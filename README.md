# Health chat

This repository contains the codebase for my final year project at [Cardiff University](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/), which is currently on-going, and to be submitted by May 5th.

# Overview

Health behaviors that negatively affect an individual, such as lack of physical activity or an unhealthy diet are responsible for the most deaths in the [United Kingdom per year](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/mortality-statistics--deaths-registered-in-england-and-wales--series-dr-/2013/index.html) when combined.

This novel application provides a chat service where users can openly discuss their diet and exercise habits. The intent of which is to make users think and reflect upon their habits and decisions that negatively affect their lifestyle.

## Main objects

My main objects of this project were to develop solutions to:

1. Construction of a domain-specific ontology from freely available data, such as [research data](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/RH-MESH/) or data scrapped from [domain-specific websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/).
2. Development and implement an ontology to facilitate appropriate response selection and context detection from user messages.
3. Development of a web-based interface to demonstrate and test the utility and usability of the conversational agent and user experience.
