# Health chat

This repository contains the codebase for my final year project at [Cardiff University](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/), which is currently ongoing, and to be submitted by May 5th.

# Background

Health behaviors that negatively affect an individual, such as lack of physical activity or an unhealthy diet are responsible for the most deaths in the [United Kingdom per year](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/mortality-statistics--deaths-registered-in-england-and-wales--series-dr-/2013/index.html) when combined.

This novel application attempts to address this issue by providing an online counseling chat service where users can openly discuss their diet and exercise habits.

# Overview

An ontological driven conversational agent that converses with users on defined subjects (i.e. from the ontology), which in this case is exercise and diet (health).

The aim of this project is to use Brief Motiviational Intervention ([BMI](http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Fulltext/2005/09001/Brief_Motivational_Interventions__An_Introduction.8.aspx)) techniques when conversering with the user in an attempt to elicit behaviour change. At the very least, the system aims to help users understand the impact of their health choices through their own personal reflection.

## Main objects

My main areas of focus when undertaking this project were to develop solutions to:

1. Population/construction of a domain-specific ontology from freely available data, such as [research data](https://www.todo.com) or data scrapped from [domain-specific websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/).
2. Development and implement an ontology to facilitate appropriate response selection and context detection from user messages.
3. Development of a web-based interface to demonstrate and test the utility and usability of the conversational agent and user experience.
