if you use whole milk, you get better consistency and richer, thicker yogurt without straining!Note that the whey is part of what protects the yogurt against other bacteria; if you do strain it, you should eat it quickly.
I just eat it plain, and made myself, the cost is about a quarter of store-bought, the waste is somewhat lower (1 plastic gallon container instead of 4 yogurt containers), and it tastes better.  The commercial yogurts mostly use additives, like pectin, to thicken it up, but a properly fermented whole-milk yogurt doesn't need that.

I use the Yogourmet maker, which isn't really worth what they're charging, but one real good feature about it is that it uses good quality plastic that can take boiling without a problem.  I've got two containers, so I boil one for thirty minutes and set it aside, and then cook the milk the way you do -- heat to 180F, cool to 115, add yogurt, stir, and incubate.

With that long boil, I end up with an amazing level of sterility; I forgot a batch in the fridge for more than a month (edit: actually, probably almost two months), and it was still perfect when I opened the container.  (long dead, I'm sure, but not spoiled.)

I didn't eat it, but I was reassured that my procedure is very, very clean.

edit: if you really want it to be sweet, instead of using jam, use a little sugar and some berries.  The flavor should be just about as good, and it will be a lot cheaper.  Jam is expensive to make, so you're paying a lot more than you would for less processed ingredients.

Costco has these fantastic frozen strawberries, monstrous things, and super tasty.  I've used those in yogurt many times.... I don't add sugar, just the berries, and it tastes great.  They also have frozen blueberries, which work super well in yogurt, but those are fairly expensive.
The word vindaloo is based on the Portuguese words for meat and vinegar.  This recipe is all about vinegar.   In Portuguese :

"carne de vinha d'alhos" - "meat with vinegar and garlic"

"vinha d'alho" = vindaloo


Thanks for the easy method, just one question, you just heat up the oven, turn it off and stick the stuff in there overnight with the oven completely off? and it stays warm enough for long enough for the fermenting action to take place? Wow, I didn't know yogurt was that expensive in the US... No wonder my dad used to make it by scratch as well back when we lived there! I get 500ml of plain yogurt for 0,49 over here. I like to mix it with a little tahini then use that as a dressing for things like tuna or chickpea salad.  Slice thinly, fry in butter.

Season with salt, pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice before serving.Sure, I usually eat chicken, salads, veggies like asparagus, broccoli. Come to think of it, I'll probably be able to just eat around anything I don't/can't eat, I'm really just looking for recipes that aren't too outside the box. Hahaha, I take them out when I eat. I know that was confusing. I mean that the attachments they put on my teeth would be scraping against other teeth if I bite down with full force. 1 cup of vinegar seems like a lot. Is this true or is this a typo? I said nearly. Maybe not PC world - try Curry's.Nearly any shop you say? Great, I'm off to PC World later, I'll buy one while I'm there.
honestly, i have no idea what you can get in AU, i'm in USA,
so link me to an online store you can buy from and I'll look.

pressure cookers pretty much boil down to (excuse the pun)
6 or 8qt size (6 if cooking for 1, 8 if cooking for 2 or more)
non stick coated interior versus stainless steel &amp; aluminum,
(this depends on how much you care about internet FUD)
other:  long cooking duration timer, delay cooking timer,
(depends on your lifestyle; i use long, i avoid using delay)
the deep cooking pot always comes out for easy cleaning.
only use nylon or silicon utensils inside a pressure cooker.
/r/pressurecooking
what's nice is you can slow cook, steam, rice, sear and
11psi pressure cook, all in the same rugged appliance.
for rice I use 2:1 water:rice, 5min on high, 5min let rest
and the rice comes out perfectly every time.  for starches
a pressure cooker does dry beans faster and better than
any other type of softening and cooking method.Cosmo sex tips?
Any recommendations? Willing to invest more money if it'll last and do a lot more.If stored in the refrigerator for a few days the meat should be safe.  This is full strength acidic vinegar that is used to give the pork authentic flavor.  It should be safe if used within the use by date.
Marinating tough pork butt in vinegar tenderizes the meat.  You could make the jam cost even lower if you made your own jam, it's super easy and cheap :) get an electric pressure cooker - they are far more rugged and versatile and do  rice perfectly too.I make smoothies regularly for my 3 little boys and me. I use banana, yoghurt, kale or spinach, frozen berries or locally sourced ripe stone fruit, ground linseed, flax seed oil, raw egg, oats, milk and a spoon of local honey.

If there are any tummy bugs going around each kid gets a spoonful of probiotics in their smoothie too but I stir that in after it's poured.

My 16mo is getting the hang of using a regular cup now so I'll probably start adding in chia seeds again. I stopped when he started drinking smoothies as they'd get stuck in the sippy cup lid! (I also left out the honey and egg till he turned 1).Avocado is great for making smoothies thick and silky, and adds healthy fats!

How do you feel about yogurt? I always throw some in for an extra protein (and calcium) boost.&gt;We-e-ell you are a brave redditor.

Brave?
Thank you very much!We-e-ell you are a brave redditor.  Hey and good luck with your studies.  In bocca al lupo!&gt;Any Italian relative you have would have cried.

HAHA! Thanks, I'll save that recipe. I'll probably do that because I have a lot of rice stock here.I bought one if these last year and it's amazing, comes with a wee instruction manual for the correct measurements and I've never had a bad batch of rice. It's easy to clean, small, doesn't take up counter space or sockets, and can have rice for 2-3 people in 12 minutes.

Hmmm.

If you had some stock or stock powder, tomato sauce, bread, and oil I would have suggested skinning then chopping the meat finely and attempting some perverted kind of[ arancini.](http://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipes/arancini-0)

You could have cooked the rice by the absorption method with the stock, and stirred the tomato sauce through the chopped and skinned meat.  Then grated the bread into crumbs.  After that you could have tried scooping spoonfuls of the rice around small amounts of the meat, rolling into balls.  Then you could have rolled these in beaten raw egg, then breadcrumbs, and fried them.

Any Italian relative you have would have cried.

Easy and cheap but not healthy, and who knows how it tastes?  May well be a good thing that you have eaten the meat and rice without attempting this shemozzle.The toaster oven will allow you to roast vegetables. Sweet potatoes, Brussells sprouts, leeks, green beans, cauliflower, and broccoli are great roasted. It involves lightly coating them with oil and then putting them in at about 350 to 400 degrees (which you may find means turning your toaster oven dial higher than that, because those are the temperatures I use for my oven). Roast til there's a nice brown on the veggies, remove them and salt them. The browning is what makes them delicious.

If you end up in a larger city at any point, you should try to find an Indian market or another little place. They can have amazing prices on spices. I just got all the ingredients for garam masala at an Indian market for a really low price. Getting a few spices will for cheap will really help you make your healthy foods delicious.Damn! Rice and hotdog omelette?

Yeah haha! I'd like to know what you have in mind with those though :)Honestly I have never tried to freeze yogurt- as I understand, it does change the consistency and also affect the live cultures, but someone else may have better information.Well you didn't tell us you had eggs.  That would've been a game changer.Open the can, watch it fall out.  Slice it, pan fry it and put it over rice.  You got rice, right?  Mix in whatever you want with your rice.....throw a slab of spam on top for your bf.  It's really not that bad if you pan fry it.

Alternatively, give it to a food shelter.I use coffee filters! I put a random amount of yoghurt in one, and after half an hour or so it was about greek yoghurt consistency. Overnight left me with something like ricotta cheese!
I've been adding agar to my recent batches though, so no need to strain really.Ah great question. The cheesecloth/strainer/fridge method someone else mentioned works fine, but want to do it a little more old fashioned? This is how my dad always did it when I was a child, and I buy a bunch of these bags and give them out to people that like my lubne (strained yogurt).

Cotton Cheese Bag https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001D1SD3G/

Dump the yogurt in the bag, pull the string closed, and hang it from a hook over the sink. Let it drip overnight up to 24 hours (to whatever consistency you prefer), then move to a container and refrigerate!Already boiled them hehe. I was really hungry. I'm eating them with boiled eggs with white rice :) Thanks guys so much though!Cut up hot dogs, mix in with rice.  You got herbs?   Fuck it, doesn't matter.  Eat hot dogs, eat rice.

Edit: LinkedPulled from a "make your own yogurt" page: "After incubation, spoon the yogurt into a cheesecloth-lined colander set over a bowl Cover with plastic wrap and let it drain in the refrigerator for at least one hour or overnight (probably closer to overnight). If you want extra thick yogurtthink Fage- or Chobani-esqueuse a double layer of cheesecloth or a coffee filter, and allow the mixture to strain overnight."Ba, na, na

Banana

But more usefully, dried fruit and nuts are great snack foods that keep for a much longer term than bananas do, and you can usually access them without too much hassle if you keep the stowed in a resealable container.

Dates, almonds, raisins, peanuts, walnuts, all of those are good options if you are looking for snacks/treats.

I don't purchase them very often, or eat very much of them anymore, but I have been able to get them all relatively cheaply. And you can buy in such bulk! I'm still eating last years dates and peanuts.Just want to check in - you're not trying to eat while still wearing your Invisalign right? Please remove them while you eat, you can drink water with them in, but that's all.Dry beans master race reporting in:P

But seriously, when the beans are soaking in that fluid they are reaching an "equilibrium state" with the fluid, they absorb the salt and the moisture as well.

If you rinse them, you remove surface salt, but the inside of the beans will still be infused with salt.

You would have to cook or soak them in salt-less water to reduce the sodium further.i aint got a mothafuckin name for it it's just somethin sweet fo da kidsSorry for the potentially dumb question, but how do you strain it?You don't need sun all day for herbs, mine grow well on the sill like any other plantThem magical facing the sun all day windows?

Might be a too far for healthy, but yum.the only thing I left out is that I store the yogurt  plain. I mix in the jam when I have a serving (although you could just mix it in to the whole batch, I just don't bother).

I'm really surprised there isn't more talk about yogurt... I don't think people know how easy it is to make :)

And as z6 points out, if you're willing to add an extra step and strain it (or add things like  powdered milk) you can get the consistency of greek yogurt (which is even more expensive than regular yogurt in the store).

I'm too lazy to strain it to create greek yogurt :P  seems like a messy job.

I like the sweetness though. Even adding jam it still has less sugar than even the lowest sugar yogurts you can buy in the store.

Tonight I tried adding 1/2 tsp of sugar (just table sugar)... holy smokes, it made it very sweet!

I think what I'll do in the future is use 1 tsp of jam for 4 tbls of yogurt and use 1/2 tsp of sugar to get it to the sweetness I like.

You seem to know about yogurt... any chance you know whether it can be frozen or not? Like when it thaws, will it regain its consistency? Mine do fine in just sunlightThanks for the easy instructions!You don't have to sweeten yogurt! It's so good with savory stuff. Strain it to the consistency of cream cheese (overnight), then smear it on pita bread with olive oil and some veggies (mint, cucumber, tomatoes, green onion, etc). If you have a middle eastern market, find middle eastern pickles and za'atar to go on it also. Some people save the whey from straining and mix it in with other foods.

You can smash some coarse salt and garlic cloves in a mortar and pestle and add it to yogurt for a heavily rotisserie chicken dip.

I like to fry thin vermicelli and add it to white rice (parboiled is healthier), boil the rice with the fried noodles. Then add plain yogurt and some salt. Comfort food right there.

Find a good kofta recipe, it's ground beef with parsley and stuff, grill them in hotdog shapes, stuff them in pita and cover in yogurt. So good.Sometimes I slice it into thin rounds and fry them in a pan with some coconut oil. Then top with fried eggs, garlic salt, and pepper! So yummy!

Ninja edit: or zoodles! Burritos man!  Buy some beans (canned may be easier for),  cheese,  rice,  peppers,  throw em on a tortilla and cook in microwave or toaster oven!This is not cheap, and I'm really not sure how healthy it is.
Looks great but the ingredient list is longer than my grocery list.The Instant Pot is what I'd reccommend. It cooks a whole bunch of different shit. i was hanging on trying not to laugh while he was prepping the roll...  started cringing when he was rolling the roll... and shut the video off when he started cutting the roll from the side...  Best of luck when you do! I'll take three please! The Instant Pot is an electric pressure cooker, slow cooker, yogurt maker, steamer and more. Not sure if they are available in Australia or not.Is it safe to store raw pork in vinegar for longer than a day in order to preserve it?Don't you *ever* tell me how to live my life. Are they the same as pressure cookers? Good thing this was flaired "FOOD". I wouldn't have known otherwise!I got an Instant Pot a few weeks ago and it will do everything. I have made rice, yogurt, chili, chili verde, hard boiled eggs, chicken/broccoli rice, apple sauce, hawaiian chicken and probably more. Everything turns out great.rice cookers are less of a hassle. I'm pretty sure that the Boston butt, which is what is pictured in this recipe, is actually the pig shoulder. Although people do use the actual pork butt, the shoulder being called the Boston butt tends to confuse people. [Source](http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/beefporkothermeats/ss/cutsofpork_2.htm)This is old, but others may find it and wonder...

I put instant brown rice, frozen veggies (broc, cauli, w/e), butter, and spices (whole frozen garlic cloves are great) in a tupperware type bowl. At lunchtime add enough water to just cover the rice and microwave about 7 minutes (may vary, and will be about half that if using white rice).

I generally either take some precooked chicken or some pouches of tuna or salmon to add after it is cooked.

You could make sauce for pasta and freeze it in portions. Cook the noodles as you use it since they only take a few mins to boil.Yeah, this is going to change my snack game. * Almonds (my personal favorite), or some other type of nuts.

* Buy bricks of cheese and cube them

* Apple slices and peanut butter

* Random fruit

I feel so dumb for never thinking of this. THANK YOU BREAKFAST WILL BE AWESOME!So I made these tonight.
Had to mash the beans by hand (visiting my mom and she doesn't have a food processor) so I was a little tired and didn't put the patties together very well.
This could have very easily made 6 burgers had I have taken my time. They also fell apart quite a bit but this is more than likely due to my haste throwing the patties on the pan and not really forming them.
[Here's the leftover patty and the bits that fell off. Trust me it looks a lot more appetizing in person.](http://i.imgur.com/OGPNcpu.jpg)
[And here's a fully dressed burger.](http://i.imgur.com/Rpb9fB0.jpg)
They were AWESOME. Totally subsided my burger cravings. They don't taste like meat, but this is an excellent alternative. The consistency and weight were perfect, and the taste really fit well with typical burger toppings and condiments. Doesn't it affect the texture though? Vinegar and other acids essentially cook raw food if left long enough (like in ceviche), and I know that vinegar marinades can make chicken rubbery if they're left too long. Does it change the texture in your experience?Can you suggest any to me? Or brands that stick out as good to get.4 or 5 easy.All great ideas, thanks! I hadn't thought of rotisserie chicken. Could probably make that into a few days! Get a rice cooker.  It cooks [a lot more](http://www.buzzfeed.com/arielknutson/surprising-things-you-can-make-in-a-rice-cooker#.wmprLXA35N) than just rice.  Stock up on beans, good oil, dried herbs.

Skipjack tuna/mayo + bag salad, dressing

Peanut butter/jam on toast.

Frozen veg with butter (peas and broccoli both high protein)

Oatmeal with cinnamon sugar (or stevia)

Instant breakfast/ovaltine/protein powder (cheap on amazon)

Rotisserie chicken, cheese, mayo/mustard, fresh spinach, wraps.  Nuke it.

There are a lot of energy bar recipes out there you can make in a microwave.  (Or just use shelf-stable foods (peanuts, sunflower seeds, craisins, granola, coconut) and chocolate chips as a binder.)But that's part of the fun!Similar to suggestion of chives from another response, green onion. Buy a bunch or 2 at grocery store w decent roots.. Can start in water to grow more roots. Then transfer to dirt and a pot.
You can also do this with any other rooted plant from store, leeks perhaps?We've been doing half a cup of granola with a sliced up banana in almond milk! I use almond milk all the time, it's delicious. I've been considering making my own almond milk because I want to try making a slightly more dense milk, like creamer status. Not sure if I can justify the cost of the almonds though. *So* expensive, even in bulk.afternoon snack for the kids sliced banana coated in honey then rolled in coconut Understandable. :) You can use almond, soy, or lactose-free milks, just in case you were ever curious. Fruit has been expensive here, so this is just an easy option for me. [Are you suggesting....?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWuSi00CcNk)OK, so here's the thing, rice cookers are good, but electric pressure cookers are better, they'll make awesome fucking rice in addition to a whole shitload of other things.  You should be able to find one for about $100 American so maybe $125AUD.
Yes I do this for breakfast smoothies. If you do have oats in there, make sure you drink it right there or shake it up well if drinking later. The bits will sink to the bottom but aren't super noticeable when drinking.I made veggie fajitas the other day. In addition to peppers and onions, I cut zucchini and yellow squash into long, thin pieces and cooked them all together before adding fajita seasoning packet. So super good.I also recommend growing them under LED grow lights if you can afford it. Uses less electricity and less risk of fire.*yes*There are plenty of options with very low sugar, fiber, and healthy ingredients. A good breakfast combo would be the banana, (healthy) granola - not a huge amount, and probiotic/natural yogurt.grilled zucchini is delicious. This looks great.  Your previous post for south Indian food is something I'm hoping to make as I miss having dosas. Cereal and/or granola, with raisins, shredded coconut, chocolate chips, whatever, makes awesome trail mix. Saute it up with other veggies for a side. I really like olive oil/salt/pepper/garlic powder with whatever veggies I have on hand. Cover the pan with a lid of some kind and cook for a few minutes(a cookie sheet works fine if you don't have a lid) to get softer pieces. Also thicker soups keep you full longer (some study I read a long time ago).You can straight up slice and boil it to go as a side with pretty much anything. Butter, salt, and pepper. Delicious.

I made a fantastic pasta dish with it once. Sliced and then quartered a zucchini and a yellow squash, cooked them in some oil in a frying pan with spices and black olives. Prepared the pasta. Had some spicy tomato sauce in my cupboard (Goya brand I think). Mixed it all together, little bit of Parmesan cheese on top. It was one of the best things I've ever made. Have you ever eaten it?

How do you know it's nasty?

What would you do to make it healthier?

Please share your thoughts.Have you taken the trap (J shaped part) off?  It requires no tools usually and most blockages are large bits of food and/or grease that is limiting the drain.Obviously none of us know the deal they have.  That being said I am given a discount on my rent to fix any small repair under 50 bucks.  Anything over I just either fix it, have it fixed, and bill my landlord or ask my landlord to fix it at their cost.  Drains are cheap and easy to fix for the most part. Take the trap off, check for blockages and thats 90% of the problems.  Drain snakes work, chemical cleaners work too and its usually three bolts holding a disposal on.  Take it apart, learn, fix it.  Chia seeds!I have heard it is possible to add tofu to a smoothie.... just google for recipes. I have not personally tried it.

Yogurt is another good thing to add, bulks it up without adding another flavor.Basic fried rice would work.  Cook the rice and chopped onion together, make scrambled eggs, and add the rice and onion to the eggs in the pan and fry it for a couple minutes.  Add oil (sesame is typical, but any will do), soy sauce, salt and pepper.  You could use meat instead of the eggs or with it.Unfortunately, I don't like boiled eggs. Thanks though! In theory I'm open to these types of things, but I prefer to stick with the whole ingredients. :) I don't mind a little effort to put something together. I don't drink milk, either.For dinner, have deviled eggs.  Use onion and spices.  Maybe soft boil the eggs?Thanks. Not too long. A couple of days. I'm mainly losing ideas for dinner Are you opposed to things like Breakfast Essentials? It's a powder mix with vitamins you add to milk. Sometimes I have this for breakfast, but I always add a banana and peanut butter to it. :)How long do your supplies need to last? I'd say make soup from the chicken breast, that will last for a while, and add the rice and eggs to the soup.Granola isn't really healthy. I'd go for a nut butter instead.Any idea if a NutriBullet would grind up raw oats small enough to make the texture tolerable? I feel like they'd be good if you had an oat-based smoothie with spices and *maybe* banana or something as opposed to a typical berry smoothie.Try some oats... I also find pumpkin is really delicious and filling. Here's some recipes: http://www.thekitchn.com/drink-your-oats-5-nourishing-whole-grain-smoothie-recipes-176741Butter isn't an unhealthy fat, fyi.Banana, add spoonful of almond butter and a dab of honey and ohhhhhhhhhhh god yesSeveral people have mentioned herbs so far, and that's something I've been wanting to do. Any tips on the best way to do it cheap, or advice for a beginner? Thanks!I'm not a big fan of eating dick either.  That's just nasty. If you do ceviche with shrimp, especially small ones, you don't want it to sit for longer than 10-20 mins anyways. Don't keep your little one away from peanuts or other foods like they suggest.

Studies have shown that babies kept away from certain foods are more likely to develop food allergies.

I know this isn't really related, but I feel the need to tell people this as often as possible.

In Britain we don't tend to have pork in curry, mostly chicken or lamb - occasionally beef.

That said, obviously we have done this: http://www.fdin.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Chicken-Balti-Pasty-300x143.jpg

This is available in nearly any shop.Same. I almost want to buy some pork butt just so I can tell everyone I'm making pork butt for dinner

Wait you're making what?

-Pork butt

Por- pork *butt*?

-Pork butt.I would like to help you if i can. I work maintenance for an Appartment complex, and i can at least try to fix every thing and it will be free of charge...........if you live in Colorado pm me and we can work it outHave you tried overnight oatmeal? Hundred of recipes for all palates. I personally prefer peanut butter, banana and chia seed recipes. I should have been more specific.  It's really just going to pick up juice or vinegar.  You'd need to make tea with the herbs and spices to get the flavor to soak in, but they can be rubbed on or cooked into the dish.

I make a turkey kielbasa and tortellini dish with red peppers and zucchini.  I cube the zucchini and toss it in a little rice vinegar and pineapple juice (sub any vinegar and any fruit juice if you don't have those on hand).  The juice releases when cooked and creates a nice little glaze on everything.  Oh yeah! Coconut oil is great. really any kind of oil. Coconut might be one of the better ones. :) also, if you have a marinara sauce you like, it's great for dipping. :)Thank you :) I tried to let it soak up some herb flavors from a spice blend I have but I don't think it didWould that work with coconut oil instead? I am trying to stay healthy lol/u/JustBlue, your submission has been removed from /r/EatCheapAndHealthy due to following reason(s):

- Must be able to provide properly formatted recipe in the comment section



If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEatCheapAndHealthy)I use zucchini in several dishes. It is surprisingly versatile. It's actually not entirely inedible raw, but I like it pan roasted or baked.

I usually toss it with a little salt and rice vinegar or balsamic (nothing too powerful) before cooking, just to give it a little flavor.   When raw, it will soak up any sauce or marinade and release it back into the dish.

If it tastes extremely bitter, you can either peel it or soak in a salt water brine.  Simple and delicious:
slice your zucchini into about half inch slices (if it's huge you might want to cut the slices in half or quarters)

dredge each piece in egg, then Italian bread crumbs (you can buy them pre-seasoned at the grocery store)

add a little oil to the pan and also a litte butter (the oil raises the burning point so the butter won't burn, but the butter adds a lot of flavor)

saut the pieces until they are golden brown. Drain on a paper towel and enjoy!

Edit: dredge in egg white. Not whole egg. :)Definitely should have used a [Serious] tag here.Vindaloo is a traditional indian curry that can be found in many many states. It's one of the most common curries, but restaurants rarely do it justice from my experience.Do you have anything constructive to add to this sub? If not, you can leave.Ghee is plenty healthy, the relation between saturated fat and heart disease is unproven, and saturated fats are more stable when heated. We really shouldn't be heating unsaturated fats for cooking use, even olive oil breaks down quickly.That Vindaloo looks pretty accurate. Nice jobdat paratha doughLooks pretty Lister worthy. Does it go down well with yesterday's warm lager? Thank you :)Thank you :) I really like it actually but I've never cooked with it beforeYou can cut it into spears and cook it either in the oven or on the grill.
Nothing to fancy spice wise, spray them with PAM.. a little salt.. a little pepper.. and I personally prefer some parm but that's up to you. You can cut it up and roast it in the oven with a few seasonings [like this](http://www.food.com/recipe/roasted-zucchini-364844)... although quite honestly, I've never been very fond of zucchini by itself. Maybe you could try something like these [zucchini parmesan chips](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ellie-krieger/zucchini-parmesan-crisps-recipe.html) instead?Sorry for pointing out the obvious.You calling the food gross, that's what.What?Here I was thinking I was breaking ground when I tried this yesterday. Sounds fantastic. You have sold it very well.The dish is of Portuguese influence.   Portuguese sailors provisioned their ships with pork in barrels of vinegar to preserve the meat on long voyages.   Western India was colonized by the Portuguese around the city of Goa.  Here the combination of pork in vinegar and Indian spices gave rise to pork vindaloo. If the disposal doesn't turn, there should be a screw or a reset button somewhere either on the bottom, or the side.  If you can get a model number i can look it upEating bananas with almonds is also a great mix.More than likely it isn't an issue. But I still like to control what I eat. http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/dried-beans-vs-canned-beans-nutritional-values-3026.htmlCool. Must but a British "Indian" food thing then. I don't think I've ever seen it in one of our restaurants.Pork Vindaloo is traditional Indian dish from Western Indian city of Goa.  Pork butt is perfect meat for this recipe.   It is a tough but flavorful cut of meat that works well with complex Indian spices.  The meat should be simmered for 45 minutes to an hour and becomes tender and delicious. Just take what you need.  12 to 15 pieces of pork for a two person meal.  Vinegar is a big part of traditional pork vindaloo and adds to authentic flavor profile. Never seen pig in Indian food. How does it work with vindaloo? Good? Or just cheaper?How do you use the meat after it's been stored? Can I just grab some out of the vinegar and cook it?Thank you! Looks so good!I think I just had a food coma and all I did was look at some pictures.  Good god yes.I thought the same thing!!Peppers are extremely expensive in winter. The get cheaper in summer though. This is more of a summer recipe anyway, so it fits.Yes.   A tablespoon of olive oil will work well.   Also coconut oil is an excellent substitute for ghee. Oh I absolutely agree. This is a great dish! And Avocados are awesome.Do you have a substitute for ghee?Chappati flour is finely ground whole wheat flour.   Half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour would work well. 3/4 cup oatmeal
3/4 cup water or almond milk
1 tbsp PB2 or regular peanut butter
1 or 2 tbsp pecans or walnuts
Generous amount of cinnamon and honey
Chopped banana, strawberries and blueberries

Cook oats with the liquid, I use microwave for like 1.5 mins. Then add the pb, cinnamon, honey and mix. Add fruit and top with the nuts. Sprinkle more honey or cinnamon if you want, and use whatever fruit combo you like. Yuummm How does using dried beans produce a nutritionally superior meal?Looks awesome! How key is the chappati flour? is there a good substitute? Very cool, and thanks for the rec. There are definitely days when I just wanna nuke something and crash. . . Now this is an excellent idea! I'll keep that one in my back pocket for about three months from now. Thanks!I had Indian food for lunch delish!

[Don't forget the Naan!](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/aarti-sequeira/naan-indian-oven-baked-flat-bread-recipe.html)

And because Indian cuisine can take so long to cook my husband and I buy this brand a lot:
["Kohinoor India on Platter"]
(https://foodiegang.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/indiaonplatter1.jpg)

They are SO good, no preservatives or fake stuff in them, authentically made in India and packaged in USA, they are in an MRE style pouch that like never expires and they are $1.99 each by me and I get 2 meals out of them and I serve it over Basmati Rice (though the box says 4 servings). I usually add grilled onions, fresh tomatoes, carrot slices and spicy peppers to taste.

Its a cheap, healthy alternative if someone does not have the time or ingredients to make an authentic home cooked Indian meal.No problem, and glad to provide something I hope you'll find useful :)

Got more coming down the pipeline (hopefully Butter Chicken, Palak Paneer, Tarka Dal, Dal Makhani, Chana Masala, plus some classic Indian breads) in the nearish future. . . but, well, like you said, sometimes it takes a bit to cook. Also the fact that I've got more than a week's worth of food to eat &gt;.&gt;[Chives!](http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/herbs/chives/growing-chives-indoors.htm)
They are hardly as heck! I LITERALLY don't do anything to mine out in the garden and they grow and spread like crazy. They fair quite well indoors as well. Love me some chives! :)Wow thank you SO much for posting this! What an incredible amount of information. Indian food is by far my favorite type of cuisine. sometimes it takes 16hours to fully cook but damn, its so worth it!I live inland but I shop sales. Shrimp regularly goes on sale for around $8.00 a lb and when it does I stock up. For me it's worth $2 per four oz serving to have the variety of seafood in my diet. Overall the meal cost me less than $4 and to me that beats a nasty frozen entree or grabbing lunch out for $10 .

For me to stick to a healthy diet it has to be food I'm excited about eating. In the grand scheme of things I think $4 for a healthy fresh home made shrimp lunch is a deal. Don't tell me where to stick my banana, only my girlfriend has that priveledgeNo I didn't. They seem to do fine on their own.Thank you. I agree shrimp and avocado is a magical combo! I fell in love with cerviche and fresh avocados in Mexico , this is my American bastardized version After having a Red Dwarf marathon, this is definitely on my list of things to make.You could even do trailmix.  Yeah it's high in fat but my own research mirrors yours, the fat is overall not the worst kind. Also fat helps you stay full and satisfied feeling. I usually eat this dish for lunch 2 times a week at least and it makes me feel great. Light and satisfying. Yeah this is inspired by cerviche. but being inland and buying cheap shrimp I prefer them thoroughly cooked the old fashioned way Do you have to hand pollinate?You'd have to setup full-spectrum lights and put them on a timer. You have to trick the plant with light cycles to make it flower and fruit.

I picked up a couple of [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016NUZP0) and grow cherry tomatoes and herbs in them. Edit: also have grown romaine lettuce and peppers in these.The vinegar is made from live culture valvin muscot white grape wine vinegar added to 50% mead and aged. This combination creates a strong vinegar with outstanding flavor.  It adds wonderful flavor to pork.

Any good vinegar will work just fine.

Looks delicious and I love pork butt! Question, how does the vinegar affect the taste of the meat?AWESOME!! I like where your head is at. If you're into melty cheese sandwiches you'll want to put a little butter in a pan and grill your sandwich, it'll melt the cheese.I was sure it *was* LPT at firstWhat about tomatos?  How well do they grow inside?I am not mature enough for this recipe... I was at a family dinner party and there was tacos, guac, and shrimp. I dipped my shrimp in guac and everyone looked at my like I was a freak. Glad to know this is normal lol. When my son was just learning to eat finger foods I coated his banana pieces in baby cereal. Now I coat them in Cheerio dust. Makes it easier to pick up, but also tastes good! Look up ceviches I posted this elsewhere but though people should see it.

Avocados contain an amazing array of phytonutrients. Included are phytosterols (especially beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol); carotenoids (beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, neochrome, neoxanthin, chrysanthemaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and violaxanthin); flavonoids (epicatechin and epigallocatechin 3-0-gallate); and polyhydroxylated fatty alcohols. Alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and oleic acid are key fats provided by avocado. Avocados are a good source of pantothenic acid, dietary fiber, vitamin K, copper, folate, vitamin B6, potassium, vitamin E, and vitamin C.

Although they are fruits, avocados have a high fat content of between 71 to 88% of their total caloriesabout 20 times the average for other fruits. A typical avocado contains 30 grams of fat, but 20 of these fat grams are health-promoting monounsaturated fats, especially oleic acid.

Crockpot beans simmered all day in a bit of vegetable broth with onions, garlic, herbs, and spices are a wonderful thing. I'm talking about starting from scratch with dried beans and soaking them overnight before putting them in the crockpot.

If you like Mexican food, this is worth learning to do. There's nothing like homemade beans for burritos, side dishes, etc.we're a huge fan of bahn mi dogs - cukes, carrots, daikon, add some sriracha mayo and you're good!That sounds really good.  That would make good paratha stuffing. This is like front page /r/LifeProTips level shitposting.Should I melt the cheddar or not?Nah.  It's a cinch once you get the hang of it. That is not helping the discussion. Why do you feel the need to add this?That is not helping the discussion. Why do you feel the need to add this?I thought the same thing. Kale chips!!If you are not sure about  ghee you can substitute it with a couple tablespoonfuls of olive oil.   Works great with same golden brown color and sweet flavor. I would check with the wildlife agencies about levels of methyl mercury in local waterways first. In some areas, probably fine, but pollution can be an issue.I like my sandwiches on rye bread or an onion roll from the bakery section. If you want a healthier sandwich, tortilla wraps are the way to go. You can't go wrong with cheddar. Feel free to throw some tomato, onion and lettuce on there too. Yes, herbs! You might also look into [microgreens](http://www.organicgardening.com/learn-and-grow/growing-microgreens-indoors), mesclun lettuces, and arugula. My favorites are radish sprouts and [mesclun mixes with spicy mustard greens](https://www.botanicalinterests.com/products/view/0127/Lettuce-Mesclun-Chef-s-Gourmet-Spicy-Mix-Seeds).

If it's winter where you are, you may need to invest in a grow light, as the light from even a southern window might not be adequate. I just use a grow light bulb in a regular lamp and keep it very close to the plants.Way too much work.for sure! its a really adaptable recipe!yeah, i have done cerviche like that, this is more like a quick "i need something to eat for lunch right" now kind of recipe*foie grasDon't worry, [Portlandia's on it](http://www.ifc.com/portlandia/videos/crunch-greatness-celery-psa).You could just let the lime juice "cook" the shrimp too.No It's refreshing to look at something designed to be lingered over instead of rushed through. At 6'1 and 165 you shouldn't be losing weight.While there is prepackaged frozen fish in every market, you don't really get any guarantee it was handled properly to be used for sushi.This recipe is delicious looking. With Ghee, I suppose it's not so healthy but it looks amazing!!Oh, ya. I didn't think about the landlord being his dad. I'd probably get the sink fixed myself too if that were the case. I was thinking landlord/tenant. Don't ever tell me what to do again. But thanks I'll try this.Some people live near oceans and it's from ocean to table. Just like meat might be more expensive for these kind of people if there's no land for livestock.

Not everyone has the same living conditions. GeographyAlso, zesting the lime into the water will release the lime oil without adding the bitterness, which is from the white part (pith). Bonus is that it's perfectly edible, so you can leave it on the shrimp. Or, do as I do and just zest the lime over the final dish instead of as an aromaticThe environmental aspect is important for a lot of people, too. Basically, aquaculture is almost invariably awful for the environment. Yes, some people have figured out impressive setups, but for the most part we're talking large-scale monoculture where the waste is dumped back into the natural system to muck everything up.Worth noting that servings are partially based on the idea that sometimes you'll serve yourself two curries for a little variation. In any case, you should easily be able to get lunch and dinner for a week straight out of this.

If you have any questions, I'm always happy to answer, so fire away :-D

Want some good breakfasts? Maybe you can look at some of my [previous work. . . ](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2kq2wp/eat_like_a_south_indian_3_meals_a_day_for_a_week/)

P.S. - [It heats up pretty good](http://i.imgur.com/Rv9QK0wl.jpg) (mad office job steez).this sounds amazing, it looks really similar to sorpotel recipe we love but dry making it perfect for paratha preparation. we have never made meat ones i am going to have to bookmark this. I love pork butt so much. I make Puerco Pibil with it for special occasions. It's crazy easy to make and has a very unique flavor. Looks fantastic! Definitely gonna make this sometime.Had a similar problem with a garbage disposal before, check to see (even google the model number if you have to) if it has a reset switch. I jammed ours up at an old apartment, and my wife discovered the reset the day we moved out.

You can also sometimes use a toilet plunger to force water through. And if there's blockage past the disposal, you may be able to get access for the snake to the pipe via pipe wrench.

Hope that helps, best of luck!I think /r/yoga might like this.No I live in the states.Gorgeous, as always! I love the meat-stuffed parathas; it kind of reminds me of Cornish pasties. And given the British love for curry, I bet someone has put some good pork vindaloo in one before, hah. I've been told drain snakes don't work so well on garbage disposals so I hadn't tried that yet because it seems like that's where the problem is. Would you recommend someone with no experience to give it a shot? Because I would totally give it a shot. We can't even wash dishes right now, it's awful.

Recipe:

Total Time: 45 mins
Serves: 1-2 People

Ingredients:

-1 Cup of brown rice

-1 1/2 Cups of water

-1 Cucumber

-1-2 Carrots

-1 Avocado

-1 Small bowl of warm water

-2 Tablespoons of seasoned rice vinegar (Didn't have on hand)

- 2-3 Sheets of Nori (dried seaweed)

-2 Teaspoons of soy sauce (Didn't have on hand)

Utensils:

-SHARP knife

-Kitchen towel

-Bamboo sushi rolling mat (optional)

Preparation:

1. Add the brown rice, soy sauce(optional), and water into a pan and bring to a boil. Then cover the pan with a lid and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook rice for 30-35 minutes. Overcook slightly to get stickier rice, which will make for a tighter roll. Once cooked, let stand for ten minutes and mix in rice vinegar.

2. As rice is cooking, either cut or peel carrots and cucumber into thin strands. Cut avocado in a similar fashion.

3. Lay down towel or bamboo mat and place nori(shiny side down). Apply a thin layer of rice over sheet. Use small bowl of water to moisten rice or clean hands. Then lay a small amount of preferred veggies and/or sushi on top of rice. Begin rolling away from you, compacting roll with each quarter turn.

4. Get your sushi on!Do you live in Alaska or Norway?Ones who don't have much money? I don't know, obviously there are a lot of details we don't know but I do know it's not a landlord/tenant situation, it's a family thing. Tenants rights don't apply.You have to put them in south-facing light - even in a very sunny north-facing place they won't grow.
I've tried many times :(Drain cleaners are a waste of money, a [drain snake](http://www.amazon.com/General-Cleaners-R-25SM-4-Inch-25-Feet/dp/B003NFO528/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424448069&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=drain+snake) like that will work nearly every time. 25' might be a little short for some clogs but will get most kitchen stops.

Maybe it's because I grew up as a plumbers son, but it's really easy to do. Just pull off one of the drain pieces so you have a straight shot at the drain, you may need to angle it a little weird so it follows the drain down instead of going up the vent pipe. Fairly easy to spot as you will likely hear it as the vent pipe will be dry, the correct pipe will feel slushy and will be much quieter. Then just run to it's length a few times to make sure it's all clear. I'm sure you can find a few videos on youtube as well.

Edit; you can probably get one for about $15 at your local hardware store if you want to save some money.Here it is $3.75 per, no less.Yes, I'll do that for sure. It will take me a couple minutes....Whose parents would let their child live that way... Good to know. No worries. As a submission rule, we ask that all images have a recipe or summary of the images. This is a weird post in that it is not a recipe but I do not want someone else to feel they are being held to a standard that you are not. So, could you format this into a basic summary of the activities or directions? You do not need to be incredibly detailed. Thanks!No it usually tastes like cat food and is pale. Hi! I'm not quite sure what you mean, sorry...
grossHerbs are pretty easy! I'd suggest starting with mint, basil, or oreganoHerbs are usually a good bet!You can make breakfast casserole with sausage, eggs, cheese, and whatever veggies you like best. Examples: parmesan, onion, mushroom, red pepper, and kale OR ham, green pepper, onion, mushroom, and cheddar. I usually cook a dozen egg casserole for about 30-45 mins on 400F.

Poppyseed chicken casserole: 2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken boiled and shredded or cut into bitesized pieces. 8 oz sour cream and a can of cream of chicken (mixed), combine these and spread into casserole dish. Top with 1 and a half to 2 sleeves of Ritz crackers that are crushed and topped with a stick to a stick and a half of melted butter and a tablespoon of poppyseeds. Bake covered for 30 mins and uncovered for 15 mins at 350F. You might need to bake it longer if you make the chicken ahead and it is cold when you start out.

Cubed potatoes: chop and mix with seasonings and oil and butter in pan, bake until tender. Usually you need about 45 mins on 350 F. I have done them with thyme, oregano, garlic, onions added, red pepper, and infinite combinations.

Mama's Soup: 1 medium onion, chopped and sauted, add one pound hamburger, salt &amp; pepper and brown. Add one can beef broth, one can chicken broth, 2 cans of vegall  (I prefer to do carrots, potatoes, greenbeans, corn, and whatever else strikes my fancy), 2 cans of stewed tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano seasoning. Bring to a boil for 10 mins, reduce to a simmer for 30 mins.  I like to add basil, bay leaf, oregano, and parsley.

Curried chicken: parboil rice and spread in greased dish. Mix in 1 can of garbanzo beans, and one medium onion sliced onion, liberally cover in curry powder and garam masala (salt and pepper of course). Lay chicken on top (I use boneless skinless thighs) and season the same. I bake this about 30 mins on 350F. That is why I like splayed thighs, they cook fast.

Ratatouille: (Melissa D'arabian 's recipe) EZPOT chop **eggplant** into chunks and cook until tender in olive oil and salt, remove to bowl. Sliced half moons of **zucchini** get the same treatment. Then proceed to do one inch squares of **pepper** (red and green 1 of each is better flavor in my opinion), and chopped **onion**. Lastly, no oil - add 2-3 large chopped **tomatoes** with salt to deglaze for a min or 2, add 3-4 cloves of garlic minced, and then return all veggies to the pot for 5-15 mins. (It depends on how well you cooked everything before and how long until whatever else is done cooking.)

You can always bake a few pounds of bbq pork chops or chicken breasts.I LOVE chili over pasta. Yeah, it stays good all week easily. You should try it. It's one of my favorite and easiest dishes and very hearty! This is true.   Often you need to simply tackle the problem.   I just fixed my drain in 20 minutes.   Remove the pea trap with small pipe wrench.   In my drain there were two chop sticks.  Don't be intimidated by do it yourself fixes.  Just begin to fix the problem and you will be surprised how easy it goes.   Some of the best do it yourselfers are women.
Off topic from eating cheap and healthy but... it's not his landlord, it's his dad who is letting them stay there for "next to nothing". If it were me, and my parents were kind enough to let me stay on their property at a significant discount, I'd fix the sink myself (or pay to have the sink fixed) and get a cheap replacement fridge from Craigslist. That's my girl scout values though, always leave a place better than when you found it. Bananas and apples. They are cheap most places in the US, they don't need to be refrigerated and they are full of nutrients that you're not getting from ramen and pizza. Well that sucks. I understand if money is really tight not being able to do anything. One thing that might be worth keeping in mind is that plumbing tools can be had very inexpensively at second hand stores and save time and money in the long run. A basic snake can really save the day and even if they are a little rusty plumbing tools typically last a long time.Lol! No wonder I feel so decrepit this morning....I do like some salty vegetable oxo cube once in a while! Or miso broth. Not sure how I would feel about beef bouillon, though.I moved to TX a year ago and there was a Sprouts a few blocks away from me which I never went to because it looked expensive. Started going around a month ago and that place is awesome.Well....what's the worst you could do? I don't care how cheap the rent is- those things need to be fixed. One can find a used fridge fairly cheap on cl or in a used appliance store...and he needs to fix the damn sink. He's a slum lord and that is NOT ok. I'm a landlord and I would never let my tenants live with broken shit. Thank you so much!! We've both tried multiple bouts of different brands of drain cleaner but we think the previous tenant threw some crazy stuff down the garbage disposal. It doesn't even run anymore or hum or anything when you flip the switch. I haven't actually had a chance to look at it, but my SO says we don't have the necessary tools and I've been instructed not to mess with it because I would hop down there in an instant if I thought I could fix it. Consider different dressings. Make your own ranch (homemade mayo is easy and delish if you want to try that to), use balsamic vinegar or make your own vineagrette (spelling) - then you know what's in it, it's exponentially cheaper, and you can be sure of what you're getting in flavor.&gt; All I did was copy pasta OP comment

I would have put that bolder and towards the top though. I almost commented asking about it. Otherwise, nice formatting! I'm 25 and I drink milk and buttermilk. I don't think drinking milk is considered weird, but most people think I'm weird for liking buttermilk.I'm aiming for dressing them up like a hamburger in hopes I can trick myself a little bit. And my mom makes chickpea burgers that are awful so we're excited to try another alternative regardlesa.Any idea what is wrong with the drain? That is often an easy fix with minimal/cheap tools.I imagine that if I grilled this, it would be delicious.I would probably throw up if I ate this.If you are worried about stuff getting lost in the shuffle, make an inventory sheet. It seems so common sense but I had to be told so I feel like maybe some other people are as in need of a dose of common sense as me. www.organizedhome.com is where I went for a template but you could just write it down on any paper you can keep up with. Use a magnet to keep it on the freezer for easy updating when you remove an item.

I keep meat in my small chest deep freeze. I file the meat packages sitting vertically (like a book) on the shelf side and larger items (like turkey, chickens, large cuts of cow, big bags of fish) in the deeper side. When I buy economy packs and break it down, I use freezer bags and freeze flat, then file.

I have a vertical freezer where I keep fruits and veggies. I have a shelf of strawberries and a shelf that was full of blackberries  (now juiced and jarred), and greens that have been blanched and stuffed into quart bags have a shelf. I pre-grated and drained zucchini (16 &amp; 1/2 cups) for zucchini bread and zucchini cornbread and froze it flat in bags. I'm living with my SO and he rents from his dad. But he pays next to nothing for rent so his dad has (from what I understand) refused to fix it. And since we're moving in six months, we'd rather put our money towards "new" appliances for our new place. And use fresh, homemade (or store made) tortillas.I try to avoid avocado because it's high in fat and carbs for what is considered one serving (1 cup). If you would decide to make an extra meal and freeze it, like making 2 casseroles and eating one now while freezing the other for later, I recommend that foil trays/disposable bakeware that are available at the Dollar Tree here. When you freeze them, sit them on a baking sheet to keep them flat until they're solid.

www.moneysavingmom.com has a lot of information and some recipes for freezer meals. (Just search her site for freezer meals.)How are shrimp considered cheap? Pork butt is one of the cheapest cuts of meat in the store.  At under $1.50 per pound pork butt is a true bargain.  Pork butts are large and flavorful but preserving so much meat can be a challenge. Here a pork butt is marinated in home made vinegar and used to make pork vindaloo, a Portuguese/Indian classic dish.  Portuguese sailors carried, as part of their supplies, barrels of pork preserved in vinegar.  When the Portuguese colonized western India, around the city of Goa, they introduced pork in vinegar to the local Indian population. Pork vindaloo was born when Indian cooking and spices combined with colonists pork provisions came together.  Here that recipe is recreated and used to make a delicious Indian stuffed paratha.

I thought it looked like someone scrunched up in a car accident?My mom is really troubled that my sister and I don't drink milk, ever. I buy it for my coffee and cooking. Or product placement/advertising thinly veiled as content. I guess it's kind of like having miso or those cup o' noodles packets. This has some good advice.  Weighing food.  Keeping a calorie journal.  Keeping your hands busy with a hobby to prevent mindless snacking.  Kinda off topic.. Do you rent? Why not get this stuff fixed?I'm sorry for your current situation. If you haven't already, you should seek out a food bank.

Keep a bin in your sink to collect gray water and flush it down the toilet until you get that fixed.

Rice and bean recipes are very cheap. Get some shelf stable vegetables, such as onions or potatoes. Firmer vegetables can be prechopped and frozen, such as carrots, celery, and peppers. Saute vegetables until soft, add some 2 cups of rice, toast for a few minutes, then cover with 3 cups water or stock if you can get/make some, bring to a boil, cover, and then kill the heat and let it sit for 20 minutes. Have some cooked beans ready to mix in at the end. Either warm up canned beans, or simmer beans in water until tender. Mix it all together and enjoy. Freeze leftovers, and reheat for later. Farmed fish are raised in filthy conditions.  So it depends on the type of fish and how their farmed conditions compare to natural conditions.

Farm raised catfish and tilapia are great since they are already detritus eaters.  So even if the pond is gross, it's not much different than the muck you would pull them from when fishing.

Farm raised salmon sucks. They're forced to cannibalize much more than typically seen in nature.  Plus they are fed so much that they grow fast and are sold young and super fatty. That is why their meat is so orange compared to the deep red of older, wild fish. It's like the fish equivalent of froixgrax.

Shrimp are also detritus eaters so I imagine farmed shrimp aren't much worse. I've had both fresh wild caught and frozen farmed in the same meal and you _can_ tell a difference. But the farmed was certainly not bad. Really? They don't turn to a watery mush?Oh man, you ARE old!!!! I was born in 1975, grandpa/ma!Keep in mind that shrimp come in many sizes and they are priced accordingly. They're binned by # of shrimp/pound.
The following is sorted by ascending price/pound
60-80 - popcorn shrimp
40-60 - salad shrimp
20-30 - good for entrees
15-20 - shrimp cocktail

I would record 40-60 shrimp for this dish. I am a bit ignorant when it comes to different types of growing food.  Is farm raised bigger and/or better?Pretty similar to a [ceviche!](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/shrimp_ceviche.html) I need this in my lifeThere are tons of pre-made sauces you can buy, or if you so inclined you can make them yourself! You can stir fry your chicken with some veggies (broccoli, snap peas/beans, carrots, onion) and add teriyaki sauce, serve over rice. You can also get tons of ready made curries (or get a jar of curry paste, mix with peanut butter and coconut milk) and serve with chicken, cauliflower and peas. The website Budget Bytes has a chicken taco bowls that are amazing, my sister makes them often. She doesn't even use a slow cooker, she just throws everything into a pot together. There's a southwest chicken skillet on that same site as well. That gives you a couple different flavour options!

You can open up even more options if you grab some ground turkey/beef. Make meat sauce and serve over pasta. Make tacos or burritos (they have packaged seasoning that's good). Hope that helps :)If all the recipes you have require weird ingredients, ditch that cook book and find another source. You have to find recipes that use ingredients commonly available to you.

Moreover, "vegetarian" doesn't mean "moon food". Unless meat is a central part of the dish, likely you can remove the meat part and prepare the dish as-is with a bit of additional seasoning.

You aren't going to enjoy cooking unless you're making food you want to eat. Find something you'd like to eat and cook that. Not weird, esoteric stuff. If you like pizza, learn to make it. Remember, pizza can be vegetarian.I've just had lunch, and after that album I'm hungry again.Atlantic mackerel (not king mackerel) is also very good in terms of mercury levels. The fats are the healthy kind too! One of the healthiest fishes in the sea.With a little tweaking, I think the aromatics could be used for a nice marinade and used with pork instead of shrimp in this recipe.  Might have to try it out sometimeI'm dumbGreat looking summer recipe.

I would dice the bell peppers and throw them in for extra crunch/flavour/sweetness. Having them on the side like that is not maximising their utility. Roasting them or grilling them before hand could add an extra depth of flavour too. Simple and tasty! :D

Will probably try it out next week or so, since it looks pretty filling. Yeah, not my favorite, either. But plenty healthy!*old fashioned*....*modern times*.....

I'll have you know I was born in 1974, you whippersnapper!I'm 30 and that was totally a thing when I was a kid.  Also starting to see why my mum drinks so much milk all the time, it was pretty much recommended for every meal.  So nasty.  I don't know anyone my age that drinks milk as a beverage.Yes very true, good tip! For this recipe you take it off the heat just as it hits boil so is not a problem. The residual heat is enough to cook the shrimp. I'm glad you've found so much creativity in cooking :) Sadly, I'm just an engineer in the making, and calling cooking as a personal art and creativity is very far fetched for me personally. Although, I can really appreciate a good cook and a great meal, so kudos to everyone who enjoy it!I was going to reply the same thing. I'm in Quebec city and the whole recipe would've cost at least 4-5$ more.I just realized a 3 pack of peppers at my local supermarket was $10! WtfWestern Canada here, I bought a red pepper for $2.50 yesterday :(thank you for sharing, i love this simple dish! when i make my version, i just use cooked shrimp, avocadoes, himalayan salt and finely ground pepper to taste, and diced tomatoes. i will have to try it with the red (or yellow) bell pepper and lime juice--that sounds fantastic!Have a wrap party? Provide a variety of fillings and let the guests diy their own wrspsI often replace spaghetti with spaghetti squash. I make chicken parm or even a turkey meat sauce, and they're both great served over the squash. And really filling still. Not sure if that's what you were looking for, but it's delicious! this is for frozen farm raised.Can you add a recipe to the comments here? Your kitchen sounds small, so I wouldn't go for a rice cooker. I eat it twice daily and get by just fine with the stovetop method :)I will also be skipping the liver and onions, kthx. But pears are awesome.I can't tackle my day without my bodysuit.Oh my goodness!  I live near the beach and during shrimp season, a pound of shrimp is $3-$5.  I get pissed when it gets up to $8 a pound.  I would have a heart attack at $12-$14!

...and the shrimp is fresh off the boat.  Like the boat literally pulls up to the place that I buy the shrimp from since it is located on the waterway. Man this is perfect for some serious gainsI see cooking as an art. I'm a pretty creative person, so I don't follow recipes to the letter. I use my own secret blends of spices, and I experiment a lot.

I see every dish that I create as edible art. I enjoy creating, so it's natural for me. Do you like art? If so, look at it like that. From experience, unpeeled limes can make the water very bitter if you boil them for too long. I'm not sure what the threshhold is, though. In my experience, the best way to add lime flavour is simply to add lime juice late in the cooking process. I loved the little section on contouring. I always thought contouring was a somewhat recent trend! thats cool. i live in TN and shrimp is like 12-14 a pound at kroger D;[r/xxfitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/) would like this!Probably the same people who would put [celery in jello] (https://www.google.com/search?q=celery+jello)Ah there is a Sprouts here, I totally forgot about it, I'd been meaning to check it out but I live two blocks from a Homeland which usually has decent prices.Yeah the price can vary, I stocked up last week they had them 2 for $1 (so $.25 for 1/2 a pepper for this recipe) - they aren't always that cheap. It's all about looking for sales. Check to see if you have a sprouts market nearby tho, they are in about a dozen states. Best prices on produce and meat and stuff. Before they came to town I was also paying around $1-1.50 per bell pepper.  I do! Its niceYeah it's a versatile recipe, you can really adjust however you like. For my fitness goals I like to keep it light on grains.

I am in Colorado. I usually buy a few pounds when the price is decent ($8 a lb or less, $2 was for 4 oz). I buy most of my food at a store called sprouts market that has pretty good deals on produce, meat, dairy, eggs etc but not a lot of normal grocery stuff. So, despite just having finished supper. . . I kind of want this, now. Why would you make me feel this way? Eating two suppers definitely can't be cheap *or* healthy :(I'm removing your post because it links directly to a recipe website.  You can make a text post containing the entire formatted recipe and a link to the source but you cannot link directly to the website.  There are tips on formatting your recipe in the sidebar. this would feed 2-3 if you added rice and maybe some tomato or something

also where do you live that shrimp is cheap??Look at how beautiful it is! It looks like people actually put some work into producing the article. Cartoonists etc...Self burnThey came to my house once. When I moved in. They bought me a toaster which I returned. And my axe!ever had celery or bok choy in an eggy asian dish? same idea.Or skillet cucumbers? ZomgOh good! They're definitely not beefy, don't eat it thinking "hamburger" think of it more as an awesome sandwich."A body suit is ideal" "Never strain or exercise to the point of fatigue."
I didn't realize we'd come THAT far in 40 years. So, at least for women, if it tired you out, you were doing it wrong.
I love cooking in batches. A few suggestions... Chili is cheap and nutritious. Spaghetti sauce... Make a batch of that, pour it over pasta, toss it so the sauce mixes in, and then put the leftovers in a Tupperware container.

Stirfry is always good. Chicken and whatever veggies you like over a bed of rice. Drizzle some soy sauce and sriracha over it and it's amazing.

Also, other users have suggested chicken. I second this. Brown it in a skillet for a few minutes on each side, chop it up, then when you get home, you put the slices on a bed of greens, chop up some veggies, boom.

Speaking of veggies, bring some of whatever you want to work. If you have an office fridge, I highly reccommend bringing something you like and using that as a snack. Trust me, a few slices of bell pepper or handful of blueberries will be just as filling (and cheaper and healthier) as going to the vending machine for a bag of chips.

Most important thing is to think about things you like and then google around for recipes for them.

If you want to go cheap, my suggestions would be rice, beans, lentils, and pasta, but the health nut in me would also tell you to eat some fruits and vegetables and lean meats. :)Which I have... Which is probably why I thought it was such a silly idea. Haha. No way would that look good on me

I'll give you the upvote back to 1 karma because i would eat sushi off u/constructioncranes' naked wife.I enjoy a cup of warm bouillon every now and then, not even kidding. I'm not sure if this was ever actually a "thing", but I have strong cravings for warm, salty comfort foods sometimes. :POh totally. I just turn it up all the way but it doesn't really matter. But man tortilla pizzas can be awesome. I mean any form of pizza is awesome but the tortilla really does work particularly well. Enjoy! I was thinking the same thing! People are acting like it's this new found invention of makeup...If you ever decide to add back in some carbs, eggs and oatmeal mix beautifully.  You can even microwave the whole thing raw, and it'll cook with no mess.  It takes a few minutes, but its faster than a boil.  Toss in some veggies or some hot sauce and its even better.Fears of illness from undercooked pork come from a time when pigs still carried trichinosis.  Very few pigs carry the disease anymore, so I'd not worry.  I guess I was just sympathizing with the op. No joke this thing actually makes good sushi. My lady friend can't work out how to make sushi the normal way, this makes it much easier to make nice uniform rolls. I use it all the time in lieu of the traditional way due to not having to spread the rice on the sheet which was always annoying to me.I really want someone to try the eye shadow makeup tip, making your eyeshadow triangular with the tip over the pupil. Okay thanks for the reply!  Hy-vee it is!I wish I could by red bell peppers for $0.25, even a green pepper is $0.79, a red one is like $1.29. Sweet idea though, I'm going to make it tomorrow.Well yeah that I'm aware of, but being that it's just homemade stuff and the crust is a tortilla, it seemed overkill.

**Ingredients (with prices):**

 * 1 avocado (130 grams after pitted and removed from skin) [~$.88]

 * 4 oz cooked shrimp (130 grams) [~$2.00]

 * 1/2 small lime (about 1 tablespoon of lime juice) [~$.25]

 * 1/2 red bell pepper (75 grams) [~$.25]

 * 1-2 tablespoons red onion finely diced (to taste) [~$.10]

 * 2 tablespoons diced cilantro (to taste) [~$.10]

 * 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper (or to taste)

 * kosher salt (to taste)

*Under $4.00 lunch*

**Directions:**

1. I usually start with raw unpeeled shrimp as it is the cheapest. Peel them and devein if you care to.

2. Bring a few cups of lightly salted water to boil. If you like you can add aromatics, for this recipe I like a slice or two of lemon/lime, whole dried red chilis, and a few peppercorns.

3. Add the shrimp and return to a boil, cover, remove from heat and let sit for 8-12 minutes until cooked through.

4. Drain, and discard all but shrimp. I usually boil 4 servings at once for 4 meals.

5. From here, you just dice the shrimp, cube the avocado, finely dice the onion and cilantro and toss together with a squeeze of lime, sprinkle of salt and crushed red pepper to taste. I like to bulk it up with something else, often strips of red bell pepper or carrot sticks.

**notes:**

 * you can adjust shrimp and avocado ratio to fit your protien/fat goals.

* this is also nice on toast, crackers, or with tortilla chips if you want to add some grains. even toss in a little cooked brown rice

 * If you are packing this for lunch pack the avocado and lime half whole and cut the avocado and squeeze on the lime juice just before eating, I have found it doesn't hold up well if you dress it hours before.

I work at Hy-Vee and we have sushi grade salmon, tuna, and swordfish.  Any store with a service meat and seafood department should work, it really just comes down to trusting the people handling your fish to not cross contaminate.Bouillon has really fallen out of fashion as a beverage.Right? Contouring and overdrawn lips aren't a new trend at all.I don't know what it was about old fashioned food combinations but who, in modern times, would put celery in an omelet? It sounds so bizarre and gross!This is immensely helpful, thank you!This looks terrible.I'm not trying to be rude or disrespectful or anything, but does it make you fart a lot? I only ask because I'm interested in the recipe.Burgers are my weakness. I will probably still smother them in cheese but I'll definitely be trying this, maybe tomorrow.
Edit: i will for sure be having these tomorrow, just checked my cupboards and I have all if these ingredients. I'll update how it goes!Nah, I'm cool with most vegans.I took it to mean separately, like you can drink broth or club sodaIt's because he's vegan.I usually just mix it around in a pot or bowl. Fill it with water, mix it with my hand, drain, repeat. If you have a fine strainer that might work too, but I haven't tried that yet. Just rice the rice using normal water. The purpose is just remove some of the starch. That actually looks fairly well balanced. Carb/sugar heavy, but a reasonable number of veggie servings, dairy and lean protein. Watch the serving sizes and it seems do-able.

What gets me is the clear assumption that women are home all day, and can just whip up a celery omelette for lunch. I froze 4 cups of cooked brown rice a few days ago and reheated the first cup today.

The recipe worked out perfectly for me. The rice tasted amazing.

The only things I did differently is I used a rice cooker to prepare the rice, and I didn't have freezer bags so I had to use sandwich bags.You should post  this to MakeupAddiction. Some interesting tips in thereMade this today, it was so good!As a girl who has made a lot of sushi there is so much wrong with this. He didn't make the sushi rice correct, no vinegar in it? NEVER use a serrated knife, I couldn't believe he suggested that.  And using extra seaweed for a bandaid to keep the roll together? WTF? The only good suggestion he made was using a towel if you don't have the right sushi mat, but everything else should be ignored.  He annoyed me so much.  As for the type of rice used he explains that he chose brown rice over traditional sticky rice because it is a heathier option and it can also be substituted for Quinoa or Sprouted Rice. Its a cheaper and healthier version of "traditional style Sushi".

Why the downvotes?Both of those pieces of advice actually help a lot, thanks... How do you usually wash your rice?What you actually use for rolling.. you can find for like a few dollars...I don't see how he was "completely unprepared for the video". He had rice, veggies and Nori wraps. What else is missing? A sharpened knife? Eh, so what. I know my knives aren't as sharp as I'd like them to be.I've been freezing our meals recently.

For casseroles, I always refrigerate them to let them "set". This makes it easier to slice. When it comes time to freeze, I wrap each slice in wax paper, then I wrap each slice in aluminum foil. The wax paper is less sticky and microwave safe. The aluminum foil is stays wrapped without tape. When I'm ready to eat, I just microwave. I unwrap the aluminum foil and if the wax paper sticks, I microwave for a minute , fully unwrap, then microwave another 4 minutes or so.

For soups and stews, I place most of the food into a large container and refrigerate. When it's time to freeze, I portion out the soup/stew into sandwich-size ziploc style bags. Then I freeze each individual bag lying flat in the freezer. I attempt to get all the air out of the bag so that it's not likely to pop from expanding liquid. You can probably do the same with stock. I hear ice cube trays are a good way to freeze stock, too. Maybe one of those [large ice molds](http://smile.amazon.com/Tovolo-Sphere-Ice-Molds-Set/dp/B007ACTN54/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424391414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=whiskey+ice) frequently used for drinking with whiskey.

When it's time to eat, I place the frozen bag/block on to a plate or paper towel and microwave for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. This is enough to thaw it enough to break it apart and put it into whichever container I want to eat out of. From there, I usually microwave in 1:30-2 minute increments, so I can stir. This is especially important if I'm eating it with rice.

Don't freeze large containers, unless you plan on eating ALL of the food when it's time to thaw. Smaller plastic containers can be frozen shut and actually require some thawing, which is a big PITA. Disposable wrapping is the way to go.Oh, I'm not sure.  I went to a Clark's to buy mine. I wish I could find them in bulk so it would be cheaper.  Maybe Clark's did carry cacao nibs and I overlooked. Tilapia is usually fairly cheap, but it's not as fresh depending on where you live.If you have that much of a budget, why not order food?Club soda and bouillon?  Gross.1/2 c blueberries
7 or so frozen strawberries
2 tbsp peanut butter

  And now you have a delicious PB&amp;J SmoothieMy favorite slow cooker pulled pork recipe is 2lb pork, and a can of root beer for 5-6hrs. Doesn't pick up the root beer taste at all. Shred and add a bottle of sweet baby rays. ...He must have taken it off as it was finishing up.it still requires a lid.I didn't know what it was until you mentioned his expressionless face. I think that's what it is. He seems so fake like somebody in sales. I wondered about that too so I googled "can you cook rice in a pan" and this is the first article to come up:

&gt;[Ive tried commonly available methods of cooking rice before, such as adding rice to boiling water or vice versa, letting rice come to a boil in water in a pan and putting a lid on and letting it rest, and so on. **None of those methods really worked to my satisfaction, especially for Japanese style rice  you know, the kind that goes with Japanese meals, that gets turned into sushi rice, and so on.** I am extremely picky about how my rice turns out. So this method was quite a revelation for me, in terms of how easy and foolproof it is.
**Recipe and method: Cooking Japanese-style rice in a frying pan**
Note that the recipe/method here is for Japanese-style white rice. It should work with other white rice types too, but you may need to adjust the water amounts. Brown rice will need to be soaked in water for several hours if youre going to try cooking it in a frying pan. (Ive seen brown rice that has been pre-treated to cook in the same amount of time as white rice in Japan and some Japanese grocery stores elsewhere, so you could try looking for that.)](http://justhungry.com/how-cook-perfect-rice-in-frying-pan-fast-and-foolproof)

So actually the guy in the video is making Japanese style sticky rice in the *traditional way* with a pan (according to this website at least).If your rice is too sticky, try washing it more before you cook it. Alternatively (or additionally), be more gentle when you mix in the vinegar/salt/sugar mixture. You should be gently folding the mixture into the rice, not trying to beat it into rice meringue. I never take back my upvotes.

But thanks for replying.Why don't you just "like" it and unlike if if you change your mind?Well since this was a thread asking for suggestions...yeah. Everytime I let it cool I feel like it gets almost too sticky and I rip the seaweed paper trying to spread it evenlyA great way to store things like soups, chilis, stock- freezer containers! I like the 1-quart size because it's good for one meal when you defrost it.

Here's an example of some you could get on amazon. You want airtight ones to prevent freezer burn.
http://www.amazon.com/Arrow-Plastic-1-Quart-Freezer-Containers/dp/B000BOBWVG

you can open pan cook rice?I don't know what it is, but something about him seriously annoyed and bothered me. I think it's partly the charismatic voice paired with a completely expressionless face... Just something about him bothered me. And /r/loseit!I would live to see this cross posted to r/fitness.....    This looks fantastic. BBQ sauce goes well with black beans, too. Pulled beef/pork. Buy small buns to keep peoples portions down. Make a nice dry rub or brine if you have time. Then sear the outside on a BBQ and place it in a slow cooker with canned tomatoes and BBQ sauce. Serve with veggies n dip/ other healthy finger foods.I have better luck letting the rice cool before I try to roll it. The texture is more workable. Alton Brown has [a recipe for sushi rice](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/sushi-rice-recipe.html) that has served me well for years. It's amazing!We don't even have to try, we just have to attempt to try. Doesn't matter if we fail to try, all that counts is that we attempt to.Kapow!Could somebody reply to this post so I can go back and watch this video later?Shows how much things have changed since then I'd say, the diet is pretty heavy on carbs but nowadays everyone's cutting them. Also lifting heavy is hot.

But that can probably still work, calorie deficit plus exercise = magic.Love stuff like this! So many canned fruits and so much stretching. And the rice. Blech. It's not so much that books are/aren't better than online versions, it's that the librarian can direct you to either (or both) cookbooks or cooking websites that will most-benefit you.For anybody curious about this and interested in learning more, there's a whole spectrum of compacted meat and rice dishes in asian cooking.  The Korean version is nearly identical- for all I know, it's derivative, or perhaps the other way around, with sushi deriving from the Korean version (which I don't know the name of), but there are southeast Asian versions that use everything from pork floss &lt;sweetened pork fried in oil until the muscle fibers all separate, creating what's best described as 'meat cotton candy'&gt; ^edit to roasted vegetables, with everything inbetween.

There is a particularly good Thai example of this I had when I lived there that used sugar cane as a case, filled with sticky rice and pork, which was then grilled over charcoal, and then the husk of the cane is peeled, leaving an inner hull so that the meal can be carried around, before being peeled and eaten.

So, the short version is, if this is interesting to you, do a bit of research: this is kind of an asian equivalent to the western sandwich &lt;rice instead of bread, compacted and wrapped in seaweed rather than having the crust of bread for structure, using cheap vegetables and meat&gt;.  There are at least as many versions of this as there are versions of the sandwich.a dash of plain white sugar also makes a surprising difference in taste. approximately 1/4 tsp per tbsp of vinegar, depending on the quality of rice- don't use it without tasting first (mix a test batch). Where would you get fish for the sushi at?  I'm in Missouri, and I can't think of anywhere.
Yeah, that's not a big deal, but it's not sushi without sushi rice.  There are probably other videos out there for that, though.This may be buried, but it is a VERY important piece of info:

IF YOU HAVE HOT OIL / A GREASE FIRE, DO NOT PUT WATER ON IT.

It's amazing the number of people who don't know this.

If you ever have a grease fire, adding water will either make the fire worse, splatter firey death throughout your kitchen, or at the very least burn the shit out of you with spitting grease / steam doom. The correct thing to do is turn off the heat and throw baking soda on it.God forbid an unhelpful comment. I don't think it HAS to be warm... I just feel like the rice is hot off the stove when I'm rolling it so it feels weird using cold water to meThis reminded me that I have one! I bought it just before we moved and never used it. I'll have to see if it's in the Asian drawer. Did not know the water was supposed to be warm. We made sushi this past weekend and it went well but cutting was definitely hardest. I don't think my knife was the right kind either though. Good call. I went to the local organic co-op to buy my Nori. It was 10 sheets for $6. The 50pack was about $30. But thats "certified organic" and the only place in town to buy it. Asian markets are definitely the way to go.

I agree, sweet potato rolls ARE delicious! :)Just a tip for some of you if you want to make even cheaper sushi! This guy said that his nori (dried seaweed) cost a few bucks for 4-5 sheets. If you go to a specialty Asian market (like H-mart) they have packs of 50 sheets for $6. Way more bang for your buck!

Also, sweet potatoes and mushroom are more great cheap and healthy options for veggie sushi.[A meatatarian is a person who eats meat, animal based products, or animal produced foods. It is a reactionary term created in response to vegetarianism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatatarian)I don't know what a meatatarians is.&gt;Wax paper is also very cheap, a fairly run of the mill pantry item,

True, but I've seen some posts on this sub where people don't even have a refrigerator or frying pan. College dorms perhaps?

Personally I would never use a towel, but hey different strokes...ThanksI like your styleFair enough. Though, I still think that a towel is a silly thing to use. Wax paper is also very cheap, a fairly run of the mill pantry item, and would work without getting lint on your clothes or making a mess of your washer. He also rolled it the wrong way, you leave the unriced nori side for last.Well, Sushi in general can be expensive. But in this case he uses all veggies which cuts down on price and shows that you can make it without any gimmicky kits or a sushi mat (yes, they are only a couple of bucks) but if you don't have one you CAN still roll it anyway.For a real surprise, you can attempt ["Nyotaimori".](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nyotaimori&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kUvmVN7aKKW_sQTM5IDoBA&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=719)I was just poking fun, my brothers dislike fish aswell so we always make some veggy rolls aswellAt first I thought it WAS wax paper, the towel kind of surprised me. I  went out this afternoon and splurged and spent $4 on the bamboo rolling mat.

Thats a good tip to dip the knife in warm water. I'm attempting to make sushi this weekend so thanks!&gt;AightHe happens to be vegan. And many meatarians don't like fish either.I love youtube howto videos where the person obviously shouldn't be doing a howto video.

According to his website, he is vegan which explains why there wasn't any fish. Many people enjoy veggie rolls, plus it is cheaper than using fish, which makes this sub happy.I've done it with two skillets, both preheated. Cover completely to get the steam going, then let some air vent so it can crisp up a bit. Works pretty good. You can do it in a slow cooker or on an outdoor grill.Its a light-hearted youtube video. Fancy editing isn't necessary. And I'm sure many novice sushi makers just might find themselves in a situation where they might be a little under prepared. And the end result is still just fine.Plus it tastes fucking nasty when it burns. Not sure why so many people cook with it at high temps.I'm a sucker for a man who can cook or attempt to even try!Surprised this is so far down. 550 isn't really too high for pizza. Wood ovens get up to like 900, it gives you more variety in terms of texture and flavor. I finally made these the other night &amp; they were amazing.  Thanks for sharing! There's so many ways! Buy dried spices at the dollar store and experiment. Rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, and cracked red pepper are basic complements to chicken.

Other combinations that you can play with are Korean marinades, soy sauce, ginger, apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, red wine, lemon, white wine... Well the list goes on.

I own about five different hot sauces at home and those are easy additions to a starter dish like yours. My favorites are sriracha, chili garlic, and sambal oelek, but I also have tapatio and cholula.

My bachelor friend lives on chicken and his George Foreman grill and basically uses different sauces and spices every day to make it more interesting. This was the least helpful comment you could have made...didn't bother to edit either, or sharpen his knife...or make a worthwhile video, but proceeded to upload itI'm removing your post because it links directly to a recipe website.

"Jiro Dreams of Sushi" on Netflix.
Nevermind your wife, you'll be world famousHere's the recipe! Nutritional info is on the website towards the bottom. It turned out really awesome and froze well too for later meals. Was relatively cheap for me since I already had all the seasonings (except for ancho chili powder which was roughly $3.50) and I had to buy farro (organic and about $8 for a larger bag).

This made probably 8 cups of chili, I assumed one cup was a serving.

* 1 cup farro (another grain like brown rice or quinoa would work)
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 3 cups water, divided
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
*  red onion, minced
* 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2-3 jalapeos, minced (remove ribs and seeds if you don't want it to be spicy)
* 1 lb. ground turkey
* 1 14-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained
* 2 teaspoons ancho chili powder
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup salsa (works best with a "fresh" salsa brand like Salsa Lisa)
* 2 14-ounce cans crushed fire roasted tomatoes
toppings (sour cream, cheese, green onions, tortilla chips optional)

Bring the chicken broth and 1 cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the farro (or rice or whatever grain you're using), cover the pot, and reduce to a simmer for about 30 minutes or until all liquid is evaporated.

While the farro is cooking, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onions, garlic, and jalapeos and saute for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning the garlic. Add the turkey and cook until all the meat is browned and broken apart into "crumbles". Add the black beans, ancho chili powder, chili powder, cumin, salt, and salsa and simmer for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes and however much of the remaining 2 cups water that you feel like you need to get the right consistency. Simmer for a few minutes while the farro finishes cooking in a separate pot.

Add the cooked farro to the pot of chili and stir to combine. Top with sour cream, cheese, green onions, and tortilla chips.

[Edit] formatting.I really want a rice ball maker, even though I know I can do it with my hands. If this type of post isn't allowed, feel free to delete.Where can I go to see a well made video of how to make sushi? This has got me wanting to surprise the wife!Oh, shit, $5 kids!? Sign me up! Shit, my parents were cheap; really, Mom and Dad, an only child? You couldn't have splurged on a brother for me?

^^But ^^for ^^real, ^^thanks ^^for ^^the ^^info.100% agree. I love making sushi rolls at home, do it at least once a week (should probably cut down on the raw fish)...

1) Need rice vinegar/sugar in the rice (and no, using anything but sushi rice will lead to a roll with different look/taste/texture, not the same at all)

2) The towel is completely unnecessary, I use my bare hands all the time at home to roll it and it's just fine

3) He should dip his knife in warm water to make a cleaner cut

4) Cut the cucumbers/carrots thinner and put a little bundle of them in the roll instead of a chunk... Maybe that's just a preference of mine

Either way, do the opposite of what he just didYa, I often only eat "veggie" rolls, or rolls with crab or shrimp. Not a fan of fish :/ I do eat spicy tuna though!If you decide to go the fajita route, Kenji over at serious eats has an amazing recipe: http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/06/grilled-skirt-steak-fajitas-food-lab-recipe.html

As for sides, when I make fajitas I typically make up some Mexican rice and refried beans. I found him slightly endearing in a weird way. I thought the same thing about twelve seconds into the video, lolSo..... where are people that sushi making kits are expensive? The mat and paddles are like $5. Also....

Why the hell would you use a towel? You'll get lint in everything. Use wax paper if you don't have a bamboo roller, I mean, seriously.

Also, his rice needs vinegar (and often sugar) in it.Yeah, the kids are like $5 at the most. You can get kits at the dollar store as well. They're not exactly expensive.long story short. this guys sucksthanks for posting this...If you have an Aldi nearby, they have frozen tilapia at a decent price- last I checked it was $3.00/lb. when you bought the big bag.

And canned tuna makes delicious tuna patties.  I also love making tuna salad using softened cream cheese instead of maya and then putting it in tortillas and making quesadillas from it.  So good!  I like how despite the fact that he didn't actually make any sushi, he proceeded to upload this video.Ah thanks I'll do that next time! the ending is a riot:

"sharp knife...", "this blade is not sharp.. ", grabs another knife, contents of roll spills out from the cutting, "... you pretty much get the point... a serrated blade would be _perfect_!" :D Yea.. That video really wasn't that great.  He's completely missing sushi/rice vinegar. Also no fish, but that's preference I guess ;)He also didn't put rice vinegar in the rice.  It's just not going to taste right without it.  what a punchable face this guy has. Also had to stop watching when he licked his fingers, makes me rage when people do that.Honestly, that kinda sauce is often best if you can really let it go (low and slow) for an hour or two. Takes more time/planning, but the results are worth it!Wet your knives.

Rice vinegar to Nishiki rice with a pinch of sugar. Fluff that shit and aerate the sides.

Then proceed.Yes definitely, beans are all similarly textured I think you could sub pretty easily. What I love about this recipe is that it's a great jumping off point to experiment with different spices and ingredients. Hahaha I could see that.  LolThanks for this, really enjoyed it! I made it, but substituted the pizza base for a tomato base I made myself with a can of chopped tomatoes, garlic and basil:

* heat chopped crushed garlic on the hob for 30 secs
* add chopped tomatoes and simmer  for 10-15 minutes, mashing with a potato masher
* Add basil at the end.

Next time I think I'll add tomato puree as the base wasn't quite thick enough.goddammit, this happens way to often ;)Sounds pretty simple and delicious. Do you think the black beans can be substituted for another type of bean?In a lot of more health food groceries you can often find "super firm" (a step up from extra firm) tofu - it is often vacuum packed with much less water. Often it isnt exactly where the other tofus are but close by, so look around. Still press it as Silentsleep suggested. Bake or lightly saute to dry it out even more if you like. This has a really pleasing texture and consistency. Exactly, I'm sure it is quite similar to many people's sushi-at-home experiences.I enjoyed this. Definitely not what I would do for sushi, but his personality made me watch the whole thing. Sad to see he has so few subscribers. He definitely has talent for being in front of a camera.Wow! That was like watching a magic trick!

The sushi Bazooka actually works fairly well, but you use a lot of rice and there are a lot of poo jokes made whenever its brought out.One pound of pork and one pound of beans per person? That seems like overkill... agreed that pulled pork would be a really good solution though.How about indian? A lot of it is pretty cheap (and healthy)!

I have successfully scaled up this recipe and it is fairly economical (use extra or super firm tofu instead of paneer, lightly fried or baked to dry it out and firm it up)
[Show Me The Curry! | Palak Paneer](http://showmethecurry.com/subzis-vegetables/palak-paneerpanir.html)

Throw in some [about.com Food | Tandoori Chicken](http://homecooking.about.com/od/chickenrecipes/r/blchicken2.htm) you can use cheap bone in skin on chicken pieces (remove the skin tho)
Serve with cucumber slices, tomato slides, very thin red onion slices, and chutney.

Throw in some naan or go cheaper and just do a big pot of basmati rice.

All of the spices in those recipes should be available at any well stocked grocery, but if you can find an Indian market you will save a ton.

Good luck!

Hahaha no I've never seen that before.  [More like this one] (http://youtu.be/CTVQlPavlis)The whole video was filled with mistakes and failures, just like real cooking. Icing on the cake was the destruction of the roll from the dull knife, but because he handled the situation with grace it was actually quite funny and worth watching as entertainment rather than just instructional. Not OP but ja.I genuinely could only barely tolerate it.  I think he lacks a lot of on camera charisma.  I'm sure he's a nice guy, but he comes across a bit clunky.

Also, being a little better prepared would have gone a long way.

Could he not have waited a minute to make sure he had a baking sheet? Though the knives being dull is a nice way to show that you actually do need a sharp knife.
If you really want to impress, get 15 Rock Cornish game hens.  Small single-serving chickens, come frozen usually in two-packs. Okay so get 16. Start thawing them now in the fridge, be sure to separate then and spread them around so they thaw evenly.  They are individually wrapped and if they still seem frozen at T-4 hours, put them in a large pot (or medium cooler) and trickle cold water over then in the sink.  Brush with olive oil then season well before cooking with salt, pepper, sage.

Add a big pot of mashed potatoes, a big salad and maybe a green vegetable and a couple of loaves of garlic bread.

Just make sure you have enough oven space. You should be able to fit eight on a half sheet pan and two pans in a normal oven. With that much food in there be sure to preheat the oven to 350 for an extra 15 minutes and allow a few extra minutes to cook. How long?  Use an instant read probe thermometer and shoot four around 170 in the thigh. Rotate the pans 180 degrees and swap top and bottom racks occasionally to help them cook evenly. If you have a convection oven, even better. Rest lightly covered with foil for a few minutes while you heat the garlic bread.

Spend the rest of the money on napkins. As a guy who has made dozens of sushi rolls at home, this guy was completely unprepared for the video. Yes, it is that easy. No, brown rice doesn't stick well inside the roll.I definitely second the chilli option somebody else posted - a few pounds of ground meat, a bunch of cans of beans and diced tomatoes, sauteed diced onions and bell peppers, and some cumin/chilies/paprika/oregano. Carrots are good too if you want to add veggies and colour. It's near-impossible to fuck up chilli, just don't forget the shredded cheese and sour cream/greek yogurt!
You can also make a few trays of cornbread - Jiffy cornbread is decent and comes in a package if you're unsure about your baking skills.

An appy can be something as simple as trays of veggies, breads, and chips/crackers with a handful of dips - hummus, guac, tzatziki, spinach/artichoke dip etc.  Plus vodka gummy worms, that shit's delicious.[Roasted Garlic Shrimp Skewers.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sandra-lee/grilled-roasted-garlic-shrimp-skewers-recipe.html) (If you can find shrimp on sale, you can also include pineapple, avocado or mango so there is less shrimp on each skewer.)
Prep time is only 15 mins &amp; cook time is only 5mins.


Hummus &amp; pita chips (add anything for flavor such as: roasted red peppers &amp;/or sun dried tomatoes, OR serve plain)

["Hummus For Real"](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/hummus-for-real-recipe.html)

[5 minute microwavable hummus.](http://minimalistbaker.com/best-ever-5-minute-microwave-hummus/)I'm not here to argue whether or not processed foods are healthy. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence supporting both arguments. However, if I think a person can make it better from scratch without spending any extra, I'm going to offer an opinion. I'm *not* trying to force the notion that additives are horrible for you; however I will note that since cutting them out of my diet (for the most part), I've felt great.I peel the ginger and throw the whole chuck in. I use a Ninja Ultima blender, not sure what kind you have.

I drink the first one for breakfast every morning. Sometimes I add celery, cayenne pepper, and a clove or two of garlic. It has some kick.

The second one came from me trying to find a way to make beets taste good in a smoothie. For some reason that combo worked out well. I find both beets and carrots tend to make the smoothie foamy, so it's hard to get them right.Do you mean like the [sushi bazooka?](http://www.designboom.com/weblog/images/images_2/rodrigo/sushi%20bazooka/sushibazooka01.jpg)I'm totally guilty of the same thing.Didn't know that was a thing till now lol.I've been dipping Harvest Snaps the (snap pea crisps so far) into my hummus lately.You can also just toast it and voila! Perfect toast.Basically, EVERYTHING.Oder

Deutsche?You got it! This recipe is VERY customizable, so just use this as a base:

1 bag (1 lb) dried Pinto Beans
1-2 lb Pork shoulder (either whole or roughly cut into large cubes; it can also be other cuts of pork, as long as it's not super lean like chops or loin)
5 chopped up strips Bacon (optional - omit if the piece of pork you're using is particularly fatty, or if you've opted not to trim off the larger portions of fat, or if you're just trying to keep the calories down in general)
Salt (to taste)
1 Onion (diced)
Black Pepper (to taste)
Worcestershire Sauce (to taste)
Tabasco (to taste)
Vinegar (to taste - any vinegar will do, but cider vinegar is most flavorful)

Wash the beans in clean cold water, in a colander. There are occasionally rocks in there. Put beans in crockpot, cover with water by an inch. Add onions and pork, sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper and a couple shakes of worchestershire sauce. Turn heat on low and cover. Let simmer for 6-8 hours (6 if you cut the pork up into cubes, 8 if you just tossed it in whole).

The pork should be falling apart now and the beans nice and soft (ideally some have gone mushy while most still hold their shape). Remove the pork, and using two forks, shred it (when I do it, I usually cut up the pork rather than dumping it in whole, and I actually don't even need to use a fork to shred it - just some vigorous stirring). Dump it back in, stir, and season with as much tabasco, worchestershire, and salt as you want. Add vinegar to give it a bit of zing - usually just a tablespoon or two, less if you went heavy on the hot sauce.

Serve with sourdough or french bread.

I usually make this and end up freezing most of it for later. It makes a TON of food, and it's very very filling. Plus, leftovers are almost always better than the fresh batch because the beans have more time to soak in all the flavors.

I admit I may have made this recipe sound a lot more complicated than it is. I tried to give as much detail as possible. But I promise you it's dirt simple. Basically you just throw 3 things in the crock with some water and leave it alone. BudgetBytes has directions for prepping fajitas in the oven. Making the filling is essentially cutting up the ingredients. You'll just want to make sure not to cook too much in one dish, though. When I've doubled the recipe, juices from the chicken didn't evaporate enough and the veggies didn't get that nice, slight char. Might be good to do in two, three batches the day before and then before dinner spread out on a pan and broil to reheat.

http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/02/oven-fajitas/he also licked his fingers after picking up the avocado.....i hope he isnt sharing$10 a person for that many people shouldn't be too difficult. You can buy in bulk for just the one evening.

First thoughts:
Pulled pork sliders (slow cooked in a cheap Stout is my favorite, but the beer costs as much as the pork does) prepped open face to save on bread

Cole slaw

Nachos (chips, cheese, taco seasoning, jalapeno, black beans, onions, w/e other veggies you want really)

veggie tray (cut up the veggies yourself to save money) with hummus

I bet with proper planning and balancing you could do all of the above on $150. Nachos aren't super healthy (obviously) but it is a birthday celebration. His personality made the video worth watching. I was surprised he didn't mention adding sugar. He does comment at how sticky it is and all he did was over cook it a bit, according to [this blog](http://www.thegraciouspantry.com/clean-eating-rice-cooker-sticky-rice/) you don't need to add anything to it to make sticky brown rice.Aiight....Aiight.....Aiiight.....AIIGHT....AYYYIGHThe reminds me of tom haverford

http://media.tumblr.com/c5850a29edf23b0c07f3218cff69ab65/tumblr_inline_mwg1dqrjZc1rbwydm.pngGet a hold of a slow cooker. You want a large-ish one. Beg, borrow, or steal one. Make chili in it by doing the following:

Get 4 lbs of ground beef and anything else you like to put in chili. (I have made chili for less than $20 that easily serves 10, so I'm doubling most things here. Canned tomatoes/tomato sauce, canned corn or something, canned beans. One or two cans of each. Definitely two cans of tomato sauce, but you might only want one can of the others depending on how it all fits in the slow cooker.)

* Brown the ground beef in a pan and put *half* of your drained, browned beef in the slow cooker with all the other stuff.

* Add half the canned stuff and mix. Season with whatever you want. Cumin, pepper, salt, garlic, ginger, whatever you like in your chili. Personally I think ground cumin is a must for chili. I open up my cupboard and add whatever suits my fancy. You can add spices to the ground beef while your brow it, too. I usually do both.

* Add everything else and mix (the reason you add half first is because it's just easier to mix).

* Cook on low for 8 hours.

* **DO NOT TOUCH IT FOR 8 HOURS.** If you take the lid off, it makes it not as good. I don't know why. Maybe stir it once at 4 hours but not before. Also, don't clip the lid on. Just rest it on top.

* take the lid off and stir it all. Serve with tortilla chips or buns (that will make the chili go farther).

You can of course do this on the stove top with a pot instead and cook it for way less time and stir it more often, but I find that using the slow cooker is just so much easier, and if you're already feeling overwhelmed, it's great to just turn to cooker on and forget about it. You can leave it on at home all day while you run around doing errands and other preparations.

The chili option is good because you don't really need a side dish. You can grate some cheese on the side for people to add on the side, but for the most part, you don't need anything other than the chili. If you wanted to, you can serve veggies with dip for an appetizer. That would add some more vegetables to your meal that the chili might lack.Yeah that's where I get all my junk.  I kinda buy things I really don't need though lol

I also bought a press, to make pressed sushi for example.You really only need the bamboo roll, if even. That's like 2-4$ at your local Chinatown I bet.He just cooked the rice? So he didn't add any vinegar oder sugar?

I don't know how I should feel about thatInstead of tortillas I often do this with pita bread, and part skim mozzarella. I really don't see the problem with "processed" foods, I buy premade sauce jars and they last a week. With pita bread and chicken, I usually make something similar that comes out to 400 calories with solid macros. Op's post is a good baseline that with tweaks can be a great easy thing for people with minimal time.No problem. I find it &amp; lean ham to be my cheapest healthy proteins.

You can also make a cheesy tuna casserole by making a box of Kraft Mac n Cheese, then stirring in a can of tuna, a can of cream of celery soup, &amp; whatever veggies you like, then bake at 350 for 25 minutes or until bubbly. It's not super healthy, but not terrible either in moderation.Small cubes, and steamed (not quite 100% soft) before adding :) I do add cheese, but only on the top.Aside from being a little bit stuffed the roll was good! I do recommend cutting the roll in the middle, and then each half into halves, and then halving it all again, rather than starting from just one end. It keeps the rolls an equal length.

Also, as far as kits go, you don't really need one at all of course. I do recommend the bamboo roll, and they are basically a dollar each. Ha, this is way cheaper then all the shit I've purchased over time lolMilk &amp; Cereal ... Pocket the left over cashI enjoyed that it was such a gritty vid. Food doesn't have to look perfect to be delicious. :)That was a great looking roll. The key at the end of the day is the **sharp** knife. Anything less and you will destroy your masterpiece.Yup. [For example:](http://www.walmart.com/ip/5855164?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;adid=22222222227001177561&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=40345538312&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;wl6=78310669832&amp;veh=sem)Wait.  There's kits??I really do appreciate this additional info to the recipe! I make my own tortillas whenever we do fajitas, but I always have leftovers, and I can never think of what to do with them.

I'm really excited to make a pizza next time I'll have to play around...I generally just add 1% milk, but not a whole lot...thanks!I may be reading wrong but something doesn't sound right about the chicken cook time... 5 minutes per side of a chicken thigh is not gonna be enough time to cook it.  Yes to brown it, but I don't see where it's actually cooked in the recipe... broiling to crisp the skin won't finish it at the end.Baking the tofu a little bit helps firm it up even more. After drying and extracting the extra water with paper towels, I cut it into cubes, toss with a little oil, salt, and pepper, spread on a baking sheet, and bake at 450 degrees for 20-30 minutes until firm and lightly browned. This helps it keep its shape in stirfries and currys. Some quick thoughts:

Pulled pork in slow cooker, serve on buns. (will need half a day to cook, but can be done in advance and reheated with minimal fuss)

OK so you've got some time, and as long as nobody is Jewish or Muslim, Pork is your friend here.  It's super fucking cheap and it's delicious.  Make pulled pork with black beans (which are also filling, and super cheap).

Get like 15 pounds of cheap pork roast (should be around 2 bucks a pound) and another 15 pounds of black beans (dried beans are mega cheap, less than 65 cents a pound) along with 5 pounds of onions (will cost you like 2.50) and 5 pounds of green peppers (should be like 1.50 per pound).  You will also need cooking oil and ~3 tablespoons of minced garic, I buy preminced garlic because I'm lazy.

Cut the pork into long slivers, kind of like pork french fries, cutting WITH the grain, not against it (you want your pulled pork to be stringy.)
Chop the vegetables up into bite sized pieces, but not super fine. Toss the pork and the vegetables into a big stock pot or into 2 or 3 large crock pots (this recipe makes a lot).

If you're using a stock pot then you can pre-brown the meat and vegetables with the oil and garlic, then turn the heat way down and add your sauce.  If you're using crock pots just toss the meat in, put the vegetables on top, then portion your sauce over them.  You will want to cook these for at least 8 hours, if I'm trying to make something badass...leave it going overnight (I use crockpots) on low.



For your sauce which you will use to stew this stuff.

1 cups of vegetable oil

1 cup all purpose flour

2 cups (not a typo) of Chili powder

2 teaspoons of garlic powder

2 teaspoons salt

1 teaspoon Cumin

1 teaspoon Oregano

8 cups of vegetable stock (bullion cubes &amp; water are you friend here)

1 teaspoon Liquid Smoke (pick a flavor, I like hickory)

Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour SLOWLY and stir together over the heat for one minute. Stir in the remaining solid seasonings (chili powder through oregano). Then gradually add in the stocks a little bit at a time if you add it too fast it will be super lumpy and a big pain in the ass.  Whisk constantly to remove lumps while adding slowly, once it is fully incorporated add the liquid smoke.

Reduce heat and simmer 10-15 minutes until it thickens a little bit.



For sides, make some homemade bread, it's WAY easier than people think, and you can make kickass loaves of bread for a fraction of the price.

You will need to make probably 4 loaves of bread minimally, you can probably do 2 loaves to a sheet pan, 2 sheet pans at a time in a normal oven, so plan accordingly if you think you'll need more.

For each loaf

1 cup milk
1 Tablespoon of butter
1/2 ounce dry yeast (a jar of fleishman's yeast is fine for this)
2 tablespoons of sugar
2 teaspoons of salt
1 cup shredded cheese (I use the mexican blend that's cheap at the store)
5 cups of bread flour.

Melt the butter and warm your milk in a saucepan slowly, but NOT too hot, just melt the butter and warm the milk, you want it under 100 degrees.  Add the flour, sugar, salt and mix for a bit, then the yeast.  Kneed that shit like it owes you money for a while (I use a bread hook and my wife's KitchenAid mixer.)

Let it sit aside for about an hour to rise.

Once risen split it into 3 ropes, think like big ass fat gummy worms.  You take those 3 gummy worms and braid them together.

Do this for all 4 loaves.  (Like I said you should be able to get 2 loaves per pan)

Preheat the oven to 375, and bake that for 30 minutes until it has doubled in size, then pull it out and brush with some olive oil

Put it back into the oven and let it bake for another 40 minutes.  It should sound hollow when you tap on the crust.

It will be fucking delicious.  This guy is hysterical and I love his videos. My favorite part is at the [2:00 mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiCFkNyUsfQ&amp;t=2m0s) and of course the very end is quite comical. I haven't attempted this yet but I have a strange feeling mine is going to turn out much like his did. :) But hey, it's both cheap AND healthy, so ENJOY!Haha. Awesome. I still have a bunch of sockeye. We freeze em with a layer of water over it . it protects them from freezer burn. This looks and sounds absolutely awesome! Thank you very much for sharing :-) Do you cook the sweet potato before putting it in the enchiladas? Is it cubed or pured? Tell me more please!Healthy?!?!?!??! We're talking about pulled pork here!!!

But seriously, your only ingredients are BBQ sauce, meat, salt/pepper, and an onion. That's not really a lot of "extras"If you have and Aldi's or Price Rite near you, I can get salmon around $5 a pound. Price Rite has them in shrink wrapped, 4oz portions so it's easy to know how much to make.

Other than that, echo the tilapia and canned fish sentiment. I have the 4psi one, dry beans in the microwave take 40min. Dry beans on the stove pressure cooker take 20 min. I picked up the stove pressure cooker at a garage sale for $3.#####&amp;#009;

Well [this](http://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Microwave-Cookware-3-4-Quart-Pressure/dp/B00L8XOZU4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424359114&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=microwave+pressure+cooker) appears to be the one you linked in the video, and it's pretty near the price of a normal pressure cooker. Still interesting that it exists, but it only attains about 4 PSI according to the amazon reviews and video.This actually does have a benefit, especially if you sit in class/at work all day. Having to get up hourly to relieve yourself (and subsequently staying on your feet for about five minutes) can help to counteract some of the negative health implications associated with sitting for an extended duration.Enchiladas would be even easier to prep ahead of time! Just assemble, pop in the fridge, and pop in the oven before the party starts. You will need two large baking pans, though.

Filling ideas from BudgetBytes: [Black bean and avocado](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/04/black-bean-avocado-enchiladas/), [Chicken and black bean](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/09/snap-challenge-creamy-chicken-black-bean-enchiladas/), [Chorizo and sweet potato](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/02/chorizo-sweet-potato-enchiladas/)


Obviously, the meat fillings are more expensive. If you add black beans and sweet potatoes no matter what meat you decide to add, this will cut down on the amount of chicken, etc., bulk it out, and make it more filling.


My personal favorite filling right now is black beans, sweet potatoes, and chard (or spinach).Definitely agreed. I'll have a more, ah, "complex" recipe post coming down the pipeline tomorrow for those who prefer a more involved meal, but honestly, there's some nights when I want to put 500-600 calories in my mouth without spending 2 hours at the cutting board+stove, and stuff like this is great for that.Must have grabbed the wrong one, the one I purchased is indeed is a pressure cooker and was less than $10.
  Here is a vid describing how to use it
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2M-QczIiaeQ
Depends on the recipe, honestly.

The South Indian meal contains a lot of unusual ingredients, but if you enjoy Indian food, investing in acquiring those ingredients can be a good decision, and a lot of Indian cooking isn't really more complicated than common French/Cajun/Mexican cuisine: oil + aromatics, then spices/seasonings, then main components.

That said, the Mexican taco bar menu uses ingredients that are much more common in Western megamart-style grocery stores and would thus be a lot easier to get together. Moreover, since the big recipe (the chicken) is a slow cooker meal, it's pretty simple to get going, and the other major recipes (black beans, rice, and veggies) all have just a handful of ingredients, most of them shared between several recipes.

If we rated cooking skills from a 1 [I can toast bread! But sometimes it burns] to a 10 [I own multiple Michelin-starred restaurants, laugh at souffles, and run a cooking academy], I'd put the recipes at this:

Mexican Taco Bar: 3-4 Difficulty. Requires mastery of chopping ingredients, sauteing skills, boiling/simmering skills, and a moderate investment of time (3-4 hours active work, plus 4-6 hours slow cooking).

South Indian Smorgasbord: 5-6 Difficulty. Requires mastery of multi-stage preparations, fermentation, chopping ingredients, sauteing skills, and novel forms of cooking/preparation, and a more significant investment of time (~5 hours of work, plus 8 hours of fermentation time).

----

Both of those recipe-collections *are* build around the idea of working to prepare several complementary dishes, then combining them in novel ways. Not only do you get a ton of healthy food, but you get to eat it in a different way almost everyday, so you don't worry about getting tired of it. So yeah, they *are* more complicated than, say, making 6lbs of slow cooker pulled pork (which is awesome, by the way). But the upside is that you don't have to eat pulled pork two meals a day for 7 days straight.Yes! There's nothing wrong with a quick and easy tortilla pizza but i don't mind taking the time to make the real deal. If you have a weekend free you can make a bunch of these and freeze the. Pizza and pierogie's are always in my rotation. Definitely, yeah. My only concern would be the sauce/cheese eventually making the middle of the pizza a little soggy with a particularly long (10+ minute) baking time. May not happen, but it could, basically.Thank you for sharing. I've only been able to put together a from-scratch pizza once, and it was one of the most rewarding meals of my life. I definitely recommend it to anyone :-DCould do a quick browning right before. Many of the reviews on that product would seem to indicate that it is not a pressure cooker at all. There is no locking mechanism or way to keep pressure in the vessel.If you don't want so many eggs maybe Greek yogurt or toast with peanut butter are better options, the point is to get your day started with some good proteins. I would think the negative to eggs is the cholesterol, but I have healthy levels so I'm not worried A frozen bag of mixed veggies works just fine and they are easy to store and prepare. Also if youre feeling indulgent you can take your day old rice and brown up some fried rice. Fry an egg and mix up your cut up chicken breastestes with the rice you can just add the frozen veggies straight to the pan of fried rice. Microwave pressure cookers are just the same as a regular pressure cookerI had no idea such a thing existed, do they even work well? Also, I never downvoted you, just was putting forth a hypothesis.

Edit: A word If you want to do fajitas for so many, the internet seems to suggest cooking the veggies and meat in advance (you can do that today, if you'd like) and then reheating in the oven about an hour before dinner. It's not really the "proper" way to do fajitas, but you'll go mad if you try to grill all the veggies immediately before eating. Just make sure to slightly undercook the onion and pepper so they'll still be crisp after reheating.While you have a point, quite a few of those improvement suggestions simply aren't:

&gt; sauce from scratch (a can of tomato sauce is less than a dollar, and you can add whatever seasonings you like)

Making things from scratch doesn't automatically make them better or healthier and starting with canned tomatoes may actually make the whole thing quite a bit *less* healthy - at least that's a reasonable assumption until the whole BPA debate is settled.
Considering that making tomato sauce actually from scratch (i.e. starting with fresh, suitable(!) tomatoes and fresh herbs) is quite time consuming and not exactly cheap, op is possibly better or at least no worse off with a glass of ready made sauce of their liking.

&gt; whole wheat tortillas

Eh, they are generally slightly higher in calories but also contain slightly more fiber. If that's a real improvement is debatable, but I'd probably go for the whole wheat as well.

&gt; turkey pepperoni

Those are generally lower in calories and that's a great improvement, but in order to make them palatable, turkey pepperoni is usually made from roughly 30% cheap plant fats - and there is reasonable doubt about their health benefits over animal fats, right now it looks like it's very likely the other way around.

&gt; add veggies like spinach and mushrooms

That's by far the best advice, this adds volume, nutrition and flavor without adding many calories.


Don't get me wrong, if I'd make something like this, it would be a whole lot closer to your suggestion than to op's - but mostly due to personal preference rather than actual health benefits.Turkey is better for you because it is leaner. It's like cutting the fat off of your chicken breasts. I like the 93% lean packages. Not quite as expensive as the 99% but still just as productive. Pressure cooker $8 on Amazon, closer to $5 on ebay. Same style as. One of the three I have. You will save $8 in the first month in time cooking/actual cost of food.

No excuses for down voting because you don't like the suggestion, that is poor redditquette(sp?)

http://www.amazon.com/Handy-Gourmet-Microwave-Pressure-Cooker/dp/B00065HO58I believe you got downvoted because your comments are very misleading. I agree that dried beans are better by all accounts, except for the time issue.

You linked an article that doesn't specifically discuss pressure cooking, and then later say after I countered that preparing dried beans from scratch can take up to two hours, that you just use a pressure cooker.

You went from saying just cook the beans from dry, to cook the beans in a pressure cooker. Why not mention the pressure cooker in your first comment, rather than linking an article about skipping soaking for black beans? Not everyone has a pressure cooker, and they can be an investment. Absolutely worth every penny, but not everyone in this sub can afford to buy a pressure cooker at a moment's notice. I only mentioned Trader Joe's because they're just as affordable as the off-brand stuff at Supermarkets and their tortillas are fairly good quality (while the flour may be processed, they still contain far less conditioners and additives than generic flour tortillas). I'm very aware they sell food that is less than healthy... I could have recommended something like some raw wraps, but this is the "eat cheap" subreddit, after all.

You can buy "natural" turkey pepperoni that has substantially less additives, etc. than other brands -- Applegate Farms is one I can think of off the top of my head, and is available at most markets.

Edit: Not sure why this is being downvoted? He did say "Beginner Friendly". Fairly certain this would give me instant heart burn, though. I don't use too much kale for this reason - it's so fibrous. If I add more than usual, I try to run the blender a little bit longer.Hmm that's interesting. Maybe it's too much coconut oil? Or try adding it after other ingredients so it's not at the bottom? Unless, it could be happening if you're not adding any other liquid to help homogenize everything - oj, almond milk, etc.Turmeric is known as an anti inflammatory but it also imparts a very distinct flavor in the smoothie, not to mention its bright yellow/orange hue to match the other ingredients.&gt;It might not have a ton of vitamins, but I wouldn't say it has a ton of calories.I'm just finishing up some pizza I made last night. For those that have the time or simply want real pizza dough, here's a good recipe. College student approved on both fronts. I have been making this cheaply for years.

Based on the Bobby Flay recipe. Will provide at least two full sized pizza dough. Bonus, make a bunch ahead of time and freeze!

* 3 - 4 Cups of Bread or all purpose flour (Use wheat for a healthier alternative. Bread flour has a crisper crust
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 envelope instant dry yeast
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, some to coat bowl.

1) In a large mixing bowl, take the water, pitch your yeast into it, add sugar. You can either continue with the recipe or wait for your yeast to proof. I have never had a bad packet so i usually go straight to step number 2.

2) Add the remaining ingredients into the bowl and mix. It is handy to have a bowl of flour on the side just in case. You want to mix until a bowl of dough forms. Add flour if its sticky. Add water if too dry.

3) Pull the dough onto a lightly flour surface and knead into a nice ball.

4) Grease a bowl with a little olive oil, put dough in bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough double in size in a warm place (about an hour, more will not hurt).

5) Pull dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead and cut in half. Reserve half for another day. Knead the dough, lightly flour, and let sit for another 10 min.

6) The dough is ready to roll and toss!

Tips: Sprinkle corn meal on the bottom of the pizza tin for a crispier bottom. Use a little olive oil on the top of the pizza to keep it from getting soggy from the sauce.

Speaking of sauce, here's a little bonus.

Really easy and cheap.

* 1 Can tomato paste
* Water
* Seasoning to taste

1) Take the can of tomato paste and empty it into a clean mixing bowl. Reserve the can.

2) Fill the can fully with hot water. Stir with spoon and combine with paste.

3) Season to taste. Everyone's different. I add...

* Fresh Garlic
* Fresh Onion
* Parsley
* Red Pepper Flake
* Sugar (I like a sweet and spicy sauce)
* Chipotle pepper
* Salt
* Black Pepper
* Parmesan CheeseDown votes come when you don't agree with the herd. Yes, thank you!Your advice isn't much better. Whole wheat flour is still processed. Turkey pepperoni has preservatives and is also processed.   Placing the word Trader Joe's and Turkey in front of a product doesn't make it automatically a healthier option.   Turkey in certain products has more preservatives and processed fats than their beef or pork counterparts. Trader Joes is kind of like an organic grocery store. It's cheap but nice. I think whole foods would be the equivalent, but really any roasted corn is just as good. I don't know what's available in Germany but when I lived in the UK I used canned kidney beans in chilli sauce in place of the black beans. "Mexican Cheese" is a bagged blend of several cheeses, namely monterey jack, cheddar, asadero, quesadilla. You can sub for whatever you like/can get. Badia Mojo might be hard to get, but it's not essential, I only started using it lately. Cholula is just a hot sauce, if you can get Franks you're most of the way there.

Enjoy!You could also make your own Naan (or buy it -- Target has some good ones) and use that to make flatbread pizza!Within your calorie budget  healthy. You wouldn't call eating a bacon double cheeseburger and duck fat fries to fill your caloric needs healthy, would you?try them in fish n chips with a beer batter....OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!It adds a sweetness to the onions but you rinse most if it off . You have to put chunks of stuff in them. I'm not talking thin Campbell's stuff, I'm talking cut your carrots 1/2 inch or bigger.

Eat it with bread. Put black beans in stuff.

Get to understand caloric amounts and how much you need to gain, maintain and lose weight and eat your meals according to that.  "Feeling hungry" is A: often actually thirst compounded by high salt levels, and B: something you get over eventually because you're used to eating until you're full.Sure!

Check out Michael Ruhlman. He has one book called "Ratio: the simple codes behind the craft of everyday cooking" and another called "Ruhlman's Twenty: 20 techniques, 200 recipes, a cook's manifesto".

Also, Mark Bittman (writes the "Minimalist" column in the NYT) has a series of books called "How to cook everythig" and focuses on super simple recipes.

That's definitely a good rule! I should probably follow that, haha.

Have fun!You're doing well OP, keep cooking and your meals will become even more tasty and creative.Avocados are like $4 each here.I think sugar is a bad choice here. It's unhealthy and unnecessary, your recipe otherwise is lovely.You are a lifesaver. I've been racking my brain trying to think of an olive oil and vinegar alternative (for weight loss). This is really helpful.The breakfast book is really awesome.And mould, because of the lack of preservatives.Jacket potatoes &amp; chilli For low carb stuff /r/fitmeals and /r/ketorecipes are pretty good places (even if you aren't actually aiming for keto or anything)That's nice. I'll try chicken tikka masala and slow cooking too. :)Okay thanks. I'll buy different containers too. I can easily eat 250g of pasta for a meal. :( I need to fix that too.Do thanksgiving dinner. You should be able to do this if you do all the vegetables fresh and shit, from a wholesaler or local shop. No walmart $1.50 per pound of onions bullshit. I'm talking 25 cents for 2 pounds from your asian market down the street.Aren't cereales and fruits good for breakfast ? I love eggs but I read a lot that I shouldn't eat too many eggs per week.

I could eat two eggs per day and still love them no matter what.I love soup but I am always starving if I only just eat that. :(Definitely interested, thanks. :) I will buy a slow cooker this weekend.It is great, thanks. I love soup. :)Thanks ! I expect to buy a lot of chicken from now on. :PEventually, I will learn to like cooking. Let's hope that's the case. :)

Thanks.Can it be cooked at a lower temp for longer?After a quick look, a lot of recipes require an oven which I don't have. Thanks anyway, I'll try to find some recipes that only require slow cooker or a pan. :)Hi,

I have a small freezer so I can't really make tons of food for a few weeks. Small fridge, small freezer, small kitchen. :DDon't I need an oven to make roast chicken ? :( I only have a pan to cook chicken unless I can cook it with a slow cooker.Hi,

not a big fan of re-heated pasta, I only like fresh bread (I miss my childhood when my parents made the bread themselves every day :P), no problem for a salad, I just need to find the correct dosage of sauce/dressing to make sure it stays healthy. I like soup but I really should start making it myself and yes, chili. I need to learn how to make it.

Thanks.Brocoli and chicken, I like. I'll need to find the other things (what's trader joes ? I live in Germany so I'll need to find the equivalent).

Thanks.If I were you, here is what I would do: buy a bag of clementines, a box or two of south beach granola bars, a bag of string cheese, and a dozen eggs. Hard boil eggs.

When you leave the house in the morning, bring with you: cheese, granola bar, fruit, and hard boiled egg. Eat this instead of drive thru meals, snack on the 4 items as you like as you go about your day. If you find this doesn't get you through until dinner, bring peanuts and tuna, too, or eat some oatmeal or cereal before you leave the house.

In college, that combination kept me full all day until dinner, when I would recommend having whatever it is you like- for me it was usually a fruit and veg smoothie and either a quesadilla and tomato soup or a spinach salad with some sort of protein (tofu, tuna, avocado, chicken, flank steak, cheese, whatever). When I drank a lot of coffee, I would sometimes just eat a second south beach bar and skip dinner... I also would have Frozen yogurt and popcorn (bulk airpop) as a study treat sometimes on hand. I also ate a lot of Mac and cheese in college for dinner, but used cream cheese in place of butter and added Frozen broccoli or spinach.

Now I eat a lot of lentils and beans and rice and do things that require a lot of cook and prep time... But, it wasn't my priority in college with a job and a social life. That combo (above) is magic and much cheaper than fast food
Once again, the chicken hehe. Is there vegetables that could go well with that in the fridge/freezer ? I like brocolis, tomato, mushrooms, ...Why is chicken so healthy ? I can see that most recipes have chicken in it. I know it is high in protein (I read a few fitness blogs/posts) but is it the only reason ?

I try to eat soups during the evening but I probably need to make the soups myself instead of the cans/"bags of dry soup". It takes me 5-10 minutes to cook so it is perfect but I am starving after that.I only like salad when it is not too dry (= a lot of sauce and I doubt that's healthy when you have a lot of sauce). That's why I prefer things like chili con carne (apparently, it is healthier that what I thought).

I can buy salads at work and they are good but I can't eat that every day. :(Is there tips in cookbooks that I can't find online ? I love books but I don't have the space to put the books close to me when I try to cook.

That's why a printed version of some recipes that I can stick on the wall is better. I sometimes have to move to my living room to cut vegetables on the table (yeah, I know, pathetic :P).Thanks for the video, I can give it a try but I don't think I will like it. I hate pastas that are not "freshly cooked".So many links, I need another day to check everything. Thanks ! I really don't have time during the week, I come home after work at 8-9pm and have to study for my future studies so that's why I need to prepare everything during the weekend and put it in the fridge/freezer for the evenings during the week.

Basically, if I can take one dish from the fridge/freezer and put it in the microwave, that's perfect.

I'll definitely buy a slow cooker this weekend. Is a rice cooker worth it for me ? I don't mind cooking rice even if it takes 20 minutes because I don't have to stay in front of the burners for a long time.Using all three, make an easy pasta salad!

* 2 cups cooked small sized pasta like orzo, ditalini or stars or..

* 1 cup cooked beans like black eyed peas or chickpeas

* 1 cup steamed frozen veggies  like green beans, broccoli, corn or that frozen veggies mix

mix all of these together and add

* 2 chopped tomatoes

* 1 chopped bunch of parsley

then make the sauce by mixing

* 2 Tb preferably sweet mustard (mild is ok as well)

* 2 Tb balsamic vinegar

* 1/2 Tb soy sauce

* a pinch of pepper

adjust to your taste and pour over the salad.Thanks for the links. There seems to have many things in your recipes (I don't have most of them). Is it easy and fast to prepare/cook ?

I'll read all of them this weekend when I have more time, thanks.Hi thanks, I am not a big fan of lens (each time I ate that at work, I didn't like it but maybe it was not well prepared). I'll keep in mind the chili con carne. :)Sorry to ask, is that really healthy (barbecue sauce, ...) ? :)

I have no clue about what's healthy or not apart from vegetables.

Once again, a slow cooker, I'll buy one for sure.Do you mean /r/budgetfood ?I saved it but I would probably end up eating the 4 servings. It doesn't cost anything if I can manage myself to really keep 4 servings. I am probably gonna save a lot of money when I don't eat take away food every evening.

Thanks.**RECIPE FORMATTED FOR EASIER VIEWING**

**Ingredients:**

* 1.5 large heads of broccoli

* 8 oz of spicy marinated tofu (very firm)

* 1 Tsp Extra Virgin Coconut Oil

* 1 TBsp Soy Sauce

* 1 clove of garlic

* 1 TBsp of ginger powder

* 1/2 Tsp of white pepper

* 1/2 Tsp of crushed red pepper

*Nutritional Content for 1 Serving (half of recipe)*

* 405 Calories

* 11 grams of fat 890 mg of sodium (mostly from the soy sauce)

* 12 grams of carbs (mostly from the broccoli)

* 27 grams of protein

* 1 gram of sugar (from soy sauce)

* No Cholesterol

**DIRECTIONS**

1. The recipe is easy. I roast the garlic in a skillet in the coconut oil.

2. I add the broccoli and sautee it with all the spices and soy sauce until it turns greener but remains crispy.

3. Then I add the marinated tofu (store bought from the local Asian grocery store) and cook it with the broccoli until it's heated throughout, and serve.

4. I personally like the soy sauce / ginger mix with hot red pepper, but feel free to experiment with different herbs and spices. I like broccoli because it sucks up whatever sauce it's being cooked in like a sponge. I also avoid most carbs after lunch except for what I get from fruits and vegetables, so this is a very common weeknight dinner for me.

5. The 8 oz of tofu only costs me $1.79 and the broccoli only $1.50. I don't know how to measure the prices for everything else and I consider them rather negligible. The coconut oil does cost $10 for 1 jar and I get a maybe 20 teaspoons out of 1 jar. You can sub the coconut oil with corn/vegetable oil (I just prefer coconut oil so I have it in my kitchen.)
I like meat but I can eat vegetarians dishes without problem. I am really just too lazy to look for informations about all that.

It is not that it is hard, I just find it boring. The longer it takes to prepare, the more bored I am. I once tried to cook a lot of different vegetables and rice that I put on a pan but it was not really funny to cook everything with only two small burners.

Funnily, I love watching cooking show like Gordon Ramsay's on youtube, I just can't find any joy in it. :(I often read chili and burritos etc, I probably should give it a try. Does it stay "good" after a week ? Some people here suggested pasta but I really don't like to eat pasta after a few hours so after a few days... :sI saved those, thanks. I looked in the search bar with the wrong terms obviously, I fount threads like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1ui1we/guides_suggestions_for_weekend_cook_for_whole/) and now I find my post in the search bar, great.How come I am not aware such a thing exist ? :D

I hate being in front of the burners and wait for things to be cooked. Being in a really small kitchen doesn't help either. I cut my vegetables on my microwave since I have no table. :P

Thanks a lot, that's kind of perfect. Thank you. That seems really nice. I hate being in front of vegetables and not know what I should buy. :)

I'll definitely have a look !Yes! Having your prepared/cut ingredients ready before you start cooking is called your mise en place--it's what they do in professional kitchens. And it takes a lot of stress out of the cooking process. Instead of scrambling to get the next ingredient ready to go in the pan, you can calmly add them when it's time.

I second learning techniques rather than recipes first. It's a shame Food Network rarely shows any programs with actual cooking anymore. It used to be a great resource for learning basic things like knife skills (dice an onion, julienne a pepper) to cooking methods, such as braising or roasting.

These days, it's not hard to find lessons online on how to properly use a knife (hint: it takes lots of practice to be good at dicing, so don't get discouraged if you can't brunoise right off the bat). Or maybe even consider taking a cooking class together with your girlfriend!

You'll gain more confidence with each success. That's how you learn to love to cook.Going off of this - cut up a hotdog, some potato, peppers, onions, and fry it with an egg or two and you'll have a simple and delicious breakfast ( or dinner ) scramble.  I looked around for a crock-pot and it seems pretty decent. Seems like a lot of places suggests it, so I think I'll give it a go at some point in the future.

Everywhere people were foaming about how delicious it will make your meat, but does it bring anything for the vegetarians? You also make the pasta, rice or potatoes or what ever you are making separately right?That is an excellent advice! That could really make a difference on the stress-part when you actually know what you're doing, instead of "is it good now or... How do I even know?"

Do you have any tips on good resources?

Oh I also just read somewhere that you should chop and measure EVERYTHING before turning any heat on - that could really make it less hectic and I'll definitely try it out!I love it &amp; yellow squash combined. It's like they were made for one another.I totally know what you mean with the awful flavor of burnt low carb tortillas. I was crushed when I realized how hard they are to cook with. Great idea about the zucchini btw; I love the stuff! They are actually called pour spouts, so good guess!For myself, I would probably make a veggie pizza with a cauliflower crust.  But I love this recipe and am saving it so I can whip these tortilla pizzas out for my son and use your process to make my own healthier pizzas.  Thank you.Not sure why you got downvoted. I use dried beans with a pressure cooker all the time - saves so much time.I just made a modification of these two one using what I had on hand, it was very good. Did I need to peel the ginger before I grate it?

I used beet, grated carrot, lemon juice, almond milk, celery, apple, frozen raspberries and strawberries. Thanks for the inspiration. I do mine at 350. I use store brand pizza blend shredded cheese, which is mostly mozzerella anyway.

The blend is white, cook it til it looks orange from the sauce and the crust is kinda crisp without burning either.

As long as the cheese is melted, you're fine. If I take it out too soon it just becomes a calzone burrito thing.I eat the same exact thing all the time (I actually only use sauce, cheese, tortilla, and pepperoni if I have it).

I'm a 5'10" male, eating this 3 times a day (I don't) is still within my daily calorie budget. It might not have a ton of vitamins, but I wouldn't say it has a ton of calories.I absolutely love how you pulled out the green on this. I appreciate how the mods are handling this, and it's kinda funny that people are getting so upset about people eating pizza. 1 avocado
2 frozen bananas
 cup frozen raspberries (or fresh raspberries or other berries)
1-2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups almond milkSure!!!  Who cares?  It's just a sub reddit, and that would loosely follow the guidelines. Don't use low carb tortillas though. They burn &amp; dry out way too fast. Wheat are great though. Never tried it with pitas, but I bet they'd be amazing.

Zucchini, yellow squash, onions, peppers, mushrooms...so many great things you can add to this to add versatility &amp; flavor.

I'm familiar with keto, but that doesn't seem enough fat though considering the low amount of protein &amp; fiber. Did you total it up? My guess is ~15g or so.

I don't know if you like it or not, but lean ham is a great option for this too.Kale is a taste you have to get use to. I used spinach for a long time because kale was just weird tasting to me. I just recently started using kale again and don't mind it anymore. As for it being chunky its probably just the type of blender or blade you use /r/frugal_jerkMaking your own deep-fried butter at home is cheaper and healthier than going to the carnival. Would that be appropriate to post in this sub?Im from Mogadishu.Sounds awesome! Glad that you enjoyed, /u/iTzKPanda :-DHahaha, yeah, that is super awesome. . . and super dangerous. Something so unhealthy should never be so good &gt;.&gt;Much obliged!Definitely so; subbing out wheat tortillas or even pita bread, for instance, would be a great start. Adding more veggies would help, too.

In all fairness, the fat from the oil and cheese *will* satiate you for a while. This is hardly a traditional keto recipe, but that diet partly works off that principle.To be fair, it's kinda going for that "pizzeria" style (blazing hot wood-fired oven for a couple of minutes). You could definitely go lower and slower!just regular quaker oats, non flavored.I do add green plant juice, sometimes, but I haven't gotten over the weird texture of kale smoothies yet. Am I doing something wrong- they are super chunky. Anyone have a recipe that uses avocado? What are the benefits of turmeric? Any kind of oats? Never tried this in a smoothie, will make tonight! Awesome idea, I love this- cacao nibs are in bulk food section?This looks great, but oven at 550? That seems overkill, can I put it in for lower for longer? If you'd like posts about somewhat unhealthy options, /r/budgetfood is the right subreddit. It could use some love from posts *exactly like this one*.Check out books and sites on cooking *techniques*, rather than individual recipes. Things like how to braise meat, infinitely tweakable salad dressings, how to make soups, how to stir fry veggies. That helps year down whole sections of the cooking barrier at once, and as you get more familiar with different dishes you can start "whipping meals up" yourself. &gt; At 550cal, it's not an unreasonable amount of calories to fill up on for a meal

The big issue is that it will not keep you full for long. Adding more protein &amp; consuming fiber in some form will help with that.Well either way....looks great!!This is the cheapest way. It is satisfying to eat what you caught.Thanks!My husband makes these! But he makes it 10x more unhealthy by making a quesadilla in a skillet and then topping it with sauce, cheese and pepperoni and baking it. Total drunk food.

[edit] just saw OP already mentioned this. Wah wahhh. http://www.bachelorsdegreeonline.com/blog/2011/50-delicious-meals-you-can-make-on-a-hot-plate/I can't imagine why...Canola tends to have GMOs in it? Guess I liked it for a reason.Obviously, we have different ideas on how to run this sub. Have a nice rest of your night.It isn't the same as American carp, which I've heard bad things about. Totally different type of fish. Most people say it is a very clean tasting, dense white flakey fish. The only downside I've heard I that it is bony. Otherwise I've heard it is great.Just tried this but used some leftover pork instead of pepperoni. Can confirm that it was awesome. Thank you so much! Opinion doesn't matter. It is not as subjective as you want to think it is. You're running a sub that expresses health in the title. You should have a more strict definition about what that means rather than leave it open to interpretation. Some of the posts in this thread that things can be healthy to *them* because in general their diet is way worse, and that is simply untrue.

Having a broad definition of health basically just makes this sub another random food sub. But they're made out of *chemicals*. Unlike food which is made out of love and the sound of children's laughter.&gt; I think everyone agrees, 99% of the time, pizza is unhealthy.Enjoy your vacation.Thanks for the in depth reply. I'm going to try some, and make sure its good and pressed before I do.

I'll report back when I find a good recipe and take the plunge I think its mostly the idea of it that turns me off. Now that I think of it, I've had the "ground beef" soy stuff and that was pretty good.

I'll try some of the suggestions! Thank you.Wtf? 100% wrong about what?I mean, if you're already at the dumpster, I say you just go ahead and get the more protein-rich meal readily available there: fresh, raw raccoon![Flat out wraps](http://foodiefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_7628.jpg)My dad&amp;uncle make my luck. They fish every other weekend and the amount of free fish I get is amazing for my wallet.Or you can get a real pizza for free at the local dumpster.... I prefer firm tofu. Firmer the better. Sometimes I will fry it and serve it with chili paste or sriracha. Most times I sautee it. I prefer buying pre-marinated and pre-squeezed (but if you live in a place where Asian grocery stores are rare that may be hard to find). If you buy regular tofu from a regular supermarket you usually need to drain, dry and press it which is annoying and time consuming.

As an alternative, lots of 'normal' grocery stores now sell 'soy chicken' or 'soy beef' which tastes sort of like those things but it is really only made of soy. It may be worth trying something like that instead if you're not that into tofu. Tofu can be awesome because it readily absorbs the flavour of whatever you want it to taste like. Like meat, you can marinate it before cooking, or simply cook it right in the pan with whatever else you have going on in there. What are some of your favourite sauces and flavours? Add tofu to those things.

The best type of tofu to cook with for something like OP's dinner, would be extra firm tofu. Because it comes packed in water, you will need to drain out the excess before cooking to avoid your recipe becoming too watery. A good trick I've used before is to create a padding of paper towel on a plate, place the whole block of tofu on the towel, put another plate on top, and put something rather heavy on top of *that* plate. This helps to squeeze out the excess moisture from the tofu. I would typically use this process on the tofu for an hour or so before chopping it up to cook or marinate.

You may need to play with cooking times and temperatures to achieve the desired crispiness and texture that you like.Try it. If it works it works. I just couldn't eat it/ No, I do not believe that you understand what I an trying to say.

1. Your version of a healthy meal is not a healthy meal for everybody's dietary restrictions.

2. This is the core mission statement of this sub. If you can not abide by it and try to be constructive, maybe this sub is not a good fit for you.

Thanks. Also, you might want to check your recipe post. I think that you may have erred in a step.Really? I've found pork to be pretty great! But YMMV I suppose.

Maybe the cut of meat had something to do with it?Details:

Ingredients:

1.5 large heads of broccoli
8 oz of spicy marinated tofu (very firm)
1 Tsp Extra Virgin Coconut Oil
1 TBsp Soy Sauce
1 clove of garlic
1 TBsp of ginger powder
1/2 Tsp of white pepper
1/2 Tsp of crushed red pepper

Nutritional Content for 1 Serving (half of recipe)
405 Calories
11 grams of fat
890 mg of sodium (mostly from the soy sauce)
12 grams of carbs (mostly from the broccoli)
27 grams of protein
1 gram of sugar (from soy sauce)
No Cholesterol

The recipe is easy. I roast the garlic in a skillet in the coconut oil. I add the broccoli and sautee it with all the spices and soy sauce until it turns greener but remains crispy. Then I add the marinated tofu (store bought from the local Asian grocery store) and cook it with the broccoli until it's heated throughout, and serve.

I personally like the soy sauce / ginger mix with hot red pepper, but feel free to experiment with different herbs and spices. I like broccoli because it sucks up whatever sauce it's being cooked in like a sponge. I also avoid most carbs after lunch except for what I get from fruits and vegetables, so this is a very common weeknight dinner for me.

The 8 oz of tofu only costs me $1.79 and the broccoli only $1.50. I don't know how to measure the prices for everything else and I consider them rather negligible. The coconut oil does cost $10 for 1 jar and I get a maybe 20 teaspoons out of 1 jar. You can sub the coconut oil with corn/vegetable oil (I just prefer coconut oil so I have it in my kitchen.)

This is my first real post here so please let me know if you have questions.

Put in on low for 8-12 hours. It will stay good on the "keep warm" setting for about 2 days/ I tried it two weeks ago as pork was considerably cheaper than beef. It just made for a really bland tasting stew. I emptied nearly a quarter bottle of Frank's red hot in and it barely changed the flavor. I tried it over rice but it just wasn't as good as the beef. See? Even the food doesn't want to be there. ;)This was our go-to summer Mom-doesn't-wanna-cook lunch when I was a kid! We'd do sauce from scratch (super easy - canned tomato sauce with some garlic salt, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and pepper til it tastes good), add cheese and whatever toppings, and just pop it right in the microwave for like 1.5 minutes. We'd also roll them up like burritos, wrap in tinfoil, and throw in some coals on camping trips. Pretty awesome, I don't care if they're unhealthy or not. :PWhat's with the avoiding pork? I mean, I'm not saying that it's incorrect! Beef is great. But that seems like an oddly specific thing to say?So, should we keep this stew in the crockpot on the countertop, on a low setting and cooking continually for 2 days? Is that correct?Nah, one of the fancy little, uh. . . pour-y spouts. Yeah, I bet that's what they're called.If they work keeping food fresh, that means they should make you live longer when you consume them, right?No, but the time I spent fiddling with taking pictures and then re-finding my lost spatula let it burn a little more :(I know this is pretty easy to make but its very cheap ($7-12 for 3-5 meals). I ususally make a pot on sunday night and snack on it throughout the week as extra snacks. As did I! Writing out the recipe made me want to make some. Glad you enjoyed.Curry, like Chilli is a mixture of spices - it does not need to be spicy.

Most that I own are mild, and then the rest as flame-hot. That allows me to start mild and then turn u the heat. Go to a grocer with a decent international section (fancy part of town, or near the relevant ethnic enclave) and pick look around. I tried adding coconut oil to a smoothie once but the cold just made it chunk up. It felt like there were bits of wax stuck in every corner of my mouth. So gross! What the heck did I do wrong?Cool, look into fajitas and quesadillas if you've never had them. They're fantastic and easy. There's also a whole range of pizzas made on tortillas so you don't even have to make dough. [Here's an example.](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/07/bbq-black-bean-pizzas/)

If you ever want to get fancy, [make your own tortillas.](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/homemade-flour-tortillas/) It takes a little time but they are SO MUCH more flavorful and tasty than the store bought ones.  I never had flour or corn starch ruin my taste.

Sometimes sauce just needs a little help to reduce and flour or corn start will do the trick. The other option is to take out the solids and keep boiling the sauce until it reduces.

Never let a water sauce spoil your meal! Thanks! I do something similar called Larb. It has a lot more steps but is SO FREAKING GOOD. My sister in law taught me. She is Thai.

Anyways...thanks for the directions. Is it possible to remove the foodcount.com watermark or the links in your imgur link? Buy a good brand of whole wheat tortillas (check the ingredients!), use scissors to cut them into chip-sized pieces, and just pop them in the toaster oven until crispy. No oil, no salt required. Yes, sorry I forgot to do thatI've never been able to get a handle on tofu. I wish I could, it seems like a great addition to my diet. What are some good ways to prepare it?I like them with pitasAre the last picture and second to last picture of different pizzas? They look different.
The point is that what you deem healthy is not healthy for everyone.

I see that you have not submitted any healthy post to this sub. We ask that you lead by example and offer healthy suggestions rather than argumentative comments.

I think I'll keep an eye out for that next time I go shopping.  Thanks!That's a good idea and an easy one too.  Thanks!That's a terrible argument. A Big Mac is healthy to a starving Indian boy yet terrible for most in the first world. It's safe to assume everyone on this subreddit is from the first world. Therefore, eliminating food items low in vitamins, minerals, protein/complex carbs/saturated fat and high in sugar, simple carbs, and sodium should be considered healthy.

This pizza is high in sodium as well as simple carbs making it relatively unhealthy. Making your own sauce, or jazzing up premade sauces is relatively easy.

Consider buns or hostile rolls of you don't have or want tortillas.Can you post the recipe? You have posted a list of ingredients and some nutrition info. Thanks. How is what you eat healthy for every single person on the planet?A Jagermeister bottle ?Well, you would be 100% wrong. I see that you have not submitted any healthy posts to this sub. We ask that you lead by example.

I make these on the grill.  I heat it up to around 450-500 throw them on and rotate 180 degrees after 1 minute and cook for an additional minute. I bake it drizzled in a little melted butter with seasoned salt mixed in, on top of sliced onions. Mmmm. Or use those saute express cubes. Burritos are awesome: cheap, versatile, and easy. If you like chipotle, Google around (e.g. Chipotle burrito/rice/chicken recipes) and find a lot of different recipes. Pick whichever is easiest or the one that appeals to you most, and just go for it.

Rice and beans are easy (in fact, beans are as easy as opening a can); the hardest parts would be marinating and cooking the meat (just because you don't have a lot of experience, but the more you do it, the easier it is) and the salsa, if you don't have a food processor. But salsa from a jar is fine, too.

This might be a good starting point. A lot is heating/assembling, which is hard to mess up and leads to delicious rewards. Plus, like previous posters mentioned, you have spices for tacos, chili (meat or vegetarian), quesadillas, and more.

Good luck, op!Yeah, I keep meaning to buy one of those &gt;.&gt;&gt;Not everyone has the astute health and keen nutritional knowledge that you have. Please share options instead of opinions. Thanks.

I think everyone can agree; 99% of the time, pizza isn't healthy. /u/dxrebirth has a point, the entire recipe isn't healthy. It can be marginally improved by adding veggies but it's still not healthy. Going to try this but with mushrooms peppers and fold it in half to make a burrito xDI hate it too! I ended up making them tonight though and loved them. It's really the smell of canned tuna I can't stand. I gaged a little when I was mixing all the ingredients and making the balls, but after they were fried the smell wasn't an issue. I like to push myself out of my comfort zone like that.How is pizza healthy?who doesnt know how to throw shit on a tortilla/bagel/english muffin/etc,etc,etc and make a pizza?

so bored with all the reddit-kids and their pizza "hacks"Hello there! I will point out that this sub gains a lot of attention from young adults who have never cooked a thing as well as mature parents and savvy kitchen veterans looking for new ideas to feed their kids and themselves healthier options that are affordable.

[Recipe on FoodCount](https://foodcount.com/recipe/turkey-thai-lettuce-wraps)Yeah persevere your life. It's common sense. Obviously that would be constructive. But if I post a McDonalds hamburger deal on here, would that fall into your suggestion? No, that would be absurd.

The point of all these comments are that certain things are outright unhealthy. You want to make this healthier? Use veggies, don't use pepperoni, don't used overly processed sauces, cut out preservatives.

I mean, that was all common sense. It's healthier and cheaper than ordering a pizza from a restaurant... Little hack you might appreciate http://i.imgur.com/7Efmn4Q.jpgThere's nothing wrong with preservatives. Can I just state that I like everything about this post and this response?

1) OP gives an easy and cheap recipe

2) OP states estimated (somewhat high) calories in the description (true Reddit hero)

3) Someone gives advice on how to make the recipe healthy

Can this be a new thing? Someone posts a somewhat unhealthy but cheap dining option, and the community turns it into a healthy meal? I would sub to that.So glad you liked it! Thanks for the feedback:)I'm sorry the recipe didn't work out in the beginning! Should have added that the curry powder that I use is indeed pretty mild. Also, I'm not a hundred percent sure if the coconut milk I buy here (germany) is the same consistency as the one in the US. Mine always has a very thick, greasy part on top and then some watery stuff underneath, and it contains about 20 percent fat in total.  When I make it, you can really taste the coconut and it is very creamy, so I really hope you try it again:) Thanks for your reply! Nice, glad you liked it! Let's just say if I were to make myself some chips I wouldn't be chucking extra virgin in my fryer!Agreed!  It's surprisingly tasty!Ya but it just gets funky when you are in small spaces, like think about how you can smell someone at work microwaving their lunch.  Now imagine that all day. I cook just about everything with EVOI and I've never had an issue either with either the cooking process or taste.  about a foot plus the container it uses. They are very small.There is nothing inherently unhealthy about processed or canned foods whatsoever. And there are plenty of highly nutritious processed or canned foods, like frozen or canned veggies. What about pasteurized milk or eggs, are those unhealthy too?

High sodium foods are a more debateable subject, but general medical consensus is that, outside of a specific risk group where high sodium diet can cause blood pressure/heart issue, relatively high sodium in the diet is not particularly unhealthy.I would rather see subreddits stay on par with what they are supposed to be.Veggie chips in the Sea salt flavor. Omg so good. And only 120 cals for 23 chips. It gets my craving out when I need a snack, and for days I'm really bad, a whole bag is under 400 cals. That with some salsa is my lunch sometimes. Hey thanks for the recipe! I'll definitely try that!

Can't really give an example of a recipe from the top of my head, sorry :( Well, actually one thing that is becoming a bit of a regular of mine is just simple pasta (any will do, really), and a mushroom sauce to go with that.  Just chop up some mushrooms, throw in some onion and cream and enough of something like a cheese spread to give it some taste. That I can whip up with out thinking! :)This makes me feel crazy lucky to live in Alaska. For our family of 4, we can have 55 salmon (red) per year for the cost of the fishing license - not that we ever bother with that many - we don't have the space. One fish can do 2 meals for all of us.

But Costco is probably your best bet for buying fish. I know I'm late to the party,  but this is an awesome idea! I'm going to use it this week!Hmm, I love tortillas / burritos what ever you call 'em and we tend to have them quite often, and that's probably the only food that I enjoy making. But mostly I defaulted to pizzas and burgers, really.  Can you get barra in the States? I'm super spoiled from when I lived in the Territory and I've never seen good barra out here.You could always import some of ours if you were willing to pay what would likely be very expensive delivery fees :pAhh, very nice then.  I wish that were the case in the states.  Pesticide and other chemical use is far too rampant here... even invading "organic" foods that should be free of such chemicals  =/Ah see, given that I'm in the EU (I'm Scottish), we're lucky to have some of the most stringent GMO laws in the world. Even so, I buy Scottish Rapeseed oil (http://www.scotrapeseedoil.co.uk/), so I know that it's as chemical free and as natural as I can get it without pressing it myself![Old article](http://smallbites.andybellatti.com/in-the-news-corrupted-virginity-2/) but still plenty relevant.  Basically, olive oil bottoms out at a certain price point.. beyond that level, it's usually a blend of cheaper oils with some genuine olive oil to bring its overall cost down.  Much like what subway does with their oil you can request.  It's a mix of a bunch of cheap oils.Yeah, rapeseed (canola) oil is quite popular in the states primarily because it is probably the 2nd cheapest cooking oil after soybean oil.

Im generally not a fan of it at all though, as I dont care for the genetic modifying of foods and the rampant use of pesticides in their production :pIn this particular case, I'm willing to take a little smoke to get some of the olive-oil flavor, which I actually find really pleasant for the preparation. In general, though, yeah, I'd recommend corn or canola for something getting this hot.At the grocery store, I can usually get swai filets for $2-$2.50 per pound and cod filets for $4 per pound on sale.

But my best kept secret (if it is one) is that there's a seafood supplier in my city that has dock sales once a month open to the public. I have gotten fat halibut steaks for $8 per pound and huge salmon sides whole for $5 each. It requires being there at 8 am on a Saturday but makes for a nice little trip. I tend to use Rapeseed almost exclusively (what Americans call Canola I think?), except when I'm making Chinese food and then it's generally groundnut oil and sesame oil for finishing off a dish/marinading. I do use Extra Virgin for some dishes that require it though!Yep, you are spot on here.  Olive oil really shouldnt be used for anything warmer than some light baking.  There are far more preferable oils that hold up to the heat and are just as healthy.

[This is a superb chart](https://eatingrules.com/Cooking-Oil-Comparison-Chart_02-22-12.pdf) that shows some of the better oils and which oils are good for what tasks.I've made this recipe before.  Definitely worth it.| Or, you know, they live in tornado alley between the two and no one is ever happy there

_

a strange way to talk about the place where most of this food *came from*.If you want a specific recommendation, Costco carries these [Bear and Wolf 6-pack cans](http://amzn.com/B003XP5ZEA) for I believe $13-14. I have them in my cupboard and they taste strikingly close to fresh salmon. No oil or even water, just straight salmon and salt.Ask around in any of the cooking subs, they're usually great at helping out beginners with basic recipes. I can toss ideas at you too. What types of restaurants/take out did you go to the most often? Meh. Extra virgin should really only be used in dressings and for dipping. It's a pretty poor cooking oil because it's chock full of flavour (so flavours what you cook with which most of the time is undesirable) and has a pretty low smoke point so ends up smoking up the joint if you're cooking on anything above medium heat. Even very high quality extra virgin will top out at about 375F, not desirable especially when cooking pizzas at &gt;380FI do something similar, except I use whole wheat pitas, no oil, and I bake them. I'm a vegetarian, so I usually load them with lots of veggies, and the pitas are thick enough that you can have a decent amount of toppings.Some people can't afford food, thus, low calories can mean death for them.I think /r/nutrition does 'healthy' pretty well without too much unnecessary debate. It can be defined!Can I suggest adding some mushrooms sauted in with the onions? Adds a lot of flavor and texture and is a good red meat substitute!Wow - I love most things but hate canned tuna fish. What you described sounds so good! I may have to give this a whirl sometime!How much space does an immersion circulator take up typically?Yeah, I was thinking that as well. Not saying he copied it either.

I've done Kenji's method and its outstanding. Better than frozen pizzas ;)Well, they tried to market it that way 15 years ago. I didn't really take.
It basically is just like a dorm.. How does it smell funky, shouldn't it smell like food?You typically would throw everything in before you leave for work. It requires no babysitting.Frozen fruits are a great addition- for example, Goya sells frozen passionfruit (I think concentrate) which is flavorful but still cheap! Just make sure the sugar levels aren't too insane.Would not recommend carp myselfWell...to that I'd just say read the sidebar. Healthy is pretty relative. Were all on drastically different diets. I'd also say instead of responding "well that's just unhealthy..." Post your own suggestions of making healthier. I already addressed the use of toppings to make this healthier, suggested corn tortilla for not only an easier cook but depending on what you're going for or what brand you get, can be a healthier option. All in all your infographic can give a decent quick idea but these values do vary widely brand to brand. Por ejemplo, wolfram alpha gives dead wrong values occasionally. My corn tortillas on their website say they have 0g fiber. In fact they actually have 3g of fiber and double calories. This is a severe discrepancy (especially for fiber). I will edit this to put the info graphic up but there. To add on, throw whatever healthier toppings you'd like on and its decently healthy. Packaged Pepperoni slices taste like ass anyway.


Edit: [Promised pic](http://i.imgur.com/AckYKUz.gif) I had the luxury of verifying the corn tortillas and pizza sauce due to having both in my fridge. Both values wrong, though the tortilla more so. The pizza sauce differs by near a gram of fiber and 6% vitamin A. Too nitpicky for ya? Well I like my data to be correct. I have also taken the luxury of correct the grossly overestimated olive oil. One tablespoon is what I would use to start panfrying chicken thighs , not brush a small tortilla. Now throw on top of this whatever veggies you'd like.

Is this going to be a food to eat nonstop for /r/eatcheapandhealthy? Nobody said so, but:

TL;DR


1. This post can certainly be healthier.
2. Diets *are* a balancing act...if you eat this one day compensate elsewhere to follow your diet, and drink more water to offset a sudden increase in sodium intake.
3. Relativity(**see sidebar**)- I personally am not worried about calories or fat ('cept trans).
4. Wolfram alpha isn't god (as much as I like to think so too). In a pinch it's good but issues from data being wrong at the core, it doesn't even have all the data to begin with.

Don't downplay this recipe as unhealthy without even a consideration for suggesting improvements or recognizing the fact that we are *all* on a different diet.Bachelor recipes sounds something I would really enjoy! Thanks for the thread! But the crock pot... why? Why would that be cool to "wait" for the dinner for that long? What am I missing :oHaha well I may have just made up the term. But basically they're recipes using shortcuts like premade spices or sauces. Also a lot of stuff in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2w74zn/is_there_a_guide_for_recipes_you_can_make_during/).

And crock pot is the same thing as slow cooker. Basically you dump in all your ingredients, turn it on, come back 6-8 hours later and you've got dinner.So what would you do differently to make it a healthier dish?So what would you do differently to make it a healthier dish?There is almost nothing you do to make this healthy. Ask your Mom to buy some spaghetti and sauce. i bet she would be more than happy to show you how to make it, it really is simple and tastes way better and is much better for you and most likely cheaper. I have read all the comments and I see a pattern

Instead of telling us why this recipe is bad, tell us what you would do differently to this to make this dish more healthy. Show your skills at providing support instead of discouraging others.

We have the chance to help more users by showing how they could do things better than telling one user that they are doing a specific recipe wrong.

Keep in mind that some of thr one-off ingredients might just be things that many home cooks have kept in stock in the pantry. When you first start cooking there is a bit of expense off the bat to build your spice and oil collection but then you learn when to use those things in other recipes. Do you have an example of a recipe you've made? Often times you can substitute in a recipe to make it work with ingredients leftover from your last dishes.


Here is a really good vegetarian recipe I use a lot. It's a really great jumping off point, once you've made it once you can start changing things up with the spices, veggies and ratios. Reading through the reviews on all recipes will teach you a lot. http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/85452/homemade-black-bean-veggie-burgers/Trader Joe's frozen cod is decently priced, IMHO.Hey that's actually a very cool idea - to focus on a style, never really thought about it.  I can't really differentiate between different food styles yet, so I guess I have to look into it a bit. How do I spot out the basic recipes out from the fancy ones and not step on a "land mine" then?I meant trout, not flounder. Whoops. I will admit that US raised farmed tilapia can be difficult to find, but I see it pretty regularly at my fish market. I absolutely believe that US farmed fish will be better quality than China and Vietnam.

Edit: snopes indicates that China farmed tilapia can be a poor idea, however generalizations about their industry cannot be made due to its size [link](http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/tilapia.asp) Yeah, you can find them there or if you have one of those big salad bar type things they have them in those. And our girlfriends' palpitate.you can try and make mackerel rice :)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dotsz4A94vATo keep the conversation going - what's a crock pot? Also - what's a slow cooker that I've heard about. I'll google around for the bachelor recipes - haven't heard the term before :)Huh, I've never seen pickled peppers before. Are they kept with the pickles at grocery stores?We do actually, and it really does help a lot with the pre-cooking part! Thanks for the suggestions of listening to music and having a drink! I'll have to try it out :)Plan your meals before you go to the grocery. Cooking doesn't have to be fun. I didn't enjoy it for the first few years, but once I started making tasty things and got better it became a kind of relaxing experience.

Check out crock pot recipes or bachelor recipes. Make too much and eat leftovers later. I only cook twice a week and just reheat leftovers for lunch and dinner most days.There are a couple websites and apps you can use to find recipes based on the ingredients in your kitchen. I'd probably start there because it's a good way to start to 'see' what you can make from whatever's around.

It's also good to learn to make one or two things at the beginning rather than picking a new recipe every time you want to cook. Cooking is a learned skill and takes practice - you're better off (and hopefully happier) figuring out how to make one delicious thing and later transferring what you've learned to a new dish.You know, even if you said it as a joke, we actually do more often than not :D Wont make the cooking too much simpler though, even if a bit more rewarding ;)Oh yes, and indeed a salad -_- my badTalapia is also great when you cook it in garlic and jolokia then mix it in with rice.No I believe nicoise salad involves hard boiled eggs. Hm you know I think I'm actually going to follow that recipe instead. I'm going to use parsley instead of green onion because I'm going to need parsley when I make falafels and whole wheat bread crumbs instead of panko to work with what I've already got in my pantry. Thanks for sharing :)

Edit: update. Made them tonight and they're awesome!If you have a Costco membership, or know someone who does, you can get a 3lb bag of wild Alaskan salmon burgers (roughly 12 patties I think) for $14. I saute it with coconut oil and tomatoes. Mmmmmm, I'm getting hungry thinking about it.I'd say pick a style of food that you like, American, French, Mexican, Thai, Indian, whatever, as long as you like it enough to eat a lot of it. Find a few basic recipes for that style of food, simple recipes though. A lot of blogs and books go in for fancy and complicated cooking and that will just drive you up the wall.

For Thai food, get yourself rice, a few types of curry paste, some coconut milk, meat and veggies. If you have three types of curry paste, you can make three different curries by chucking paste, coconut milk, and whatever meat and veg you have on hand into the pot.

As you get bored, find another recipe to toss into the mix. Say coconut soup. You already have the milk, you'll only need a couple of new things to make it. Branch out little by little, one recipe at a time, and you'll soon find yourself with all the ingredients without having had to go on a major shopping spree. You'll also start learning how to throw things together in that style of cooking.

Once you feel confident, pick another style of food and start over. You don't have to master any of them, just get to learn the basics and you'll feel like a cooking rock star soon enough.This is almost entirely untrue - the one correct thing is that it is a freshwater fish from Africa. The majority of tilapia farming occurs in Asia. It's not being marketed as a trendy delicacy in any way, shape or form - it is an incredibly cheap and easy fish to farm, so the supply has exploded. Tilapia is almost never marketed as high end.

The only reason it tastes awful is because of the conditions it is grown in and what it is fed in poorly regulated farms in China.

If you purchase tilapia farm-raised in the United States, it will be fresher, healthier, and taste much better as well as still being in the price range of OP. This is something my diet falls under. My grocery shop consists of lots of chicken breast , Turkey mince, canned tuna, eggs, rice, milk and spices! You need to make sure youre adding flavour to your foods or you'll get sick of them quickly I fry it in a pan with lemon juice and dill and it usually comes out pretty tasty.Its really hard to say; You can't really improve on this stuff. But you can Dilute it.

Try getting a can of crushed tomatoes and a small can of tomato paste; mix them together into a pot, then put the Chef in there too. You might have to experiment with the proportions, but you'll probably improve on it, even just a little. I have never had any so its hard to say exactly what it would turn out as.Sounds crazy, will look it up!

Been buying this oil for the last 8 months or so. It has been hard to go back to anything else and Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a must have at home. These threads always turn into "but stuff is way more expensive where I live!" OP isn't going to be able to adjust pricing for every location in the world. If you can't find this stuff cheap, just adjust accordingly. OP went through a lot of effort to compile this list and shouldn't be dismissed just because they don't live near you.Reminds me of [this](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/cast-iron-skillet-tortilla-pizza-bar-pie-food-lab.html) posted to another food reddit late last year.D'oh!

So, I actually do cook this in my oven (which is great for simultaneously hitting the tortilla from the bottom with the blazing hot pan and from the sides/top with the air in the oven itself), but there's no reason you couldn't replicate that with a skillet on medium to medium-high heat and a lid to contain some of the heat and steam-melt the cheese on top. Only thing is that the pepperonis themselves might not get quite as crispy that way.

Best of luck :)Honestly it's amazing. If I can't be sure anyone is gonna sell me legitimate, un-tainted, true Italian olive oil thanks to the organized crime involvement in that market (seriously, Google that--it's crazy), I figure I'll go for highly rated California stock instead!Unless they get caught in your throat!&gt;.&gt;

Mine *did* eat a pack of ramen noodles as lunch yesterday. Just straight out of the back. Crunch crunch crunch. My heart weeps :(Have sex after cooking each meal :)Haha, thanks :)The problem is cans and pouches tend to have a shitload of sodium, try to buy the low-sodium if you can.:Shrugs:

I think people are just grumpy because they're either all snowed in (Eastern Seaboard) or living sad lives bereft of snow (Western Coast). Or, you know, they live in tornado alley between the two and no one is ever happy there.

I wish you the best of luck in adapting this to your family's needs. It's very versatile, so I think you'll have a lot of luck!I see what you are saying, just wanted to clarify that the front page is now filled with other healthy recipes and links and great discussions...and not just hot dogs, tortilla pizzas and a discussion on how to make Chef Boy-r-Dee better and healthier. Your comment used explicit language that I wanted to clarify. No offense was taken by me.Yeah. To me it just tastes like nothing. Though really I don't think it's as bad as the person above you suggested. It could be a delicacy if you prep it right :)The point of using whole chickens is that you don't need to make your own stock, but it definitely adds time, if not complexity. Would save a few $$ as well.Did I say that there wasn't other stuff?

This post is at the very top with HORMEL PEPPERONI and processed everything else. The community seems to have spoken.

I am speaking about those posts specifically and the mentality of the sub. The sub's name is definitely misleading if people are defending this recipe.

I am not even saying I wouldn't eat it. Just that I came here looking for different food ideas - not this. Did you see any other posts? Anything else at all? [Here's Wolfram Alpha's nutrition information for one serving (I assumed 1 tbsp Parmesan).](http://i.imgur.com/3q29MXd.gif) That's about a quarter of your daily calories, a quarter of your daily cholesterol, half your daily fat, over half your daily sodium. Yes, it's possible to integrate this dish into a healthy diet, but it is *not* a healthy dish. Especially not if you end up eating more than one.

I wouldn't question it for a second in /r/budgetfood, but I just don't think a dish like this is appropriate for /r/eatcheapandhealthy./u/justanotherguy99999, your submission has been removed from /r/EatCheapAndHealthy due to following reason(s):

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEatCheapAndHealthy)I don't have a working oven, so this idea is genius! I'd sub the oil for non-stick spray and sub pepperoni for something like spinach, but I wouldn't have thought to just cook a faux pizza on my stove! Awesome idea.try to plan, shop, and cook your meals together with your girl friend. Make it fun instead of a chore. I also like to listen to music when I cook. drinking helps too. :)
also, it's possible that you'll never enjoy it. No big deal, not everyone does.Best olive oil. Is this the type of think i could make, freeze and reheat via microwave? Mine is the same way, so I know what you mean. She'd be content with eating two packs of ramen for dinner... Oi.&gt; What's unhealthy about pizza?

While pizza can be somewhat healthy, this one in particular is not. &gt; The term "healthy" is such a vague term

No, it isn't. There is a line and it can be blurred, but easily crossed.

The front page today has this post, hotdogs, and chef boyardee. What is this sub supposed to be, exactly? I mean, /r/frugal basically has these same exact recipes.  I've made this before but it never turned out great. You have perfected it though! I'll try this next instead of my typical English muffin pizzas.

 Also, your directions (especially the "Id say don't try this at home but the people at Sears would be freaked out" bit) hilarious.
Nicely done!I've recently heard (npr maybe?) that Cod is similar in health benefits to salmon.  If you are in the midwest, you can fish for (or probably buy cheaply) asian carp.  It is an invasive species in the US, and isn't actually a carp in the normal sense.  It is an algae eater and supposed to be a very clean fish.  They will also just jump right in your boat if your lucky.  :)  Seriously. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfG4vsJ5_xI  Can't get any cheaper than that.  I agree about chunky onions. And the dish looks delicious. I will probably try it this weekend.even more confusing is who would need this "recipe" to melt cheese and sauce on a tortilla Well, I have never thought of doing something like this. As a mom with little free time to prepare lunch, this is a great idea. I see no reason why I couldn't adapt the basic concept to be more healthy for my specific needs. I guess the only way to make people happy in this subreddit is to poach a chicken breast and take a picture. Not a problem. And if you do try this recipe, I cut up my onions smaller, I really don't like chunks that big. Infants are different than children. You might not give honey to a 3 month old but you certainly wouldn't have a problem giving it to a 6 year old.A bag of green beans is $2 at Trader Joes.This is great! I have so many cans of chickpeas lying around, going to make these tonight!You've got to be kidding.

Healthy = low caloric density + high nutrients.Stale bread also makes great breadcrumbs! Toss them in the blender or food processor with some seasoning. It's a great use for the ends, as well. Food banks still give out cans a year or two past expiration because it's completely safe (assuming the can isn't dented or bulging) and to reject them would be a huge waste of food. No hard feelings, and agreed in general. As I mentioned elsewhere here, this was made for my gf, who's a little less invested in healthy eating than I am. At 550cal, it's not an unreasonable amount of calories to fill up on for a meal, but you could definitely improve its nutritional profile with those changes, and I encourage anyone reading looking to do so to follow your advice :)"reveals". As if it was a big secret that *food has calories*, and larger portions of food have larger amounts of calories! :PUnderstood!I realize people have brought this up already and I'm not trying to bash your food, but that's not healthy. Not only is it full of processed foods that you could have made yourself (for cheaper), it's almost entirely free of any sort of beneficial nutrition. It will fill you up, but that's about it.


I would improve on this by making the sauce from scratch (a can of tomato sauce is less than a dollar, and you can add whatever seasonings you like), buying whole wheat tortillas (Trader Joe's tortillas are $2 and have far less preservatives), using turkey pepperoni, and using that extra savings to add veggies like spinach and mushrooms.


At any rate, we're all here for the same thing, so I hope you take this with a grain of salt and thanks for the submission!You could make a baked casserole out of it.  Lay in a pan, spread cheese on top, bake at 400 20 minutes.

Normally how I jazz up spaghetti is chop onions and bell peppers, saute in olive oil (or whatever you have for oil or butter). When they are tender, add a minced clove of garlic for less than a minute so it doesn't get too brown, then add a can of Hunts spaghetti sauce or a jar of any marinara sauce, sauteed ground beef (drained) if you have it.  Cook 10-15 minutes.    Serve over hot cooked spaghetti or penne.

So I don't know if you could modify that to jazz up your stuff, you would probably have to get the peppers and onions super soft since the CBOD is so soft.
If you think that a 1 lb burrito doesn't have at least 1,000 calories in it, then I've got a bridge to sell you.

I regularly go for the salad bowl - lettuce, fajita veggies, chicken, sour cream, cheese and salsa - and it's ~400 calories.

I miss the days that I used to go for lunch when I was in college and down two whole burritos, though.  Damn. geniousYou know, the breakfast variant kinda reminds me of some of the breakfast foods I see in Indian cooking, where whole-wheat- or rice-and-lentil-based-flatbreads are cooked on top of (or even folded over) a scrambled egg and veggies/cheese. The less healthy variant, a kati/karthi roll, is cooked in tons of oil and stuffed with meat-and-veggie kebabs, and is a super-popular street food, but stuff like an [egg-and-veggie dosa](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6jKISvBrcro/Uy3_33_iCII/AAAAAAAADGA/6IomyDR8Ouc/s1600/Vegetable+egg+dosa.jpg) are really awesome!mackerel..
fresh, cheap, (a bit fatty), some people hate the taste, but you can cook it many ways (japanese way is nice ....
http://www.japanesecooking101.com/saba-shioyaki-recipe-grilled-mackerel/ )

trout...i love "truite meunire" (dusted in flour, and fried in butter, sprinkle some fresh parsley, a dash of lemon juice, and add some potatoes...)

edit : you can make a sole meunire too, but it's waaaay more expensive :/I make this for lunch pretty often, just a little different. I use a light Flatout wrap for the "crust" and spray it with cooking spray instead of olive oil like you mentioned, put it in the oven at 400 for 5 minutes, and then top with everything and pop it back in for 10 minutes more. I also use reduced sodium pepperoni. Sometimes I'll have it for breakfast, instead of pepperoni I use bacon and and crack a couple of eggs on it which I highly recommend. Feta goes really well with it too. :Shrugs:

And people downvote substantive, useful opinions that they disagree with, despite all the Rediquitte in the world saying otherwise. Sometimes that sorta thing just happens, and you gotta roll with it. Thanks for sticking up for the post, though!If you get some Italian seasoning, add a but of pepper and possibly Salk to some regular tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes and cook that up while cooking your pasta, it's cheap and tastes good. I'm not saying that, in a moment of weakness, I once made one of these with *two* tortillas and a thick layer of full-fat shredded sharp cheddar between them, then normal pizza stuff on top, calling it a "Stuffed Crust Quezzatilla." Nope, not saying that at all.Good luck finding tilapia raised in the USA. And Flounder is wild-caught. Do you really think US farm - raised seafood is higher quality than China and Vietnam?Yeah. For me (mentioned upthread this was for my gf, who's about half my size and thus a little less concerned about counting calories than me!), this would really go great with some sliced veggies, maybe on a wheat tortilla, or with a different kind of base, like pesto or similar.

Pizza's hardly the only food to deliver healthier items atop a bed of largely empty carbs, but no disrespect for anyone who wouldn't want to include this particular recipe in their diet :)Exactly. That's what I thought. But that's not what happens. People are so judgmental around here sometimes. Things aren't healthy enough, portions are too small, ingredients are too expensive. It gets tiring.Also known as Swai. I agree, it's a mild, light texture fish that you can season however you want and doesn't really have a fishy taste -- and cheaper than tilapiaDirect links are not allowed here. High caloric density in combination with little to no nutritional value in any of the ingredients.

The pepperoni, the cheese, the empty carbs in the tortilla, the oil...Fold it over and you're working with a pizzadilla!The sidebar basically says we each have our own needs and situations and that what's affordable or healthy for one person may be completely infeasible for someone else. We should all strive to keep that in mind and be supportive, offer good advice, and most of all, to contribute content we think is valuable rather than tear down what we find disagreeable. That's the path to a great community, I think :-) The term "healthy" is such a vague term and it's all relative. Some people who have gone from eating processed food every day may consider tortilla pizza a healthy alternative to pizza from pizza hut. To them it is healthy. As far as I know, this subreddit doesn't have an exact definition of what healthy actually is. I could be wrong. Yeah, and let's make sure to make our new subreddit budget-conscious... let's call it something like /r/EatCheapAndHealthy, or something, I dunno, I'm just spitballing here.So... why didn't you just link to the recipe?Used to eat these all the time.  They're not particularly *unhealthy* but they're also not healthy.
But they cheap.  Don't just freeze your liquids flat! Freeze your hamburger flat as well! When you buy it in bulk you need to divide it into meal by meal packages before you store it in the freezer. So what we do is measure out 1 lb servings and put it into medium sized freezer bags. We then make sure that we squeeze all the air out of the bag (ofc) and flatten the bag as much as possible. Then you can easily stack your hamburger in the corner.

Another handy trick is to use plastic grocery bags or cardboard boxes to divide you freezer up by item type making it easier to sort through later. It's much easier to find ham or chicken when they are all kept together in the same box/bag.This is a nice article but I think it's unfair to throw Chipotle under the bus because of an individual's bad eating habits. It should illustrate more how people make terrible choices under the illusion of health. Like you remove the cheese, sour cream, and guacamole and you're at half of the calories with a meal that will fill you up all the same (and probably have you feeling better and less sluggish than you would with all the cheese and sour cream). 560 calories for a chicken burrito bowl with rice, beans, and corn salsa isn't that bad at all. Drop the rice and make it a salad and now you're at 400. Guacamole is delicious but it's like $2 there and you could pick up an avocado and dice it up for your burrito bowl if you're REALLY craving that (ECAH, I figured their guac isnt really adding much in the "healthy" aspect for $2 so I leaned towards the "cheap" aspect)

Chipotle has a lot of options to eat healthy that most restaurants don't have. In before "hail corporate" but I think Chipotle is a stand up restaurant with lots of options for people eating better. The problem isnt them, it's the consumer not being properly educated and this article doesn't exactly help properly educate.Then start your own subreddit that is /r/cleaneating or something. Somewhere that does not allow any processed food, sugar, salt etc. Whatever you want.

Edit: apparently /r/cleaneating is already taken. The point is, if you're unhappy about the content on here then start a new subreddit. It's just so perfect for most things and I think it's zero calories too.I see. Thanks for letting me know. It's marketed as a delicacy? I thought it was a budget fish. Like, I need protein but I'm almost broke kindof fish.I mix it with some dijon mustard too.
If you like a nice chai flavor: one banana, 1/4 cup oats, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, milk of your choice. Peanut butter and cacao nibs are nice to add, too.Every time something like this is posted, there's this huge debate over what is considered healthy. I've given up trying to explain that although they may be part of a "balanced" diet, processed, canned, high-sodium foods do not belong in a subreddit for "healthy" foodYeah you can do that by using premade stock, but I find that whole chickens dont fall apart as easily in under 2 hours. Maybe if it was broken down first.tilapia is the cheapest because its a garbage freshwater fish from Africa that is being marketed as a trendy delicacy as a way to provide an economic boost to African regions that need it. which is a good idea.

it tastes awful though. and physically makes me ill when I eat it. Maybe im allergic to it? friends and family don't like the taste either though.

so what im saying is try a small filet before you buy the 20kg box, to see if you like it.I actually used to do these with high-fiber tortillas (which have very low levels of digestible carbs, so they tend to be super low-cal, relative to their size), but they develop a *very* bitter flavor when burnt even a little, so I've settled for flour tortillas for this. Particularly since this batch was made for my girlfriend who prefers 'em that way, anyway :)That's what I thought. I usually put a lot of veggies on mine and they're damn delicious. If you don't drain it in litres of cheese it should be fine.Tortillas aren't healthy, just empty carbs. And neither is the heavily processed pepporoni. Tomato sauce could go either way depending on what is used.Tilapia and catfish are pretty nicely priced around me.I am not sure if it is cheap but farm raised Catfish is one of the most sustainable fish you can buy. There is a good eats episode on Netflix right now on cooking cat fish (with an emphasis on not frying).Fish in the pouches is better than canned.

Alton Brown explains it in his "Good Eats" episode (available on netflix) on tuna. IIRC, canned fish is slightly overcooked compared to the stuff in the pouch.Looks delicious! Canned tuna in water. There's a hundred ways to prepare it and it's $.60 a can in most places. You can also get 8-10lb bags of frozen tilapia for less than $10 at Sams Club/Costco. Hot dogs are sausages, and Germans love sausages. Braise cabbage, apples, and onions together along with the dogs. Both items get flavored, onion infused dogs are better.

This recipe uses wine, but you can mix the ingredients up infinite ways. Beer works too, and apple juice is good, especially with brats and lots apples.

http://andrewzimmern.com/2012/10/09/beer-garden-style-red-cabbage-and-sausage/Baramundi is delicious, too.What's unhealthy about pizza? Its not like this is deep dish, stuffed crust, you need a bypass when done eating... This is not an unhealthy meal. It can made more healthy with better toppings but hey....we all know its nice to have a splurge. I do this same thing with homemade pitas on occasions.

However I did notice some burning as flour tortillas so often do. Use a corn tortilla. Its smaller in size and does not tend to burn as easily as flour, and a slight edge (depending on what you're looking for) on the healthy scale.Is that a Salad nicoise?Add a little Italian seasoning, some granulated garlic (salt free) and some Parmesan cheese if you have it. Sometimes I'll add a little hot sauce as well. I just open the can and crumble it on top of a salad. Add in seeds or something for crunch. Always good. I dub thee, the Tortizza.  You're welcome.Chest freezers offer a lot of space and are pretty cheap too. My parents actually had *two* at one point.Yes! And scallions can regrow from scraps! Easy to leave in a small jar to let them regrow. I'm one of the lucky ones in manhattan with roof space so I can pot and grow a few things, but the parsley has come quite handy!looks delicious I'm going to give it a go.If you use frozen bananas and strawberries you wont need ice :)Honestly, we had to get a small freezer that we keep in our basement. Chest freezers are the best ever:

https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=chest+freezer&amp;tbm=shop

It's an investment, but it's seriously made our lives easier. It's stressful trying to cram everything into the fridge freezer!I agree!  Good stuff.  I'm a huge fan of canned fish.  I eat it nearly every day for lunch and sometimes breakast.  My go-to meal is mashed avocado, tuna or mackeral or sardines, plus spicy mustard or pesto with a spinach salad.  I make salmon patties from canned salmon once a week. I buy frozen sockeye from TJ once a week.

That being said, I splurge on Norwegian salmon from WF once a week.     eat cheap and *healthy*?Made this for dinner last night ... thanks for the idea!We always had them as salmon patios since my brother couldn't say patty when he was little!Alaskan pollock fillets are usually pretty cheap frozen, too. My mom used to get it for a dollar a pound when we were kids, lay the fillets in a glass baking dish, sprinkle with season salt and/or lemon pepper, put enough water in the pan to just barely cover the fish, and bake it at 350 for an hour. It was great, and she usually served Mac n cheese with it. Pollock is a very mild fish, too. I love that it didn't have a strong fishy taste to it at all.Yes, one big one to look out for is Tilapia- most of the farms are really bad and there is apparently a lot of crap besides the good stuff of fish going into your body (ive tried and stayed away from tilapia). Costco has other fish like flounder quite reasonable in their frozen section.Yes they add a nice crunch to the texture and are a good source of calcium. I consider frozen whole sardines to be the optimization point for price, health, and environmental concerns. You can't find them everywhere, so you might need to shop around.As a catholic, trying to find cheap fish and chips on this Ash Wednesday is a real chore. It's almost impossible to get anything under $15.
I was never happy with mine, always ended up with bland, dry meat.  Anytime i added spices/sauces/marinades it just made it burn.Definitely making this next pay day!! Thanks for this :)My favorite thing about them was the time savings, cooking both sides at the same time. Good for quick meals with minimal effort.Not many. I live on the Oregon coast and can't afford it ironically. Wild canned salmon makes for decent salmon pattiesForeman grills are meh at best.  You will get much better mileage out of a slow cooker.  Not saying you shouldn't buy both, but if money is tight, you can get a slowcooker at a second hand store really cheap.Only suggestion is to smoke weed first.

I am sorry.  I am only joking and now I am alone laughing in my office thinking of my teenage years. I was in the meat section and saw Swai for around $2.40 a lb.  I picked it up to try it, and it's not bad at all.  A little digging around the internet and it's a sort of vietnamese catfish/shark that is farm grown.  It's packed with protein and also kind of fatty(couldn't find a source that said it specifically had Omega-3, but lots that stated that Omega-3's are common in fish fats).  It's not very fishy tasting at all, a little sweet.

I had done the canned salmon and other fish but they just come out the can so briny and fishy it overpowered most of what I tried to put it in(just crockpot recipes).  Swai seems to be a good, "fresh" alternative for a cheap fish.We got 5 lbs. of mahi there the other night for $17. &gt;  Or just go to the river and catch a fish

I sustained myself for a while when I was broke by doing this. I was lucky and had the bounty of the Chesapeake Bay to draw from.

At work everyone knew I was broke and finally one day someone called me on it. He said "You always say you have no money but you eat like a king everyday. How can you afford all the seafood you eat?".

I looked at him and said "I just go catch it on the weekends". You could literally see the "Duh, why didn't I think of that" look on his face.**Ingredients**

1 russet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes

Kosher salt

8 small skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 1/4 pounds)

1 heaping tablespoon dried oregano

Freshly ground pepper

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 medium onion, cut into 1-inch pieces

1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
6 cloves garlic, smashed

4 to 6 pickled cherry peppers, seeded and sliced, plus 1/3 cup brine

1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley

**Directions**


Preheat the broiler. Put the potato in a medium saucepan, cover with water and add 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until just tender, about 8 minutes. Drain well.

Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry and sprinkle with the oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate.

Add the potato to the skillet and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook until slightly soft, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium; add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the garlic and cook 2 minutes. Add the cherry peppers and brine and cook, scraping up the pan with a wooden spoon, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat.

Return the chicken to the skillet and sprinkle with the parsley. Toss with tongs, then set the chicken skin-side up on top of the vegetables. Broil until the skin is crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.

[Recipe Courtesy of the Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/broiled-chicken-with-peppers-recipe.html#lightbox-recipe-image)I use canned salmon to make salmon patties/burgers. Take the canned salmon, remove skin and bones. Add veggies (I usually use carrots, celery, and onion). Add some spices/herbs (some lemon pepper, cajun seasoning, just salt and pepper, I usually add a little Worcestershire as well), add an egg and bread crumbs as binders. Add a little oil to a pan and make it like a yummy burger. Cheap and delicious.This looks interesting and tasty.  Think I'll give it a try this evening, thanks.##Quick-n-Easy Tortilla Pizza

Let's face it: at heart, we all love pizza. It makes us feel like a kid again, and it's just so darned good! Now sure, it's not exactly the healthiest meal in the world, but this awesome recipe makes a single serving that is a great meal. It clocks in at a bit over **550 calories** (with **25g protein**--but also a fair quantity of carbs and fat) and is ready in 10 minutes flat with easy, cheap ingredients. We can't make sous vide steaks and hasselback potatoes *every* night, after all :)

This pizza's crispy, crunchy, and extremely tasty, so give it a shot!

-----

###Ingredients
* 1 Flour Tortilla (Burrito-sized, ~10") - **$2.50 per 8**
* ~1 - 2 tsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil - **6.00/bottle, using a tiny amount**
* Pinch each of Salt and Pepper - **$1.00 for a 2-pack, using a tiny amount**
* 3 tbsp Pizza Sauce (Homemade might be better, but Ragu's faster!) - **$2.00/ Jar, makes ~8 pizzas**
* Seasonings (e.g., 1/8 tsp each Garlic Powder, Red Pepper Flakes, &amp; Oregano) - **~$2.00 each, using tiny amount**
* ~1/4 cup Finely/Fancy Shredded Part-Skim Mozzarella Cheese - **$2.50/bag; each makes 8 pizzas**
* 10-12 Pepperonis - **2.00/Bag; makes ~6-8 pizzas**
* *(Optional)* 1 - 2 tbsp Shredded Fake Parmesan - **$2.50/shaker, makes ~30 pizzas?**

**Total Cost to Start from Scratch with an Empty Kitchen**: $20.50 - $24.50, depending on quantity of seasonings purchased

***Actual Cost per Pizza***: ~$1.30

-----

###Directions
Pre-heat your oven to 550F (or however high it goes, if less than that). Leave a cast iron skillet/pizza stone/sturdy baking tray in the oven to heat up alongside it--we want our cooking surface to be piping hot!

Apply a small amount of olive oil to both sides of your tortilla and rub it all over with your fingertips. Focus particularly on the edges on the "top" of the pizza to help them crisp up while baking. Season the top lightly with salt and pepper--I'm using well under 1/8 tsp each.

Spoon on a few tablespoons of pizza sauce and spread it in a thin, even layer across the bulk of the pizza. You don't want any big gloopy pools of it; they'll make the whole pizza soggy and fragile. If you are using any extra seasonings, sprinkle them on very lightly on top of the sauce. A few tiny shakes of garlic powder, red chili flakes, and oregano should do it, but whatever you like is fine!

Sprinkle on a light, even coat of shredded mozzarella and then place your pepperonis on top of that. If you're using shredded/grated parmesan, sprinkle that on top of everything else.

Once your oven hits 550F, **carefully** remove the skillet/stone/tray and quickly pop your pizza onto it. Toss it back in the oven and bake for 2.5 minutes, keeping a careful eye on it. For instance, my oven has a hot spot in the back, so even 2:30 is enough to make one edge noticeably darker than the other.

Once it's done, remove the pizza from the cooking implement quickly, slice, and serve hot!

Want to go a little healthier? Try it with thinly sliced bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms instead of the pepperoni, or at least sub out regular pepperonis for mini ones or even turkey pepperoni. You could easily replace the olive oil with a quick 1/2 second spritz of spray-can oil to get an even, light coat, too!1 handful Kale

Maybe rosemary.Sounds similar to one of my favorites, [Tuna Croquettes](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/tuna-croquette-recipe.html) from Alton Brown.banana+peanut butter.Can you not open it in your browser? s it is, your recipe only uses 1/3 of the ingredients and has been removed from the thread. You can repost using all the ingredients. Use frozen spinach. The water from them makes it a little more saucy, saving money from using more olive oil. However, the tomato flavor from the oil is really really good.I posted it from my phone using an app. There is no edit function via this phone.thanks for replying! I pretty much only buy things on sale, and plan my shopping trips around different store sales. I want to start making my own soup, just haven't gotten there yet. Thank you! And yeah, it isn't always doable to grow your own food, but I find it's very easy to do even if you have limited space. I tend to fail my salads and herbs for some reasons, but I managed to grow tomatoes and potatoes with only a small balcony to put pots on. It's just a matter of what you're willing to do and try :3 You can safely eat the bones in canned salmon. They also have boneless canned salmon. So this made 6 300 calorie servings (about 1.5 cups each). You could reduce the amount of meat to drastically decrease the price, or add noodles to increase the volume of calories. This is definitely healthier than canned soup - less sodium, fewer preservatives, more protein. I personally think it's tastier as well. For perspective, a 200 calorie can of Progresso chicken noodle soup where I live costs $2.00, and has 1500 mg of sodium per can. This soup recipe has about half as much.

$3.50 1 lb chicken thigh

$1.00 egg noodles

$1.00 onion

$.50 celery and carrots

$3.00 pre-made stock

So this recipe would be about $1.50 per 300 calorie serving, or $.50 per 100 calories. This makes it half the price of Progresso soup where I live. Since you have access to very cheap soup, it's about on-par as far as cost goes, but still has less protein and more salt.
1.  Oats, milk, frozen banana, protein powder

2.  Strawberries, protein powder, milkHonestly, I like the Hunt's a lot. There are varieties. You can always add spice, meat (ground turkey works well)... I have a friend who makes vats of sauce, and he includes some italian sausage, some pork chops, a little pepperoni... whatever meat is cheap.Why no one is talking about pangasius?

Very cheap and easy to find. Best place to buy fishes are Asian market.  They always have great deals[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2mpig1/5_minute_healthy_strawberry_frozen_yogurt_use_any/) is a recipe for frozen yogurt that I tried a while back. If you substitute milk for the yogurt it makes a really nice smoothie.The only thing that's simpler is that you don't precook anything before tossing it all in. The point for me of doing that was to lower the cook time from 6+ hours to less than 2.Banana, pb, strawberry, milk, ice.I have a small pressure cooker, dried beans with onions and rice takes 30min from start to finish.

Pressure cookers should bring in the arsenal of everyone in this subLike a fine wine. I wonder what it tastes like.Ok what if i want a great pasta sauce? There are so damn many types. I just want some real good stuff for my spaghetti &amp; meatballs and sauce is always the most important part of the processwhat was your approximate cost for this soup? either overall or per serving? you can even exclude spices, since I have most of those. I'm curious because I consider canned soup a pretty cheap and fairly healthy meal already. I bought progresso when it was on sale for $1/can, and get one lunch out of it, or two if I have something else with it. and I think most of their soups are 100-200 calories per serving (so still under 400 for the can). Don't forget sardines.It does reduce a little (my dietician said 3 good soak rinses will drop it about 25%) but it's much better to get the no-salt beans in the first place. If you are stepping down and using up what is in the pantry and don't have the unsalted though, it is better than no beans.Have you seen the Budget Bytes how to make and freeze dried beans? That is an awesome tutorial! http://www.budgetbytes.com/2010/12/how-to-kick-the-can-of-beans/We used to make something similar called "salmon fritters" though the first time we had to pick bones out of our canned salmon we just poached our own.

I currently replace all pasta with squash and all bread with spinach or cauliflowerTo piggyback, Hunt's pasta sauce (in a can) is fairly cheap and has the least sugar of all the brands. Tasty, too!

Ingredients:
1 can of baked beans
1 Onion - peeled and chopped
Vegetables of your choice - I like peas and tomatoes
Carb of your choice - rice, instant noodles, pasta
Protein of your choice - canned tuna's my personal fave
1 tablespoon of peanut butter (optional)

Directions:
1. Using a pan or a pot, coat the bottom with oil and  start cooking the onion on medium heat till its soft and slightly transparent.
2.  Add tuna with its water, peanut butter, baked beans and vegetables
3.  Let it simmer till the vegetables are cook or till the sauce reaches the consistency you like.
4. Ladle it over your noodles/rice/pasta!

If you are not using canned tuna, it might be a little bit dry so you can either add some water or vinegar, depending on your preference. Water will definitely make the sauce blander though.
I skip the bun, and treat hot dogs like smoked sausage. Mix them up with peppers and onions, throw them into some rice and mire poix. As long as you are buying decently produced hot dogs, there's no reason they can't be healthy. While I agree entirely that using dried beans is absolutely the best from a flavor standpoint, this is a "quick" recipe. Using dried beans in this recipe would add a significant amount of time, taking it almost two hours worth of cooking to make, compared to the 20 minutes or so it would appear to take here.  My recipe is a bit simpler. Throw a whole chicken in a large pot with water and soup starter veggies from Trader Joes and a bay leaf. Simmer for 4-6 hours. Pour stock into a bowl and set aside. Pull chicken out and separate from bones. Throw out veggies and bay leaf. Cut up 6+ carrots, one onion, 2-3 stalks celery, and parsley (optional). Throw them in the pot with the stock and celery. Bring to boil, add noodles, and boil til noodles are done. If you are going to buy farmed fish, try and find tilapia, catfish, or ~~flounder~~ trout raised in the USA. Farmed fish elsewhere is often not exactly something I would want to consume on a regular basis. That's just my opinion.You may want to look into an immersion circulator. Check out /r/sousvide. While a bit expensive to get into, you can cook anything with them, and there's no worries about fire. The only issue is that you'll need some sort of way to sear the meat at the end, and with the no hot plates rule, that could be an issue. You could use a broiler setting for a toaster oven. There are also microwaveable stones you can heat up and then sear on those.That's happened to me before. You got for leftovers and they've turned into Chicken noodle casserole.I'd like to help answer your question, but I don't understand - what are you asking here? Wal-MartThere is nothing you can do to make that taste good. Chef Boyardee is bland and sweet. It is specifically made for and marketed to children.

It is packed with massive amounts of sugar to make it more appealing to them.

The solution here isn't to add stuff to it, it's to stop eating that crap entirely and start eating real food.

If you want spaghetti, get a box of dry noodles from the store, boil for eight minutes and add sauce from a jar. Still very simple but much better taste. I haven't tried it yet myself, but I'm going to one of these days. I found a recipe posted here that called for a can of tuna (drained), an egg, a tbsp of dijon mustard, dried dill, salt and pepper to taste and a tbsp of flour. You mix up all the ingredients, heat up a non-stick skillet with a bit of oil and fry up little balls of the tuna mixture to make tuna cakes. Serve alongside a bed of mix greens and you're good to go. Avocado, rotisserie chicken, quinoa, shallot... Are you sure you weren't looking for /r/eathealthy? This recipe looks great and in fact I'm saving it for later use but it's far from cheap. It's not even my sub, but here I am feeling like a proud mother!&gt;Redditor posts pic of Wal-Mart produce to /r/eatcheapandhealthy for that farm friendly knee-jerk karma and proceeds to get his salad tossed in upvotes

Well played OP, well played. Subbed!This is great, thanks for sharing!&gt;You were all also very concerned about how I drank cold drinks.

Curse you for making me laugh in the library. And congrats on taking some steps. Good luck going forward. I know I just don't make pasta on the stove, instead I use one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/Pasta-More-Microwave-Cooker-Cookbook/dp/B0017VIO36/ref=sr_1_6?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427993568&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=microwave+pasta) and take advantage of my poor microwave. You found me! :PThe reason your meatballs weren't very good is because you need to add breadcrumbs and egg to it. That's what gives you the meatball consistency. No biggie if you don't know that, cooking is always a learning experience.

If you're an absolute beginner, learning how to cook (which you are claiming to be) watch youtube videos on cooking. Food Wishes is great, has a TON of recipes, and he gives you a lot of tips on how to make food.

Always remember to use salt and pepper, and taste your food while you cook it. The easiest way to make your food taste better is to taste while you're cooking and get an idea of where it's seasoned.

There's no shame in looking up recipes, and trying them. There's a reason recipes are so eagerly traded between chefs, and so prized when someone doesn't want to share a loved recipe.

Like all things you're not going to be a great cook until you work at it. Simple dishes like spaghetti and meatballs are simple, but that doesn't mean that everyone can make a Michelin star plate of spaghetti. Don't get discouraged, and the more you cook the better you'll get.

I started trying to cook about 4 years ago. I moved out of my parents house, and I was in a similar situation as you. I used to buy a lot of prepackaged meals, and fast food, and I didn't really know how to cook. My dad always cooked, and didn't really ever need the kids to help with the meals, we just set the table.

You have to eat every day, and it can get really expensive (not to mention, terrible for your health) to eat out every day. I remember my first GOOD meal. Fried rice, with sauteed veggies, and a soy sauce chicken breast. Now, it's something I could make without even thinking about it, but it's still a big first step.

I can't count the number of times I've made a bland sauce, really dry chicken, super oily stir fry, or scrambled eggs out of an omelette. It sucks when you work hard on something and it doesn't come out good, but you'll eventually stop making food that isn't very good, and you'll start making food that IS good. You may not LIKE cooking like I've grown to, but a little bit of practice will make the food at least good enough that you don't throw money away for meals that aren't good for you long term or short term. There are plenty of meals that take as much time to cook as it does to get in the car to get them. Hamburgers, spaghetti, even Pizza or steak take less time than driving to go to the drive through, and they cost less, and the more you practice, the better it'll be.

Just keep at it, and you'll be making something you'll want to eat in no time.Peanut butter and apples til the day I dieThey might not be cheap if you're looking for a snack... but they are prettymuch the base of a meal here.  So even at $2 for an avocado its still a pretty cheap dish.You don't need meat for every meal. Between the almond butter, eggs, and hummus there should be apple protein. For lunches that don't need to he heated up, wraps or sandwiches are easy. Lettuce, tomato, cheese, cucumber etc. Can use rice and roasted veggies in the wraps.

Breakfast should be pretty straight forward. If they're eating eggs, then eggs and toast or a bagel etc, hasbrowns works. Or pancakes, that kind of thing. I usually have some sort of oatmeal during the week when I get up early.Hey I recognize that cart and towel!!California yo.Good suggestion -I really only need the liquid to help puree, so I might try this sometime!  I completely agree with you about the sodium.  My black beans were low sodium, but I'm sure it was still higher than I'd like to intake.I make shepherds pie topped with parsnip mash instead of potato. Aside from being more nutritious, I think it tastes betterMy only suggestion would be to drain and rinse the beans and simmer them in tomato juice. That liquid in the cans usually has a ton of sodium and the tomato juice gives them a nice flavor.

edit: Forgot to mention some tomato juices also are loaded with sodium so check the labels.Butternut squash roasted with Brussels sprouts, tofu, kale, and mushrooms. Season everything with extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a pinch of brown sugar. Par-cook the squash to al dente before hand to ensure that everything roasts evenly. 10-15 minutes at 400 degrees should do the trick.

This can be eaten as a side dish, light snack, or even dinner if combined with something hearty like lentils, caramelized onions, roasted cloves of garlic, and maybe even a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.For those interested, I built a map-based farmer market locator app called [Grown Local](http://www.grownlocal.in).It's not very active, but it could be one day!WHAT?!

Are people complaining about markets that look like the above link, or are they getting really high prices from community outdoor markets?Lasagna or slow cooker carnitas Since when are avocados cheap?Asparagus is my favorite spring vegetable. I usually roast it in the oven with some lemon, salt, pepper, and parmesan or romano cheese, which makes a great side dish or addition to a pasta primavera recipe. Tastes great in stir-fries too; I recommend [blanching](http://startcooking.com/keep-it-fresh-learn-how-to-blanch) the pieces before throwing them in the wok (boil briefly, then immediately cool in an ice bath to keep its bright green color and crunchiness). It has some problems but the documentary Food Chains (I believe it's on US Netflix) elaborates on this a bit. Supermarkets have a lot of leverage to dictate the prices of what they buy, and what they buy is necessarily mass produced, unlike what you would often find at a smaller/local market.Interesting, I'd never heard of that sub!true,  but as a relative noob, one could use some prepared dough, or another way is that two months is enough time to nail down a good pizza dough, even for a noob.I can understand where you're coming from, and like I've mentioned in some of my other comments, there are *a lot* of those overpriced "farmers markets" in my area.

&gt;What /u/pabstyloudmouth said, sometimes you have to know where to look.

&gt;Granted, not every area has someplace great for cheap food, but a lot of times it just takes a bit of searching.

&gt;To get to this place, I have to go through the "hood" &amp; and into a really industrial part of my city. It's between fisheries, processing factories, and semi parts places.

&gt;Not many people I know know of this market, or are willing to take the time and check it out. I searched and searched for those! A lot of vendors had them really cheap, but also really bruised (not that I have an issue buying ugly veg), but I wanted them for salads!It's alright buddy, you will find someone to make you "Spicy Stuffed Avocados with Chicken, Quinoa, and Cilantro-Lime Vinaigrette" I'm sure of it!This isn't exactly easy.

Lots of great ideas: http://greatist.com/health/healthy-fast-breakfast-recipesMust be nice living in an area with a cheap farmers market.   The thing is many people don't, and even if you say "just look!" yeah, we have, and it's all too expensive.   I don't see how product that is hand picked, better, and grown in much smaller quantities will be anything but more expensive -- it should be.There's no Asians but I have followed Mexicans (I live in the south), and they go to the grocery... This soup is fantastic! http://www.myrecipes.com/m/recipe/moroccan-chicken-butternut-squash-soupInteresting. Well, they don't come to our farmers market, so I feel good about that. Makes sense that they have a selection way before the others though. You know, as someone from India, the exact same thing can be bought for 7-8$ here. Sweet Jesus, this looks incredible.  Those soft boiled eggs!  I want to try this ASAP.Don't forget about eggs! They make a great breakfast. You can even make a huge family-sized [fritatta](https://experiencelife.com/article/the-hearty-vegetarian/) that you start in the pan like an omelette and finish in the oven (no flipping). Cut into wedges and serve hot or cold-- or just make it the day before.

The options are endless. I usually do a potato, spinach, and mushroom fritatta with a little bit of cheese. Always a good solution :) Add a big pan of cornbread, some hamburger buns, and some tortilla chips, and you're all set!A great transition into spring recipe is roasted butternut squash served warm, on a bed of arugula, topped with slivered almonds, shaved Parmesan, and a homemade balsamic dressing.

* Add a teaspoon of mustard powder, then a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper, and oregano.

* Shake, let sit for an hour, and shake again. Enjoy!My dinner plans were cancelled last night, so I threw  this protein-packed dinner together with a few things I had on hand!  This dish can be made with just about anything you've got in the fridge/pantry -get creative; profit!

*  Olive Oil (1/8 cup)
*  Lime (1 qty, juice only)
*  Serrano Pepper (1 qty, use only half)
*  Vinegar (any kind, small splash, optional)
*  Salt and Pepper  to taste

Stuffed Avocado:

*  Hass Avocado (1 qty)
*  Rostisserie Chicken (4oz)

Avocado:

*  1.  Open avocado and dice [using this method](http://mylittlegourmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CubedAvocado.jpg) and set empty avocado shells aside.  This will make keep your avocados from being too mushy when combining all ingredients.

*  4.  Top each avocado with a drizzle of reserved vinaigrette and  a sprinkle of salt &amp; pepper
*  5.  EAT AND ENJOY!Make-your-own Pizzas...These past few days, I've been eating hummus and cheese on a toasted pita.Yeaah. I'm guessing this would not be the case in my country./r/inyourbasket :)A great way is to use pita bread, put sauce on it, cheese, some bits of ham or salami, oregano. Pop in the oven until cheese melts or bread is crisp. Very satisfying, less calories and pretty fast and easy to make. It doesn't taste like pita when it's done.Ps all these options are meant to feed your family too (everyone can get down with chili, meat burgers or tacos can be served along with his meatless version). I think this will make it easier on you ( no planning two meals) and prevent him feeling like odd man out. You don't need to go out of your way to make him something wildly different from what your family eats. There is usually an easy change to make any meal veg.That's what I came here for, no one else seemed to notice.For lunches, make sandwiches with hummus or some other mashed bean mixture (mashed and seasoned black beans strike me as an "American" take). Add cucumbers and sprouts for texture and roasted red peppers (skip these if they're too pricey) for flavor. I also personally like mustard on a hummus/veggie sandwich.

For dinner, black bean burgers or portobello mushrooms. What's more American than a bbq? You could also do grilled veggie kebabs. Other dinner ideas: three bean chili, sweet potato and black bean tacos, vegetable stir fry (with or without tofu).Maybe some fish recipes that ask for regular flour and sub the coconut? Especially good if you were to add shredded coconut flakes as well.No. I mean,  nothing as strictly international as Chinatown. There are neighborhoods that have a preponderance of a certain nationality,  kind of. .. I can get to an Asian grocery store. Farmers markets are a different story. Butternut squash rancheros from post punk kitchen: http://www.theppk.com/2010/11/butternut-rancheros/

For the squash, you slice it and roast it for a half hour, then broil for 5 minutes at the end for color. It comes out sweet and tender, but also steak-like.

For the sauce:
2 teaspoons cumin seeds
2 teaspoons coriander seeds
2 tablespoons oil
1  yellow onion, diced medium
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 15 oz can tomato sauce
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp maple syrup or agave
2 15 oz cans black beans, drained and rinsed

Dry toast the seeds, then add oil and saut aromatics. Add sauce and agave (I have used jarred pasta sauce if that's what I have on hand, but omit salt and sweetener). Blend this mixture til smooth (but I've also been lazy and left it chunky) and then add beans! Very easy, very few ingredients, but the result is so impressive. I make it frequently during fall/winter.You should season it, and then replace your nonstick with it.

A good cast iron is hard to beat. You can use it in a whole bunch of recipes. Just never cook with anything high acid in it. You could ruin years of seasoning just by throwing down some tomato in it.Pulled Pork is certainly the easiest, and most certainly cheap, but it can be pretty heavy on the calories. If you use dark meat chicken, it can be a cheaper and healthier alternative. It's really easy to slow cook a bunch of chicken with some onion and barbecue sauce until it falls apart and use a fork to shred. You can make as much as you want, and it goes with all kinds of cheap and easy sides. Grill some corn on the cob, or make some sauteed zucchini and you can serve a bunch of people for cheap.

If you're looking for something a little less causal, pasta dishes are easy to make for a lot of people, just scale up whatever recipe you're aiming for. A simple bolognese can be made for pretty cheap, and can really impress a crowd. If you make your own noodles (which is easy, but a little time consuming) people will think you're a five star chef.  I really like this [Squash Soup](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/squash-soup-recipe.html) by Alton Brown. It's super thick though, so I thin it with extra broth. And I add a lot more ginger. :)Far better than ok.  Most people eat fast food shit for lunch.There's one farmer's market in my area. It's ridiculously expensive. Last time I went, a pound of onions was 5 bucks. No way. I live up North in Cleveland and this is about on par with what I get from the West Side Market. Sometimes you just have to know where to look. Yeah, prepping the dough takes the most time, the actual cook time is pretty short.This is the one and only thing I miss about living in Phoenix.  There are no sprouts in my new city. I meant to say local BEEF, chicken, and pork. I like the idea of local beer, too, though. Farmers' Market FTW!  They should be opening up here again in about 6 weeks. I have two of them within 6 miles, and they operate on alternating days. Lots of agriculture in the area, few jobs. That keeps the prices down and the quality up. Plus, we have a local butcher shop who deals with the regional farmers directly and we get fresh, local beer, chicken, and pork for the same price as Kroger and Wal*Mart. Sometimes even cheaper. There are definite benefits to living away from the big cities sometimes. I like to do 1 of 2 things. I will make either my Puerto Rican roast pork (pernil) with rice and beans

Or I will make a taco/burrito bar. I make some excellent poached chicken breast, rice, and beans. What also makes this great is I have each guest bring something. Someone can bring lettuce, someone else can bring tortillas, etc. This makes it way easier and cheaper.Eight dollars?  Come on.  I live in the area and never saw higher than $4 all last summer.  &gt;We however only have one true farmer's market

Fresh produce is really pricy.What do you mean farmer's markets don't exist in Australia?I was on a veggie low protein diet for some time and one of my favourite things I would make are summer rolls.
Basically take whatever veggies you want (I'd use sundried tomatoes, onion, spinach, feta) mix together with seasoning. Then place on a big sheet of puff pastry and roll up. Brush with a beaten egg and throw in the oven  until golden brown. It's really good hot or cold so can be used for lunches. Just make sure to dry the spinach after wilting it so the pastry doesn't get soggy.

Also veggie quesadilla is a good meal as well. Or baked potatoes with beans. Or stuffed potato skins with cheese and onion. Or even cheese and onion slices (potato, cheese onion mashed and rolled in puff pastry). Or stuffed courgettes. Or veggie lasagna. Mushroom stroganoff... The options are endless!!I love sunflower seeds, just my problem is eating them whole. I enjoy the taste of the shell and rarely spit it out, and I know pretty quickly when I've ate too many.I'm more shocked at how good those capsicums look.

I just went to the local markets, which are widely considered to be great (Cheaper prices, fresher produce - AUD$1-$2/KG for bananas vs. $3/KG in stores for instance) and couldn't find a single good one  - Granted, it was an hour before closing, but they were all bad looking.  Yours are so shiny!

Edit: I am Australian, so farmers markets in the same sense don't exist - at least not under that name.
Also Capsicum = Bell peppersChilli.It keeps me full because of the "metric fuckton of fat". I drink it slowly from 8am-9am and then have lunch at 1pm. It's hardly starving myself.I feel guilty that it costs so much for OP.
This is a good deal in the US?I could have sworn my tongue was here a minute ago but it appears to have dissolved out of my mouth...The dressing I make is more than half olive oil. One portion of hummus has another tablespoon or so. The eggs have some fat and so does the almond butter. I'm not a dietician but this seems OK to me. I do a protein shake after work.

I posted the recipes again, that was just a miss click on mobile. Seriously though, make that hummus. You won't regret it.Actually I was looking at this from perspective of an office worker. On the other hand, for a physical workers lunch this should have some fats. And why theres no meat :(

And why did you take the recipe off? Bring hummus back :PI work in Landscape construction which means getting up at 6am or earlier to go work for 11 hours of digging, irrigating, paving and planting. We take a 15 minute break 3 times a day so lunch has to be ready to go and easy to put in my face. This lunch keep you full all day without sugar spikes and it won't break the bank.

Prepping a large batch on Sunday so that I can come home, clean out my containers and load em right back up before bed lets me do other things with my limited free time. Attention to detail on the job is huge so taking the extra time to make healthy choices keeps my mind clear. Please enjoy and keep posting great stuff, this is one of my favorite subs to lurk in when I'm feelin' the munchies.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Yes this is a lot of food. I call it a lunch but it makes up at least half of what I eat that day. This could probably be a whole day worth of food for some people. I burn about 2500+ cal/day though so it's fine for me.
Haha you're right... But I'm a tall guy and we burn a lot of calories on the job.Yah I have several good farmers markets in my area, definitely would be hard pressed to find that kind of a deal. Do you have an international area/district anywhere nearby you? China-town? This looks so yummy and healthy! Thanks for the inspiration!That looks like ~~2-3~~ 2 lunches rather than one. (**edit**: calculated calories a bit, adding a banana should be filling and sufficient for two lunches).


And well. This looks just wonderful.Is buckwheat too much like oatmeal? I love it. Also good mixed with quinoa, hemp hearts, nuts, chia.Homemade fries in the oven.Yes!  Black kale and walnut is one of my favourites.  But I like it with cheeeeese.Miller doesn't grow most of the food they sell. They buy it from the same source as king soopers. They have peppers in May....because they are grown in Mexico. You can find some with the four digit stickers left in them, and they are NOT organic.Breakfast: Cereals or oatmeal with fruit, porridge, eggs. Yoghurt and fruit. Banana pancakes.

Lunch: PB&amp;J sandwiches, jar full of salad with or without a cooked egg. Rice or pasta salad. Rice salad: bit of cooked rice, kidney beans, onion half a bell pepper, spices, drizzle with oilnand fry a bit before cooling. Pasta salad: pasta, tomato, bellpepper, maybe a bit of cheese, oil and vinegar.
Vegetable sticks and dip.  Here in uk, we have "lidl" that would cost....about 6 here. It must be hard in USA to choose to eat well and cheap, well done! :)Yep! We had a weekend market underneath a freeway overpass growing up with veggies from all sorts of cultures but lots of South East Asian things. My mom called the place something that I thought meant farmers market in her native language for a long time but it just meant "the place under the bridge". How the fuck do you people *save* money at a farmer's market???

All the ones in my town have way overpriced produce compared to grocery stores.Hell yeah Tulsa!Fuck yeah, I'm just gonna buy me a bag a flour and dig in. It depends.  A lot of farms who are active at farmers markets swallow up a lot of money in hiring staff to run the markets, as well as buying diesel, hiring drivers and paying for repairing trucks.  Basically, by attempting to make more money through selling directly to the consumers you have to run your own distribution network that is no where near at the economy of scale of massive food distributors.

If you want my honest opinion as someone who works at a farm market, a lot of the craft goods (think soaps and packaged cheeses and prepared foods) are overpriced because they think they can get away with pricing it that high and they generally do in middle to high income areas.

That being said, the quality is unparalleled compared to supermarkets.  The vegetables could only be fresher if you picked them yourself... and I have never eaten more delicious meat then from meat vendors at farmers markets.  Also, holy shit, milk from a local dairy?  Absolutely worth paying twice the price of supermarket milk.   While farm fresh potatoes are better, if you're trying to cook potatoes multiple times every week as a staple of your diet it's not financially feasible.  But if you get your base starches and the bulk of your calories from the supermarket and supplement them with fresh vegetables, meats, and other goods from farmers markets the quality of the food you make improves considerably without spending too much.  You just have to be smart about what you buy.

Meh, just referred me to the overpriced farmers market that I went to once and never went back after I realized everything was 2-3X the price in the grocery store. Woo! Tulsa!Agreed, I get all of my produce from Sprouts. What can you do if you just buy your parsnips at the store? I've had the bland carrot taste before turn me off of parsnips. Should I just stick to buying them in the winter and spring? Oh, we have some really wonderful Hispanic and Asian markets no doubt, those places always have good deals. We however only have one true farmer's market and it is huge, diverse, and terribly expensive. Aside from that we have your standard fruit/vegetable stands but again, I see no difference in quality between those and the grocery store where the produce is cheaper. I've been buying baked, podless Edamame from Winco for less about three dollars a pound! Extremely protein rich, and has a good deal of fiber, too, its always pretty filling for me.

If you can only find it plain, add a little moisture (soy sauce, or something), season it and slow roast it for a while.

For those unaware, Edamame is young soybeans, really popular eaten straight out of the podGlad it helps! Yikes. Sounds like a personal problem.Thank you for this link! It's really helpful even though a lot of the market info is outdated.you can sub 50-100% of regular flour in a recipe with coconut flour - it's also gluten free so maybe try searching gluten free recipes for more ideas.  I've used it to make "flourless" muffins, and it would probably be good for things like pancakes/savory crepes.  I've read it can be used in gravy (and probably roux as well).  I'm on to you OP...I'm on to you...*tosses salad*My sprouts in my area does double ad Wednesdays too. I don't know if they all do it, it's where the ad from last week and the current week are both in effect.Why not make him a curry? You can combine a tin of chickpeas with a tin of crushed tomatoes, and bag of spinach along with some curry powder/garam masala/cumin and ginger, garlic and onion with a bouillon cube or something :)Where are these? How do I find them?

Ninja edit: in twin cities area specifically, I mean. Awesome Thank you so much! I've been meaning to try cooking pizza for a while but I just have never gotten around to it. Hearing that the cooking time is much shorter than I expected makes it a lot more likely that i'll actually get around to doing it.Clean and season it.

The only thing I use hydrogenated shortening for is to season pans. Wash, dry, slather with shortening on every surface and cook upside down; on a grill, outside, on the highest heat setting until it stops smoking.

If you lack something from the above recipe substitutes are: high temp solid oil (refined coconut oil) works, if you lack a grill place pan in oven (again upside down) at 350 for 1 hour, turn off oven leaving pan for one hour. Also place foil on track below pan to catch drippings.

There will be smoke.A Japanese breakfast staple is a raw egg dropped over warm rice.

I eat it raw because I like the texture (and the rice cooks it's a little if you mix it in), but if that's too exotic you could just prepare the egg however you want and put it over the warm rice.Minneapolis-St. Paul

Hmong farmer's markets. Best food in town. I agree, disgustingHow hardcore vegetarians are they? Ricotta cheese adds well to leaner ground meat recipes and would probably make this recipe moister as well without compromising the structure.Start with the basics:



a grilled cheese sandwich.

Bacon and eggs

Pancakes

French fries

Sauted veggies


Basically, anything that would normally have you putting down a fairly significant layer of oil under it to begin with. Start building up that layer of seasoning early!Oh my god... I just made these tonight. SO GOOD!

I would recommend using fresh rather than frozen cauliflower. Mine turned out a bit mushy. I think so.  If it isn't, it certainly is based on his recipe.  And never eat a whole bag whole.

Ow.Truer things have never been said. *Always* follow the Asians.For me, creating/cooking something at the house that's better and cheaper. I know it's clich and doesn't always work, but knowing that I have really good food at the house--even if it's just a snack--takes away the urge to go elsewhere. Being in college, when I don't have a lot of money, knowing that I can get a 5lb bag of frozen chicken at HEB for $10 is kind of nice. I also really like chicken...Dude I live in Tulsa, we should compare notes! [Here is some price data I got from Reasors a few weeks ago.](http://i.imgur.com/05NLnmC.png)Small detail concepts, such as certain foods filling you up for particular reasons, differences between macro nutrients and micros, the lower caloric value of soluble fiber to standard dietary fiber as a carbohydrate (in terms of amount of energy necessary to use up the fuel that is the food). There is also the question of intermittent fasting or carb-loading, but those pertain more to people attempting to both gain muscle and lose fat (read; body builders).

These are just examples of oddities in the more specific senses of dietary information and the bizarre nature that is our relationship to our fuel.

But they get the most important concept across which is food is fuel. It is like a car fuel in, fuel out. We just happen to store our excess on our body. It doesn't matter if its a carb or a protein source. If we have too much by the end of the day, many days in a row, we begin to store this on our body.Get one of those chip dip mixes from the grocery store and mix it in with a cup of greek yogurt and you have a healthy chip dip. This can also be used as a yogurt sauce over cooked vegetables/meat. The onion soup mix is super tasty over plain chicken breast.Shouldn't cutting out middlemen make up a lot of that difference?I'm Korean and we people like to have soup and stew for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I like having tofu stew in the morning with a side of brown rice. You boil water in a single serving pot, add your vegetables, then the tofu, and finally add in the stew flavoring (I use a Korean soybean paste called doenjang but you can add Knorr soup flavor squares), and it keeps me pretty full til lunch.

I've also been experimenting with crepes in the mornings with my husband. We use [this recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/crepes-recipe.html) and we add cheese, deli meat, and tomatoes, and then you fold it over for a cute, fresh breakfast sandwich.

Bagels are also a great option for breakfast. In New York they're staple breakfast food. Egg bagels were my favorite, which was a fried egg and slices of cheese inside a warm crispy bagel. You could try it with just cheese if you don't want the egg, or you can have it with spread (called schmear in NY). There's cream cheese, jam, avocado, greek yogurt, butter, etc. If you want to make the best ever fluffy, healthy pancakes, use the [first recipe](http://www.veggiesbycandlelight.com/whole-wheat-greek-yogurt-pancakes/) here. I halve it to make one serving for myself and then spread natural peanut butter on top.

I also like [these biscuits](http://untrainedhousewife.com/the-best-whole-wheat-biscuits-are-made-with-yogurt) but they're a lot less healthy.Main thing is to move out of the north.

It's borderline uninhabitable anyway LolYou don't know where the real markets are then. Follow the Asians. I don't mean that offensively. Where the Asian immigrant minority goes, this is where you too should goWell, any pizza recipe will work without a stone, just make sure the oven cooks the crust all the way. The stone just helps get more heat under the crust, and helps the pizza cook more evenly.

If you don't have a stone, make sure you grease the pan you use thoroughly, and make sure the bottom of the crust is cooked fully before serving.

The recipe for crust I use is yeast sugar and warm water until activated, add flour, olive oil and salt. Mix well, let rise 20 minutes, knead, let rise again, shape to pizza, add sauce, cheese and toppings, and cook at 450F-500F for 10-12 minutes. You can lower the heat and cook for longer without a stone, something like 425 for 15-18 minutes would probably do the trick.

Really the best advice I have is to check the crust for doneness, if it's cooked enough the toppings will almost certainly be done as well.post it to /r/JohnCena they will be happySprouts is so much better than the farmers' market.  The produce is top notch and the quality is outstanding.Hootenanny If you're fortunate enough to have disposable income, or prioritize on supporting and eating local is why people go there.

I will eat less, to know that the money is going to a farmer within 100km (I live in Canada), than imported internationally to a megacorp where other than wages, non of the profits stay in my country.  It's a philosophical choice, and is not the easier path.
How? :\ Farmers market here, all of that might be like $40.&gt; Porridge

ruling out oats, you've got:
Grits
Cream of wheat
Congee
Quinoa
and I'm sure many others
w/r/t Congee, a bowl of rice can have most everything done to it that a bowl of oats can; but salt, pepper, poached/fried egg is an appealing optionMine doesn't start until June. Get out of Boulder, man! There is a really good market that goes up in (I believe) Lafayette. It's usually super cheap. Check out Miller Farms. They have a schedule of what markets they are going to. I'm up in Vail and I can get these prices. If we can do it here, you can do it there. How long has this feature been around? I made something similar last year (based on the USDA data) www.seedtip.comApril fools! This actually coat $63 from Whole Foods. Fucking poor'o's.Onions, garlic, salt, pepper, peppers, paprika, tomatoes. Creole seasoning is a good all around spice mixture. Herbs de Province is also good. Get a crock pot book or get some recipes online and follow the directions.Good call, I had already used my vanilla and I used my plain yogurt for this recipe.That is not how we act. Actually sugar free gum is good for your teeth. Plus it boosts concentration and relieves anxiety, something op struggles with.Love me some sugar snap peas. I could eat those all day.I think the corn is small. ;)Pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds are a also high calorie. Only thing going for them is if the shells are slowing you down. Dried fruit is also pretty expensive.Those Jalapenos are huge!I go to the farmer's market here in Boulder and pay more than Whole Food prices :(Farmers markets in our town require only local produce and it starts getting food the second week of June. We still have six weeks of snow potential. Totally understand that, I'm not trying to say that this is possible anywhere. This is a good resource for finding a market near you.

I hadn't been since the fall, but Summer vegetables are the best!Cold places often don't have farmers markets in the winter, though, even ones with limited/non-local options.  I have a month or so until there's a farmer's market of any kind within 60 miles.There's a lot of vendors that sell prepped/pre-cut mixes!Chewing gum is a disgusting habit. Honestly, I know it varies by area, but this market is somewhat of a hidden gem even in my city. Many of my friends are always shocked at how much you can get for so little, because they just don't know where to go.Awesome!! Thanks!Not all of the produce is locally sourced, while a lot of it is (I'm in Florida) there's also a lot that's wholesale.

Just pointing out that there's options everywhere, and part of being frugal is working with what you have. Also a few places that I went to offer the less-choice cuts of meat for a really reasonable price. Beef tongue and heart and whatnot. Although that's probably a where-you-live thing. This depends wildly on your budget and local produce prices, but I'll have half an avocado either on its own or spread on toast - for my local prices that's about $0.50-$0.75 a meal, which isn't too bad considering that, like you, I'm not crazy about really affordable options like oatmeal. If you wanted, you could probably get away with using 1/3 the avocado to stretch it out for a third breakfast. That along with a cup of coffee is usually enough to get me to lunch. because the vegetables and fruit there taste better and are fresher,  it's usually more expensive because farmers generally aren't able to price as competitively as a gigantic distributorMy local market is a sort of complete mix of the two. There's a potato stand that sells up to 10kg bags from pretty much change and there's a a stand that sells biologically and ecologically responsible potatoes individually. There's a nut stand and a stand that sells almonds from specific places. There's a fishmonger that sells cups of coffee for a euro and an impressively pretentious coffee bar bycicle.
Use Vanilla Greek yogurt.  I use the dannon light and fit.  Has a bit more sugar than I want but it makes the pudding AMAZING.I found it in the "natural" section of my local kroger, but my kroger carries some really odd things. Where I found it was kind of on its own near the gluten free and organic stuff. It's a yellow container that says "nutritional yeast seasoning" on it. It'll probably run you 5-6 dollars but it lasts for a long time.Same here. The farmers market that's down the street from me is easily 4 times more expensive than if I were to go to a grocery store. I'm sorry but $7/pound for strawberries is ridiculous.I've done something similar with plain Greek yogurt, cocoa powder, sweetener and a bit of chocolate protein powder. I liked it. I think the cocoa powder gave it a nice flavour.And I'm just thinking I could get all this for cheaper at my ding n dent store. Prices are weird.I'ma tell you a secret: you can get proteins somewhere else while buying your veggies at a market.Lol this dude must have thought the top comment was referring to sub strictly about shit? This is great if you live somewhere obviously warm that you can get this kind of produce in April. Non-mobile link:http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/Awesome haul!!! I am going to put that on the sidebar if you don't mind! *Edit, as soon as I make room for itDo you even protein ?maybe about 10-15 bucks, but it feeds you all week.

cheaper on average if you buy a big bag of frozen chicken breasts to pre-cook!About how much does that cost?&gt; Baby carrots are good too, but they contain a lot of sugar so maybe be more sparing if you eat carrots.

Eh, most the time what looks like a bag of baby carrots are actually just baby cut carrots. So they wouldn't be any worse than normal carrots.In which area of the grocery store do you usually find nutritional yeast? Would it be in seasonings, or is it a speciality item like gluten free stuff...?i make this all the time:

The only good thing from living on a 3rd world wide country is that, that would cost 10$ heresage i got, salt and pepper obviously. i used a cream sauce similar to this in chicken and dumplings last night.

So sweet, they're like grapes!I see a lot of people here suggest smoothies.Same here. In Tulsa, Oklahoma the farmer's market is where yuppies go to buy their groceries, everything has to be at least x3 to x4 times supermarket prices for what seems to be the same quality food.

Thank you my friend!Apples and carrotshttp://www.ehow.com/how_8252684_roast-peas-snack.html
Roasted Peas are damn good, and easy to make/cheap to buy and are generally healthy.I think its all been said at this point really, but any fruit or vegetable that you find enjoyable is a good snack, just don't go for anything too exotic to where you live. For me, I live in the northeast, I wont be eating too many kiwi's for snacks. Apples? Carrots? Quite cheap and super good, even if I want organic they still wont break the bank.Sub your abendbrot for some tasty vegetables or make some tofu, that stuff is so tasty. Haloumi is also pretty low fat and can be found in many grocery stores or the local turkish supermarket.

Really cut down on the bread and make something different.I was super ready to correct you on nutritional yeast having no sodium because it tastes so salty, but I just looked it up, and yep 0g sodium in a 1/4cup.It's the same thing here. Probably due to the push here for organic things.But be careful with sunflower seeds, they are horribly addicting. I have jaw issues from eating them so much. Coffee with a metric fuckton of fat. Yes I have had it as something additional during breakfast at multiple day endurance events. But dont see how it would keep you full for several hours.Pistachios in the car. They're tasty and healthy, and you have to take them out of shells so you can only eat them a red lightsLooks like alien poo.Every market I've been to in my city is like twice the price of a grocery store. Not sure why people go thereIf you get the shelled sunflower seeds, try dry roasting them. It totally makes them irresistible. Seconding the professional help suggestion. A therapist can work through healthier coping strategies with you, in addition to drug and other behavioral options.

While I think its great to see seeking help for depression being less stigmatized, I think the same effort should be done for anxiety sufferers too. I know so many great people who are limited by their repetitive thoughts and fears. Homemade buns and breakfast pucks (contains egg)Cereal - bought in bulk can be cheapMuesli - you can make your own (you might not like it if you don't like oatmeal)Beans on toast - half canTomatoes on toast - can be tinned, but fresh is bestCoffee and homemade muffin Yoghurt and fruit saladLeftovers from the night before that you promised yourself you'd leave until dinner the next night, but damn it was just so good!Protein shakeRegular healthy milkshake"bulletproof coffee"? What's that?Favorite splurge foods? Air-popped popcorn. There are a lot of veggies that taste super sweet when roasted, which I like. And there's always roasted garlic. Keeps the SO away, but tastes so damn good. For people who don't like the taste of zucchini, it helps to cook it before throwing it in the sauce. I normally saute it with some olive oil and garlic until it's translucent then I let it strain while I cook the sauce. That way a) most of the zucchini taste is gone (for which my husband is always thankful), and b) it prevents the pasta sauce from getting watery with reheats.I think it comes from [this book: ](https://books.google.com/books?id=zHPVTc0nte8C&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;ots=NQms6F5aLb&amp;dq=fetch%20me%20a%20rock%20allegory&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=fetch%20me%20a%20rock%20allegory&amp;f=false)

But the way I heard it went like this:

A king says to a servant, "I need a rock. Fetch me a rock!" and the servant rushes outside and grabs the first rock he sees and hurries back to the king. He says "Here is your rock, sir". The king looks at the rock and says "Fool! I don't want this rock! This rock is terrible! Bring me a good rock!" So the servant goes outside, pokes around at rocks and pebbles and stones and picks another. He reluctantly presents the second rock to his master. And again he is rejected. The servant fetches rocks big and small, rough and smooth, shiny and dull. Each time, rejected. The King grows angry at his servant's incompetence, and dismisses him. The king assigns this task to his top advisor, thinking the fault must be in the foolish servant. But just the same, these advisors fail. His Knights, his Bishops, and even his sons all fail at this task.

Finally, the King decides to venture outside the castle walls and find the rock himself. Squinting against the daylight, the king scuffs his dainty shoes upon the rocky soil; bends over his stately frame; and peers at the ground. His eyes flashhis hand dartshis voice exclaims: "Ah ha! I have found my rock!" The King stands triumphant with his treasure grasped in his fist, and swiftly turns, to return to his throne.

Trailing behind, and curious to know how they have failed their master, the Princes and Bishops, Knights and advisors, and even the lowly servant, seek an audience with the king. "Oh King", they ask "May we see this rock, so that we may better know how to serve you in the future?" And the King, thinking himself a reasonable ruler, agrees to this request.

"Oh yes, this is a fine rock" says the Bishop. "Indeed, a strong rock" says the knight." The prince agrees "A wise rock. Sturdy." But the servant is not impressed. The servant knows the king saw dozens of rocks, many of which looked very much like this final, chosen rock. "If I may sir,", begins a meek voice from the back, belonging to the servant, "May I ask how you choose this rock?"

The king considers the question for a moment, and replies "Well. Its was not very difficult. You see, I just picked a rock."

Moral of the story, if you haven't gotten it by now, is that some people cannot be pleased, and can only find their own work to be clever. /r/misleadingthumbnails/Calories be damned. Something I can refrigerate, portion out, and crush while im at work all week? I burn well over 3000 cal on my shift. I should just be shoveling back mayo. This looks way tastier. Thanks for the post!I eat pizza for breakfast sometimes.  Food you at at breakfast time doesn't need to be "breakfast" food!I could go for a fat bowl of either/both right now.&gt; chickpeas

Seconding! Roasted chickpeas with spices are super yummyI have a similar problem, and my go-to snacks are sunflower/pumpkin seeds. They are cheap, healthy, and they take a while to eat.Thanks! Looks delicious.Damn you, that's awesome. This would cost maybe $40 where I live. I buy frozen fruit in bulk at Costco and make a vegetable and fruit smoothie. Usually I fill half the blender with spinach and baby kale, a banana, small scoop of frozen fruit, and then skim milk and/or yogurt. You might need to add water or more milk to get a drinkable consistency.  You could certainly get more creative, but this works for me!I cannot wait until midsummer for this reason! My food bill has increased by almost $100/mo just because vegetables are so expensive!This is a great breakfast bagel [recipe](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s37/sh/f303af5b-13be-45b1-a40d-3aa363d0fd3d/a37f87de6b2a2071babbc12323a2bdba) adapted from Bagels and Brew.I'd say reading the book Sugar, Fat, Salt is a pretty good way to understand how the food industry exploits human weaknesses with the sugar-fat-salt bombs they call food.

Then, I'd say, having a good long abstinence from fast food is the way to stop craving fast food. You'll still get hungry, obviously, but you'll have more skills, knowledge and resources to avoid falling for the drive through. I don't crave fast-food, because I can cook something way better (and healthier and cheaper).

Keeping healthy snacks on hand is key. I buy big boxes of granola bars at costco and keep a few in my desk at work, my glove box, and my purse. I also try to keep baby carrots and hummus in the fridge at home, or greek yogurt, or some other prepared snack. This can be enough to get you home, get you to not-be-starving, and able to make better decisions about food.

And finally, I keep some frozen prepared food. This is when I crave the convenience of having food now. This is a combo of microwave dinners, and home prepared stuff. Amy's burrito bowls aren't cheap, but they're tasty and pretty good as far as prepared foods go. Check the weekly Ad for your local supermarket, most stores are probably putting strawberries on sale. Asparagus too.

Typically things go on sale in supermarkets because they're in season, so you'll get better produce by looking at what your market has for you.I've made pesto without the cheese before, it's still a nice herb sauce.  The only thing you really need to substitute is a bit of salt, because the cheese is so salty.  I don't eat with my eyes.I'm genuinely envious that you were able to purchase all of that produce for $20.It looks a lot healthier than all of the stuff that people post on here where they dump a bunch of canned stuff and pre-made sauces together.  I wish there were more posts like this here.Haha, no offense taken. You can only make pesto potatoes look so good. Promise it tastes better :D It fed 8 of us as a side, with left-overs. I can't wait to try this!This sounds great! I love those little ranch MSG packets! :DYum! If I could control my Nutella intake, I would be all over this!Ok so it's a major no go with ON Whey Chocolate protein... I forced myself to eat half of it for the gains, but it was terrible. I kept looking at it and telling my brain it's not chocolate pudding it it ISN'T going to taste like chocolate pudding. It's a low carb mix, so I added liquid stevia for sweetness, but there was no saving that monstrosity.  :( Will try with fruity flavors because it's probably bombPizza is incredibly cheap to make at home, and almost certainly better if you have a pizza stone, plus it's something fun that everyone can do, and letting everyone make their own pizzas means nobody needs to worry about what everyone else likes.

If you freeze pepperoni bought in bulk, it lasts for what feels like forever, and GFS pepperoni is about a third of the price of the little packs you'd get at a supermarket.

My wife loves Mexican and Italian food, and they're both super easy to make at home, plus having homemade burritos/bowls means you spend a whole lot less money, plus you get the added benefit of cooking something together.

Nothing can replace Skyline Chili in my experience though. Mine always comes out too fatty, or too watery. The spice blend never matches exactly either.perfecting the art of oven roasted potatoes really helps satisfy the greasy fried food cravings.Frittata is a baked omlette. Stir fry is cooking the veg in the frying pan.I would recommend investing in an air popper over the paper bag in a microwave method if you're going to be eating home popped popcorn regularly.  Tossing oil in a bag will strip the coating off of it very effectively, and eating heated paper/paper bag coating residue regularly isn't good for you.  A couple times a year when you forgot to bring the air popper to your in laws house?  Not going to hurt you.  Once a day?  That's a personal risk tolerance question that I personally answer "no" to.

A $25 air popper, neglecting dishwashing costs over popping into a reusable glass bowl, and neglecting the cost of the bowl as well, and assuming one batch of popcorn per day, will pay for itself over brown paper bags in less than two years.How many people would you say this serves?No offense but it actually doesnt look that good :/This is the best advice I think anyone could give. Adding butter, or oil to your meals is the quickest way to rack up calories at the end of the day, and anyone who is trying to LOSE weight will tell you drinking your calories is where hidden calories lie.And she even did a month long SNAP challenge.I only eat eggs and oatmeal in the AM. :-/

Yogurt and fruit is a good choice.

If you like eggs, but are done with omelettes, there are tons of ways to cook them to have a different perspective on it. Poached eggs can make for Eggs Benedict (you can use less, or no hollandaise). Sunny side up eggs go great with toast or sausages. Crustless quiches are nutritious, and can be made the night before. Frittata is great, and easy to make.

If you don't like oats, other whole grain cereals are alright, but can be really heavy calorie wise, and are almost always more expensive than just eating oats.Absolutely love farmers markets because of this. Mine is a bit of an undertaking, but if you're doing a big batch, it's worth it.

In the frying pan: a red pepper, green pepper, large onion, jalapeno pepper, and a few minced cloves of garlic all chopped up.  Cook in a little olive oil, add a bit of balsamic vinegar when they're nearly fully cooked.  Optional: you can start this process with a diced chicken breast in the pan, add the veggies when it's half done.

In the saucepan: 1/2C brown rice.  When cooked, combine with a can of black beans.  Sometimes I also will throw in a little frozen corn.

In the oven: peel and dice a sweet potato, toss with a little olive oil and sprinkle with chili powder.

On your tortilla, add a little of the rice/beans, pepper mix, and a few pieces of the sweet potato.  Add a small amount of salsa and grated cheese for extra flavour.  Fold up your tortilla tight and repeat.

When your burritos are folded, put them in the freezer as is until they are solid.  Once frozen, you can wrap them in foil if you are going to reheat them in the oven/toaster oven, or use waxed paper if you want to use the microwave.  Time to heat them up will vary depending on the size of the burrito.Thanks for submitting and not putting your blog link in **bold**. I saw that practice in my other subs and...eww. It looks desperate. Don't take that the wrong way, please. I want to help and I hope that does help. :-)&gt;Obviously you're not going to eat a half of a chicken

oh how wrong you are I'll let this be my cheat day dinner Yes, celery! The best snack ever. You have the crunch like with usual snacks, it is cheap and healthy. You can't go wrong with that. :)Mayo.I've seen his shows and he is kind of a dickI feel like a broken record, but roasted whole chickens are delicious and the cheapest way to get chicken.

It's also lean, and doesn't have a lot of calories, so if you were to theoretically eat two pounds of chicken a day without the skin, you'd eat 1500 calories.

Obviously you're not going to eat a half of a chicken, but roasting a chicken is cheap, low carb, and it's good for you. If you make a side of greens or grill some veggies, you'll have a great meal that's cheap, healthy, and low carbs.  When I say snack I think of almonds, peanuts, cashew nuts and roasted chickpeas - those are definetly my favorite.

But despite being healthy those are kinda caloric dense, so not the best options if you're trying to lose weight. I think your best call is to go for vegetables: Cherry tomatoes are awesome, they taste grate and they're like 3 calorie/tomato. Pretty much any veggie is good, I'd be careful around fruits if trying to lose weight.My face when? Do tell What's in season is going to be cheapest, and freshest. That's going to vary dramatically during springtime, if you're shopping local produce (just depending on where you're at), but here's some vegetables that should be the best to pick from a National chain:

This is a good resource for finding a market near you.

Edit: Non-mobile link:http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/Not to mention it can mess up your teeth if you're eating it constantly every time you're in the car.Egg. Cube up potatoes, mix with oil, salt, whatever herbs you want, onions, and peppers and put in the oven at 450F for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

If you prep them ahead of time, you can reheat them in the morning and they're pretty great. *Rice
*Canned Tomatoes
*Frozen peas or mixed veggies
*Potatoes
*Onions
*Olive Oil
*Whole chicken
*Chicken stock(made from whole chicken)
*yeast
*flour
*soy sauce
*hot sauce
*worcestershire sauce
*eggs
*part skim mozzarella/provolone cheese
*Whatever fruits or vegetables are on sale that week.

Typically, I just go with the flow of whatever is available/in season, but what I listed above is something that every kitchen should have. You can make so much with what I listed, and just buying whatever veggies are cheapest/seasonal, I have a lot of variety, and can have a ton of fun trying out new ideas.Elaborate on frirata and veggie stir fry? Sorry, I'm not English therefore I may not understand some of the terms. Beans and rice with a sunny side up egg. Pictured: Two cauliflower, cilantro, bag of baby carrots, 4 beets, 4 jalapeno, 3 apples, 5 corn, several limes, lots red potatoes, &amp; bell peppers.

While I know "go to the farmers market" is oft repeated advice in this sub, I think a lot of people have issues finding a true farmers market. There's lots of hipster "markets" here, but they aren't necessarily cheap. This is at a large, open air market, where haggling is encouraged and there's dozens of vendors.

Edit: I know this isn't realistic everywhere (the downvotes reflect that), but I just figured I'd share for anyone who hasn't considered it or doesn't know where to look.

There's always fluctuations in food costs, and I'll admit I live in an area with lower cost of living compared to a larger city or the west coast, however, this is still considerably cheaper than I'd pay at the grocery store. I cook grits [enriched corn or brown rice] in vegetable broth with fresh ginger and top with soy sauce and a poached or fried egg. It's like congee but easier.

I thought it was weed, not shit."all of us have different perceptions of cheap and healthy"

my dawg, this is perfect for some people, don't be ashamed. I'm active as hell, I can't wait to try this recipe. I'll probably sub some hummus or something for the cheese (I avoid dairy), but it sounds awesome.Kroger is typically cheaper than Wal-mart and Giant Eagle if you have a Plus card, but Aldi typically has better deals on milk, eggs, and produce, although it isn't typically as good.

GFS is great if you do your own baking. a 25lb bag of flour (both bread flour and AP flour) costs about $7, and you can get huge bags of rice for something like $0.60 a pound, if you want to eat rice a lot.

Invest in a slow cooker and a rice-maker. It's super easy to make a great meal with minimal effort, and the amount of time you'll save on prep will make life a million times easier, and you can also use them for all kinds of things (rice cooker for rice and steaming veggies, slow cooker works for TONS of stuff).

Like you said, planning ahead is the key to making good meals, but if you make the planning ahead step easier, you'll have a better chance of staying on track.I don't know how good of a recipe this really is, barbecue sauce that you buy in a store typically has TONS of added sugar, and the kind used in this recipe is no exception. 11g of sugar in just 2 tablespoons.

If you're using a whole bottle, that's WAY over your carb limit, and that's before the beans, which have a lot of carbs too.If I've over cooked dinner, I'll have left over dinner. Or eggs, peanut butter, veg, fruit, nuts, Greek yoghurt, muesli, cereal, toast... Whatever I have on hand that I can shove in my face and leave.

Recently I've been having bulletproof coffee as it keeps me full until lunch.Have you tried Gordon Ramsay's scrambled eggs? Really really tasty. Some salsa with them is great as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0Depends how much time you have and what you have to eat. Could do a quick veggie stir fry and dump a fried egg on top, you could do omlettes with whatever veg you have lying about, or the night before do a frittata (and then have that for the next few days). Just say it. It looks like shit in the image preview lol It's literally chop up a potato, par boil for 5 minutes, oven for 30 minutes at 180degrees C.I'm assuming you want something in your car that you can grab whenever, so I'd recommend bags of nuts and seeds (especially almonds and walnuts) and a few dried fruits (apricots). Really dark chocolate (I'm a fan of 90% lindt) is also good when craving something a bit sweeter.lol yeahI had it over spinach last week with a little feta sprinkled on top.. delicious!apples and bananas - cheap in most parts of the US and full of vitamins and nutrients.https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/search?q=snack&amp;restrict_sr=onI might try the both omelettes options you have me, I'm also interested in the home fries, can you give me a recipe? here here! I personally need low calorie but when i'm being very athletic and burning through lots of calories, I like to eat healthy too. Healthy can mean that something is made with unprocessed foods and is full of nutrients to power your body. Omelette with spinach and peppers. Onions and Tomatos are great too.

If you want something completely different, you can make home fries, by roasting potatoes, and Onions and peppers are good for that too. If you prep them ahead of time, you only need to warm them up in the AM. The standby for me is a banana, frozen blueberries, and a ton of spinach.  The banana makes it sweet and creamy, the blueberries mask the green colour while adding anthocyanins and lots of other antioxidants, and the spinach is a milder, sweeter green that allows you to get away with adding less fruit.  If you're having trouble blending it, add a little extra water.[Brawndo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vw2CrY9Igs)Canned chickpeas are already cooked, using dried beans is quite a bit cheaper, if less convenient.At least I know what I'm eating after I tree it up nowDitto hahahhaa.Healthy doesn't always mean low-calorie.  Some of us need all the calories we can get!That's a good tip if you want to eat it frequently.  I usually only eat it on the weekends, so once or twice a week of washing out a pot isn't a big deal to me.&gt;I have a terrible habit of eating constantly

&gt;So what is a food that stays healthy...I also want it cheap because this is taking a lot of my money just to upkeep with my heavy eating

&gt;Finally, I'm also looking to lose weight

Dude/Dudette... I think you know the answer to this one.  You can swap out M&amp;Ms for celery or a head of lettuce, but if you want to reduce the amount of money you're spending on snacks and drop some weight...you know what you should do.

&gt;[eating constantly] helps with my anxiety

Snacking as a means to calm your anxiety will likely lead to an early death.  No sugar coating that.  You've developed a bad habit/coping mechanism.  If you need professional help to break that, seek it sooner rather than later. Sunflower seeds in shells. Eat them one at a time. (Pro-tip: use this method to stay awake while driving on long road trips! Keeping my brain active to work the seed out of each shell always wakes me up)Dried fruit is actually REALLY sugar-heavy and caloric. I leave them in the shell. I cook them in my electric pressure cooker and the pressure makes them easier to peel.Sorry! I guess calorically this recipe isn't particularly healthy :( I tend to go more by the ingredients when I consider if something is healthy - fresh produce, healthy fats and low in refined sugar. Sorry guys! You can also air pop your own popcorn by throwing some kernels into a small paper bag then heating in the microwave. Making this tonight.  I was pretty stoked with the marinade.  Can't wait!!It's easy to make your own bagged popcorn out of popping corn, paper bags, salt to taste, and oil. Just look up instructions. No need to get a pot dirty every day if you want to eat popcorn frequently without paying for prebagged popcorn. The thumbnail image made me check which sub I was in.I love Snapped peas, with edible pods! They are awesome and sweet tasting you can eat them all on your own.

Also brocolli with balsamic vinegar dressing is the shit! Let it soak into all the crevices of the broccoli. Seriously amazing. Put some red onions and some feta and by golly you've got yourself a salad. Haha! I used Italian sausage because my roommate had bought some, it was the cheapest option I could get, free!Popcorn is my fave. Especially air popped, where you have control of what's in it.This seems sac-religious to me. Italian sausage links should be enjoyed on a nice Italian roll with some peppers.

That being said, this looks delicious and I may swap that out for andouile or similar. This is a simple recipe I sometimes make that includes cauliflower. Proportions and ingredients are approximate.

**Roasted Chicken with Vegetables**

*Ingredients*

5 chicken thighs (boneless)

1 cauliflower

2 bell peppers

1 onion

1/4-1/2 cup white wine

smoked paprika, garlic salt, lemon pepper, or other spices

*Directions*

Preheat oven to 375 degrees

Slice up all veggies and place in a deep baking dish with a lid (something like a 13x9 Pyrex dish or a deep pie dish)

Open chicken thighs and place open side down over veggies

pour in wine

add spices

cover the pan and bake for about 45 minutes

The fat from the chicken will drip down into the veggies and mix with the wine to make a nice sauce. Looks absolutely delicious &amp; I would make it for a party, but not sure how healthy it is, unfortunately :(I cut them really thin and put them in my actifry, add coconut oil, salt pepper and some chipotle and make tasty parsnip chips, yum!Hell yeah! Great idea.Electrolytes -- That's what plants crave.  It's also quite important to note that the sugar from those natural sources doesn't get digested as quickly as the M&amp;M's he's used to so there wouldn't be that immediate endorphin release from these foods. Because of this they are far less addicting, but that still doesn't mean you can't form a habit around them. Being mindful of these things will help the transition.How exactly is this going to be a fruitful (pun intended) discussion if you don't state your preferences before hand?

Have you heard of the allegory "fetch me a rock"? I've found popcorn - as in, the kind you pop yourself on a stovetop, not the pre-packaged, microwavable bag variety - to be a great snack.  Maybe not hugely nutritious, but 1 serving w/ 1 tbsp of oil is only about 230 calories and it takes awhile to eat.

Edit - clarified that I meant not the pre-packaged kind, not just the fact that it's microwaved.If it's just for anxiety, would chewing gum help? I often chew n drive to calm me. Also kills the coffee breath.Sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds,  dried fruit.I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to have an opinion? Is this a game where we all name things that are tasty and you say "Lol Nope". "Aaaaaaanything from the trolley?"[Parsnips A-Plenty](http://www.homestarrunner.com/parsnips.html)I can only recommend looking at blogs! I've been vegetarian for over a year now, and I love getting new inspiration from them.

[Hummusapien](http://www.hummusapien.com/) is a great place for mostly, but not strictly vegan recipes, just like [With Food and Love](http://withfoodandlove.com/), and then ofc there's [Oh She Glows](http://ohsheglows.com/) which is very frequently updated and has a well-organized, big recipe archive.

All of these will give you ideas how to make veggies the main part of a dish, how to make those dishes satisfying and get enough protein in them, etc.. Good luck! I'm always happy to hear somebody cares about animals.Bell peppers are crunchy, sweet AND delicious! M&amp;M's

**Ingredients**


For the pesto:


1 cup fresh basil


1/4 cup fresh mint


1/3 cup pine nuts


1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese


2 cloves of garlic


1 cup olive oil


1 tbsp fresh lemon juice


zest 1 lemon


1 tsp salt


1 tsp pepper


For the salad:


8 soft boiled eggs, cut in quarters


1 cup frozen petite peas, blanched


1 &amp; 3/4 lb baby potatoes, sliced in half


1/3 cup pine nuts


1/4 cup fresh mint, finely shredded


salt and pepper to taste


**Directions**


Bring large pot of salted water to a boil and cook baby potatoes until just tender. Pour off water and set aside.


In toaster oven or shallow pan, toast the 2/3rds cup pine nuts. Set 1/3 cup aside.


In food processor or blender add: basil, mint, 1/3 cup pine nuts, parmesan cheese, garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest and generous season with salt and pepper. Chop until course consistency reached. With blender on chop, slowly drizzle olive oil in until thick paste is achieved. Pour pesto into a large bowl.


While potatoes are still hot, add them to pesto in bowl. Stir to combine so potatoes are covered. Cover with saran wrap and place in refrigerator overnight, or 2-3 hours to let marinate and absorbs the flavours.


Meanwhile, prepare other ingredients. Soft boil 8 eggs, peel and cut into quarters. Blanch peas in boiling water, then set aside. Finely dice 1/4 cup of mint leaves.


When ready to assemble, grab potatoes and add the eggs, peas, reserved pine nuts and mint. Toss gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper and serve.I'm Mexican  and my parents  never cooked Mexican  food  with cumin. When I smell cumin, I  smell more like an Indian flavor  profile.I've  have chipotle  peppers  in adobo sauce. Is that the same thing?

Avocado, with salt and black pepper... and maybe a bit of srirachaParsnip latkes!! Just shred them up with a little onion, then mix them up with an egg, a little flour, salt &amp; pepper, then smush dollops of the batter into pancake shape, pan fry it, and serve with sour cream or applesauce.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9ryPC8bxqEA bag of celery costs between $1.50 and $3.00 depending on where you live. Take it home, wash it, cut it into sticks, and that is a very healthy, high-volume snack you can take anywhere. You can eat as much celery as you want without having to worry about lots of added calories.

Baby carrots are good too, but they contain a lot of sugar so maybe be more sparing if you eat carrots.

Sliced green peppers can be good too.

Pretzels aren't exactly healthy, but they are healthier than m &amp; ms.

Apples can make a great snack for the road. You can slice them, but I just eat them whole.

Another good snack is sunflower seeds. They take effort to crack open and eat, so you still have the mouth satisfaction, while not eating too much. They're pretty cheap depending on where you go.

Good luck!

Yumm, I like this thank you.Yes! Especially on tacos!Mfw never had salsaSalsa on eggs is fabulous. Add equal parts apples to this and it is amazing too! A little spicy, a little sweet, so delicious! I love squash in the morning. Goes great with eggs too.This reminds me that I need to buy parsnips before I go home tonight!  I'm making basic roasted root vegetables with butternut squash, carrots, onion and parsnips.  Toss with Rosemary, salt and oil and roast them.  I can then use those for lots of meals, including as a side with roasted chicken, blend up for a soup or stuff in dough to make turnovers.Under a roasting chicken alongside carrots, potatoes, and radishes. They bathe and simmer in the chicken fat and just a little salt and pepper turn them into something heavenly.

You can put them under any meat roast but that is my preference. These look delicious! Are you willing to release blueberry faux jelly recipe yet? I would love to try making these.I really enjoy old bay spiced parsnip fries. Just peel them, cut them up into whatever size you like, toss lightly in oil and old bay, and bake until crisp!For the most part, the information was true. Nothing really called out as being totally wrong. But, it was a general video, so some details were missing, which could certainly change people's minds.I also live in Ohio. I assume you are mid to southern Ohio since you have a Kroger? ( I have Giant Eagle, but Kroger tends to be a bit cheaper for the same quality). $100 is a good place to start, but I am able to feed our family of 3 (2 adults and one toddler) on $125 a week and I am including all meals and snacks and toiletries, so you could eventually go down a bit with careful planning. Aldi's is your savior for anything canned and frozen, so unbelievably cheap! And Costco will save you TONS on decent quality meats. Being in Ohio, find some local farms for fresh produce in the summer, you can't beat the prices and Ohio can produce some great food. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat more about budget, being in the same region, our prices should be fairly similar.I've been subbed here for a while so I know the ropes ;)See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/30xmvk/oven_roasted_chicken_shawarma_with_heirloom/cpxijwn).

You *could* try to make it with breasts, but I don't think it will be anywhere near as juicy.Tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach...Thanks for the heads up! I've been wanting to try pickling some red onions for a while now to use in sandwiches and whatnot, so this could be another pickling to try!The potato one is definitely my favorite. I really love potatoes.
A strange combination. I used to love to get SUPER SPICY wings and greek yogurt and trade back and forth between "I'M GOING TO DIE!" and "ahhhh. Sweet relief." Those are some nice ideas!

Thanks ;)Thanks! I will try it sometime soon. :)Probably posted but, parsnip mash, so good and so easy. Steam parsnips tell soft all the way through, mash up add Brown sugar, salt and white pepper and great easy side dish.Wow that sounds awesome! really looking forward to dinner :D Thank you very much !Sorry, I figured It was high compared to an average north-american diet.

I will keep that in mind!My gf tried vegan and gluten free and its a pain in the ass she said and gave up after 3 month :P I think its fine to eat some graubrot, but if you looking for weight loss I would avoid it late in the day.Sounds like what you're really looking for is a healthy meat-free snack so you're not left out when it's Brotzeit time. Some thoughts:
* Instead of cutting out the cheese, cut out bread -- enjoy cheese with carrot and celery sticks.
* Top bread with olive oil, fresh chopped tomatoes and garlic, like a Catalan tapa.
* Use a thin spread of low-fat cheese, add olive paste or a bit or jam for flavor.
* Top bread with hummus or other high-fiber, low-fat bean dips.White potatoes especially have a really creamy consistency. I also love to put them on top of pizza with just some caramelized onions and Parmesan-- so good.


Soup #1: Creamy white bean, potato, and kale soup.

* Sautee some onions and plenty of garlic. If you have it, add a good dose of smoked paprika. Optional: use leeks instead of onions, and add mushrooms for more protein.

* Add a can of white beans, diced potatoes, and whatever kind of broth you choose (I use non-tomato based vegetable broth). Salt and pepper to taste.

* Add chopped kale or spinach when the potatoes are nearly tender and simmer for ten more minutes. Frozen spinach works well, or you could add broccoli or even cabbage instead.

* Blend everything together. You may need to add more broth or water as you blend until it is as thick or thin as you like. It comes out a weird green color but who cares? It's delicious and nutritious.


Soup #2: Creamy carrot, sweet potato, and ginger soup

* Sautee some onions. When they're just about soft, add a healthy amount of fresh diced ginger put through a garlic press-- at least two teaspoons. I love ginger so I normally get closer to a tablespoon, diced (a good inch of root).

* Add one-two diced yams or sweet potatoes, roughly an equal amount of diced carrots, and veggie broth. Salt and pepper to taste.

* Once soft, blend everything together, adding more broth or water as needed.

Soup #3: Butternut squash and red lentil soup

* Optional: Dice and roast butternut squash along with some carrots, turnips, whole garlic cloves, and quartered onions.

* If you don't roast them, sautee the onion and garlic before adding the 1 cup red lentils and 3 cups broth to the pot. Once they start boiling, add the vegetables and more broth as needed. Stir frequently to avoid sticking!

* Seasoning options: Keep it simple with thyme and rosemary (put these on the veggies if you roast them) or add a twist with some curry powder.

* Once everything is all cooked, blend together. This soup is especially nice topped with a little fat-free Greek yogurt to really enhance its creaminess.


Finally, when it comes to a sausage roll sandwich, you could try some other satisfying toppings, like caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, a few slices of avocado, sliced and roasted eggplant, sliced and roasted zucchini... pretty much anything! It's not the same as sliced cheese but it adds flavor and moisture to an otherwise dry roll and vegetarian sausage.You're right it is potent, I usually just add drops until it smells a little smokey. I kind of go by scent or sight with that one, which is why I don't have any measured amount. Venison would be awesome!Thanks for this. I never have cooked chicken thighs. Is that what makes the dish work..or could i get away with using chicken breasts cut up?Yes! I was doubtful the first time I tried them, especially because of the weird pink. So glad the guy at the shawarma place convinced me to try them. Thanks :)

The potatoe idea seems very good.

Yeah, I'm maybe going to try a soup for dinner once or twice a week. Can you recommend any good soup recipes?I have made this several times now, and it's so good.

Spicy Whole Roasted Cauliflower
http://www.purewow.com/entry_detail/recipe/8821/Forget-florets--roast-the-whole-damn-cauliflower.htmFor anyone who is super interested in this topic:

http://www.amazon.com/Cooking-Greek-Yogurt-Pancakes-Smoothies/dp/1581572395Wow that is actually very good to know. As soon as I reach my weight goal i will look into that. Maybe I will even go vegan. Not to sure about that yet. Yes! The pink things, right? So delicious!Sure, but most of my recipes are either imprecise or links to other people's websites, etc, so might not be that helpful.I live in Germany graubrot is not healthy at all tho. Specially if you don't get it from a real bakery which barely exist in Germany. You only get premade dough with gentech wheat. Its terrible for you longterm. But yeah I like that bread as well..High protein would be when most, if not all the calories come from protein not split down the middle between carbs and protein.Thinly slice some potatoes and parboil them. Of course, now you're just eating carbohydrates instead of fat...

Sadly, the best way to avoid cheese more often is to change your eating habits. How about trying out some dairy-free soup recipes that are naturally creamy with ingredients like white beans?I'm going to try that one but what I'm really looking for is a replacement for sliced cheese.

Thanks tho ;)Every time I try parnips, even roasted ones, they just seem bitter to me-- I can't get over it. The only recipe I might use them in is a roasted mixed butternut squash and root veggie soup with turnip (which I love), parsnip, carrot, and potato.It would seem so. Should have called it "shawarma" in the title!

Here's a quote from the NYT article:

&gt; Most people do not make it at home. The reason has to do with the traditional preparation of the meal on a vertical rotisserie. The technique is alluded to in the name of the dish itself. Shawarma derives from a Turkish word meaning turning. Doner is Turkish as well: turn around. Gyro, Greek: circle.From wikipedia

Shawarma or Shawurma (Arabic:  / ALA-LC: shwarm;) is a Levantine Arab[1][2] meat preparation, where lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, veal, or mixed meats are placed on a spit (commonly a vertical spit in restaurants), and may be grilled for as long as a day. Shavings are cut off the block of meat for serving, and the remainder of the block of meat is kept heated on the rotating spit.Nutritional yeast is often used as a replacement for cheese in recipiesAnd here I am...eating my Ramen..Very good. It's like a typical pizza crust with a bit of a roasted cauliflower taste. The more you cook it, the less cauliflower taste you get, but you also run a higher risk of it burning, and if you make it too thick on one side it might turn dark on one side quicker, so it's important to make sure you press it down as evenly as you can.Awesome looking dish! I will try with some venison sausage with natural smoke flavor.

I would caution though. One of us has unique taste. Anyone who has not used liquid smoke before, use very sparingly. In my opinion, as with real smoke, it is possible to have to strong of a smoky flavor. Liquid smoke is a very unique and powerful. It is good but I think it can be over done very easily. Not really a recipe, but a good tip for anyone with a garden:

Parsnips harvested after the first frost or two are almost an entirely different vegetable than parsnips harvested in the summer. Cut a summer parsnip into batons, toss them in oil and salt and roast; you'll end up with a bland imitation of roasted carrots. Do the same with parsnips harvested in the late fall or early winter (some people suggest even waiting until the spring thaw - I guess it depends on your local climate) and you'll have sweet, nutty, complex flavours from the same basic recipe. I suggest planting them once you've harvested your early summer crops, and then [just waiting it out](http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/grow-parsnips-for-the-winter-garden-zmaz03fmzgoe.aspx). This sounds pretty good, I'm gonna give it a shotLiving in Israel and buying almost every day a tasty pita with zaatar, I cannot stress enough how tasty it is! Added bonus: Leaving lemon halves in fridges/kitchens smells great  and covers up other, less desirable, food odoursNot yet but I'm going to.

Thank you :)It's been awhile, but I usually would put a gallon of milk into a crockpot, then 1-2 tablespoons of yogurt as the starter.  Heat that up  on low, dont let it boil.  Let it sit till it looks yogurty.   Then filter through a cheesecloth.

Also disregard my post, dairy based yogurt is a form of animal abuse. Thanks!I've never tried oats. Just raw rolled ones tossed in? Or as an overnight oats? It sounds tasty!Have you tried using wheat germ? It'll never replace sliced cheese or a good mozzarella or anything like that, but it does have a cheese/nutty taste that's quite good.When I'm at home I use almond or cashew butter. They're harder to take to work cleanly, though, so for transport I like the dry stuff. It's just an ease of use personal preference. If you try it, I hope you enjoy!I allready tried vegan cheese and really did not like it. Same thing goes for ham except for one brand which is really expensive and one brand which is morally disgusting (Rgenwalder Mhle).


I allready eat whole wheat bread and "Graubrot". German bread is really good and not as boring as Toast. If you get a chance you should try it.


Thanks ;)Your steamed broccoli is perfect with Olive Oil, Garlic, and Lemon and other garlic recipes. Good luck on the experiment! :D Summary: Short video on what is healthy to eat, when to eat (Some mythbusters like not eating breakfast), and general losing weight tips.

Just thought it was funny some stuff seems .. inaccurate even though its a video from a big name (Buzzfeed).There is vegetarian cheese and ham in Germany both is kinda expensive and gluten based(if that is a problem). Tbh I would just go into a local alnatura store and see what's there and test it. In the end bread isn't really healthy either specially later in the day. I recommend at least only eating whole wheat bread if your aim is to eat more healthy.Please submit a summary of the video. Greek yogurt mixed with a can of tuna and a ranch dip mix packet. Dip with crackers.

Greek yogurt with protein powder as already mentioned.

Also Greek yogurt mixed with any 0 calorie water flavorings such as Mio, kool-aid or crystal light.Not sure how true this video is - thought I'd ask some well educated healthy eaters out there to see how true this is! :)This is Alton Brown's recipe, right? It's the one I use for hummus every time and comes out perfect. Just tried [Moroccan Lentil and Vegetable soup](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/11/moroccan-lentil-vegetable-stew/) the other night and the cauliflower was a big reason I thought it was so amazing. This recipe was aaaaamazing. The cauliflower definitely adds something. Like a little spice and broth sponge. I used a small can of tomatoes because I can't read. Also used beef bouillon because I didn't have veggie. Sorry for the delayed response, but:

Basil is wonderful in non meal replacement smoothies. Strawberry, lemon concentrate, basil, some sweetener, Crushed ice, and water. Refreshing as hell! Or cucumber, lemon, like, and basil is a really subtle treat.

The only bases we use at the shop I work at is sugar water and crushed ice.

One of my favorite banana less green smoothies is:

Avocado, spinach and kale, pineapple, coconut concentrate and some lime.

Or, spinach, kale, pineapple, mango, coconut concentrate (for taste)

Ginger goes good in that one as well! It's tough to pull off in non green smoothies in my opinion because fruit is too sweet for its taste.


Whey makes any smoothie somewhat creamy and thick, so I use it in any of them as a meal replacement. Pea protein is a great alternative, but soy tends to be grainy.

All time favorite smoothie: blueberries, half a banana, mango, almonds, whey protein, sugar water and crushed ice. Oh mah gawd.

Sorry for the discombobulated thoughts but I hope you've gotten some ideas!
Not that much. I recommend multiplying the ingredient amounts by 1.5.It was amazing dudeI usually just add a tablespoon of almond butter, cinnamon, and sweetener. I will have to try this.You loose flavour by soaking, and you only save yourself 20 mins or so boiling time.

http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/09/soaking-black-beans-faq.htmlStrawberries and avocado are really good in smoothies! So shawarma has nothing to do with flavor and basically means spit-roasted? Serious question.I love beef stroganoff, so I found this healthier version with greek yogurt from Real Simple. It's really tasty too. http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/beef-stroganoff-yogurt-dillSweet Thank you so much for the recipe. Some people don't include them... and we don't like those people... but you, you I like. Great photo, by the way.No problem - enjoy! For those of you asking if you can sub chicken breast, the answer is probably no.  One of the delicious meaty qualities of shawarma is that it roasts in its own fatty juices as it cooks.

I've tried many times with chicken breasts, only to end up with lackluster resuts.  Don't get me wrong, it's still tasty.  But it won't feel like "real" shawarma.  I've tried grilling, poaching, roasting... no luck.  What you could do is shred and mix white and dark meat if you are worried about cutting the fat out while maintaining some flavor.

For those of you who love middle eastern food, this is a great cheap and healthy idea.  For my personal taste, I would add some allspice to the marinade :)

Budgetbytes.com is amazing too!BOOM!!! I just made this for dinner, black bean and barbecue chicken tacos.

What you need:

-shredded chicken (I made salsa chicken in a crock pot)


- 1-2 regular sized cans of black beans

- 1 red bell pepper

- 1 red onion

- 1 head of cabbage

- 1 bottle of barbecue sauce (I used Jack Daniels honey bbq)


Now:

Cut up pepper and onion and throw em in the pan with some oil (I used some butter cuz we're out of oil) and sautee on medium  just until they're almost soft.

Dump in barbecue sauce and let em cook for a bit longer, then add the chicken, and more sauce and mix it up.

Now that's what I did yeasterday but I had leftovers and a can of black beans and cabbage.

So put beans in another pan and cook do a bit, and start squishing them. Then add everything else and mix well.

Once it's all done graphics the cabbage, rinse, and pull a leaf of and throw some of that delicious mixture inside. You can top with whatever, by I just used some taco bell fire sauce.

Also I eyeballed everything so measurements aren't exact.

Enjoy!

Edit: for the shredded chicken

-chicken breasts

-Salsa

Add chicken to crock pot, cover in salsa or water if you have no salsa, cook on low for about 6 hours

Pull out chicken and shred with a couple forks.My mouth started watering just looking at the pic Same thing for me but also typically a scoop of flax seed fiber and half cup of oats.All right, this is my first post to this subreddit and I'm on mobile so apologies for formatting.
This is a super easy dish, ready in around 10 minutes and it's got a surprising amount of flavor and of course, protein. Let's get into it:

You'll need:
1 can of kidney beans ( or whatever beans you like, I don't care)

1 Italian sausage

Liquid smoke (find it in the BBQ sauce aisle, it's amazing stuff and not too pricey)

Nutritional yeast ( harder to find but worth it, healthy stuff that lasts forever and adds a little protein without sodium and kind of a cheesy flavor)

2 tsp vinegar (that's what I used anyway, you season your beans your way, go nuts)

2 tsp coconut or olive oil

1. Cut up the sausage into disks while you heat up your oil in a pan. You can also open up the beans at this time and add them to a small pot or microwave safe bowl.
2. Add the sausage to the pan and pour on as much liquid smoke as you want, I used hickory but there are other typea. Seriously this stuff is a lifesaver.
3. Cook the sausage like you would cook anything, watch it carefully and flip it when needed. At this point I liberally added nutritional yeast to the beans and microwaved them for around one minute. I also put some liquid smoke on them to enhance flavor.
4. Once the beans are cooked add whatever you want to season them with, I added a little vinegar to give it a kick without adding salt and it tasted great to me, but you do you.
5. Add your sausage to the bowl and season if you want, it probably won't need it but it's your dish, own it.
6. Enjoy!

This was an impromptu dish I made tonight and it surprised me with how good it tasted, it'll definitely be a staple from now on. It would probably be good with some cooked greens added in too.I'm making this for lunches next week. I honestly can't wait to try it.

Anyone have tips for what veggies I could serve this over? I use canned garbanzos then add a little salt to make the hummus taste good.Can't wait to try this!You could try microwaving it with a moist paper towel over it. That's usually the trick for anything that dries out in the microwave 1 lb dried chickpeas

7 cups water

1/4 tsp baking soda

Put those ingredients into a slow cooker on high for 4 hours, or low for 8 hours.  Make sure the baking soda dissolves.

The baking soda turns the water basic, which softens the chickpeas immensely.  More baking soda=softer, to the point where they will turn to mush if you let them (you don't want that).

Feel free to adjust as necessary, but 1/4 to 1/2 tsp does it for me, with the high end making them almost too soft.

No need to soak, no need to monitor, just turn on the slow cooker and walk away.Soooo right about the onions!! I'm a broke college student so I did a very interesting variation of this but it was still super yummy :)you could either blend it in, or pour it on top after the batter is in the pan and then swirl it aroundomg peanut butter sounds soooo good!  I got a really nice food processor for christmas so perhaps I'll try it and blend it really well.  Thanks for the tips!My daily breakfast:

Mix it all up and yummmmRaw and cooked cauliflower taste completely different. The taste of cooked cauliflower (esp if it's mashed or turned into cauliflower rice) is extremely mild and it takes on the flavor of whatever you add to it whether it's cheese or buffalo sauce and so forth. The texture's also deliciously creamy.I use PB2 and it works great. Save a lot of calories that way.Hoagie bun (125 Calories)  [$0.50]

EAT SANDWICH!")

There. Closed both for you.I've not made tuna salad with greek yogurt, but I have made tuna melts with greek yogurt instead of mayo.  (Basically bread, tuna &amp; greek yogurt, topped with your preferred cheese and adding herbs or whatnot as you see fit.)

Tastes a bit different of course, but it's quite good and is an uber protein meal.

As a side note, my snack of choice for protein used to be low fat cottage cheese, then I realized plain greek yogurt was about the same in terms of protein density but had a ton more calcium. So that's nice.Totally making this for my lunches next week and serving it over a salad instead of pita.Sounds yummy! I'm going to have to try this.Well the traditional dish is pretty mild and creamy, so I wouldn't go too crazy. Maybe a bit of thyme or sage or tarragon.

But just salt and pepper would be good too. If you get the tubs i've found that you can just make the Tzatziki in the tub it comes in. Pretty convenient.Have you checked the sidebar?  The Good and Cheap Cookbook by Leanne Brown is an especially good resource and is written with SNAP recipients in mind.Hello fellow Oklahoman.

I also do the same thing. I'll typically stop by Aldi and pick up staples, and then I hit up Crest and fill in what Aldi didn't have.

This egg toast sandwich is high in protein, low calorie, low fat, low carb, less sodium healthy snacks. Serve hot with your favorite smoothie/juice. My meat obsessed desi heart thanks you Spend some of the money you would spend on meat on brown rice and quinoa instead. Paired with tofu, tempeh, or even just some delicious beans, something like this [curried chickpea quinoa](http://thefitchen.com/2014/09/05/curried-quinoa-chickpea-salad/) will be equally satisfying-- plus you can easily add a lot more vegetables and even more protein with some tasty raw cashews sprinkled on top. Bold flavors definitely help keep your tastebuds happy!

Eating meat once or twice a week instead of more frequently also allows you to seek out free-range, naturally fed, etc. sources. Yes, it's more expensive, but since you don't eat it as often, it's now more affordable.


Adding beans also stretches out the meat you do eat-- for example, this [white bean and chicken chili](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/white-bean-and-chicken-chili-recipe.html) looks delicious.

This is by far the easiest way to get some calories in because it barely fills you up. I would personally suggest drinking 1 or 2 cups of milk everyday. 1 cup of 4% milk is 160 calories, and those calories will slowly add up. If you get tired of milk, drink a cup of fruit juice or something. Whatever it is, getting 300 calories a day through drinking would be very beneficial to you in the long run. By the end of the week, you're gonna have 2100 calories which is a day's worth of calories.

* Consuming more fats. Fats are also a very easy way to increase your caloric intake. Butter, coconut oil, olive oil, peanut butter. Try to add fats to whatever you are eating. Snacking on a banana? Put some peanut butter on it. Making some stir fry? Add in a tablespoon of oliver oil etcetc.

It is not completely unfounded to literally take a shot oil, but might as well eat it with something to make it more delicious.

I usually blend until smooth: about a cup of greek yogurt, an apple, one banana, handful or two of spinach, and 1 tbsp of chia seeds.  Makes two servings (for me).  Delicious and full of good things.Has your doctor actually confirmed this is from scrambled eggs for breakfast? Before jumping to conclusions I would make sure you get your entire diet/habits reviewed as I am pretty sure while high in cholesterol they are pretty much nothing compared to trans/saturated fats.This looks awesome. Thank you for posting!I do pecans because I'm in Texas.  I always toast them first.  Walnuts also work well.  I stopped using pine nuts years ago due to allergies a friend had.

Sandwiches with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, cheese if you're still eating it, onion, experiment with some sauces in place of mayo (even throw it on a sandwich press if you have one). Veggie ground round tacos with all the usual. Can make quiche if you're eating eggs (with or without a crust, can be healthy stuff). Now I'm hungry! Pro tip 1: use kitchen shears to cut the fat off instead of a knife.

Pro tip 2: Don't cut the fat off, but cook the chicken thighs on an oven rack. The excess fat will melt off and pool in the bottom of the tray while the rack will allow air to circulate and cook the chicken faster.Ha! I almost burned them, they go from "um they smell good but they look pale" to "jesus Christ who's burning newspaper?!" In like 5 seconds. Buy rice and pasta in bulk because it'll last you a long time and doesn't spoil.Swedish Easter food can be quite cheap and healthy. Prepare salmon fillets simply, eat with boiled potatoes topped with sour cream and chives. As a side, halve boiled eggs and top with mayonnaise, prawns and some dill. I can get by on 20 a week but generally it's more like 40-50. I hardly eat any meat (once a month on average) and avoid dairy but I do buy coconut milk and the expensive eggs from a local farm. If you eat meat, look at your serving sizes and you can probably save a lot in that area.

Stock up on some foods you'll need. Rice, canned beans, canned tomatoes, pasta..that kind of thing. Also have a good set of spices.

I usually make a big pot of soup or chili on the weekend, then portion it out and freeze it. That's most of my work lunch the whole week and probably works out to about a dollar a serving. Saves a huge amount vs buying premade or going out for lunches. Alrighty, thanks. Your preparation of the recipe looks far more appetizing than the New York Times' photo, by the way. Tzatziki: Grab a container of Greek yoghurt and dump it in a bowl. Add in one grated cucumber, 2 cloves of minced garlic, a teaspoon of lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh dill, a pinch of salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Stir well. Let sit for ten minutes. Dip bread in it and eat.I made these this afternoon! Texture is nice, and they seem to be holding together well.

The only thing I did differently was instead of toasting the oats, I burned the crap out of them, and then melted a plastic bag trying to throw them away. So my kitchen smells really bad, but at least I have chickpea bars. Ugh I hate doing that too.

I'm sure you could do it fine with breasts, I'd just be careful with the heat/cooking time so as not to dry them out too much. My favourite is milk + 4tbl spoons of live culture greek yogurt. then cook for 18 hours @ 40 degrees C.  Will save you a fortune Gonna try this with avocados this week. My aldi always has them but they're much less ideal than the ones at Walmart. My mid-afternoon snack a couple of times a week is 1/2c plain Greek yogurt, 2tbsp powdered peanut butter, and a pinch of sweetener (I use artificial). It has the flavor and consistency of peanut butter pie, but a fraction of the calories and and 11g protein (with the brands I use--mileage varies slightly).This looks absolutely fantastic. Would you be able to substitute chicken thighs for breasts though? I despise having to cut the bits of fat off thighs... I make overnight oats with greek yogurt for those early mornings when there's no time to make eggs. My go to is:
-1/3 C oats-
1/3 C almond milk-
1/2 C greek yogurt-
1 tsp chia seeds (optional)-
1 tsp honey (optional)-
1/2 T almond butter-
1/2 sliced banana-

Mix it all up in a small container, let sit overnight and BOOM breakfast is ready for your mouth in the morningIf you're working out you probably want more protein and fats in your diet. Chicken breast and canned tuna are mainly my foods to hit my protein macro. I get a 10 pound bag of frozen chicken breast for about $20-$22 and pack of 15 cans of tuna for about $17.

A can of tuna that I get packs in 45g of protein (about a third of what I need) and chicken varies depending on how lean it is. For me, 7.4 oz gets me 46.2g of protein according to myfitnesspal.

Although frozen is probably less healthy, it is cheaper than fresh (where I live at least). I usually thaw it in the microwave for 8-10 minutes. Slice it up, season with some garlic salt and throw it on the pan with some oil. I probably eat a 6-8oz piece of chicken for dinner/lunch everyday. I vary the flavoring with barbecue sauce, oyster sauce, sriracha + sweet chili sauce and always eat it with veggies (broccoli, spinach, and mushrooms) and rice.

I personally eat my tuna with cottage cheese and sriracha. The cottage cheese gives it moisture and the sriracha takes the fishy taste away and gives it flavor. 1 can of tuna + 1 serving of cottage cheese + a couple grams of sriracha sauce makes a pretty big bowl of food. I eat this for a meal by itself but you could eat this with bread or rice probably if you have a big appetite.and toss it in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes after you mix it up. it gets delicious and more like ice cream instead of pudding.My little indulgence- greek yogurt with nutella! I use 1 tbsp of nutella for every 1 cup of yogurt. Plain light greek yogurt + 1/6 package fat free sugar free chocolate pudding + strawberries + raspberries. Breakfast and dessert all in one.If you need to know exactly what to eat, as far as meals and recipes, SparkPeople is a good place to start. It will allow you to break up your meals into 3 meals and 2 snacks per day or just 3 meals per day. It also gives you exercises you can do and uses brands you commonly find at the grocery store. It is all free and you will have exercise videos and stuff you can use as well. This looks amazing! Have you ever tried this recipe with breasts? I have a freezer full...If you haven't yet, you probably won't! :) Yes please! Oh! No, not yet! But, I'll be baking up another batch some time this week, so I guess I'll have to post the steps when I do!Wow I planned on making tuna salad tonight, will try this!WOAH. I will absolutely do this tonight! Fantastic! This is such an amazing idea.(   )It won't be EXACTLY the same because the mechanism for cooking is very different here (oven roasting vs. cooking it slowly on a spit forevaaa). But hopefully the flavors will be close! I imagine there are some regional differences in terms of the spices used in the marinade, so you can always play around with those to get what you want! Maybe your Turkish deli can give you a few hints..I've been trying to reverse engineer the shwarma from a local Turkish deli for months now. I'll have to give this a try!That's a good budget to aim for at first, if you're including nights out. I'm aiming for $100 per week for me AND my boyfriend this month which is a HUGE challenge. The key for me is to make use of things I already have in my pantry. My main food items are a 4 lb bag of frozen chicken breast, a couple cans of black beans, can of diced tomato, bag of frozen corn, bag of frozen butternut squash, a big box of mixed greens, and a block of cheese. From those ingredients along with pasta in rice already in my pantry I can make a lot of meals.Greek Yogurt + 1 scoop sweet Protein Powder

About 50 grams of protein, excellent for dessert.

Add in some chopped almonds/peanuts/walnuts for some variety.great, thanks!Replace mayo in chicken or egg salad.

Tzatziki sauce on kabobs or falafel.

Strain it and make it into yogurt cheese with garlic and herbs.

Replace sour cream on chili, stew, tacos, etc.

Last week I posted my own recipe for greek yogurt. Once you get hooked, you'll quickly find out its much cheaper to make your own. You're welcome! And a bit less. Those little circular ones in the bottom right are 473ml (16oz) so slightly less than 2 cups.Not really a recipe, but I love a dollop of it on top of veggie chili -- or really any bean-type soup.  &gt; *I just found out greek yogurt is the most delicious high-protein thing I've ever had in my mouth.*

_

You're welcome. ;)This looks like an awesome recipe, I'm going to give it a try when my tupperware is empty again.

For reference, your portions are about 2 cups by the looks of it?

Thanks!I found this recipe and made it last week.  It was so good.


For the yogurt sauce, I recommend a half cup of plain yogurt, 2 tbsp tahini, a couple teaspoons of lemon juice, and a clove of minced garlic.  Salt/pepper to taste.


It also goes great with diced tomato/cucumber salad with a bunch of chopped parsley.  Add a bit of olive oil and mix.There's a difference between opinions and attacks on my intelligence Oh fuck Ever tried dipping your carrots in your peanut butter? Best of both worlds.I have an OXO citrus squeezer so truthfully, I couldn't tell you exactly how many tbsp's per lemon I've been using. But I do squeeze every last bit of juice I can out of each lemon.

Lemons seem to take a while to go bad and I have been using them more and more lately in my healthy recipes, so I've just been buying 4 or 5 at a time instead of having to run out to the store every time I need juice/using that prepackaged lemon juice.The cookies!Of the cookies, or the brands I use? $3/lbs is kind of high.

I'd suggest you find an indian or middle eastern market in your area. Even Goya brand chickpeas/garbanzos are less than $3/lbs in a regular grocery store.

Other than that, err on the side of overcooked instead of undercooked. Soaking or non-soaking doesn't make a huge difference. Maybe 20 minutes of cooking time.

Be sure to rinse and pick over your chickpeas like any legume. I don't think I've ever found a rock impersonating a chickpea, but I do frequently find lentil impostors.

If you eat a lot of beans, and want to avoid using canned, I suggest considering a pressure cooker. Chickpeas, no soaking, done in 30 minutes. My electric pressure cooker lets me cook on a timer too, so later this week I'm going to delay cook some black beans. Start it in the morning, go to work, then arrive home to freshly cooked beans, and proceed with a recipe that calls for 2 cans.

Alternatively, you can use a slow cooker, 4 hrs on low, which is what I did before I got my PC. The only issue is you can turn most beans to mush sitting in "keep warm" mode for the remaining 5-6 hours. (If you're out of the house for 10 hours a day)Mah god that looks awesome. I'm always confused by recipes that have "juice of a lemon" though because I never have lemons around. How much juice is that? The standard seems to be 3 tablespoons per lemon. So are you putting 6 tablespoons into the marinade?Have any pics?Of course! I can't say how "authentic" this recipe is/isn't. But it sure is delicious either way. Hope you enjoy!Sunflower seeds are what I use. I use normal pb and I buy Xylitol at Whole Foods. They have it as an item in my local Walmart, but it's almost never in stock. Health food shops also have it.Have you tried adding soy milk or almond milk as a substitute for cows milk?This guy is very talented. I would lose a finger attempting to chop garlic and veggies while drunk!Walnuts, macadamia or cashew. These nuts are kinda pricy too.

The cheapest option is to leave them out. It's still tasty.

Or make chimichurri instead. Mmm. A dude did this a while ago while drunk: http://imgur.com/a/O7NjA#0Augh, perfect. You're the bestThis quick weeknight meal was very flavorful and super easy. I spiralized the zucchini using a "Veggetti Spiral Vegetable Cutter". Total cost for the dish was $9.84. It contains 1,160 Calories and yields 4 servings. (That's $2.47 and 290 Calories per serving)

**What you will need:**


2 Large and 1 Medium zucchini (1.8 lbs) - spiralized
1 Jar pasta sauce (I used Francesco Rinaldi brand tomato onion and garlic sauce)
1 lb Ground beef (93/7 fat content)
12 in. Frying pan
Salt/Pepper/Garlic Powder

**Prep:**


1. Add the ground beef to the pan and season with a small amount of salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Brown the meat on Medium-High heat. Drain excess fat if necessary.
2. Reduce heat to somewhere between Low and Medium, add the jar of sauce and bring to a bubbling simmer while stirring occasionally.
3. Add in your spiralized zucchini for about 3 minutes (or until the "noodles" are firm but not crunchy when bitten into) stirring occasionally.
4. Remove from heat and enjoy!Wow, this sounds amazing! Thank you so much, I can't wait to try it!You can replace rice with cauliflower "rice" (basically shredded and sauted cauliflower) and you can replace pasta with "zooodles." A handheld spiralizer shouldn't cost much. Would you suggest toasting the walnuts? I put them in a pot, cover with water by a few inches. Bring to a boil on the stovetop then put the cover on and put in a 275F oven for 75 mins. Check after 30 mins to see if it needs more water. Sometimes I add a bay leaf. You do not have to soak them with this method. Man I miss HEB. Oooooh! I'me excited to try this.This makes for an UNHEALTHY meal.  Less than 20 grams of protein per serving but over 50 grams of carbs?  It should be about 30 grams of each otherwise it's a not a 'healthy meal replacement'.

In fact, there's nothing healthy about brownies in general. There are plenty of actual healthy 'meal replacement shakes' that come in powder form on the market that are much cheaper than this recipe. Don't be fooled.In my family we don't cook the chickpeas, we just dump them out of the can into the food processor and save some of the water. If you want really creamy hummus without adding too much oil try shelling them before blending them.Walnuts.Thanks!  I love making swedish fish soup and have printed a recipe below.  Sometimes I also like to add shrimp, mussels, sausage or scallops.  There's a lot of room for variety, and it's really, really good.

Fisksoppa

Ingredients:
- new potatoes (the tiny light brown ones)
- cubed fish (salmon/white fish/etc. go wild)
- 2 T butter
- 1 yellow onion
- 1 sliced leek
- 4 cloves of garlic, chopped
- 1 cup of fish stock
- 1 cup of cream
- 1 cup of white wine
- 1/3 cup of water
- 1/2 cup of creme fraiche (sour cream or even greek yogurt will work too)
- 1 T tomato paste
- 2 T thyme, chopped
- 2 T dill, chopped
- 2 pinches of saffron
- salt/pepper accordingly

Boil the potatoes until tender and set aside for later.  Saut the onions/garlic/leek in the butter until they're translucent.  Add the tomato paste and herbs, and give it a good stir.  Then add the fish stock, cream, wine, water, and creme fraiche before bringing it to a simmer.

Wait until the flavours meld and it starts to smell awesome, then take it off the heat and let it cool a bit.  You need to blend the base in either a food processor or blender, but be careful  you really, really, really don't want burning fish broth exploding out of your blender and onto you/the kitchen.  It's not fun.

After you blend it (and hopefully don't scald yourself in the process), add it back to the pot and bring it back to medium-high heat.  Add your seafood at this point and cook for roughly 5 minutes.  The fish will cook really fast, so keep an eye on it.  If you want to add sliced sausage (I like to add spicy chicken sausage sometimes), cook the sausage beforehand and add it now.  Add the chopped and boiled potatoes (I usually just cut them in half or quarter them), and make sure you have enough salt/pepper.

This is a really hearty and comforting soup, sort of like New England Clam Chowder.  I like to eat it with some crusty bread and a green salad with vinaigrette and shaved radish/cucumber.  Enjoy! One of my go-to's from a local Israeli shawarma place. Thanks for this!Burrito bowl!

*  Make some rice or quinoa, mix in your spinach when the rice is almost done. Have a bag of frozen corn? Same deal, toss in a handful.

*  Rub the thighs with salt, pepper, cumin. Broil or bake. Shred it up when done. (Next time, try putting the thighs in a slow cooker with salsa on low for 4 hours, or in an oven-safe skillet with a bit of extra water for 1 hour at 350.)

*  Dice the green pepper. Leave it raw for crunch.

*  Top the rice with chicken, more salsa, avocado slices, green pepper, cilantro, lime juice. A bit of cheese or sour cream would be awesome here.

Could also go into a burrito, but I'm thinking you're more likely to have some rice in your cupboards. For this recipe using these amounts, it's 17 servings.[Look here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gqbjj/hummus_recipe_is_not_creamysmooth_enough/)/r/ketorecipes How many servings?Depends a lot on where you live, what kind of diet you keep (meat lover or vegan?) and what level of money you can spend on stocking up.

If you can, in the beginning, spend extra money stocking up pantry items, and be flexible enough to buy lots of pantry items when they are on sale in the future, than you can get your **overall** budget much lower than someone who can only ever spend $20 at a time.

In my high cost of living area, I feel damned proud when my grocery total for 2 comes in around $400/mo. In Texas, I was able to do $200/mo. I include cleaning products, shampoo, TP, fancy coffee beans, and beer in that budget. We do eat out 1-2 times a week, and we budget restaurants /bars/ entertainment separately.

Cooking for one will be less efficient than cooking for more. Recipes are designed around, say, one can of tomatoes, and make 4 servings. You can't buy half a can of tomatoes, even though you only want 2 servings. So, you end up halving it, and wasting half a can of tomatoes. Or you cook the whole batch, and have leftovers for a few days straight.

So I suggest, you start cooking recipes for 4+ servings, and freeze portions of them. Eventually, you'll have a variety of meals to pull from, and might only need to cook 2 or 3 times a week. And no leftovers fatigue!Cheers!I would give it a shot,  But almond meal seems to crumble on me too often for my liking, but if it can bind and hold the bar together then I'd go for it. Charlie Day would like a word with you.Thanks! Egg is one of those ingredients that once you start incorporating it in things you can't stop because the creamyness is too good.

Plus it has great macros, a little high in cholesterol, but it's good cholesterol so there's nothing to worry about. &gt;everything's a remix

Should be reddit's new motto.That sounds like a good start to me.

If you're like me and unable to plan far enough ahead to use a slow cooker I highly recommend a good pressure cooker, it pays massive time dividends.Deviled eggs with the yolk replaced with cauliflower mash.  A lower cholesterol alternative!Double whammy: add apples to your oatmeal! Either cooked or raw, I do this almost every morning, sometimes with extra berries or a banana. You can hide lots of healthy things in smoothies. I add kale, spinach, carrots, apples, peanut butter, almond butter, chia seeds, etc.Good point. I'm in Ohio and have access to plenty of grocery store chains (Aldi's, Kroger, WalMart) and have close proximity to both a Sam's and a Costco.

I have preliminarily budgeted $400/month for food, figuring on a few nights out where I spend more than typical. My schedule gets pretty busy so I think planning ahead is going to be key to keep myself from falling back into the eating out all the time routine.Inspired by that crazy whole roasted cauliflower recipe making the rounds through the food blogs, I made this the other day:

1 small/med head cauliflower
3T plain low-fat yogurt  *(NOT greek yogurt- need the thin consistancy of low fat yogurt)*
3T curry paste (I used Pataks tikka paste)

Chop cauliflower into medium florets. Mix yogurt and paste in a small bowl and pour over cauliflower, tossing to coat. You can let it marinate if you want (I didn't). Place on a greased cookie sheet in a single layer. Roast at 400-425 degrees for about 20 minutes until brown and crispy along the edges.Nice, I have to try these! Post workout carbs (and carbs is general) are essential to building muscle. Until I learned this and actually followed my carb macros (always followed my protein macros), I did not have as much gains. Also, by consuming a large portion of your carbs just after lifting (not cardio), you are more likely to build muscle rather than fat. Unlike when you are sedentary or engaging in low activity for a long period of time. need to make sure you rinse them very well.  I also found the more I blended them, the less "bean" you could taste.   I like the black bean brownies.  I'v added peanut butter in mine at times as well :)you can get just regular shredded coconut, but it's going to take some looking; my local market carries it as does Costco.   in most grocery stores for about 60+ years now, there has been bags of VERY sweet coconut.  Couldn't tell you how it was sweetened as I haven't had the stuff since I was a kid.I love making black bean brownies.  It's almost like it's ok to eat them woops, yeah, i'll go edit and be more specific First of all, location affects price.  A $50 grocery trip for me might be a $100 trip for you, or the other way around. The nearest grocery store to my house is 10% more expensive on average than one five minutes further, for example. And I live in a fairly isolated part of Canada so I don't see the numbers most people post for their groceries unless there's a 50% off sale.

If you have a bit of time to commit to this project I'd track your normal spending for a week to a month to get a baseline then see what you can cut out or change to bring it down. For example, maybe you decide to only buy cheese when it's on sale and freeze it until you need it. (This works, but it gets really crumbly when it thaws.)

It's easier to compare yourself to yourself than to other people and it's more motivating to say objectively measurable things, like "I spent 20% less than last month!".oooh! a new subreddit to stalk! THANK YOU! (: (I probably will post there once I get around to prepping my next few meals!)Let me know if you like it :) I want to own a restaurant some day and I have been playing around with recipes lately and I was trying to see how well pumpkin substitutes for eggs and milk.

Also when you mix it, it will be very thick but that is okay because it still comes out great :)  Recipe (with pictures): http://imgur.com/a/tHLBaText recipe for those who don't feel like going through the pictures:

Could you be more specific? Are you looking for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, or snacks?
One of my favorite dinner dishes is spicy cabbage and Greek yogurt. I don't use a formal recipe, but basically you saute onions, cabbage and hot peppers together, stir in some soy sauce and serve with yogurt on top.It could be that I just added enough garlic and cheese to mask the difference in flavor. Thank you so much for that recipie! I'll stop at target after work today and try it out, it sounds super delicious,  I love blueberries and pumpkins! Thank you!I make cauliflower mash all the time. I discourage anyone from comparing them to potatoes though. Similar in color and texture but very different in flavor and it's never pleasing to think of one flavor as you're biting into an entirely different one. That's just my two cents.

If I have cream cheese or sour cream on hand, I'll throw some of that in with the cauliflower for a creamy dish. Another thing to try is adding chicken broth to thin it out into a soup. Yeah, that's what I get for replying to comments from my inbox on a phone (^~^)I oven roasted a head yesterday with cumin, chipotle pepper powder, salt and pepper. Was delightful. Pasta dishes are usually good frozen; if you load up things like lasagna, large shells, or mac&amp;cheese with vegetables (spinach, eggplant, tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms) and use less cheese and sauce it can feel more "fresh". I've been looking to find a nice way to introduce more protein into my diet, and this looks like it is going to be solid. I'm also going to keep an eye on what other people are saying in the thread, because it seems they have alternative solutions that might not be as heavy on the carbs side. Still an awesome recipe!It's 5k for the whole batch, a little over 400/barOne of my favorite ways to make salmon is with soy sauce and fresh ginger.
1/4c soy sauce &amp; 1tbs grated ginger per lb of salmon. Marinate for 30min-1hour then broil until the fish is done.ah okay, might have to try thenI could use something like this at my work. Quick to eat and would stave my appetite until dinner. I work as a nurse aide for evenings.These are easy and really good either as a snack or side http://www.skinnytaste.com/2013/01/spicy-buffalo-cauliflower-bites.htmlWere you posting this in reply to me? I think you stared a new comment chainAs an American observing Americans, all I can say is Americans are weirder than everyone thinks they areThanks!That's good to know! I used to live in Japan and ate more veggies there, but fruits were pretty expensive. I'll try to eat more apples (I love apples) and veggies. Thank you so much for the explanation!Check out /r/keto or /r/paleo for lots of ideas.

When I was on keto, I loved substituting potatoes with cauliflower. Cheesey mashed cauli is one of my favorites and the cheese gives you enough calories to keep you from feeling empty.

I'm also big into stuffed peppers. A sriracha-neufchatel filling in small red peppers makes a delicious and low-carb appetizer!What world do we live in where that shit supposedly tastes good?Where do you buy Xylitol?

Do you use normal sweetened peanut butter?Since you haven't heard, the health benefits of brown rice are plentiful.  Please see some examples:

1. Brown rice is rich in selenium which reduces the risk for developing common illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and arthritis.
2. One cup of brown rice provides 80% of our daily manganese requirements. Manganese helps the body synthesize fats. Manganese also benefits our nervous and reproductive systems.
3.Naturally occurring oils are beneficial for the body as these healthful fats help normalize cholesterol levels.
4.The antioxidant capacity of brown rice is right up there with blueberries, strawberries, and other fruits and vegetables.
5. Brown rice is high in fiber and on top of the list for foods that can help prevent colon cancer.
[source](http://www.vegkitchen.com/tips/10-reasons-why-brown-rice-is-the-healthy-choice/)

One of the few down sides to brown rice, and rice overall is that is it a higher calorie food.  If adding one more ingredient, one more step (I like cold food) and $.10-.15 per serving will allow me to double my intake of brown rice and all its health benefits without increasing calories, that's a no brainer.   If $.10-15 isn't cheap, and that list of health benefits isn't healthy, I don't want to imagine what you are doing to fix your fupa fungus.
Similar to a brownie but with coconut and cranberries inside + almonds on top.Easy breakfast or a post-workout recovery snack.It's the only option at most stores here, and doesn't taste bad. $1/ 30g protein is close to the best price:protein ratio you can get.So I also hopped on the cauliflower mashed potato thing last night, and it worked out pretty decently.

I took one bag of frozen cauliflower and steamed it in the microwave, put it through a cheese grater (a ricer or blender/food processor would work better but I don't have those), then added it to a pot with butter, garlic, and Parmesan to taste (you can also use milk or cream if you want, but if you grate it thin enough the texture is okay either way). I'm not sure exactly how much butter to add because I put too much in, and I need to correct that for next time.

It turned out well, could probably be improved by adding milk and having less butter, but a good potato substitute if you want to go keto, paleo, or low-carb. One bag of frozen cauliflower makes about 2 large or 3 medium servings of mash once shredded finely.This is quickly becoming one of my favorite weeknight dinner/post-gym meals; it's crazy easy/low effort and the payoff is huge.  I marinate the chicken earlier in the day and when I'm ready to cook it takes about 30-40 minutes to whip the final pieces together/bake the chicken.

IT'S SOOO GOOD. The red onions are the unexpected star of this dish - I always add extra onions now because they are seriously the best part.

I also up the garlic and have started adding a hefty pinch of garam masala to the marinade just as personal preference.

For the homemade raita I watered down some greek yogurt, squeezed some lemon, added salt, pepper, raw garlic, some more diced heirloom tomatoes, and a pinch of garam masala again.

Obviously it could be made cheaper or more expensive depending on the add-ons you choose to include. The recipe suggests a bunch, but we tend to go pretty simple for dieting purposes.

Original recipe can be found [here](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017161-oven-roasted-chicken-shawarma):

**INGREDIENTS**


- 2 lemons, juiced
-  cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled, smashed and minced
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons paprika
-  teaspoon turmeric
- A pinch ground cinnamon
- Red-pepper flakes, to taste
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 large red onion, peeled and quartered
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

**PREPARATION**

1. Prepare a marinade for the chicken. Combine the lemon juice, 1/2 cup olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon and red-pepper flakes in a large bowl, then whisk to combine. Add the chicken, and toss well to coat. Cover, and store in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.

2. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 425. Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rimmed sheet pan. Add the quartered onion to the chicken and marinade, and toss once to combine. Remove the chicken and onion from the marinade, and place on the pan, spreading everything evenly across it.
Put the chicken in the oven, and roast until it is browned, crisp at the edges and cooked through, about 30 to 40 minutes.

3. Remove from the oven, allow to rest 2 minutes, then slice into bits. (To make the chicken even more crisp, set a large pan over high heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, then the sliced chicken, and saut until everything curls tight in the heat.) Scatter the parsley over the top and serve with tomatoes, cucumbers, pita, white sauce, hot sauce, olives, fried eggplant, feta, rice  really anything you desire.The average price of any whey protein is $1 a serving unless you are buying a cheaper brand in bulk then you might get down to .83*  Ham steak. They're like $3/ea. Fry in a pan. Make a glaze with the pan drippings and brown sugar and apple cider vinegar.

*  Oven roasted asparagus. Just wash, salt, pepper, oil, bake. Asparagus is a bit pricy, but my favorite spring veg. Brussels sprouts are also awesome roasted and can be cheaper.

*  Scalloped potatoes. Make in advance, bake on Sunday. Just sliced potatoes, cream (or milk), salt, pepper, butter (or olive oil).

I don't do a recipe for the scalloped potatoes, just kinda eyeball things. Butter a big dish, slice up 4lbs of potatoes (into a bowl of water, else they'll brown), and thinly slice an onion. On a pot, melt 2 Tbs of butter, stir in 2 Tbs of flour and cook into a paste (this is called roux). Then add 1qt of milk or cream (or a combo), and a bay leaf, a pinch of nutmeg, (white) pepper and salt to taste. Simmer until thickened. Layer in the potatoes and onions in your big dish. Pour the sauce on top. At this point, bake right away or refrigerate for up to 2 days. You can also top this with cheese. Bake at 350 for an hour, or until bubbly and brown.

I know an hour seems like a long time, but you'll just come home and immediately throw it in the oven. Then go get changed and start to cook the rest. The asparagus will take 30-40 minutes in the oven, so start that next. The ham only takes 5 minutes, so do that last. Everything should be ready at the same time. I've tried making brownies with beans twice, and both times they've tasted like sweetened beans. Not terrible, but not something I'd make again.  Even my husband who will devour any dessert around  took a few days to finish them off. Any mexican/tex-mex leftovers can be cooked up and added to some scrambled eggs. Enchiladas, taco fillings, fajitas, rice &amp; beans, etc. All are awesome with eggs for breakfast (or breakfast for dinner). Toss it in a corn tortilla and have breakfast tacos. Yum!Why would you replace meals with this stuff?Oatmeal does double duty by replacing foods high in dietary cholesterol, and can lower blood serum lipids with soluble fiber.

Increasing your fiber intake at all your meals can also decrease your bad cholesterol. Your lifelong avoidance of fruit and veg might have more to do with your high cholesterol than your daily eggs.sugar, water, purpleokay so I just did this, this morning and it was amazing.   I got 2 boxes of jiffy brand blueberry muffin mix.  (they cost 72 cents each where I am)  and instead of adding the egg or milk it calls for, I added only 1/2 a cup of pumpkin (canned pumpkin you can find at any main grocery store.)  I have also seen articles about pumpkin and its ability to help bad cholesterol.

So that is it, bake regularly as instructed on the box, 400 degrees for 12ish minutes.

They are amazing and not horrible on the nutrition side, because they are just the mix and pumpkin.  They also taste really great after refrigeration so I do them at night so I can have one or two in the mornings.

Also, I work a desk job.  I stay healthy by figuring out how many calories I will be burning which is very few, and eating about that every day. I put salt, garlic and pepper on pretty much anything hot. Don't use many other spices. Zaatar is the best! I forgot about this stuff. Growing up, our next door neighbors were Lebanese and the mother would always come over to share fresh pita to dip in olive oil or some goat yoghurt and sprinkle with zaatar. I make really good stuffed mushrooms, the filling requires a lot of breadcrumbs. Take the stems out of the mushrooms (use big ones, so there is more room to fill) and finely chop them. Mix them with an equal amount of breadcrumbs. Season generously with salt, pepper and parsley. Stir in olive oil until everything sticks together. Put the filling back in the mushrooms and bake them until they look good. I think the surface is going to brown.if his calorie, protein, and carb counts are correct, then there would be ~220g fat in the complete recipe, or ~18g per bar.Thanks, this was very helpful.That is one intense documentary!  I've slowly moved away from meat-centric recipes but more because I've been focusing on nutrition and meals that I can prep for the week.  My current favorites are [Quinoa Caprese Bake](http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/creamy-caprese-quinoa-bake/) and [Lebanese Bean Salad](http://cookieandkate.com/2013/lemon-parsley-bean-salad-and-hummus/)Eat a piece of fruit and some toast. Or use egg whitesI made cauliflower mashed "potatoes" last night. I boiled the cauliflower for 11 minutes, strained and put it in a food processor. I added a drizzle of olive oil, 1/4 milk (added a bit more to get a better consistency), a TBSP of minced garlic, and salt &amp; pepper to taste. I then added some cream cheese, which was delicious.

They came out pretty good and it was easy enough.I'm not familiar with chocolate whey, how is it $1 per scoop?!You could, but your end product will have a very different texture. I don't do much keto baking, but maybe experiment with oat bran? I like meat too much to cut it out of my diet completely, but my wife is in the same boat as you, so I do a lot of recipes that don't use a lot of meat, or cut out meat entirely.

Beans and mushrooms both have that 'meaty' feel to them, without being actual meat, so if you like that taste, they can be used in place of meats in a lot of different recipes. Black Bean and tomato chili is really good. Just make chili without the meat, add more onions, peppers, and a ton of beans, and you've got something passable.

I make a potato curry dish that doesn't have any meat, and still hits those savory notes. I boil the potatoes and make a thick butter/curry sauce, saute onions, garlic and ginger with something like cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon and tumeric, black pepper, add diced tomatoes, yogurt, clarified butter (regular butter works if you don't have/don't make clarified butter). Add the drained potatoes, and top with cilantro.

Falafel is great too, just grind up soaked chickpeas, parsley, salt and onion together, and fry them up. You can bake them if you want less oil too, but they don't have the same texture.

Vegetable stocks can make for some good soups or stews, Irish potato soup is one, just cut out the bacon.Milk, flour, vitamins...feed yourself for a month!What about fats?Energy balls.Thank you! I've searched a bit and found some oatmeal crockpot recipes online. I'll have to try them out next week!Apparently we are the only ones that look at that lot of ingredients and shudder lol.Sorry, that was not included in the quote from my previous comment.  Best way is to rinse and sort the dried beans then soak them overnight.  You can do a quick soak by covering the beans in boiling water and soaking for 1 hour.  After soaking bring to a boil then simmer for about an hour and a half or until tender.  I think pinto's work the best, but you could experiment with others (black beans would be great).  Thanks for the link--there are some really great ideas on there!

I'm a bit upset I've never thought to add poached eggs to alfredo or carbonara.  Looking back, they seem an obvious fit for any basic, cheese coated pasta.

Cheers!Cauliflower Pizza crusts

1 medium-large head cauliflour
splash of water
1 oz soft cheese (goat, cream, velveeta)
0.5 - 1 oz Parmesan cheese
1 medium/large egg (do not use an extra large egg)
Sauce and cheese to top however you like your pizza.
1 tsp Salt

Core your cauliflower, and process/blend into cauliflower rice, so cauliflower is uniform, but not so over-processed it becomes a paste.

Transfer to a nonstick pan on medium-high, with a splash of water and 1 tsp salt and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the water cooks out, and remove from heat. Place the cauliflower into a clean towel, and wait to cool.

When the cauliflower cools to where you can handle it, squeeze out as much water as you can. Make sure to get out every bit of water you can, since too much moisture can and will ruin the end product. After you've pressed out as much water as you can, add the egg, soft cheese, and Parmesan to the bowl. Mix thoroughly. It should have the consistency of a thick paste.

Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and flatten the paste to the shape of a pizza. I recommend covering the 'crust' with plastic wrap, and pressing it out to a uniform thickness of around 1/8 - 1/4 inch thick.

Place in the center of a 400F oven, and bake for 30-40 minutes. Rotate every 10-15 minutes so it cooks evenly.

Transfer to a wire rack, and let it cool. It should resemble a pizza crust, both in look and in texture. Top however you like, and bake just to melt the cheese/cook the toppings.

Just a note, this isn't meant to replace pizza, but for people with a restricted diet (celiacs, low-carb, etc), this is incredibly tasty, and really works well to make something known as unanimously bad for you a bit better.I'm gagging at what I imagine the texture to be... Is it really clumpy or can you get it to be pretty smooth?Those oats are giving me pause, especially since my fiance is on a ketogenic diet and has eliminated grains completely. Do you think maybe almond meal could be substituted for that, or would that worsen the absorbency of the dry ingredients too much?Yes! That's great, I love oatmeal. I am worried that it's a lot of carbs for someone who doesn't have an exercise schedule yet and works a desk job.I just do oatmeal. You can add different flavors to it if you get bored and it's really cheap when you buy the big containers.I should also note I don't have any food allergies, but due to OAS,  it's difficult for me to eat certain raw fruits and vegetables.

I also have a regular set of pots and pants, oven, crockpot,  and electric kettle.Have you looked into oatmeal? It's super cheap and yet also great tasting. *  Might as well store it in the fridge, it will slow the separation of oil and solids.

*  The issue is with the fat going rancid. (which you can easily smell or taste) You can mitigate this some by salting it, and with refrigeration. If it's summer, and you don't refrigerate it, I'd say a 2-3 months. In the fridge/cool storage 6+ months. Since this is so hydroscopic there is not the typical concern of bacteria growing, just the flavors going off. Using cooked almonds further reduces this risk.

*  You'll have to experiment, but a typical size peanut butter jar is 1lbs. (So you'd need 1lbs of nuts). Your concern should be finding the optimum volume for your blender/food processor, instead of the yield.

*  You shouldn't need too. However, considering the other fats in your diet, Almonds are relatively high in Omega 6s (which typical Western diets are too high in) and very very low in Omega 3s (which we all can probably use more of). So if you wanted to supplement with a high omega 3 oil like flax, this would be a good place to do it.

*  Up to you. Typical almond butter is not peeled. Also blanched, peeled almonds will cost more.

*  Again up to you. Toasting basically makes everything better, so I do. Also, reduces moisture content, making it last longer.

Experimenting with your food processor/blender will show you the optimum height/volume for getting the almonds to hit the blades. This is the key issue you need to work out. If you've got a large processor, you won't get things churning with like, a half cup of almonds.
Energy is given in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kj), and everything else is in grams.yeah these sound really good!  I'd like to try them out.  Congrats on healing up and almost getting back into it!Also, everyone needs to use the Mexican seasoning pack Sazon. It makes everything taste like it came from the restaurant.Update: it is much better with rolled oats. OP use rolled oats lol.

Also random, but i tried it with yogurt (literally eating it right now) an I can verify it is AWESOME.Makes sense. I simply wondered because everything else was in imperial measurements, and I'm not familiar enough with nutrition measurements to know of any conventions in this regard.I think I'll do just that! I recently healed up enough to start working out again and these "fuel cookies" as we called them do great to supply energy right before workouts!you should make them and post it here!Peanut butter cookies may be a better option. I use 1 cup of PB, 1 cup of protein powder, 1 tsp baking powder, 2 eggs, and 1 cup of Xylitol. I usually just eyeball the ingredients, so I'm not sure what my exact measurements are, honestly. I'll have to make them and take pics.Cauliflower and broccoli casserole, my favourite. Can be eaten hot or cold, for breakfast, lunch, dinner... you name it. Looks nice, too.

You will need:

- 1 small cauliflower head and 1-2 broccoli heads, or any other proportion of cauliflower vs. broccoli, around 300g (less than 1 pound) total.
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 cup milk (+1-2 tbsp cream, optional)
- 2-3 tbsp flour (I use plain white)
- 150g plain yellow cheese, grated
- salt, ground black pepper, a bit of ground nutmeg or mustard or both

Boil water in a medium pot. Put cauliflower and broccoli, cut into florets (you decide how big they are), into boiling water for 2-3 minutes. Drain.

Mix eggs, milk and cream. When mixed evenly, add flour and spices, mix well. Add cheese.

Put cauliflower and broccoli into baking form (or pyrex dish). Pour the egg mix on it. Bake in a preheated oven (220C / 430F) for about 30-40 minutes.No because they are blended and are covered by the overpowering taste of the chocolate/flavoring.That Walmart whey though... *shudders* Black bean turkey burgers jamHuh. Is it normal for coconut to be "sweetened" in the states? What does that mean exactly, does anyone know? Is it sweetened with coconut sugar? Does it taste sweet? Has it just got, like, powdery sugar all over it, or is the sweetness somehow imbued in the coconut flesh? So many questions.

edit. I found [this article](http://www.thekitchn.com/sweetened-unsweetened-coconut-both-deserve-a-place-in-the-cupboard-ingredient-spotlight-186835) which answered most of my questions. I'd never heard of this before. I use unsweetened coconut in all my recipes and never had any problems. Now that I think about it though, I can see how the softer chewier kind would be necessary for eating uncooked, eg as a topping. It's almost certainly grams.You might want to look at how many carbs the flour has, and the beans, and the evaporated milk, and the cranberries.I see beans as an ingredient in many brownie/bar/whatever recipes.  Can you taste them once it is all mixed?  I really fucking hate beans. I buy these huge 5 pound bags of frozen vegetables, usually two at a time, and I buy other bags of frozen things to add in.  Like kale, spinach, and okra.  I also keep tons of canned veggies around.  Corn, green beans, cabbage and kraut, black beans, mushrooms, etc.  The only fresh stuff I keep are carrots, salad mix, leeks, and peppers.  My main snacks right now are raw nuts, pickles, and hummus.I do a lot of baking. You may be able to get away with replacing the beans with plain greek yogurt. You may have to add a little more dry ingredient to offset the wet, but it should still come out as lower carb.I recently started eating healthy, and it is fairly cheap to eat well. First off, I don't like beans at all, so you won't find any beans in my recipes, but beans are really cheap and really good for you, so eat them with every meal if you can. I switch up these meals and make different meals every time I cook.

1) In a pan throw some onions and peppers to cook them and brown the onions. Then, throw in chicken cut into small strips. Next put in some spices. For this I'd suggest paprika, salt, pepper, and some chili powder. Stir it all up, once the chicken is fully cooked, throw in a little bit of chicken broth (or water and chicken bouillon) to make a sauce. Serve this over rice or beans. Add some salsa or guac if you get bored of this. This is the only recipe I kind of made up myself.


2)Fried rice with either chicken, strimp, pork, any kind of low fat meat. http://damndelicious.net/2014/04/05/shrimp-fried-rice/

3) I make fajitas, which are kind of a spicy version of the first version, but they definitely taste different. I season the chicken with fajita seasoning taken from (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/fajita-seasoning/) with onions and peppers. Then I add in some chicken broth again, and serve it over rice/beans with guac and salsa if you want a change of flavor.

4) Simple grilled chicken with salt/pepper with a side salad.

5) If I am to lazy to make a meal or I cannot eat meat(lent), then I just eat guac over rice.

These are the meals I make regularly now. They are pretty cheap since they require just rice, chicken, and veggies, which can be bought frozen for like $1 per 16oz bag. The seasonings are pretty expensive starting out, but if you buy the seasonings in bulk, they do not cost that much and will last you a very long time.

These are the dinners, for lunch I am normally at work or school, so I try to go to Chipotle or grab a salad from some place. Salads are normally cheap, but aren't really filling. Chipotle only costs $7.04 after tax by me and is very filling and good for you. A burrito bowl with extra brown rice, chicken, veggies, corn salsa, and hot salsa can fill me up for most of the day and only have 600 calories tops.

Besides these meals, I eat fruit, veggies, yogurt, whole wheat toast with peanut butter, and pretzels. These get me through the day and are very healthy for you.

PS: Invest in a $30 rice cooker on amazon, they cook the rice perfectly for you, and they have delay timers on them so you can make the rice for yourself before you come home.
I always make fried rice or noodles out of my leftover... super easy.   another one that I learned recently is vietnamese vermicelli noodle salad: make rice vermicelli, then toss with leftover salad and any kind of meat that you want. Add nuoc cham sauce (you can get bottled or make your own: fish sauce, hot water, half a lime, sugar.. make sure you make it strong so you can taste the sauce when you mix it with the noodles)What is the unit for the nutrition measurements? "204 protein" doesn't really tell me a lot except for the ratio of protein to the other nutrients.One simple but useful seasoning blend you can learn is equal parts paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt. Then on top of this, add pepper to taste and chili powder or cayenne powder if you like it spicy. Chili powder you can add lots to increase the flavor, cayenne is more for heat and IMO tastes bad in large quantities. Seasoning is the act of making sure salt, acid, and fat contents are ballanced. This is always done to taste, as even gram - based recipes are not accurate enough , given variance in product and circumstance.

So, seasoning is not so much about making a certain flavor, but making your food taste good in that context.

Anyways, the number one failure is the lack of acid. Some staples are naturally acidic, such as tomatoes, but generally the acid will have to be added with vinegar, lemon juice, etc. But, the biggest problem home cooks neglect is fat content, (it is usually ignored, or shunne) , which is highly related to mouth feel and general satisfaction. Far and away the restaraunt industry addresses this with butter and/or olive oil and putting it on/in everything. There are other ways, generally by adding fat rich foods like avocado, nuts, or egg yolks (or some kind of fried garnish).

It is easy to be overwhelmed when learning how to cook, largely by the enormous mass of accumulated knowledge. Find a dish you can eat over again and a favorite recipe. Then, make mini versions adjusting the recipe ratios - this will bring an understanding of what your changes actually do.[Here it is](http://citrusandspicenom.blogspot.com/)

It's a project between my SO and I to take recipes we've found in the wild and redesigning them to fit our two diets.



* Mine being Marcos at 190g carbs, 160 g protein, and 50g fat per day

* Hers being dairy free and still satisfying, sans the fattiness of usual rich foods.


Posts have been sparse for the last few months as were halfway through coordinating a 3,000 mile move across the country so things have been a little hectic as of late. But I can assure you, more is to come. &gt; If it's successful would you mind if I add it to my blog? (Giving you credit of course)I try to lighten up dishes and such while retaining flavor.

Would you mind sharing the url of your blog? I like to do the same thing but I have never thought about recording my "experiments".Alright, so I used the same recipe from /u/blueAjah238 's post, and I had some left over because we forgot to eat it after dinner.

I took about a cup of oats, and toasted them (dry, in a skillet, toss it around.) I folded that in to the dough after it cooled.

Next, repeated the process with about a cup or more of milled flax seed. Sprinkled a little bit into the dough, folded it in. Like literally a little bit, couple pinches for this amount.

The topping is a unique blueberry faux jelly I made with sugar and flax seed. It's not great so I will hold off on the recipe for that. It's good, but I wanted something that would be kind of like the "jelly" topping on protein bars. This ALMOST did it, but not quite.

Anyway, I figured I'd add it here because oats, flax, and frozen fruit are all cheap, and all pretty healthy, minus the sugar, but there's ways around that.

Flattened, cut into bars, baked at ~400^f (~200^c ) on parchment paper, chilled quickly.

tastes amazing!
Go ahead, everything's a remix :)Glad to hear that you're going to keep improving this recipe! I wish I could subscribe to your progress with it.Yeah like I said they look like a great alternative to expensive builders or quest bars.


I might whip up a batch of these tomorrow with some alternate ingredients and see what I can do.


If it's successful would you mind if I add it to my blog? (Giving you credit of course)I try to lighten up dishes and such while retaining flavor. This is the third time I've made them, but the first in which I actually tallied up the macros. Definitely going to balance the ratio next time with less oats and chocolate chips. Probably drop the flour altogether and just replace it all with whey to get closer to 25g/bar protein (300g) with less carbs.

Still, I usually eat one after the gym and it's served me right. More calories than an equivalently-priced protein bar for dat anabolism.Try stir fry.  Cheap, and tasty.  I used to make it almost every night because you can just switch up what veggies you want to use that week.  And since the bulk of the dish is the veggies you can make a 1lb package of chicken breast (try and find pastured chicken if you still feel guilty, its better for you anyways) last the better part of a week.Wow. This looks delicious but that's A LOT  of carbs vs the protein content. IIFYM and all that but that's almost a 1/3rd of my daily carb intake but only 10% of my daily protein.


This looks like a fantastic recipe but I think a lot of people will have a hard time fitting this into their diet. Taste &amp; smell everything. Start simple, go with single spices, and stay away from spice mixes to better your understanding of each spice.Good method. You can also take a spoonful of food out of the pan, add the spices and taste. Oregano goes great with eggs as well.My biggest flavour advice: garlic, lots of it, and fresh. It's so tasty and good for you and improves almost everything! And the fresh part is important. As Anthony Bourdain says, "if you're too lazy to peel fresh garlic, you don't deserve to use it." I'd say swap. More frozen veggies- less everything else. Play with amounts and only cook one portion per meal/ immediately store leftovers in fridge and freezer.I always try to use fresh garlic and onions. It's really easy to chop an onion or mince a bulb of garlic, and the result I find is much better. Onigiri!canned tuna mixed with mayo and seasoning on top of leftover/microwave rice, with rice vinegar and a few strips of nori. it's like a bowl of poor-person sushi.Basil grows like CRAZY. If you keep up with its water demand and trim it diligently, it will seriously get huge and live a long time for a season plant. So don't underestimate the size of the pot.

Jealous of your deck. Several big pots, not so many that they take up too much space, will be great for basil and lavender. I cook with lavender, most don't... take advantage of that deck and get herbs that grow big. Many of us think of kitchen herbs are being cute lil things on the windowsill, but they can grow large and wide if given the space. Mint, parsley, rosemary, and thyme are all fairly wide-use herbs.

Honestly, despite what I just said about the size of herbs, I'd plant them in a "window box" along your railing and use the open floor space for tomatoes, lemons, and strawberries etc. Easy apartment crops. I know you said herbs but there's nothing better than making your own tomato sauce out of fresh basil AND tomatoes.Can you use any sort of beans? Are any beans not suitable?
Do you use the dried beans or do you keep them in water first?

Thanks!

No more nuts for you, lol. Learn how to cook so you can make even rice and lentils delicious. You can still buy meat if you get discount stuff. Eggs are a good protein replacement at $1-2 for a dozen. Honestly daily vegetables will cover a lot of your nutrition, more than most people get, you just have to decide where to get your proteins and fats from. Avocados, eggs, olive oil etc.

A slow cooker will be really nice to make a ton of food at once for leftovers that's ready when you get home. It will also make the cheapest, shittiest cuts of meat tender and delicious.It would be dishes, but my boyfriend does that when I cook. I'd say space. Even with a kitchen island the apartment didn't originally come with, I'm always crowded and making a mess and balancing dishes because nothing fits.Cheese isn't unhealthy. Just buy good cheese that's made of real milk/cream and not a lot else. Most cheese substitutes are going to be worse for you, in fact.iced coffee with rich cream, or homemade lemonade. I'll usually infuse the simple syrup in the lemonade with basil or ginger or something to have some fun and make interesting.

homemade pomegranate juice is a lot of fun if you have a blender.water as a drink is an acquired taste like anything else. my boyfriend used to only drink soda and now he never does, and drinks water out of enjoyment. it is the most delicious thing once you're used to it and your body gets used to being well-hydrated.

i can respect that some people will never like plain water, but just like black coffee and red wine, you can definitely learn to like it.cold brew coffee with cream or milk.Eat less :) done that a few times..

You can get many meals out of a whole chicken, especially if you stuff it and use the stuffing for other things. Buy meat on sale (not just sale but like, "this meat is going to expire soon so it has a 50% off sticker on it") and freeze it until use. Omelettes are less than a dollar depending on what you put in em. Foods like hold a lot of water or expand are very filling, like beans or rice or vegetables. Instant noodles are SO cheap and you can fancy them up with a bit of stir fry, honey/sugar, soy sauce, meat source or eggs scrambled in.

My bf and I spend about 50 a week and we do this by not eating breakfast, buying sale items, shopping at the cheapest grocery store in town, and having lots of things stockpiled that turn poor people ingredients into good food (spices, herbs, seasoning, oils, vinegars, etc).So insted of reducing the portion of rice, you want to;

- Cook the rice

- Add coconut oil

- Cool the rice

- Reheat the rice

You are using more time, ingredients and money to do the same thing as just reducing the amount of rice by 60 % or roughly half.

&gt; can slash calories by as much as 60%.

Doesn't sound so *cheap* and or *healthy*. Sounds like you want to eat without punitive.if I could pick one thing it would be eggs. protein, good fats, hella micronutrients, about 3000 ways to cook them.raw vegans are obsessed with bananas. I swear it gets crazier every time I hear that fruit mentioned.Good flavor mixes

Garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes

Hot salsa, apricot jam cooked together

Canned peaches, butter, white wine on meat

Soy sauce, whiskey, chopped onions, minced garlic, and olive oil as a marinadeI'm sorry I can't answer your question... but that is nuts. I was really certain it would be some gimmick that doesn't translate to real life. If it works, you changed my life LOLCounting calories is all you need to do. If you want to be healthy too, focus on fiber and low-sugar, and any combination of healthy foods you like. People debate *forever* about high protein or lowcarb-highfat or high carb plant diets... it's whatever man, you just need less calories. Different people like different methods, find what works for you. However, across all these theories, the 2 most valuable consistencies I have found is that fibre makes you fuller, and sugar not only makes you hungrier but makes it physiologically harder to lose fat and psychologically harder to quit shitty foods.

Don't overthink it. Eat less. Anything else is a bonus.Ask your parents if you can go grocery shopping with them. They probably won't get mad at you for putting something healthy in the cart, it's chicken breast not doritos. Unless money is a large concern.

If you're eating a high protein diet, save up for some good protein powder. In the meantime, focus on meals based on eggs, chicken, beef, and pork. Pork especially is very cheap compared to other meats, just get the leaner cuts if you're worried about calories. Learn how to stir fry or slow-cook the cheap cuts of meat too, they're cheap because they're tough but you can cook the toughness out of them.So close yet so far... just an 11 hour drive :(Another thing to take away from this is the 'profiles'. If you want something to taste a bit Italian then it is these spices, if you want a Mexican flavor then it is these other spices. Keep that in mind while you're spicing things up and you'll almost always end up with something good.No problem... I also forgot to mention food prep days.

Basically you spend some time on the weekend to prep food for the rest of the week. This can be for all meals, not just lunch, like breakfast burritos in the morning. Basically prep food one 1 day, then refrigerate/freeze for the rest of the week.

Those subs are good for prepared lunch ideas. Also, slow cooked stew/meat is good for lunches, and you can load it up with as much veg as you want.Wow, thank you for the detailed response!  I'll have to look around and see if I can't make that work.  Hopefully I can make something work, cuz good god there's so much goddamn sodium in *everything*!Buy greek yogurt and replace all sour cream with plain greek yogurt or plain yogurt. This means put that on your lasagana, potatoes, chili, tacos, nachos and anything else you normally use sour cream on.

If you like cottage cheese buy that as well.

If know how to make pasta. Buy pasta noddles and frozen veggies and make veggie pasta salad. Or make chicken/beef pasta. If you can make ramen you can make red sauce pasta.

You could also start microwaving or steaming frozen veggies as well to munch on.

If you are terrible at cooking buy some frozen fruit with granola and oats even some oat cereal and mix that up with yogurt and drink a protein shake or drink a glass of milk and have a peanut butter/j sandwich with it.

Also if your parents don't mind you can ask them to cook meals you aren't capable of and offer to clean the dishes. Or even try what BigBubbles said and do the monthly grocery shopping for healthier food.



&gt;Are you talking just the ones found in packages? Or are you saying over-the-counter is unhealthy too?

They're both the same unless you go to a proper butcher. That being said, a proper butcher that will not have the processed ham/turkey/chicken/salami is best. No good meat comes like [this](http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/00/20/86/96/00/0020869600000_500X500.jpg). So if you see this, avoid it.

Going to a butcher, and asking them to slice you up some type of meat that you like is probably best as long as they don't reach for one of those compressed logs of shit like in the pic.

&gt;It's hard to eat an easy-to-prepare, healthy lunch that fills you up. :/

Yeah it sure is. What my fiancee does, is have the leftovers from dinner the night before. I usually have hard boiled eggs, yoghurt packed with muesli, and  shredded coconut, PB2, and a protein shake. For variety I'll replace the HB eggs with egg/chicken/tuna/sardine salad.

Instead of getting smoked chicken, or turkey from the shit logs, you could cook a full chicken or turkey, and shave off what you want for sandwiches, after you eat the breasts/wings/legs. Or eat the legs/wings/shavings, and use the breasts for lunch meat.

I have an uncle who owns a restaurant, and we would get him to make [Loukaniko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loukaniko) for us. He would have all the meat, and we would bring the greenery from our garden. If you can't do that, make friends with some hillbilly/redneck/hunter types. They love to make their own sausages, jerky, etc. Plus they will usually have a lot of left over meat from hunting that you can stick in your freezer. At that point, you can invest in a deli slicer, and slice up your own lunch meats.Good for you. I can easily cut out red meat but I love chicken.. I don't know if I could ever give up on chicken :P
Frequent grocery shopping is not an issue for me as I live very close to the supermarket. I think this is making me wasteful though ('ahh this carrot is going bad, just gonna go walk to the shops and buy new bag of carrots). How do you manage to only go to the supermarket twice a month when you eat so much veg? If anything I imagine that I will need to do more grocery runs, as veg (especially salad &amp; leaves type of thing) goes bad pretty quickly.... any tips?This. You can even find bread and go for the "premo" either costs 99 cents or 2$ that has 4-6gs of protein a slice with peanut butter.Loveeee Tempeh. Here is recipe for Tempeh, Indonesian style:
Chop tempeh to cubes, then fry them until golden.
in the mean time chop some garlic, shallots, and chilli.
Stir fry garlic, shallots and chilli until fragrant, stir in some kecap manis (google it) and then toss the fried tempeh in the sauce.

The thing with tempeh is... it's $5 per 500 gram here so it's very $$$ (I'm in Sydney Australia)

What do you eat with refried beans? Do you just eat it with nachos, guacamole &amp; mexican type of thing? can you eat it with something else?&gt; Deli Meats

What would you recommend instead?  Are you talking just the ones found in packages?  Or are you saying over-the-counter is unhealthy too?  It's hard to eat an easy-to-prepare, healthy lunch that fills you up. :/Eat a ton of peanut butter. Great tasting, cheap source of protein. Peanut butter and banana sandwiches, pb&amp;j, I make a great protein shake with a banana, peanut butter, chocolate protein, a few ice cubes and a half cup or so of milk. I also like mixing canned tuna, a little mayo and hot sauce and eating that in a sandwich. Drink a ton of water, a glass of milk and a glass of OJ a day. Yogurt is good too. As for veggies, I buy a pack of baby carrots and eat them plain or dip them in hummus (if it's on sale). I take a multivitamin to get the vitamins my diet doesn't provide. Coming from a broke ass college student who doesn't like salad. Do you have a recipe you use for fish stew? That sounds amazing right now, and I like your username!You might not see this but hit up your local Asian market and snap up a few packs of Indian spice mixes. Shit is so good.Came here to say this. 2 bags mint, 3 bags black, and a lemon per half-gallon of hot water.

A lot of great info in that sub.I believe certain discount retailers (e.g. Wal-Mart, Aldi, Food 4 Less) stock lower-grade produce (US No. 2-3), which tends to be less uniform in appearance/"defective" and prone to faster spoilage than No. 1 or Fancy grade produce. Cilantro and lime round out the four with cumin and oregano I usually make sure to include in a "Mexican" dish. Often I'll also add paprika.I did the same thing at the turn of the new year.  I was making meat the centerpiece of every meal, now I only eat it once a day and I limit it to less than 300 calories.  I also cut out all red meat except for very rare treats at restaurants.  Cheap, yeah, it really is especially if you can keep fresh produce from going to waste.  I was shopping for groceries twice a week before now it's more like twice a month.  It's really great.  The two major changes I made was adding a lot of sweet potatoes and some wild rice.  I was doing the whole high fat thing, but with so much less protein and fat I added these carbs back in to balance things out.  I honestly haven't noticed a single thing from this change.  It's all good.Ever tried tempeh? Cube it up, fry it in some canola oil for 5-10 minutes add to stir fry, breakfast potatoes etc.

Also, learn how to make refried beans.  Infinitely better than canned.  Bean burrito for lunch, never miss the meat

Edit:
&gt;Refried beans are really easy. I make 4 cups dried pintos as described by others here. In a heavy deep sided pan or dutch oven heat anywhere from 2-8 tablespoons of olive oil, saut 1 onion and 1 jalapeo diced for 10 minutes (more oil equals richer beans, less if you are watching fat and cals.). Add 1-2 cloves minced garlic for the last minute. When the beans are done cooking, drain off the majority of the water reserving several cups. Add the beans and a small amount of liquid to the onion jalapeno mixture and begin mashing with a potato masher. At this point you can either continue mashing until smooth, or employ an immersion mixer until smooth. Add roughly 4-6 teaspoons of kosher salt, and add a little bit of the reserved bean liquid. It should be a bit looser than you want your finished beans. Cook on medium low heat, so that it just bubbles a little bit for 15 minutes or so scraping the edges and bottom frequently. Cool before storing. Makes about 10 cups. Keeps a little over a week in the refrigerator. I usually freeze about half. I think that's it, let me know if anything is unclear. You will never go back to canned refried beans again.
The mods should take these infographics plus the one above about spices and put it in the sidebar. These things are informative and aesthetically pleasing.Just wanted to add.. don't forget the **beet greens**! Mince 1 clove garlic, add 1 Tbsp oil, and saute up those beet greens with a sprinkle of s&amp;p. Delicious.

Here's a similar recipe for gardeners who want to thin out young beets:

[Uncle Bill's Creamed Young Beets and Tops] (http://www.food.com/recipe/uncle-bills-creamed-young-beets-and-tops-182999)
If I have a leftover **rice** I like to make this [Salmon Rice Pie] (http://www.food.com/recipe/salmon-rice-pie-83812). The crust is made of 1 1/2 cups rice, 1 cup grated cheese, and an egg. I substitute one Costco salmon patty for canned.

/r/veganrecipesI've been living in Mexico for almost a year and I'd say that they use much less cumin that in other parts of Latin America. On the other hand, Tex Mex food uses a lot of cumin. just for Mexican cuisine. We use regular oregano in Chile and I think it tastes much better.Really it depends on what you define as healthy. Calling something "healthy" doesn't necessarily mean anything. Do you mean low calorie? Low fat? Low sodium? High in vitamins and minerals? A good macro balance?

Everything in moderation is my motto. :)This. Is . Exactly. What. This . Sub. Is . For.

Excellent comment! [For those willing to try it...it will be worth it!](http://www.amazon.com/Marmite-125g/dp/B000EZWHZW)I make a huge pot of beans once a month and freeze them in ziplock bags (lay them flat so you can stack them after they're frozen). They're super convenient to add to stuff and I can season them however I want. My favorite flavors so far are garlic, spicy, taco seasoning, and chilli powder.Throw a spoonful of peanut butter, some frozen veggies, and siracha in with your ramen.Just don't mess with Cylons.I've heard honey actually is a little bit better than table sugar or some other equivalent, basically because of what's summarized here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/09/healthy-sugar-honey_n_5445024.html . Basically honey usually contains a greater diversity of sugars and sometimes some useful trace elements depending on the bees, flowers, etc. Nothing huge but maybe worth thinking about.

Yeah I know huffpost and all but it's a pretty quick summary from someone that seems legit. Not like honey &gt; sugar in some life-changing way, but just a slight err on the side of honey type of way. Plus honeys all taste different and good, which is kind of cool, but obviously that is beyond this discussion.Not a turkey burger fan, but I love the idea of adding black beans to them.Beans and especially sweet potatoes are good ways (and versatile) to make a more filling meal without meat.Hmm this is interesting about the marmite! It's an item that is most definitely *not* my cup of tea, but I may have to test this out sometime.For those asking for more info, it's a mixture of thyme, sumac, sesame seeds, and salt. It's absolutely delicious as OP mentioned.

Here's Alton Brown's recipe for it: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/zaatar-recipe.html

Also, if you happen to have sumac powder, it's great on roasted vegetables, fish, chicken, potatoes. Flavour-wise, think sour/tart lemony flavour. If you have a really high quality blender you don't need to. The vitamix comes with a stick so you can blend the crap out of anything with a nice texture. But probably not worth it just for chickpea cookie dough! :)Used to grow it where I grew up. You could go pick a leaf and freeze it and chew on it mmI used to not care, but I'm afraid to while I'm pregnant. I also get my flour from bins and I don't want to eat that stuff raw.Best guide I've had: my tongue. I tend to wing it, but chili powder, ground black pepper, and garlic salt/powder go a long way when using just a little.Please come see us at /r/vegan!!  You can just lurk if you're more comfortable - there are plenty of recipes!  /r/coolguides is also nice.
salmon burgers!!Steamed broccoliNot a vegetarian but I try to limit meat intake just on account of the cost. There are a lot of great meat-free versions of recipes that are still filling and taste great. You could try a [veggie lasagna](http://www.food.com/recipe/vegetarian-lasagna-14684) and other pasta dishes subbing meat with veggies like zucchini, eggplant, or mushrooms. Homemade veggie pizza is also really tasty and you can personalize toppings to your liking. Beans and lentils are a great way to make filling meals at a low cost - especially if you buy dried ones (a bit more effort but a big savings) - [this](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/10035/golden-veggie-shepherds-pie) shepherd's pie is a great veggie alternative. Mushrooms and avocado are also great for adding savoury "meatiness" to dishes.Your "sunday" food spices are also the recommended spices for poultry.It's kind of funny actually. Because they are right on some of them, but just for the wrong reasons (mostly).

**Cereal**

* Most don't use wholegrains, and do have a lot of added sugar. Muesli mixes are healthy if you get decent ones.

**Multivitamins**

* No scientific evidence that they actually work. They're not bad for you, but they're not good for you either.

**Diet Soda**

* It's not worse. And Aspartame is not a neurotoxin. But artificial sweeteners (including Aspartame) do cause an insulin response even if they don't increase blood sugar levels, and that's still bad.

**Margarine**

* Margarine made with good oils like olive oil, is healthy, otherwise it is bad. Butter is better because it fills you up for longer as long as you don't overdo it.

**Vegetable Oil**

* It's not unhealthy... But it's not as good for you as other oils.

**Multigrain/Whole Grain**

* Labelling can be deceiving, but that's why you look on the ingredients list. Multigrain includes too much white grains. 100% Wholegrain, and Wholemeal are better.

**Protein Powder**

* All bullshit.

**Low-Fat Food**

* They are right on this. This is why Full Fat Milk is better than the lower fat alternatives. Also fat helps with satiety, which is important.

**Sugar-Free Food**

* Mostly bullshit. Sugar is sugar... Natural sweeteners are not better for you. Honey, and cane sugar is not better than regular white sugar.

**SlimFast/Meal replacements**

* Mostly right. Slim Fast cuts down on fat, and raises sugar levels, which makes you hungrier, sooner. But you can find actual meal replacements, that have proper portions of Protein, Fat, and Carbs, so that you feel full, and get a good ratio of the trinity.

**Healthy Frozen Meals**

* They left this pretty vague, so they can suck it.

**Deli Meats**

* They are right on this one. Deli meats are super high in sodium, and nitrates do have a link with increased rates of stomach cancer.

**Fast Food Sandwiches**

* Really depends on where you go, and on what you order. But most from the big name fast food places are bad for you.

**Salad with Extras**

* They are right. The extras is what gets you, and it can be unhealthy.

**Canned Soups**

* Again, depends on the brand, but most are bad for you.

**Soy Sauce... Soy Anything**

* Bullshit all around.

**Tofu**

* Still bullshit.

**Instant Oatmeal packages**

* True.

**Microwave Popcorn**

* Somewhat true, but worker conditions don't translate to consumer consumption.

**Ketchup**

* Who the fuck thought that ketchup was healthy? Oh, and nothing wrong with MSG. It's just salt.

**Veggie Burgers**

* Mostly bullshit, but again... Depending on where you're getting them from they can be good or bad.

**Tuna Fish**

* Funny how they make claim to the trace of amounts of mercury, but then recommend wild caught tuna... Super contradictory. But the mercury levels in tuna (or other seafood) are not at all a problem because of the high levels of Selenium that counter acts the binding component of mercury. So as long as the food you're eating has more Selenium than Mercury, you're safe to eat it.

**Corn Chips**

* They are bad for you, but not for the reasons they listed.

**Fruit Cups/Canned Fruit**

* They're right.

**Fruit Snacks**

* They're right.

**Liver**

* True to an extent. While the grass fed livers are better, then non grass fed ones aren't unhealthy.

**Dark Chocolate**

* Depends on the brand, and what they add to it.

**Olive Oil**

* They're right. But you shouldn't be using high heat with Olive Oil anyway, cause it tastes like ass.

**Honey**

* Load of bullshit. Honey, is honey. And honey is sugar water, whether it's organic not.

**Yoghurt**

* They're right. And the low fat ones have increased sugar to compensate for lost flavour. The low fat/sugar ones are bad too because of the artificial sweeteners. Another example of where full fat is better.

**Baby Formula**

* True most of the time. Again, depends on brand.

**Skim Milk**

* True




Add me to the list of people who love this spice. One of my favorite spice mixes.Left over pork roast - slice it up, pour a can cream of mushroom soup over it and heat up in the oven

Left over beef roast - roast beef sandwiches, or if you have gravy left over too, open faced hot beef sandwich

Left over bacon - wrap and freeze, can easily be thawed and chopped up for a salad or added to a quick breakfast

Left over mash potato  - heat up the next day in a frying pan with some diced or sliced onions

Left over peas - heat up and add to a white sauce, and have peas on toast

Bananas ripened too much before you got to eat them - freeze them and use for baking

Left over pancakes - wrap and freeze for a quick go to later

Wow, everything is there! Even how to filet a fish. Thanks! Whoa, this is a great idea. no way man. eating everything in moderation is the key.

Ah, reddit you fickle stick you.That's one of the problems with chemotherapy. People get taste aversions to food they eat around the time of treatment, since nausea is usually associated with spoiled/poisoned food. I've seen a study where they have the patient eat something yucky like bitter ice cream before having chemotherapy so that they don't get a taste aversion to something they actually like. &gt; Bitches about condescending remarks.

Come on man! Your post asked for opinions on your food theory. You **ASKED FOR OPINIONS**. If you don't like the opinions, do not respond with petty comments. I am removing this thread.

It can be very overpowering if it's the only or main seasoning you use in my experience but when blended with multiple it becomes amazing.For left-over mash, I like to add egg, cheese and some flour and make potato pancakes.

For potato-based dishes:

* Cut into bite-sized chunks and fry with black pepper and a smidge of allspice. Serve with HP Sauce, pickled beetroot (optional) and a fried egg. ([pytt i panna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyttipanna)).

* Cut into bite-sized chunks and make an omelet.

For meats:

* Slice, put it on bread, put a thick layer of cheese on top and grill in the oven.

* Cut into strips and add to instant ramen.

* Cut into strips and make a stir-fry.

For rice:

* Fry the rice in sesame oil. Don't stir too often; you want it to get golden and crispy in places. Add other left-overs if available, or just add some black beans and/or carrots and/or onion and/or peas and/or whatever. Move the rice to one side of the pan, and scramble an egg or two in the other. Serve with sweet chili sauce.

For pasta:

* Grill in the oven with cheese and breadcrumbs on top.

For noodle stir fry:

* Boil some chicken stock, add noodles and baby, you've got some ramen going.Fritattas. Preheat oven to 325, Combine everything w/ veggies in a skillet/casserole dish, whip up 4-6 eggs, pour over everything and pop into the oven for about 20-30min. Add cheese about halfway through.Fuck... now I really want rice...Local food is typically less regulated, so you're more likely to get sick from it, unfortunately. Organic food is also more likely to be infected or contaminated by insects.... because they use less antibiotics (which farming does over use) and they either use no pesticides, or "natural" pesticides, which are less effective and some of them are harsher on the environment.

Regardless, those farm fresh fruits and veggies in the summer are the highlight of my year. I am soooo excited for the day that my local farmer's market opens up again! I just wish there was a CSA around here. If it smells good or tastes good I put it in my food.Idiots Guide to Seasoning: Salt, Peper, Garlic Powder. Case Closed.Also really annoying that some "non-allergen spices" can still be allergens for some.I'm actually one of those few people to contract salmonella from raw eggs.

Though, in my case the eggs were from a local farm, the shells were contaminated, and they just rinsed them off with water: there was no shell sanitizing step, so my odds weren't your odds.

I used to believe the whole "local food is clean food" spiel, but though I still try to buy and eat as local as I can afford, I'm a little less naive nowadays: a lower ability because of small scale of the operation, to cause outbreaks or even be detected in the first place doesn't correlate to safer products.

It usually says right on the packaging. At my local Walmart and even publix the strawberries are from California. At Aldi they are from a city less than an hour away. It's one way Aldi keeps its pricing down. We get "Mexican" food (but I imagine nothing very authentic). The issue's when I see US recipes for stuff and I normally can't get all the ingredients, especially living in the middle of a city without a big supermarket nearby. Ooh thanks. Awesome thread, OP. :)I love zaatar! I have a big mason jar of it in my kitchen. It's pretty healthy too, lots of minerals and whatnot. You could mix it with rice or cous cous so it's a bit more interesting. Thanks man. It's always as simple as /r/infographics. I've almost done that a couple times...not sure how I'd feel about that though. Almost did it with cloves once which honestly may not have been the worst thingGive [Sazon](http://www.texmex.net/Graphics/sazongoya.gif) a try sometime as well. It's a good base for a lot of latin foods. It comes in packets in a box, usually in the Mexican food aisle of the store. One of the good things about cooking is things rarely have to be exact. If you get pretty close to a good recipe, it will still be good.If it smells like it will taste good together then odds are it will. Simple, easy, and damned useful. I did that with cinnamon toast as a child. I wouldn't recommend it. Paprika, cayenne pepper, and chili powder are great for heat. Dijon mixed with honey is great on top of chicken and other meats. Basil is good with anything Italian. Fresh oregano is good on grilled vegetables and chicken. Rosemary is amazing on all meats and potatoes. Make sure to add it before you begin cooking because it's not great when uncooked. Cinnamon is good for oatmeal, cereal, sweet potatoes, fruit and yogurt. Dill is excellent with fish or mixed with greek yogurt for a healthy sauce that tastes fantastic on red meat. Tarragon is good on fish and in chicken salad. Cilantro will make any Mexican style dish 100% better. You can add mint to chocolate or several citrus items for an interesting taste I once mistook Cumin for Cinnamon in my oatmeal. Taste buds were thrown off for a few days.Dang, Mexican food is so good. I'm sorry you don't get to experience it much. I bet you get some other good stuff we don't though. plain marmite is glorious!Sprouts has really great produce deals, Trader Joe's is good on a lot of "splurge" items and things you might want to try but don't want to pay way too much for.honestly I put garlic powder (not salt) and pepper on pretty much everything I cook, you cant go wrong with the basics. I'm in roughly the same area as you, you will rarely find really good deals at Safeway.  Try King Soopers, Albertsons and even the ever dreaded Walmart for decent meat prices.&gt;Pour over a bowl full of Fritos

I find them really helpful.I'm not entirely sure of the stats. Like I mentioned earlier, it's something like 1 in 20,000 chickens that start infected with salmonella. But that's not accounting for contamination of the meat after death. And, I believe, E. Coli is much more responsible for illness from uncooked poultry than salmonella is.

We're somewhat loose about food safety in my house. Defrost meats with a warm water bath or sitting out on the counter, etc. But with chicken I'm still washing my hands about 3 times as much as with any other meat and I will disinfect the counters once I'm done using the raw chicken on them. Whereas with eggs I'll just sort of wipe it down with soapy water like normal. Try [these](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/05/chipotle-sweet-potato-burgers/). They're not quinoa; they're sweet potato, black bean and corn burgers, but they're excellent. I find that the corn really helps with the juicyness; the potatoes and beans (and cornmeal) provide structure - and you can't really have a structurally sound non-meat burger without being a little dry - and the corn provide the juicyness.

I'd recommend adding a little marmite (no, really) to the mix. Not much, maybe a teaspoon. Plain marmite tastes rancid, but just a smidge in a vegetarian dish adds that umami flavor that meats have and veggies lack.I've just revisited the reddit home page for second time in an hour and scrolled down, scanning the articles and to my eyes it still says 'Idiots guide to sneezing?'I understand why they do it, I just think it's dumb that they're not required to list an ingredient.

And have you tried overnight oats?  There's hundreds of recipes out there, but they can be made ahead a few days and take less than 5 mins to make.  I find that they're actually so filling that I have to adjust most recipes down to use only about 1/4 cup of rolled oats.  Raw chicken is VERY different.

Huh... very interesting, hadn't considered that at all and we are big egg fans. Thanks!You can eat literally anything and lose weight, if you are below your maintenance caloric goal, bute more filling are high protein and fiber things like eggs, vegetables, beans, ground turkey. i second the recommendation to use My Fitness PalI just baked this into cookies. Didn't freeze it or anything as some people mentioned. They fall apart rather easy but are still good. The melted chocolate is a nice touch. This is going to be the cheesiest answer on here, but whatever-

I smell the spice. I smell the food as it cooks. If the two smells kind of go together, I add a little. If they really go together, I add a lot.

Besides that, here's a really short and easy list-

Italian-type food (tomatoes, pasta)- basil and oregano

Mexican-type food (beans, rice, tortillas)- cumin, chili powder, cayenne/red pepper (careful, that's the spicy one)

"Sunday"-type food (sorry, don't know how to describe it- think roast, carrots, potatoes)- thyme, rosemary, sage

Fish/eggs- dillTIL New word...

Coarse salt is difficult as a late seasoning, it takes some time for it to dissolve, the smaller the faster it dissolves. you could make a flask of 35% (35g/100ml) saline solution, use that for late seasoning, give it a splash or two mix, the water should evaporate very quickly, and the salt more evenly distributed.i use my trimmings like ground meat or recipes that call for canned salmon. these aren't recipes, but a general idea: burrito and taco filling, nacho topping, indian or thai curries, stir fry, burger patties, salmon pie (like chicken pot pie), cold salmon salad (mayo or vinaigrette base with a few veggies and herbs, to eat on sandwiches or crackers).

we usually get 30 fish a year and we scrape the fish after filleting, so my trimmings are pretty ragged compared to what you described. the other spices just "fill out" the flavor, in my opinionTry this: look up some recipes, and only cook Italian food for a week. You will notice that there is always a similar order: olive oil and onions first, then garlic, then the rest of the ingredients and salt, then fresh herbs (usually basil and parsley) on top. You'll notice a few other common ingredients like lemon, cloves and fennel as well, but if you just want to think about the spices/herbs that is a good start.

A week later, only cook french recipes. You will notice they also often start with garlic onions and olive oil, but may have butter in the base. Some more savory herbs like thyme, bay leaves and rosemary are used, often when the food is roasted.

Then, try Moroccan. Then, Mexican. Or whatever. You will notice that in a month or two you will have learned what spices (and importantly, other flavorful ingredients) go together. Next time you make roasted veggies you will reach right for the garlic and rosemary and next time tacos are on the menu you will expertly shake in cumin and paprika.Commenting to save this thread for future reference [this recipe](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/salmon_fish_stew_brazilian_style/) is outstanding if you're willing to let it marinate overnight. The trimmings sound like the perfect size!Meld, as in blend. Not melt :P

Like, I get little pockets that are saltier where the granules were. I also only have coarse salt which I'm sure doesn't help. The water from whatever I'm cooking (onions, chicken, etc) usually is enough to evenly distribute dissolved salt.Adobo on everything.


[I love Adobo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI475BJUGJU)To be fair, the Chili powder I use probably has ground Oregano in it already. I just don't add more.Okay Here is my list of the top 10 seasonings/flavor enhancers with a few use cases at the bottom:

1. Vinegar

1. Onion Powder

1. Cilantro

Honorable mentions to salt, butter, bacon grease, and heavy cream. Excluded because this is cheap AND healthy.

Thanks, fix'd!I normally make a veggie burger and use quinoa instead of bread to hold it together.  Probably not want you want but it usually turns out juicy.  yeah it should, just don't add regular salt.the spice house is great. The sensory overload on your nose when  you walk in, I just love it.I'm not sure I understand what you are saying, salt does not melt in cooking it dissolves in the moisture if you are cooking a stir-fry or some other dish where moisture is low, I'd use either salted water, or soysauce.

Salt does change the chemistry, it changes the water's structure thus water freeze at lower temp and boil at lower too if memory serves, it also stabilize proteins and amino acids, possibly enhancing one taste, and decrease anotherSo when I get my standard eggs from the shop, it's completely unnecessary to be fishing out every tiny bit of egg shell that falls into whatever I'm cooking?

There is mexican oregano that you can buy at most spice shops and it's often used for more authentic mexican dishes as well as american-mexican dishes.Yeah i thought so ... the article lacks a lot of hmmm details so i guess it is just a headline thing!Sticking to a calorie intake goal, like My Fitness Pal, as suggested for your height/weight, and amount you want to lose.

Then sticking to fresh foods, mostly fruit and vegetables, little meat, and be more active. You will lose weight.

There's no magic weight loss vegetable.Really simple, but scrambled eggs with salmon and black pepper are delicious./r/mealprepsunday has a lot of great recipes in their sticky. I know it's helped me a lot to prep food for the rest of the week. [This](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/11/stock-kitchen-pantry-staples/) pantry staples list from BudgetBytes is probably a good place to start.

Personally I try to buy meat on sale and keep it in the freezer, along with mixed vegetables. I'm in the same boat, I literally have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to seasonings.

A couple weeks ago, I literally thought while cooking: "Hmm, what spices should I add? I guess I'll go with parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme... if someone wrote a song about them, they probably go well together..."I really enjoy [this](https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/flat-iron-steaks-with-freekeh-beet-salad-gorgonzola) recipe from Blue Apron.

It could be as simple or as complicated as you want. This one calls for freekah, but you could use couscous, or quinoa. The Hungarian wax pepper is a little difficult to find, but you could sub banana pepper.

It would also be good without cheese, maybe goat cheese instead of gorgonzola. Pretty much every kind of leftovers that I've ever had have become omelets.

Leftover Chinese chicken and broccoli? Omelet. Leftover baked ziti? Omelet. Leftover braised Cuban beef? Omelet.I'd experiment with adding some marinated mushrooms to your mix.I just do frozen blueberries, an orange as base then maybe add a banana or spinach or both. Blast it in a ninja or other processor. I have been drinking Zen green tea with about a teaspoon of honey like crazy lately.it's awesome on potatoeshow...do you skin chickpeas? Hire ants?
Yeah, if you're using chili powder there's bound to be so in there. ;]I found [this](http://i.imgur.com/SwoSvDV.png) a long time ago and have found it to be quite helpful. It's more than just seasoning, though.Break things up. Look at content of your favorite dishes. You like baked salmon with butter and lemon? Do you think pepper would taste good on that? Add lemon pepper.

You like bolognese with basil and parmesan cheese? That should tell you that basil work great with a sweet tomato sauce.

And so on.

Read recipes and pick out which flavors work with what. And don't be afraid to fail, go easy on the spices and look for a hint of taste from it. If you don't like the hint, don't add more. If you like the hint, add more. This way you won't ruin your dish by adding a lot of spices that really doesn't work.

Garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne, onion and other dried vegetables work really great with basically everything. Cinnamon is good on pork/lamb if combined with other good spices. Lemon is great on fish. Celery, carrots, cucumbers, applesTo be fair, there's likely crushed oregano in the Chili powder I use so there's probably a bit in my seasoning anyway. I just don't add it independently. yesssssHaha, no, I had to go to your profile to notice that. I was apprehensive at first, but I think it ready rounds out the spices, oregano really takes it from just spicy to savory. I'd like to talk about flavor beyond seasoning. Spices are great, but don't make or break a dish. You also need a balance of acid, salt, sweet, and "umami" for your foods to taste good. You can get really far by just learning to cook things properly (not overcooking chicken, for example) and adding salt and black pepper, and it'll taste better than poorly cooked but awesomely seasoned food.

The spice guides other people have posted are great, but an acid will really help your food pop.  A splash of vinegar/lemon or a squeeze of lime go a long way. Getting good browning on your food will also help develop flavor, especially with meat and onions.

If you're cooking vegetarian dishes or lean meats, a bit of umami will really help bring out some extra depth. Soy sauce, fish sauce, worcerstire sauce, caramelized onions and meat drippings are just a few examples.

A little bit of sweetness goes a long away, and sugar helps promote caramelization, since it reacts to heat at a lower temperature. Most marinades and sauces include some amount of sugar.

Beyond those basics, seasonings are cuisine and taste specific. I usually omit most of the coriander that's called for, and always add more cumin. To get an understanding of the taste of spices, eat a little bit, or better yet, make a tea out of it. Experiment or look up recipes for inspiration. Try to copy foods that you enjoy eating out.

Best of luck!Oh. I just assumed you brought that up because just above this comment I mentioned that I don't use oregano in my taco seasoning. Thanks for the info![Here's](http://www.food.com/recipe/mexican-seasoning-mix-456146) a good guide to making your own. I agree. I also omit coriander from the Cajun mix. No. Oregano is a pretty common ingredient in chili powders, and [Mexican seasoning mix](http://www.food.com/recipe/mexican-seasoning-mix-456146).

That's why you see "Mexican oregano". I have a hard time getting the salt to meld when I add it at the end, and it's more well distributed if you add it in earlier. I also believe it does change the actual cooking chemistry by drawing out moisture - whether that's good or bad is case by case.Man, whoever made that must LOVE coriander. I'm taking some beef with its inclusion in Cajun spice mix, as I've never seen or tasted coriander in any Cajun/Creole food... Such as jambalaya, etouffee, red beans, or gumbo.

Overall that's a nifty chart with good proportions, nice find!Beets are really good added to almost any salad. Fresh ones are best but the canned ones aren't bad at all.

Sometimes I like to have just beets, sliced onions, vinegar, and salt and pepper.   I really like making fish stew, and usually just end up cutting the fish into pieces that size anyway.  Quick and delicious! chocolate chip falafel!you trolling, right?The truly idiot's guide to seasoning comprises 2 products: black peppercorns that grind up when you turn the lid and Mrs. Dash. You can explore from there but this base will get you far.Don't forget oregano to that list. [Hibiscus iced tea](http://www.marthastewart.com/350188/hibiscus-iced-tea).  For extra frugal points, don't discard the flowers.  Throw them in a skillet with some oil and add them to tacos.  If you've got some on hand, a handful of mint will really push that shit over the top.  This guy has it right. Specifically about detox, the human body (well, any organism's body really) is actually incredibly good at precisely and punctually ridding itself of any toxic substances it is exposed to. That's an essential part of homeostasis, one of the requirements for classifying something as biologically alive. In humans, our livers and kidneys do most of the work processing and filtering toxins from our blood (like the byproducts of alcohol metabolism), and if those start having problems, then you've got bigger fish to fry than "detoxing" your body.Cumin...on everything!

Unless its something sweet...then Cinnamon!

I accidentally put cinnamon on my eggs once...i was not upset.That is true, but often atleast when I cook, salt is enough, to change the dish from decent to good...

Clarification, premixing spices is not good for a beginner, add one at the time.put old bay on everything. - ancient Maryland proverbHahahaha neverMore cocaine, fewer mojitos.My two favorites are [Garam masala]( http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/142967/easy-garam-masala/?page=0) (cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, and nutmeg (you can add ginger)) for spicy/savory and [Herbes de Provence]( http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/herbs-de-provence-recipe.html) (savory, rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil, marjoram, fennel) for light/summer flavor. I use almost nothing else. Masala makes everything taste like gingerbread or chai. Herbes de Provence tastes like traditional French food.I never use regular paprika in hummus anymore.I actually disagree with the salt part. I think that salt should be  separate from the other spices. Make your blend for foods and then add salt to taste.Thanks! This is a lot of good info.Never had it. I'll have try it on everything now.Nice, thanks!I feel like the bulk of that "mexican taste" that makes mexican food taste mexican comes from the cumin.

EDIT: "Mexican Taste" as in Taco Bell mexican taste.And paprika.... And Chili powder... And Garlic powderKeep in mind, this is a very general guide. Look for others and compare  and modify them for your own preferences. For example, I~~'ve never~~ *don't often* see Oregano in taco/Mexican seasoning, so I don't use it.Smoked salmon nuggets

Lox-bites I recommend getting:
Oregano,
Thyme
Basil (fresh if possible)
Parsley (definitely fresh)
Cumin
Allspice
Garlic powder
Onion powder
Paprika
Cayenne/crushed red pepper
Salt
Pepper

Salt and pepper are universal. You can put them in damn near anything to improve flavor. The rest you experiment with.
I plan our meals for the entire week, using as much of the leftovers as possible. Here is a typical meal plan that I can squeak by on $60 to make for the two of us with a stocked pantry with spices and sauces.

* Meatloaf and mashed potatoes, 1/2 bag of steamed veggies ($10)
* Shepherds pie with leftover mashed potatoes and veggies ($3)
* chicken or beef tacos with home made refried beans and corn in the meat mixture ($10)
* Loaded nachos ($4)
* Chicken and rice, frozen veggies ($10)
* Leftover chicken and 3 slices bacon, diced in mac n cheese ($5)
* Chili for 2 nights of the week, make a batch and put 2 nights worth in freezer bags so you have them when you don't feel like cooking, I include lots of beans and corn to bulk it up ($12)

those are my favorite go-to cheap meals and including the cost of things like milk and butter, it's about $60 if you shop sales. It's all about knowing how much to make of everything which I have found is a bit of an art cooking for my SO. Also, when dry goods like beans go on sale, bulk up! They won't go bad and you'll be glad you got that extra can of beans for $.60 2 weeks from now when they are all $1.20 and you feel like you're being ripped off. And use your freezer. It is your friend as long as you actually keep the frozen stuff in rotation and don't just forget about it in there. My method is usually 1. smell the food, 2. smell all the spices I have and can think of as possibly fitting. Then it's trial and error :)They have massive amounts of spices if you go into one of the big Tesco's, I stumbled across it a couple of weeks ago. They have all the mixed spices as well.And now I'm hungry. Lightly fry in oil and add sesame seed sauce! Serve over rice and greens!!If you do a little research, you can start figuring out which spices go with what cuisine and take it from there. (It's much better than relying on pre-packaged spice blends, which are overpriced and packed with salt.) You'll find that a lot of spices are common across cuisines and can (and should) be used for pretty much anything; it's the ones that differ that make things taste right. And having a good grasp on what different cultures use together can help you figure out what all might go together, even when you're just winging it.

For instance, Italian seasonings. Oregano and basil are the two most important, basic ones. Most dishes will probably have one or both of these. Garlic and onion should be used fresh, not powdered (although the powder is good to keep around in case you need more and don't feel like chopping). Rosemary, parsley, and thyme are all relatively common. If you ever want a little spice, it should come from crushed red pepper flakes. Red wine (slash red wine vinegar) and balsamic vinegar are great ways to add acid and depth to your dishes, and if you need citrus, lemon is the safest bet.

Compare that with Mexican spices. Cumin is my favorite spice here; I use it in basically all my Mexican food. Chili powder (many different kinds) and cilantro are everywhere. Oregano and basil are widely used here, too, as are garlic and onion. Your acid should come from lime, when in doubt, and your spice can come from fresh or dried chiles (both taste better than relying on chili powders for spice). Jalapenos are a good choice, unless you're some kind of insane spice demon, in which case, you do you.

Or Thai spices. Lime and cilantro are very common here, too, as are garlic, onion, and cumin. They also use a lot of basil, but Thai basil is definitely different and you should try to get it if you can. Similarly, Thai chiles are very different and absolutely key. Lemongrass is often what gives things that special Thai taste, and fish sauce, when used in moderation, is magical. Ginger, turmeric, and some form of coconut, and you've got Thai food.

Obviously there are other spices that go along with those cuisines, but those are the most basic and will get you through most recipes. Other than that, when you're making something and you feel like it's lacking, just go through your spices and smell things. That's what I do if I don't know *what* exactly something needs--smelling is so close to taste, and you should be able to tell if something will work with the taste of your food in your mouth and the smell of the spice in your nose. Would garlic salt and minced onion seasoning work in that? Sounds pretty straightforward.If we're talking cheap and healthy, I think a simple beet-quinoa salad is the way to go. It's not amazingly cheap, but it is healthy and tasty.

Ingredients: Beets, Arugula, Goat Cheese, Quinoa, Vinegar, Oil
Optional: Nuts

I've actually found some good info on spices and herbs on Pinterest. I have a few printouts on my fridge so I can refer to them. This site seems to have a lot of info (I've printed out their spice use chart)

http://adventuresinspice.com/flavormap/flavormap.htmlYup, keep it simple! Just roast them with olive oil.
We chop them into half moons and throw them along with some carrots onto a preheated 500* pan, for about 20 minutes.One easy all purpose seasoning is garlic, onion, salt and pepper.

A step up from that, look up recipes for spice blends and make them, or see what combinations of spices occur in certain recipes. Get in the habit of smelling spices, and becoming familiar with what they're like.Taco meat: big plate of loaded nachos the next day (usually on a weekend for lunch)

Pot roast: Roast beef sandwiches

Chicken (breast or whole): Chicken pot pie, chicken tacos

Steak: Steak and egg sandwiches, Steak and gravy, Cheese steaks,  etc..

Using leftovers is all about what you like to eat and making the right portions of said meals. And don't be afraid to use your freezer! Some stuff doesn't freeze well but you never know until you try! (or google it)Once you go Ceylon, you never go cassia!If you're trying to gain weight why would you want lean beef? Get that fatty cut !!If you have a ton of spices and you don't know what they taste like, make a bunch of white rice and put it into small bowls or cups, and then add a little of an individual spice to the cup of rice and mix it up. The rice will pick up the flavor of the spice well and give you an idea of what it tastes like. Then you literally can do anything you want, just try to imagine what would go good with another food you make. If you don't like it, then no big deal, there's very little that can go wrong with experimenting with spices beyond you not liking the taste.Juicy quinoa burgers would result in mushy quinoa burgers. When assembling, add veganiase to the bun, and in season, ripe tomatoes for a 'juicy' burger. Mix equal parts soy sauce and melted butter. Pour over salmon and sprinkle with Lemon Pepper liberally.  Broil until fish is done. So good. For Mexican spices use a mix of cumin, ground coriander, salt, black pepper, and any ground chili powder you have (I like arbol and pequin). Those packets you see in stores have a very high sodium content.That article doesn't make any sense!

She is a lifelong vegan but she had a laundry list of issues.  She owns an orchard so she ate bananas for 12 days then gave birth?

Was this article translated out of a foreign language or something?  Nothing here points to reality, I think it's pure fiction.Curry.  Almost any kind of meat, beans, veg can be added to curry. First off get a peppercorn grinder and a 5 pound box of Kosher salt. Put these on everything.

See if there's a spice shop by you, I live in Chicago and http://www.thespicehouse.com/ is super legit. You'd be amazed at the quality difference between their stuff and store bought stuff. For example I went in to get some fancy cinnamon for a pie, they had 5 distinctly different types that all tasted amazing.

Don't overthink it, if it seems like something will go with a dish, try it out. Taste as you're cooking and adjust seasonings accordingly.I always make enchiladas with shredded leftover pot roast.Cereal and whole milkif you want things to taste mexican, add cumin.I'm terribly sorry. My view of the average redditor is male ;) but thank you!Chili powder, paprika, and cumin!Put. Smoked paprika. On everything. Sweet mother of god yes. Thank you for this. Nice! I did some searching around and didn't find much. That seems helpful.The whole webpage feels like clickbait BS.

 Regardless, don't eat only bananas for 12 days.Thanks for the detailed response. I appreciate!Nice chart, thanks!I've seen that Trader Joe's seasoning referenced before. I'll have to dig around for a comparable substitute. The closest one is pretty far from me.Make [salmon fishcakes](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/fish-recipes/salmon-fishcakes/#uSoqEc5FLmXAjcrb.97), the recipe is Jamie Olivers, if you like fishcakes, they are quite good. the recipe calls for tinned salmon, but just chop the fresh, it is much better.

You can also make a salmon salad, the recipe is the same as for a prawn cocktail, just use steamed salmon instead of the prawns. or a mixture of the two.That's perfect! I might just make a shaker of each of these.This is what I use as a guide. [9 easy spice blends]( http://imgur.com/wVuF1ti)

Keep in mind the proportions more so than the actual measurements. Like,  same amount of paprika as chili powder, half that portion of garlic powder,  etc . Also, general "spiciness" will vary greatly depending on upon preference and application, add more or less cayenne accordingly. Well don't really have a recipe for leftovers, just kinda go were ever my mind wants to really...

But if I make rice the evening before fried rice is always nice, usually I finely chop 1 onion, dice a few slices of bacon, dice a few slices of a strong salami, some garlic.
Fry the bacon and the salami, remove from pan, fry onion and garlic, add the meat again, mix it, shove it to the side of the pan add rice, mix up, fry for 2 min, season, add a wisked egg, mix, when the egg is stif, dinner is served...

If you have potatoes left and some meat, make it into a stew. say you've had a roast the night before and you don't feel like having a stir-fry. dice the meat(large dice) say you have 500 g of meat, and 1.5 kg of potatoes. take 4 onions chop them however way you like. fry them in a large pot put in the diced meat fry that as well add half a liter of water, 2 bayleaves and some pepper, let simmer for 30 min. add the potatoes, now these are already boiled which only makes it quicker let the stew boil for 30 min, then kinda mash the potatoes into the soup/stew. The dish looks kinda gross, light brown with lumps and pink meat in it. but it is very tasty. What about raw Chicken? Same thing?Problem is, here in the United States, "Spices" is an acceptable ingredient listing of non-allergen spicesSweetener. You should be able to replace with honey. Anything that's short term, only eats one food/drink, claims to "detox," is a fad and 100% unhealthy. I love 'real salt' or 'Celtic sea salt', I've even had grey salt, Hawaiian silver, pink and Hawaiian black volcanic sea salt.

Experiment with these and you may find that some are more delicious than others.

21 season salute at trader joes is a great all around spice, and I personally love cayenne powder and garlic powder.

Definitely get thyme, and sometimes a dish can be improved by squeezing a little lemon on it.Bananas are pretty sugary. Sure they are great for potassium, but I wouldn't recommend eating more than 1-2 a day.

Maybe instead eat only fruits and veggies for 12 days? Still seems like it would be lots of sugar to compensate for the lack of fats/grains in your diet. Quantity one: salmon, yellow Try this

The best way to learn though is to follow a recipe containing the spice you want to learn.  Especially if that spice is the predominant  flavoring.

Try the food in your recipe pre-spice, then add to the dish and try post-spice to learn what the impact was.

Tasting your food regularly is fundamental to being a good cook.bitch needs to lear how to season some chickenCutting is all about eating less carbs while still getting enough protein in my experience.

Lots of protein powder, vegetables, meats, salads, and Fiber One cereal have been my staples.  I usually have a nice sauce with my meat as well, and put olive oil on my vegetables to get my fat macro met (but careful with it because its pretty dense calorie wise).  But honestly just eat as few carbs as you can reasonably handle.I'm British and don't get easy access to exciting things like that. Soap has been around since like 3000 BCE give or take a couple hundred years, and Europeans were far cleaner than pseudohistory would have you believe. Here, facts:
http://www.gallowglass.org/jadwiga/herbs/baths.html

Also, the eggs are the same over here in Asia. Unwashed, unrefrigerated, and perfectly safe. Let's avoid making any mass generalizations on the historical hygiene of this continent and just go with eggs are safe to eat and so, so yummy.Seasoning, is one of the most difficult things to do right, the best advice is to take a little of the dish i a bowl and taste, remember that taste, add some salt, like a quarter of a teaspoon, remember this is a small portion, did this make the dish better? yes add salt in roughly the same amount, a little less maybe, taste the large dish, salty enough? - good.
On to the next, pepper, does the dish need a little kick, add some pepper same procedure as last time small sample add pepper, made it better? add it to the dish. if you think your dish needs more kick add chilli, but remember chili becomes more powerful when cooked, learned this the hard way.
Once you have done this with enough dishes, you find that you know which spices the dish needs to have, without thinking, I did atleast.

Soya sauce is another source of salt, so if you are cooking with soya sauce you use this instead of salt.

You have a variety of spices available, curry, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, garlic powder, and so forth.

There is also fresh herbs, again best advise taste the herbs if you can. but guidelines for me is that oregano and basil works really well with tomatoes and Itallian food. Mint and thyme works all the time(big fan here), parsley has a more gentle taste, it is good with potatoes.

There is also some forms of liquid spices, whiskey(never top or middle shelf), adds a little smoke, I find it good with stake. white wine with fish, if you find that there is a need for a little acid that is if salt does not work, you can add vinegar or lemon juice.

One time  I could taste some thing was missing from a dish, but could not find out what it was, so I took all of my spices and tasted them one by one, to find how they each tasted, and now I know.

Hope this helps a bit...
edit: formattingI make 5/6 (depending on portion sizes) days worth of salad (iceberg lettuce, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red pepper, orange pepper and red onion) in a massive Tupperware pot with lip that clips on each side, and keep in the fridge.  Everyday I transfer some over to a smaller Tupperware to take to work.  Keeps it fresh for at least 5 days (on the 5th day the iceberg starts to go a tiny bit brown but literally the tiniest bit)  And then add dressing just before eating.  Saves making it everyday I know if i had to make it everyday I'd lose my will power and just say stuff it I'll just go to the cafe at work.  MSG in everything for me!To second this, you should definitely look at Asian/international markets rather than big chain groceries to buy it. 3 packs of miso soup from my local Kroger was $5, whereas a pack of 8 from the local Asian market is $3.50.

And if you like Asian food, try Golden Curry! Again, I'd recommend hitting up your local Asian markets for these (1 pack for $5 at Kroger, 2 pack for $5 at Asian market). My boyfriend and I both can eat on crockpot curry for a week when we eat it with rice. I'm all about that Adobo with Pepper included. Insta-Mexican anything and a big shaker costs ~$2.25 at my international market. It's also really popular in Puerto Rican food. Definitely recommend fried plantains with Adobo. It was a joke.  OP said this recipe was "safe to eat".  The implication being that every other recipe here is not safe to eat.Europe tends to be a lot stricter than the US with a lot of stuff, though.If you even see the word 'detox' you can safely consider it bullshit. And eating only bananas for 12 days is a terrible idea. It's pretty unhealthy to eat only one food for extended time periods.What's your recipe for the meatballs? Just buy some whole chioggia beets and bake them until soft, then peel off the skin and devour as many as you can stomach.I love Aldi. I think a lot if it is based off your particular location. I buy milk and bagged salads at Aldi, both of which seem to last way longer than Walmart's. Mine also seems to have good produce, though my mom bought the ground beef there a couple of times and we kept finding hard things in it. There's also a good variety of name brand stuff at mine.

I usually spend $20 (just me) and it's plenty of food. It wouldn't hurt to go there once and see how it compares - I always think I have a cart with $35-$40 worth of stuff and it's never even close.I think of "buying in bulk" at places like Sam's or Costco. You can get a pretty good deal when you buy 10 lbs of apples or a big jug of Pine Sol or whatever.Meh, they were still colonizing, but sure. I didn't mean it as a contribution to the "America vs. the world" thing, just wanted to offer it as a parallel to the attitude about eggs. I'm not sure about the bathing habits of other regions, though. Just thought it was interesting that this attitude still exists in certain parts of life even though it's been proven somewhat inaccurate elsewhere.[Here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/pb2-powdered-peanut-butter_n_5675261.html) The link is to a pretty balanced huffington post article. I don't care about the 'downsides' they point out, like because it has less fat and less calories it's less satisfying (duh) but it helps me stay low-cal without sacrificing flavor!

Do you generally live in a constant state of fear?In terms of taking a break, i've found that taking 2-3 days off (but still eating at a caloric deficit aka cutting) of Keto, mostly by eating paleo accepted carbs (sweet potato and other carb-y vegetables come to mind) and still keeping the sugar low has helped before when i've stalled. In terms of having visible abs, there are two limiting factors: 1) very low bodyfat and 2) skin recovering. While cutting the body fat down can be hard, you don't seem to be having too much trouble with that and i'd think you could probably just continue along your current path, maybe adding in a few days off of keto if you're stalled. The biggest limit is going to be the excess/stretched out skin you have. Your skin can't "de-stretch" as quickly as you can lose weight/re-shape your underlying body. Everyone is different when it comes to how their skin rebounds.

Here's where I go more to speculation: you don't have so much excess skin that I would expect it to be impossible for it to rebound, however, from what i've seen, that can take a year or more to completely happen. Obviously, if the abs are what is motivating you, this might make it kind of hard to stick with. BUT, while you may not be able to get the skin to completely rebound for this beach season (or you might!) if you stick with this, you should be able to completely get there by next summer. Once you get there, it is easier to stay there than it was to get there (to a degree, obviously you need to stick with the diet and how defined your abs are will vary depending on what you're eating and how dehydrated you are - being dehydrated will make your abs look great, but is bad in pretty much every way).

Keep going though, you're doing great!These idiots should stop trying  to influence our behavor.I fought this idea for the longest time, and ended up just like you said. Eat "mostly keto," lose some weight, fall off the wagon and gain most of it back. Over and over.

Finally I realized that it just isn't going to work. I can't swear I'll never again eat a piece of bread or some potatoes, but not now, and not for the foreseeable future. This time it's 100% keto, or as close to it as I can get, and I am finally okay with that.umm just ignore him? Just "k" him and move on please.

Most people do 20g net carbs.How tall are you? If you're not that much overweight, then losing weight like that is perfectly reasonable. Think of it this way, the less you weigh, the higher each pound is in percentage of your overall body weight.

Also, are you exercising?These before/after photo posts are SO COOL! Keep it up!Are you going to have vodka every day? That is just how I read the post. Even Keto friendly alcohol suspends ketosis while the alcohol is in your system.My friend had the same issue, and decided to just forget his calories and just keep carbs as the enemy for life. Its been probably a year now or so? He fluctuates 3 pounds + or - but he never seems to stress about it anymore. He just made the decision that carbs were off limit for good and focused on healthy "cheat" foods like hamburger patties covered in cheese and bacon in a bowl for movie nights and such when he wanted to binge a bit.I stopped on the way in from work for eggs and heavy whipping cream! I'm prepared!I would say use the MFP recipe calculator, but you're gonna lose a lot of the lactose (sugars) from the milk as it's draining.  With that said, I think your best bet is to use the generic numbers.

And I'm the same way.  I just picked up 2 gal of organic whole milk, some heavy cream, and I have a few packets of mesophilic in the freezer.  Cream Cheese is today's project!If you like coffee w/milk, then you'll love coffee w/heavy cream.That protein is low, it is reccomended to aim for the middle to top range for protein. Normally they put that in the first post of the New Here sticky like....
&gt;First step: Use the Keto Calculator, but DON'T use the minimum protein recommendation. Aim for middle to top of the numbers.what makes it harder the second time? Does this (http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/low-carb-diets/why-is-low-carb-harder-the-second-time-around/) make sense?

Not eating the carbs might make for hurt feelings, maybe I can just eat much smaller portions of those.The body doesn't care about the DNA inside what it's eating, it's not like the whole thing is able to be digested without being broken down into the base pairs. GMO is really just artificial horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer occurs among millions of simple organisms. If it was a problem though, why hasn't it been with the literal million different species living in my digestive tract doing just that. Argh! Hang on. Trying to figure out this formatting thing.Haha!Um...yea...that's a typo.  If my SW was 1787, I'd hope for more than 0.5 pounds a week.  CorrectedFinally a person with a starting weight of 1787 pounds and comments of losing a "shit tonne" are more appropriate.Thanks for the reassurance!  It's a slower weight loss rate than I'd like, but (as I've posted in other threads) the feeling of energy and wellness that I have is so good, I'd be ok with even less of a weekly loss.It's so fun to see someone at the same height and similar build. And you saying that everyday is like day one for you...THANK YOU. Thank you so much for saying that. I get so used to hearing people saying "I never get hungry!" or "I never even get cravings anymore!" Nope, never been like that for me I'm afraid!

How many carbs do you try to stay within per day? What is your cheat day strategy?

I started keto March 2014, and it has almost always been like day one for me, especially after the first 6 or so months when the enormous losses stop. It can be tough to push forward, but when I see myself slipping, I realize that if I say "Oh, its okay to have a treat today" is opening a door that I may not have the discipline to shut again, so I try to be real with myself. It's one pound up, you think...then 2, then 3, then 5 and suddenly you just don't see the point anymore-so I want to avoid that trap!  I've actually been getting into Mindfulness as a way of dealing with cravings and it's working really well.

Did you hit any walls/plateaus?Nope!They need to tax sugar so that they have revenue to pay growers to not produce more sugar.  Don't you love this country?Good job. You can really see the difference in your face. You'd probably be better off doing the body weight exercises (or even weight training) and cutting back on the running, but since you have a goal in the running that's cool. Also, sprinting once a week would help your 5k. (Full disclosure: I hate running, but love sprinting, and weight training.)Yup makes a perfect sense. Slow and steady, marathon not a sprint, work with your bodyHey all, introducing myself here. I sit around for work all day, and I've been gaining a lot of weight. I stumbled upon this thread and decided I would give it a shot. My goal is to lose 70 lbs; I'm currently 225.

I haven't had any bread or rice in the past two weeks, and now I'm going to try and set a standard diet that I'll mostly stick to.

I rarely eat breakfast, so I was going to skip that. Lunch will usually be a couple of slices of swiss, a couple of slices of virginia ham, and a rotisserie chicken breast. Dinner will be a salad with 1/3 of a romaine lettuce head, 1/2 a cucumber, 1/2 a tomato, and 1/4 a white onion. For a snack, I was thinking roasted and salted pecans dipped in almond butter. For drinks, I figure a vodka neat should work; happens to be my favorite drink anyway.

Based on what I read here, the above seems to be acceptable. I was going to hit the grocery store today, but if any of you recommend any tweaks to the above, I am open to it. I wanna make sure I do this right.Yea, the advice is to start over with two weeks at under 20 grams carbs.  Pretty simple.Is... is that a bad thing? :3It's the hairstyle.LOL! So true. Cut your carbs to no more than 20 and that should help increase your weight loss.What about it slowing down weight loss?This is a yo-yo dieting pattern, and given your other comment, you have probably yo-yo dieted before.  Your body is getting wise to your behavior and will no longer drop fat as quickly as it has in the past.  Instead it will release fat grudgingly and refill the fat cells with water expecting you to fall off your diet and the fat cells can gobble up that extra fat again.  Time to quit playing around and get serious, lululuia. I'll list it when I get back home, could be that because I always drank a lot of water I wasn't really retaining to begin with. But ill get it listed when  I get access to my PCFair point.  My wife's pointed out to me that having a high calorie defecit isn't practice because the first thing most people do when they plateu is cut down calories. That's much more difficult when your already on a high defecit whereas if I increase my caloric intake it'll be easier to drop it down again later. If that makes sense Yup, never have to race to the store. The food I eat will still be there when the middle aisles are wiped clean Most average 1-2 lbs a week but there are no rules and it depends on how much you have to lose. Your progress is fine. Consistent progress is great! Men with over 50 pounds to lose should drop 8/12/16 pounds the first two weeks on keto depending on metabolic resistance per Dr. Atkins.  If you only lost 2 pounds during that time, something is wrong.  You should post your keto calculator results for guidance.So I know no one will probably see this at this point, but I have decided to quit half-assing it and go whole ass.  I think some MFP friends will help me stay motivated!

http://www.myfitnesspal.com/k3p13rthanks :) will do, I have been doing it the same way since the start and i lost weight i guess i will do everything more controled now :)Pad Kee Mao is one of my favorite foods in the world.  I still whip some up with a few substitutes...  First off, no noodles, just meat.  The only real issue in the dish is Oyster sauce, I've tried skipping it completely, but the taste is off.  The closest I've come is by shucking fresh oysters and incorporating them(with their liquid).  Either way, the recipe to make a simple oyster sauce is:
Makes 1/4 to 1/3 cup (60 to 80 ml)
-- 8 tsp (40 ml) soy sauce
-- 4 to 5 tsp (20 to 25 ml) liquid from canned oysters
-- 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) white granulated sugar

Now, obviously sugar is the issue, you can try different ways to sweeten it...   without it, its still a great dish, but is definitely missing an elementI was gonna come in and go "how about you just quit ingesting nicotene" but then, hey, I vape marijuana, and I get pretty annoyed when people question my largely harmless activity that I do in the privacy of my own home while not driving. I hope OP finds a fix for his issue. &gt; I believe carb cravings occur in the 50g-100g a day range, and I've seen the 125g carb level used instead to avoid this problem.

Can you explain this? I guess I haven't heard of this.I would eat 1700 calories use a food scale to measure *everything* and take body measurementsThis salad counts about 5-8g of carbs.Do these add up into your daily ketosis limit for carbs?Source?I think that is excellent advice, except I believe carb cravings occur in the 50g-100g a day range, and I've seen the 125g carb level used instead to avoid this problem.  Carbs at 125g for 500 calories and Fat at 89g for 800 calories (45fat/27protein/28carb.)Dunkin Donuts Cinnamon Spice was so good thoughLuckily I haven't had keto flu at all. I had a headache yesterday but that's about it. I have been groggy this week though.Resveratrol or Pterostilbene offer the same health advantages without the horrible side effects of ethanol.Glad to see some fellow vapers.

I never had it that badly and keto only emphasized my sense of taste so far.  It usually goes away after a while for most vapers.I did keep some ginger around for a while when I had it a few weeks into vaping.Right not 103 kg, 164 cm, 18, femaleWhat is your weight, height, age, gender?using keto calculator, it says to me i need to eat 1808 (exactly :D) with no exercise but I do 2-3 hours a week of exercise and right now Im eating around 1750.

I have never eaten a lot i was always eating small portions, not becaus e of any diet, just because it is how i am, but before keto i was going to a dietitian who put me on a 1500 diet and i gain lots of weight so, although i dont reach the 1800 its still a lot of food for meHappy birthday...awesome nsv!My fear is that if they tax sugar then they will tax things that come in similar form that isn't sugar...like diet soda and sparkling water, pork rinds (similar snack category as chips).

My fear is also that the anti-fat nutritionists are so dominant that they will throw in red meat and fatty foods, too.And when the keto flu symptoms go away (if you get keto flu) take note of how much energy and mental clarity you have. Sometimes that's even more motivation than the weight loss!With a food scale? What are your full stats (height weight age gender) and how many calories?You can just average it over the week yes Im counting calories and weighting myself on alternate days.

I used to get some acid reflux when I first started drinking BPC, it gradually went away, I think I had to get used to the coconut oil. Maybe try cutting down to one cup a day. And if that doesn't work, try cutting the coconut oil down and bit and gradually increasing it as your body adjusts? Ideally you want to prioritise protein over fat. Consider carbs to be a limit, protein to be a target, and fat to be variable. Getting an extra 20g of protein would be more beneficial than keeping the fat high, you can adjust the fat up/down to increase satiety/decrease calories. It doesn't matter if you don't get anywhere near your fat goal as long as you're under carb and hitting your protein :)Doesn't processed meat contain a lot of fat?No it's not ok but like many others I assume you plan to do it anyway. What are your stats?Fantastic Job! Keep it up /u/honeybee33!Steamed meat and veggies, no sauces, use soy sauce High deficits are counterproductive, yet people refuse to listen to this adviceWater needs vary I drink the same and am still aliveEating more fat is not going to help. Are you counting calories? Food scale? Measurements? You do not need carbs to break a stallReally? It's not all in one go that's throughout the day and evening. I've always drank a lot of water so it's not much if an increase for me tbhHonestly, I just wing it and watch my carbs very closely. Doing great so far. Even if you are on the Standard American Diet of high carbs, you are usually producing ketones when you wake up in the morning before you eat.  After four days at under 20g carbs, 85% of the population is using ketones to fuel most of their brain (per Atkins) instead of glucose as their glycogen burns off.  So yes, you are in ketosis after 24 hours on keto, but not yet to the level of nutritional (ongoing) ketosis.you look great! Keep up the good work!!!The medical approach would involve your individual physician's judgement, as well as determining your Framingham risk score. http://cvdrisk.nhlbi.nih.gov/

If your risk score exceeds 7%, or you have diabetes or hx of heart disease, you need a statin. No question there.

However - since you're probably relatively young, on keto, and exercise well - if you were my patient, i would not start any intervention. LDL is just a small piece if the puzzle. You could take fish oil / omega 3s, but youd need big doses to see any substantial change in your numbers... something on order of 3-4 grams twice daily.
I don't think im that kind of people, when i lose weight i do it relatively fast the first days ,but not as tragic as it explains in the link, then it slows down but now it has stop fully. This past days ive turn to eat mostly just fat in case that would make me start again, but ive been stuck fo almost a month.
I don't know what you mean by carb load, can you explain?
:)congrats! You look great!My stomachs is still a little chunky so I don't really know yet. I'll let you know when I hit my goal weight.What were your macros? :)Ugh, yes they do have carbs, and some have significant numbers of carbs and calories. I wrote to the company a few years ago because they keep these details well hidden and it's really difficult to find accurate nutritional information for individual varieties.

They also manage to sidestep federal requirements to list ingredients and nutritional information on individual boxes of k cups. Now 146.  Scale dropped under 206 this morning.  You're not going to let me catch up, are you?Allergies suck! However I'm glad that I could pass on the help. I had some yummy zucchini fries for tea and they were delicious, even my boyfriend loved them. This is a new start, keto on! Check this out too.

http://nusi.org/It's a big wonderful difference!  Congratulations! I'll describe me, these symptoms work on a continuum, and build up over time:

My endurance takes a huge hit, my normal cardio seems impossibly long and much harder than usual, my heart rate is much high than normal too.

My strength takes a huge hit, I can't make reps, and some times even getting a last set seems impossible.

I am tired all the time, getting up in the morning is a bitch even when I get a full night sleep. Sometimes my sleep will even be disturbed so I can't get the right kind of sleep.

I don't heal. DOMS comes back even if I should be adapted. If I tweak something, it stays tweaked.

I AM HUNGRY. Like insatiable eat 3000kcals every day (that's almost double my maintenance). It's like zombie hunger where I just shovel food in - which is the worst feeling.

Motivation goes in the toilet. This one is a gray area, because sometimes I don't feel like working out, but then get there and everything is great - this is not what I'm talking about - I'm talking about no motivation through the entire workout, like you body is literally telling you to go home the whole time.

Depending on how severe all these are determines how long I rest. What were you eating the past few days?

The usual advice is to start tracking your measurements (hips, waist, that stuff). And may be do a carb load night. It can help, if you are one of those people who lose weight [in whooshes](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/of-whooshes-and-squishy-fat.html).Count your carbs. Keep it below 25g per day (at most).

This isn't about self-denial though. Its the opposite. Find *utterly indulgent* keto recipes to feast upon. I had duck with maple bourbon cream today... I'm hardly engaging in asceticism. I still prefer lard. If not that, I'd go with peanut oil."ate meat, drank water"

^^- ^^it's ^^the ^^keto ^^subreddit.I've always been overweight as well, and I've tried dieting in the past and failed (yessss to stress eating, it's a problem). Keto has been the only thing that's really worked for me, and I mean that physically and mentally. After the first ten days of hell, I've never doubted my ability to sustain it for the long haul. It's freeing, really. I'm excited for you. Good luck!Rice bran is great. High smoke point and no greasy mouth feel.Sorry to hear that it hit you that hard.  It is interesting.  I am convinced at this point that my  flare ups were sugar/carb related.  Do you know historically what caused yours?  So far going passed the 8 week mark, last few weeks have been zero carb,  and have not had anything resembling a flare up.  Hopefully, one is not just waiting around the corner.  Ha!Thank you! We all have set backs! It's part of life. I struggled at the beginning. In fact, I remember writing a post here at r/keto that was something along the lines of 'oh my god, is this forever?' Keto was a huge change for me, and it took me a few tries to get it right.

The problem ended up being that when I first started I was doing keto in a way that was not sustainable long-term, it did not satisfy me, i was not happier eating keto than the alternative. It took a while, but eventually I evolved keto into a way of eating that I prefer to ANYTHING else, including those big ticket items that a lot of people struggle with. I can't really say what that will look like for you, but for me it was less snacking on pre-made keto things (like nuts and jerky) and more home-cooked meals (I had to make prep and cooking a bigger part of my life so that the majority of my food was whole meals.)Micronutrients may be lacking on a severe calorie deficit.

And a large deficit isn't considered sustainable over a long peroid of time. There are hypotheses for such "crash diets" like PSMF (Protein Sparing Modified Fast, check out /r/PSMF ). You might be able to learn something reseaching that area so you don't put your body into starvation mode, which will hinder your weightloss efforts.

Ketosis and being Keto is a diet/lifestyle so stating such low, ultimately not lifetime sustainable, calorie counts are the concern because it isn't the core of Keto. Ketosis and elimating carbs at a sustainable rate are. As I understand it. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong or missed something :) This is crazy, I just started vaping at the beginning of the month, started keto at the same time.


Is everyone here me?  (apart from being neophyte) I've been doing this a week.
Before I could easily handle a bottle of wine, no problem, no hangover.
I had two small vodka and diet cokes last night. I lost one of them.
I am such a cheap date now. Hoping the keto will help with acquiring one of those.

Anyway why this happens I am also curious about.
I'm wondering about aldehyde dehydrogenase and how drugs like metronidazole and disulfiram work (you never drink on those) in relation to this.
I've added some to the posting.Apparently 6L can kill a 165 lb person...Thank you!Holy $#%+ thank you!!!350-360

I guess the first fry may be more of a par cook, which could probably be about 250-275.The smoke point on olive oil is much too low for a lot of deep fried foods. All you're going to do is burn it.I started keto in March of '14. I was pretty strict with it through about the middle of May '14. I moved back home and was off keto for most of the summer before restarting at some point in August '14. I wasn't as strict last fall, and had too much chili on a couple Sundays during football season, which probably knocked me out of ketosis. Then a made the conscious decision to go off for holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, Super Bowl... lol). I also went out of town for the better part of a week in January, and decided it would be easier to go off keto for that.

All in all, I've been keto for the better part of a year, but I'd have a hard time saying it's been &gt;75%. But what I've done well, which I think some people screw up with, is that I get big streaks going. I don't cheat once a week. Cheating once a week is very counterproductive, since it takes a couple days to get back in, which means you'd really only have three days of weight loss every week.Hey! Welcome and good luck with your journey :)How do you manage to drink 8-10L per day? Don't you get water intoxication?I've added some to the posting.If you do it properly, with proper macronutrient ratios, electrolyte supplementation, nutrient dense whole foods, you don't have to worry about muscle loss.

Your muscle gains might not be as good as on a carbohydrate rich diet. But this is only assuming you were healthy in the first place. Insulin resistance screws hard with muscle gain and fat loss (it's only ironic that both muscle gain and fat loss increase insulin sensitivity).

If you are stuck in low carb limbo however, your body won't be able to adapt to use ketones in place of glucose. Gluconeogenesis will dominate that will wreck your muscle mass. Your water weight and electrolyte needs could also change wildly. You will feel like shit all the time.

Do it properly and you have nothing to worry about.Now 147. Sorry. (Scale dipped under 169 this morning.)I fapped to this. Thank you.I personally have one BPC per day. More than that and I feel that I've overdone it.First things first, keto isn't right for every person in every situation. In your case I would recommend watching your calories, and just try to limit the amount of sugars and starches you take in. You could still try to hit your protein macro, and maybe set a goal of between 75 and 100 carbs. If you can avoid the french fries and pasta, that shouldn't be unreasonable.

So, what you would have:

Protein: 120g, 480 calories

Carbohydrates: 100g, 400 calories

Fat: 100g, 900 calories.

This would give you about a 50fat/25protein/25carb ratio on your macros. It would still allow you to drink some delicious beer. 100g carbs would still allow for you to eat an actual serving of pasta (2oz), or a burger with a bun, and maybe toast with breakfast. You may not be able to have all of it in one day, but if you need to have everything every day there's not going to be a diet in the world that will help. I also think the high amount of fat would help with satiation. Maybe not as much as full on keto, but better than eating 60% of your calories from carbs.

Basically, you'd still have to avoid sugary treats. No soda, nothing more than a very occasional cookie or scoop of ice cream. You could probably do one meal with carbs, maybe two if you went light on each meal. And you could still drink beer (moderately).

All in all this would add up to about 1,800 calories, which if you're active at all, would still net you about a pound/week of weight loss. You wouldn't have to worry about bouncing in and out of keto. Well I never had any muscles to begin with, so there's that. Also, my huge calves from all those years of persistent heavy lifting do not seem to be going anywhere.You could always just have coffee with unsweeted almond milk or somethingMy weight loss rate was basically the same on IP and keto. My energy level is significantly higher on keto compared to IP, or any other point in my life for that matter. Depends on activity level. [See chart in this article](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/).Golly, there is a lot of hidden carbs there. No way that is only 30 grams of carbs a day.

Ditch the greek yoghurt, berries, sesame crackers, tortillas, grapefruit, and even the lunchmeat. Double-check the others to make sure you really don't consume hidden or mislabeled carbohydrates. Look them up in online databases as well, don't rely exclusively on food labels.

As for what to eat: [I wrote a comment describing what foods to eat to combat depression](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2weebx/unemployment_can_change_peoples_personalities/coqkkwu). "Coincidentally" most of them are applicable to keto.

Add cheese as well because it is an excellent source of calcium for low carb diets.

And as always, when in doubt, increase your fat intake.Wow!!! You look great! :DWhat is your activity level? 1800 calories might be excessive for a sedentary person, but a huge calorie deficit for a strength or endurance trainer.I remember a similar study that showed that the fatty acid composition of beef is the least sensitive to feeding patterns, compared to chicken, pig, and lamb. So yeah, if you deem grass fed meat too expensive, just go with beef.

Also, Omega 3 enriched eggs rule.
he would have to eat way more protein than he does to get kicked out of ketosisA League of Legends streamer in all honesty. Sky WilliamsYou might be consuming too much protein, and thus gluconeogenesis and uric acid production dominates.
Incredible difference! You look like you lost more than 30lbs. I'm sure there's muscle gain in there as well. Gym's paying off! Keep up the good work, I think you have a shot at that 6-pack you want by summer. I don't have any knowledge about the programs you're doing but if you're looking to gain (well rounded) strength, I recommend Starting Strength.Try her on Atkins. It's more or less keto, and it's famous enough she should be confident it can work.Eat Spinach and Broccoli every day, you can get 4 grams of Potassium easily that way. Avocados are a good source of Potassium as well, but I dislike them.

Use a mixture of Salt and Potassium Chloride in a 1:1 ratio in your salt shaker.

Dissolving Potassium Chloride, and especially Potassium Citrate in water and consuming it that way did not really work for me, but the above did.Did family come over in November? I mean, those bed sheets are messed up EXACTLY the same in all other pictures so it's obvious something messed up your routine.

Come to Reddit for complements and quality conversations. End up with Internet Strangers judging your choices! Muscle meat contains glycogen.Your comment really helped me, too.  I'm allergic to bell peppers so I go to great lengths to stay far, far away from them.  I need to think of doing keto the same way...bad carbs are something I'm just "allergic" to!  Excellent way of thinking of it!

I DO have to do keto for the rest of my life, so your post was very helpful for me, too.  Thanks for that.String cheese? Any cheese. This is keto, I eat blocks of cheese like they were slices of cake.nice, but we need details... how long did it take you?
did you go strict keto day one, or gradually ease into it.Oh awesome advice thanks! As I use it only in cooking it seems weird to me to put it on my skin xD Good job you added that bit about the face - was literally just thinking 'hmm I guess I could try that there'... I will give it a shot on my skin and see what happens. :)Oh I'm getting there I sneak them in more than anything. That's good to know. Thank you.Ooh really? I'd always though fish oil was associated with joints - had no idea it was good for skin too!What temperature? Joke: You just stop putting maple syrup on everything eh?


Serious: Great work. Feels great getting out of the 500's doesn't it? I know I was there myself, but it took me like 6 months to lose the amount you did; congrats.&gt; now that the bf is getting lower its getting a LOT harder

I'm sorry but uh... are we still doing phrasing?Thanks for sharing. I feel the same way about running.. but it hurts the feet and knees..  i found i get the same cardio impact by riding a bike and swimming laps with no negative impact damage to my joints.  keep up the good work! &gt;I'm thinking of stopping and joining a priesthood so I don't have to do it any more.

Please don't... &gt;. &lt;In and Out protein style... mmmmmm anther winnerYeah! They're great if you're craving some wings! These gummies look great. I can't wait to try making them this weekend. :) You might have to supplement with magnesium. I had this as well, over a two week period I had it four times. Horrendous time. I'd rather have excess diarrhea for 24 hours than have that type of constipation. Before I started taking magnesium, I dabbled with chicory root gummies. That fixed the constipation but I then had horrible smelly farts and they had carbs. I also tried fibercon generic and that worked as well. I am now taking Natural Calm magnesium and I am pretty regular although it has only been a week. Got damn get ahold of meWell done! I personally wouldn't worry too much about the ol' total cholesterol at that level or LDL-C.

LDL-C is also a bad predictor of bad things and, as some have said, overestimated in people with low TG.

All I know is that the ones I got tasted like a hot, steaming bowl of aspartame. Flawless hahaLots of things get better in the early days of keto; this is perhaps one of them. Careful with the water, though. I know that people say to drink gallons of the stuff, but that can be a pretty good way to remove electrolytes and lead to big problems like lightheadedness and oddly, thirst, if you don't replenish them (which can be particularly hard to do with potassium).I honestly think I would struggle to get more cals in. Lactose intolerant so been trying to gradually introduce some dairy like cream and hard cheeses to try and build a tolerance.  Not pleasant to say the least lol. That being said my skin is looking much better from the coconut oil. Always had greasy skin but these last couple of weeks had no troublevegetableHad one of them last night. Gude shit, but may have to ask for a double next time.Well your deficit is way too high. Should start at around 20% and you are using ketostix which are basically condemned by this community as they do not signify nutritional ketosis soooo yeah put down the the stix and recalculate your deficit for a more healthy way of living. Don't rush weight loss. You'll get there.I don't know how to do the flair thing haha and I only use mobile, but I'll try to figure it out. My start weight was 186 and I'm down to around 164. I'm happy it looks like more though :)There are already a lot of comments here... And I'm reading this post on my mobile so can't say I've even skimmed through them all.

Needless to say... Holy crap, OP, is this all TRUE? I'm 2 dedicated months into a keto diet and am a first time keto'er.  I list a terrific amount of weight in my first month - 5 to 10 pounds I'd say. However, at the end of Month 2, have not lost even a full pound more :( it's really upsetting,  even though I know everyone says stalls are normal and must be expected.

But my experience does mirror what you said re: stalling early on (happened), being afraid to eat calories (old habits die hard), obsessively counting calories (guilty), and being afraid to eat FAT (my brain keeps saying nonono)!

I'm trying to grocery shop for primarily 0 net carb (or close to) items to stock my fridge and pantry with now, and doing the fat bomb thing in order to reacclimatize to a proper keto (High Fat!) food plan.

God... I hope this works. Hate the way the extra pounds have been making me feel lately.

Thank you for this post. Was the first thread that came up when I searched "month stall" in /r/keto. I've just been following the keto diet! Used MFP for a while at first but quit after I got the hang of things. Haven't been doing any exercising besides walking at work!Oh true, keto requires a lot of fluids and salts; that's a possibility. I wouldn't worry about too much unless it lasts for like a week or more. Looking up symptoms on the internet almost always blows things out of proportion~HelloThanks again.Sounds like a perfect "flavor reset" juice.Thanks for the info.  I don't think I have a cold, after reading some other responses about fluids and electrolytes, I am thinking my problem lies there.  I'm just glad to know that you can be on keto and still enjoy vaping.I'm not really sure why you would only want to eat 800 calories per day... your protein goal as listed in the calculator is to ensure you are getting enough protein for your LBM and not cannabalize your own muscles.  Fat is really there to help with satiety.
Without knowing your stats it's hard to say.I don't want to sound like a snob, but I admittedly am, so head over to /r/coffee and never drink k-cups again.  Once you learn to make a good cup of coffee you won't need to worry about flavored coffee.I think protein is to high... I believe the diet is suppose to be high fat, moderate protein and low carb. If you have to much protein it will turn in to glucose and kick you out of ketosis and your liver will recent it with time. What about you recalculate your macros with the calculator on the side bar? :)Vaper who was Keto-ing last year (until I reached my goals). I've had the no-taste mouth once or twice. I don't know that vaping has anything to do with it.

It's possible you just have a cold. Sometimes colds can cause loss of taste for a while.

But during my vaping (about 2 years now) no-taste hasn't been a problem more than twice that I can remember. And even then it was maybe a day&gt; Of relevance to those following a ketogenic diet, other studies have shown that eating a low-carbohydrate diet shifts the bacteria population toward that found in lean people.

Link?Oh and another flavor to try if you haven't, that seems to always cure my vapor tongue...Mastermind Snake Oil. It's a melon/menthol flavor.Okay great! Thanks very much! :)what about olive oil?When I was using the Protank, I used to pull the wicks, dry burn and clean the coils and then rewick with organic cotton yarn. The cotton keeps it tasting fresher longer and it was easy to rewick. But then I got lazy and started using the Nautilus and Eleaf BVCs. I'm thinking about going back to the Protank, just so I can rewick.Yeah, PG carries flavor, causes throat hit, and is very thin; VG makes clouds and adds thickness.

Hope you're able to find a solution!That would make sense, as from what I understand of ejuice, PG is the flavor carrier, right?  I've never heard of Seduce Juice, but I'm always on the prowl for new products.  Thank you for the reply!I wish I had been taking consistent progress pics. Excellent work!!Interesting, I've never heard of adding vodka before.  I change my coils pretty regularly, usually about once a week or if I notice that it seems gunked up or the flavor is off (back when I could taste it properly, ha!)  Thanks for your comment.If you are eating the Mission Carb balance low carb tortillas, there area options in the MFP food directory showing the net carbs, for both the fajita and burrito sizesNo gas anymore, most of the time, but when I do get it, yikes!I definitely see it! Like PP said, I see a lot in your face (lucky! :-)  ) and even your arms/shoulders. Keep up the good work!I'm two months too late responding because I chickened out on checking comments then forgot, but thank you so much! Even now, two months later, this is crazy encouraging and makes me smile. I appreciate it. Great job! I still want to get started with keto but am not sure how to go about it. Any tips from a fellow stalky short person? ThanksYou could try using a 50/50 blend, or cutting it yourself with the tiniest bit of distilled vodka (i'm talking a couple drops per 5ml). The higher VG blends tend to coat the tongue in my experience.

Also, how fresh is your coil?

I experienced vapor tongue even before I went keto. It comes and goes. Sometimes switching flavors helps, changing flavors, adding menthol/strong mint, or changing coils.100% of the time since Oct. 8th 2013.  To me, cheating isn't worth it. Losing 161 pounds (so far) is worth it.Hmm, I haven't tried the Atlantis but I was looking at picking up an ipv3 soon myself. I have an Aspire Nautilus Mini right now.

I personally find that more PG in my juice really makes a big difference in increasing the flavor. 70% and up VG juices almost completely lose their flavor to me. I also ditched stuff like Mount Baker Vapor a long time ago and I've never looked back (sounds like you might have too, you've got a pretty serious setup there), my current favorite is Seduce Juice but I'm gonna try some more stuff soon. I'd definitely give them a shot if you haven't, the flavors are the strongest I've had from anywhere.Oils, butter, soft cheeses (cheddar is horrible for constipation), and peanut butter are a few off the top of my head.

You do not look like the same person at all, so far out of the realm of possibility that you don't even look related to your former self. Good job!Use the keto calculator, and determine your macros, keep count of your carbs, protein, and fat. Read through this reddit and see the different posts on protein powders used, the food, recommendations. You can find lots of recipes here and on keto recipes. Good luckI have an IPV mini with an aspire atlantis, I usually run it at about 25w.  I generally use high (70-80% )vg blends.  I can't say I've tried others...I see a lot of people using RDA's, but I prefer the convenience of a tank.As long as it fits within your macros, you can eat just about anything. I don't know what the Zija is, but work it in with the rest of your carbs, and see how you feel
Strange idea, but I have noticed that without the right setup, my flavor can be seriously lacking. Specifically upgrading juices helped me a lot. What juices have you been vaping, and on what setups, may I ask? And have you tried other people's?BPC is good but I definitely prefer my coffee without the oil and butter. I've been a huge tea drinker my whole life and had a hard time adjusting to not using milk in it. Even after 2.5 years eating keto I still only do half whole milk and half H&amp;H as I just can't do the creaminess in tea. If you love cream in your tea then you'll love this recipe as it's so rich. Mmm.They usually have some chicken choices that are keto friendly. Just go with veggies instead of the normal starches like rice or lo mein. Okay, good to knowThe "meat kills you" studies are almost all observational/epidemiological which can't determine causality, [here's a longer post](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ei6hp/my_vegan_friend_posted_this_on_facebook_i_would/ca0ik3y) on why these types of studies are wrong around 80% of the time.

Here's some additional articles on the issues with these types of studies:

From the available randomized controlled trials we have there's no indication that low carb would be bad, almost every health marker improves just as much as, or slightly better than, on low fat diets.

I posted this in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1qakxb/please_help_me_educate_my_so_about_keto_books/cdax0wm):

A review focused on discussion of why low carb works:


&gt; In short-term and long-term  comparison studies, ad libitum and isocaloric therapeutic diets with varying degrees of carbohydrate restriction perform as well as or better than comparable  LF diets with regard to weight loss, lipid levels, glucose and insulin  response,  blood pressure,  and other  important cardiovascular risk markers in both normal subjects and those with metabolic and other health-related disorders.

...

&gt; The metabolic, hormonal, and appetite signaling effects of carbohydrate reduction suggest an underlying scientific basis for considering it as an alternative approach to LF, high-carbohydrate recommendations in addressing overweight/obesity and chronic disease in America. It is time to embrace LC diets as a viable option to aid in reversing diabetes mellitus, risk factors for heart disease, and the epidemic of obesity.

*Hite AH, et al.* ["Low-carbohydrate diet review: shifting the paradigm"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21586415) *Nutr Clin Pract. 2011 Jun;26(3):300-8. doi: 10.1177/0884533611405791.*

A review looking more at actual outcomes of low carb studies:

&gt; Meta-analysis showed LCD to be clearly associated with significant decreases in body weight, BMI, abdominal circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, fasting plasma
glucose, glycated haemoglobin, plasma insulin and plasma
CRP, as well as with an increase in HDL-C. LDL-C and creatinine did not change significantly, whereas limited
data were conflicted regarding plasma uric acid.

*Santos FL, et al.* ["Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials of the effects of low carbohydrate diets on cardiovascular risk factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22905670) *Obes Rev. 2012 Nov;13(11):1048-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.01021.x. Epub 2012 Aug 21.*

And a review looking specifically at very low carb ketogenic studies:

&gt; In conclusion, the present meta-analysis demonstrates that
individuals assigned to a VLCKD achieve significantly greater
long-term reductions in body weight, diastolic blood pressure
and TAG, as well as greater LDL and HDL increases when
compared with individuals assigned to a LFD; hence, the
VLCKD may be an alternative tool against obesity.

*Bueno NB, et al.* ["Very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet v. low-fat diet for long-term weight loss: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651522) *Br J Nutr. 2013 Oct;110(7):1178-87. doi: 10.1017/S0007114513000548. Epub 2013 May 7.*You might also want to use the Iranian formula ([calculator](http://homepages.slingshot.co.nz/%7Egeoff36/LDL_mg.htm)) to calculate LDL:

&gt; In patients with low serum triglyceride and undesirably high total cholesterol levels, Friedewald equation may overestimate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and it should be either directly assayed or be calculated by a modified Friedewald equation.

*Ahmadi SA, et al.* ["The impact of low serum triglyceride on LDL-cholesterol estimation"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18426324) *Arch Iran Med. 2008 May;11(3):318-21.*

This puts your LDL at around 183 mg/dl which is a bit better, but still high. Ideally you'd want an NMR or VAP ([longer post](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/20713r/going_to_get_cholesterol_tested_on_thursday_what/cg0hmfh)) but just trying more unsaturated fats and seeing what happens is probably the safest bet if you can't. I'm dealing with a similar issue with my family. At some point I think you're going to have to accept that this is someone set in her ways and isn't really looking to change, or at least it sure doesn't sound like it. Old people tend to get like that: they think they're entitled to x, y, and z as well as a, b, and c. They want to have their popcorn and ice cream and eat it too (before bed).What great inspiration! I don't know you but I'm so proud of you!!! Keep it up!How long do you keep the oil in there?

How long do you use it before swapping it out?

What kind of oil do you use?

I ask because I want a fryer but lack any and all knowledge on proper use.Fried cauliflowerYou look young, hope your skin rebounds. I'm afraid if I ever achieve my goal, I'm gonna have flappy skin everywhere. Good jobI don't have access to a gym, but I'm actually going on week two of a workout I based on the One Hundred Push-ups challenge. Four sets each per day of eight different exercises, focusing on pushups, lunges, chin-ups, sit-ups on M/W/F; and dips, squats, pull-ups and crunches on T/T/S. Sunday I do max reps. My legs are way ahead of everything else, though, because I already go on epic walk/jogs on a fairly regular basis.Ahh, this is perfect, thank you for these tips, they will definitely be helpful!Yea I'm going to have to go ahead and disagree with you thereThis stuff is awesome, but way to expensive.A lot of ground beef patties, bacon-wrapped chicken thighs (they at least have some fat in them, unlike most boneless skinless chicken parts you can find in a frozen bag), pork rinds, salmon, kippers, sardines, liverwurst. Eggs in moderation

Honestly it's probably closer to 5g carbs for me since I still eat some dairy, but reducing my carbs to this level is what it finally took to get me losing weight again. I never liked vegetables anyway; like my hero, Monkey D Luffy, I crave meat.Fuck off dude. I don't even vape but I also don't give a shit if other people do. Get a fucking life. With a beard like that, you're going to need to start lifting weights.

/r/ketogainsAmazing! I second the request for some before/after photos if you're comfortable sharing - they are so motivating.

Well done I buy Morton lite salt and use it to season my food or put it in flavored drinks. It's an excellent source of potassium at 610mg per 1/4 teaspoon. You should get about 5g sodium, 1-3g potassium and 500mg magnesium per day. Broth is good for sodium and I just take magnesium pills every couple of days. Hope that helps. And yeah I don't know why all the hostility, but I do notice this sub is getting worse and worse and less accepting of people's decisions. Excellent, I'm heading there now.  Thanks again.I ask this literally every time someone posts about massive weight loss, but yours is especially incredible so I have to ask.

What is your experience with loose skin? Did you get much/any?In truth, I haven't monitored this at all during the past week; I suspect that this is probably where my problems lie.  I'm going to revisit the FAQ and see what I need to do in order to be more cognizant of electrolyte intake.  By the way, I appreciate your comment, I was kind of taken aback by some of the vitriol here. Many thanks!No problem! I believe theres some info regarding electrolytes on the sidebar, under "FAQ". Good luck!Exactly. It seems awfully hypocritical for people to be criticizing someone who wants to have a healthier lifestyle. I get that there are people who don't vaping but this is not the place to be discussing that. I appreciate the reply!  I'll definitely do some research and see what I need to do in order to increase my electrolyte intake; I've definitely been neglectful in paying attention to that.  Thanks again.Why are so many people being fucking dick heads about this guy vaping? If you have advice, give it. If not, there's no need to comment. He vapes. He doesn't want to stop, he wants advice. Get over it.

OP, how much potassium are you getting? Magnesium? I still eat them in about 25% the amount I used to (used to cook with 2 large onions for a pot, now use half a large or one small; 20-40g for a single serving).

Anyway 20g is a guideline to try and hover around (if it wasn't all at once and came from veggies mostly 30-50g generally doesn't hurt, but 20g is safe for most people), so don't freak out about today, but don't take it as license to go crazy all the time.Rude?  I'm just being honest. Vapers never shut up about their new Vapatron 5000 and the new snozberry blend they're hitting.  What kind of lanyard do you keep your rig on?  Careful with rubs, they tend to have quite a bit of sugar in them.This is really logical, but it's terrible advice. Try taking in some more electrolytes and/or drink less caffeine as it's a diuretic. I vape as well and have no issues of vapers tongue while in ketosis. Rawwwwr! Nice work! Love the beard&gt;Apparently from what I've read, Keto is not a very good diet for people who suffer from gout.

Only during adaptation (ketones compete for excretion with uric acid), so if you cycle in out and are susceptible then yeah.

Long read, but as a gout sufferer you're probably used to spending your downtime hours in agony with nothing else on your mind but WTF is going on:

- http://highsteaks.com/forum/health-nutrition-and-science/gout-uric-acid-low-carb-keto-diets-kidney-stones-function-111.0.htmlDepends. There are some that are flavored coffee that have no sugar, and some that are similar to hot chocolate mix and they're full of sugar. My in-laws bought us a huge variety pack and we can't use any of them! They're flavors like Chai, Mocha, and Hot Chocolate and it's basically just a powdered drink mix in the K cup. So after you brew it, the cup itself is empty. If there are coffee grounds left inside the cup after brewing, it's probably safe.I would opine that trolling and being rude is a habit deserving of mockery, and would likewise agree that there are many other hobbies you could occupy yourself with.e-cig necklace? I have dozens of coworkers that vape. I've seen probably hundreds of people vaping in public. I have never see anything that looks like a necklace. It's a habit deserving mockery.  Seriously, you look like a fool.  There are so many other hobbies to choose from!  It's sorbitol, which I consider pretty ok. I'd eat it.You've been pointed in the right direction for pizza crust already (honestly Holy Grail crust: egg, cream cheese, cheddar, mozza, almond flour; is better than normal bread imho) but I will add here that it's probably best to steer clear of the Atkins bars and sweets.

First, the Atkins carb counts use some kind of math unbeknownst to us mere mortals and the net carbs often don't add up (even when you subtract sugar alcohols).

Second, the favoured sweetener is maltitol, which is known to have a significant glycemic effect (~50% that of pure glucose) compared to other sweeteners, and which is also known to cause volcanic diarrhoea (small amounts are okay, and it varies person to person; google Haribo Gummy Bears for examples of what happens on maltitol overdose).Trying to look cool is not my objective here.  Why the mockery?You might try making a wrap with lettuce or a low-carb tortilla as the outside. You can make tuna or chicken salad or layer some lunch meats and veggies in them and it isn't messy at all. My favorite is to take a bunch of those precooked grilled chicken strips in the freezer section, warm them up, mix them with buffalo sauce, and then put that in the wrap with blue cheese dressing. Sometimes I add celery and lettuce inside as well. Ya there's not enough data to predict how long vegans will live because nobody gives a shit how long they live.  Re-purposed joke:  "How can you tell someone is a vegan?  They tell you."

Jokes aside, no real need to deal with it.  At worst you can just tell him to worry about his own life and not yours.  IMHO if your diet is based entirely on the hopes that you'll tack more years on to the end of your life, you're doing it wrong.Hey I'm new here and I want to start doing this diet but I want to know something first. Is popcorn okay to eat, and what kind of foods are safe to snack on for a while?What sort of other things do you have going on?  thanks for pointing out Peter Attia.  I just watched his ted talk.  what a studYou should put the before on the left and the after on the rightI think it looks like there's some rosemary in there! How decadent!Me too!  I may find a sour jello and kook-aid. Oh! Just quit? God damn. I didn't know it was that easy! Thanks man, you cured me.This sounds good. Were your jello and Kool-aid the same flavors?I don't smoke, I vape.  If people think I look like a douchebag because I vape, then that's their problem.  I have better things to do than worry about people judging me for it.Fine.  Enjoy your nicotine addiction and your e-cig necklace thingy.  You look really cool!  just quit smoking. I went from smoking a pack a day to vaping at 12mg to 4mg to zero. plus i dont look like a douche bag anymore.April of last year I moved to the San Jose area... there is nothing that resembles good bbq here. I cry every time.Respectfully, this is not helpful.Killing it, nice job.NICE dude! Enjoy it!Seems like a great idea.  [here](http://mariamindbodyhealth.com/french-toast-and-pure-proteinfat-days/) and somewhere else on that blog she makes syrup or caramel sauce with butter, erythritol and cream (or I guess almond milk on this page). I was satisfied with water, butter, erythritol and maple extract. However, I also just like a berries cooked down into a sauce with a spoonful of erythritol over syrup.Or, you could just quit vaping.  Doing it makes you look like an idiot anyway.  could you please describe what you did to achieve this  also what was your motivation and your mindset."Hey, friend. I think your a good guy, and I respect your opinions, but we just don't see eye to eye on the ideal human nutrition. Let's agree to disagree, and leave it at that."40lbs!  It feels good doesn't it (!!), but if you cut off the beard it might be 42lbs :)  Just kidding, I like it and you really look great!Yowzer that looks good. Thanks. Now how to replace the syrup taste...It's my pleasure. I'm glad to see that this had a positive effect on you, it's apparent just from the change in your writing voice.

And don't be afraid of steak. Try to buy a thicker cut so you can sear it without overcooking. If you have to, cut a thick steak into two thick smaller steaks and freeze the other half. Always dry brine it. Take your stainless steel or cast iron pan and get it nice and hot. Put your coconut oil or clarified butter in (need a fat that can take that heat), dry your contact side of your steak with a paper towel, and put it in. The meat will stick at first - don't worry, it will stop sticking once it's seared. The color sear you're looking for is brown, not black. Sear the other side for a few minutes and then pop it in an oven at 350. Check it every few mins with a thermometer until it's at your desired temp. Rest it for a few minutes and eat.You've done an amazing job! Why is it pointless? I'm eating it. And that's really just as "necessary" as someone doing that to a pig or cow or chicken, since you and I both have alternatives.upvote bc i hate being a fat fuck too!Double fry the wings for extra crispy tastiness.  Melt butter, add franks hot sauce to it and toss your wings in it.  It's now a parody.

Then add and meats like goat and quail and kangarooAlright. Ill alternate. Thanks!if it's fresh mozzarella and a little porous I think it'll actually be pretty absorbent. that's awesome, thanks!sometimes the flavor of olive is lost when added to dishes :(What kind of juice are you drinking if you hope to enter ketosis? It couldn't have any fruit in itFollowed [this recipe](http://mariamindbodyhealth.com/protein-waffles/) with all measurements halfed (didn't need so many waffles... and only had ~1c almond flour) and using 1 scoop Quest multipurpose mix for the protein powder (it looked like roughly half a cup to me). I also added a dash of cinnamon, tiniest pinch of nutmeg, and a splash of vanilla extract. Don't discuss, but keep in mind "My food eats your food"Yea!Add said ingrediants to whatever dish you're eating. Avoid sticking to old routines. I like the WW shake. Chocolatey, creamy, etc. Only problem is most of the WW shakes I find are high carb (like 26 a bottle) but they have a special "Protein" brand that I get that's not but that seems to be harder and harder to find.Afaik, avoiding carbs has a frequent beneficial effect on heartburn . Unless there's an unavoidable ,untreatable medical condition requiring them, it would be great to get off the PPI s due to long term side effects.
 Losing some excess weight in and of itself could help probably, as well. I would also like to know the answer to this ^^^ I love gummy candies (gummy cola bottles were my favorite) but not so keen on jello. Its a texture thing. :PNice. I'm going to have to get another Costco membership. Thanks!Thank you so much for replying. (I had to start another account. My password was not working. Haha) I am 5'5" and my current weight is 189 lbs. My macro goal are currently net carbs: 20 g, fat:156 g, and protein: 66 g. I have not measured yet but that is a fabulous idea. Energy wise, mental focus and general health is on a good track. Are my macros goals set properly? And, I do Kettlebell circuits 3-4 times a week. Tell me more about these waffles you speak of...you look great :D Eat them. But only #ifitfitsyourmacros. Right but with just juice in ketosis I would lose way more weight way quicker. I do juice fasts once every 6 motnhs, never did a keto oneDo they fit your macros?

Also the Atkins pizza is pretty disgusting.

Up your pizza game.

How long do you use it before swapping it out?

 What kind of oil do you use?

I ask because I want a fryer but lack any and all knowledge on proper use.Slow clapThanks!protips:

- insulin is a mechanism to rid your bloodstream of excess glucose, which can cause seizure, heart disease, etc... however, it works mainly in the liver, by encapsulating glucose as glycogen.

- adipose tissue (aka fat cells, not to be confused with dietary fat like triglycerides), are a mechanism by which your body rids the bloodstream of excess... you guessed it... lipids...  (stroke, heart disease, liver disease, etc...) so by eating lipids, you're feeding your adipose/fat cells.

furthermore, the latter will seriously mess up your liver. on par with alcoholism/diabetes... (if you don't cut the carbs, and then you're borderlining ketogenic shock).

t2 diabetes stems from insulin resistance, but that stems from fatty liver... the way to obtain a fatty liver is to mix carbs with fats. eat one of the other and you won't gain weight, but you will feel lethargic (ie: braindead), and tired on a carb-restricted diet. pretty much it's glycogen depletion, which is fuel for your brain and muscles. furthermore your body will need to expend even more energy to create glucose through gluconeogenesis.

i think the fallacy here comes from what people consider a 'low-fat' diet. i've seen studies cite that as 25-35% caloric content from fat sources. that is simply erroneous. it should be 5-10% from fat.

hence why you get so many false positives of 'studies' (ahem*cough*hack), claiming health benefits to low-carb over low-fat... because there is an obvious double standard.

above all, most diets works simply by the equation: calories out &gt; calories in. if you metabolize the carbs/fat (calories) you're consuming before they reach too high a concentration in the blood, then they won't be 'stored'... simple as that really...

in any case, weight loss should not be confused with health effects. if you're eating keto, and don't burn the calories, they will be stored as fat... enjoy your early grave...I've done juice fasts before, there's no need to do them to get into Ketosis. Your body enters Ketosis within approx 24 hours if you consume less than 20 net carbs. Unfortunately that's not true at all.  24 hours won't put you in ketosis.its not a gimmick, i've done it before and you lose a pound a day and feel great
Isopure Zero Carb protein powder! I have a hard time meeting my protein and heard/read so much positive feedback on it I tried it and am very happy with it.
As for pricing I think it's actually pretty reasonable for what's out there. You can get a 3lb tub on amazon for $40. I get a 1lb bag at Vitamin Shoppe for $23 and it lasts me two weeks.

I like to use it on it's own or with coffee. Was most impressed when I was able to drink and even enjoy it with water alone.
Protein coffee in the morning: 1 scoop vanilla Isopure, 1TBSP Coconut Oil, 1 cup coffee. You don't NEED the coconut oil but I like to use it to help keep me full in the morning.

Protein shake: 1 scoop vanilla isopure, 1 cup water OR unsweetened almond milk. I like to throw this in a blender with a handful of spinach for some extra greens/iron.The change is noticeable.  It's in your face, arms and chest that you see it the most, remember the belly fat is the last to go.  Congrats on your progress, I'm a little less than two weeks into keto but it feels amazing and people like you inspire me to keep going!this looks so gooooodJust eat food, and eat less than 20 carbs. You're in Ketosis within 24 hours. No need for gimmicks. Good luck with it! Moderate exercise in a fasted state before your juice should speed up the process too!  Just make sure to be rediculously hydrated and get your elecrolytes!Low-carb / keto is often not as easy the second time around. Second-timers often find that they have to set stricter carb limits and may need to pay attention to calories.

One idea is to still attend the family gatherings, but don't eat the carbs.Mozzarella, with a little salt.

Not absorbent, but awesome with olive oil, and readily available in restaurants.Yes to juicefast, and yes to Keto. I have done them before, but I used primarily fruit, and I still lost a ton of weight. I can't imagine how much I could lose if I entered ketosis. Keto is well-known for reducing appetite and bringing your hunger levels under control. This is one of the reasons that it works so well.

Over time, keto will provide you with more energy than you had before. However, workouts will be a challenge for a while since your muscles are likely mostly empty of their normal fuel, glycogen. Eventually (if you stick with keto), your muscles will adapt to running on fatty acids and your brain will adapt to running primarily on ketones.

Sounds like you're doing great.Many people who are lactose intolerant find that they can eat dairy on keto. This is because keto tells you to avoid the high-lactose items such as milk. Cheeses actually have very little lactose. However, they may still be too much if you are severely intolerant.

The easiest thing to do is to eat fatty meats (without any sugary sauces such as teriyaki), fatty fish (e.g. salmon or mackerel), and low-carb vegetables sauteed in olive oil or coconut oil. Include avocados, eggs, leafy green vegetables, homemade mayonnaise.Well, actually, I was going to do a juice fast without fruit so I can enter ketosisThere's a reason this sub is huge.  There's a reason strictly fitness sites such as bodybuilding.com have a keto specific sub.  The proof is in the results.  Read and understand the faqs and apply.  You don't have to justify your decision to anyone.  Now go eat some bacon and lose weight! How do you stick to your protien macros?I just feel like there's such a difference in my activity levels from day to day, that I shouldn't be eating as much on my off days. Maybe that's just old diet habits speaking! You gotta Alternate fingers, use the lateral area not right on fingertip goal is to avoid forming excess scar tissue leading to decreased sense of touch in the overdone index finger.

Superstition vs screwed up touch in finger.
K,done.Yes, if you drank enough. The amount of protein that you need is determined by the amount of lean body mass (muscle) that you have.

The keto forum recommends eating around 0.8 grams of protein for every pound of lean body mass. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds and have 20% body fat, then you have 160 pounds of lean body mass. 160 * 0.8 is 128 grams of protein.

You would want to use a high quality protein powder.

If you want to read about a diet that is essentially starvation with protein replacement, read about the protein sparing modified fast (PSMF) in /r/PSMF

Note: if you drink sugar juices and you have insulin resistance, then the juice could cause high insulin levels which could prevent your body from accessing its fat stores. That could dramatically increase the amount of calories that you would need to consume in order to avoid feeling hungry, fatigued etc.

If you are considering a juice fast or a protein sparing modified fast, you should also consider keto. Keto is similar except that it avoids extreme calorie deficits by adding calories in the form of healthy fats. This tends to leave you with more energy and less fatigue. It also allows your body to access its stored fat for energy.What if I were to drink protein during a starvation diet like a juice fast? would that prevent muscle loss?
This photo looks really fake.No need to feel deprived! If you like to cook you can make some close substitutes.

Ruled.me has some good Thai recipes including pad thai zoodles and cauliflower fried rice.

Bangin'!Congrats. You were still cute 70 pounds ago too. :)Wow, I now have hope for me =DIf you go on a starvation diet (e.g. hunger strike), your body will burn fat plus some muscle. It will burn the muscle to make some glucose and to obtain some essential amino acids for building proteins, hormones, etc.

Now.. what do you suppose would happen if you were on a starvation diet, except that each day you decided to eat enough meat to provide the same amount of protein that your starving body had been acquiring by burning muscle?

The answer is that your body would start using the protein that you ate to avoid having to eat its own muscle. Why wouldn't it? To do otherwise, would mean that evolution doesn't work very well.

Here is what happens when you restrict carbs.

1) Your body uses all of the stored carbohydrate in your muscles and liver which was stored in the form of glycogen.

2) Once the glycogen is all gone, the liver begins burning fat instead of glycogen.

3) When the liver burns fat, it produces ketones.

4) Ketones work as a replacement for glucose in many of the body's tissues including much of the brain.

5) Where ketones aren't sufficient, the body will make glucose by burning the glycerol from fat molecules and by converting some small amount of protein to glucose in the liver via a process called gluconeogenesis.

The bottom line is that your body won't miss the glucose from the missing carbs and it will receive all of the protein that it needs from what you eat.

As a nice side effect, eating fewer carbs will lower your insulin levels which allows glucagon to increase which will allow your fat cells to release fat for energy.ThanksYou were very handsome before but now you're glowing!My husband and I raise grass fed beef. If you need proof about how different it is, buy any regular cut of meat, and then buy the same in grass fed. They carry their fat and muscle in totally different places. The color is even different.

Edit: spelling Tell him that obesity also has a high mortality rate. Tell him that you'll take your chances that you can lose the weight before you die from heart disease. At that time, you can reconsider his offer to convert you to veganism :)



I don't plan on staying strict keto forever. I'm happy with my weight right now, but I want to continue to work on my relationship with food. Once I'm satisfied that I won't ever go back to my old ways, I plan to move to a "paleoish" diet. We'd respond to your question , but we don't even have muscles left in our fingers . But seriously, keto doesn't eat away your muscles as long as you eat adequate protein . Which is true for any way of eating . Some advice, play around with the baking time. My oven would have absolutely scorched it at the recipe's stated time plus it allows you to adjust the texture to your preference.Sadly, eating "normally" in our society IS unhealthy...I'm in the kc area. Bryant's is the best! The sauce is actually sold in walmarts as far as 100 miles away.
Also, Oklahoma Joes/Joe's Kansas City has an really good Carolina style vinegar based sauce. Very low carb.
Sounds like you need to add some items to your wardrobe

For example:

* Meat is Murder! Tasty, tasty murder ...
* I like vegans... I just can't eat a whole one by myselfLol I love the results I'm seeing with keto and I'm quite comfortable on the diet (no stress or food obbessing). Sometimes I do feel like it's too good to be true but I try to stick to the keto macros but on paleo approved foods. I do love my bulletproof coffee. Oh my goodness, bread. Thank you!It doesn't taste very good. Try some of the recipes on /r/ketorecipes. They are much tastier and aren't hard. I use the one that is almond flour, cream cheese, egg, and shredded up cheese. I usually go for white sauces (typically a philly pizza) as they are lower in carb. You can use red sauces if it fits your macros. I also use that recipe as a hearty sandwich bread.Can't tell if super disgusting or fun and delicious. Was going for 2 until I saw that it's xposted.

??? :)OPs normal style of eating did lead them to being overweight . Normal isn't a defined "thing" . Your normal is probably very different than mine . OPs current/non keto normal way of eating has led to them being overweight - they cannot return to this way of eating. A new normal must be achieved and stuck with to maintain a healthy weight . Be it Keto or some other "diet", but whatever it is, it's not the current state of eating . PLEASE do not listen to this person. Spend some time reading the legit science articles on here or anywhere, and make up your own mind. Even if you find something else you like better, like I know a few people who do Paleo, just educate yourself and be good to your body. The non-believers shut up eventually. Especially after I egg their car. :)It makes me think this gap is perhaps a business opportunity.  I imagine there is a good camp/hike crossover with keto already.First picture you look like you're going to tell me about your truck.  The second picture looks like you can give me directions to the pilates class.   Just kidding around though OP.  Good job on your hard work!You just made me think of beef jerky dipped in ghee.  This idea needs testing.

Of course I can fast, probably a while.  I'd rather not bank on it.  The most I've fasted is a day, so I'm going to try to avoid it during a stressful situation until I get more time and observations on my performance while fasting.Oh wow. I so feel you about useless advice from Doctors. I remember one in particular telling me that it would be 'next to impossible' for me to lose weight, and that I should just learn to live with it. Uh, no thanks.

That sounds like a pretty decent clinic! Covers all the bases. I should see if there's a Canadian equivalent.

And damn. I think you're right. I've had the USDA recommendations given to me by doctors a number of times...it's only recently that I realized and accepted that it's wrong. It angers me to watch my friends eating the low fat diet food that's been marketed to them...I also bought into the low fat thing, for years! It's just such a shame.How much are you paying for a can? It's pretty expensive I think around 4 or 5$. I did :) But to me it still reads like normal is the style of eating that led you to be overweight in the first place. Maybe it's just me, oh well!I think you can get it with the Kindle app... but I have one...soo.. not really sure. this is SO COOL! I hadn't even though to check on my kindle, and here are a bunch of Keto cookbooks that are free in my kindle unlimited subscription. thanks for posting!I think I will make some as soon as my kitchen is in. Thank you! Married guy living with a wife. Fuck making up our bed.

Nice work!40/70/118It averages out to around 30g/day which is still below my macros of 40g carbs/dayI've been looking into this too.  I wish there was a company that made keto-friendly bug-out and survival food storage buckets and such.  Aside from buying the handful of dried meat and low-carb veggie bulk items individually I haven't found any good options.The first rule of keto is you do not talk about keto. The second rule of keto is you do not talk about keto.If you read the sentence directly after the one you quoted, you'll see that's exactly what I meant. Wow I disagree so much.

&gt; you can't really ever go back to eating normal if you want to stay healthy the rest of your life.

If it's making you unhealthy, it's not "normal". But you probably just meant that as in going back to eating "like you did before". Which was clearly abnormal.Start hunting your meat. Keep trophies and pictures around. Describe in great detail how you harvested the game to said vegan. I decided today I needed to make a change in my diet. After I stopped eating dairy (Im severely lactose intolerant) my sugar consumption spiraled out of control. I work or go to school 7 days a week, so any quick/cheap recipes that aren't 'load yourself with cheese' would be appreciated, as well as any tips for someone who's not great at tracking things food related to stay on top of eating well. Thanks in advance for any support!is oxtail used exclusively for soup and broth? how else is it eaten?'splain this to me, please. I get that it takes several weeks for my body to learn to use fat as my energy source. That's adaptation, right? When my body doesn't have to think about using fat for energy, it knows to do so, I'm adapted.

What's induction? Is that the transition time it takes to become keto adapted?Ohhh that's great to hear. Congratulations! I expect I'll still get the odd breakout too...but that's so much easier to handle than constantly dealing with it. Glad to hear it works so well for you!Parmesan garlic my favorite

Dipped in ranchI always get refrigerated chicken sausages, 5lb bag of shredded cheddar,  brussel sprouts and broccoli florets. They also have a quart of heavy whipping cream for under $5 (non-organic) which is a great value in Milwaukee. Also the Italian beef meatballs in the frozen section are pretty good,  as are the individual serving packages of edamame!I hope I can be as successful as you.
Everything in your story (except your amazing progress) could be me.

I hate my wedding photos. I was 176 two years ago (a year after my wedding) but here I am back over 200 again.You might at first! I know I went pretty haywire for the first 6 months, and then gradually started to settle down. Thank you so much :D I hope you find the results you're after, too!!LOL Love this. =) I'm going to request it for my birthday!!Many ketoers use peanut oil if they don't have a fryer that can use solid fats.Stop discussing it There is definite difference..your efforts are working:)Nice work!Same here. I do struggle to meat my daily protein goal (pun intended). I considered adding a scoop of protein powder to my BPC but forgot to pack it with my lunch today. I'm going to give that a try tomorrow morning for "breakfast"! Hopefully it won't be totally disgusting ...

I was seriously addicted to flavored coffee creamer and was really unhappy about having to give it up. (Really though, who would tell themselves that they can't try keto because it means giving up chemical creamer for their coffee ... besides me??) Thank the fuckin' gods for BPC and sugar-free hazelnut syrup. I used to drink four or five cups of coffee a day, now I only have one. I never ever thought I'd see the day where one cup of coffee was all I needed to function. In hindsight, coffee with creamer was just another way to feed my carb addiction.I caught the typo but it was too good to correct.I switched to zero carb start of February.  No deliberate carbs.  Just animal products no veggies.  It's been excellent.  coconut oilWhole foods had crap for snack sticks. Just turkey.

If you are searching online for retailers near you, try pork cracklings or chicarrones as alternative searches.i have not had any luck finding any, after i seen this post i looked for 2 hoursI allow myself 1 indulgence day a month with no less than 3 weeks between. It seems to work great for me, I like to plan them around large events that I would otherwise not be able to partake in fully.

Granted, I also only drink once a month, and it must be on my indulgence day, so I make sure it's really special, something like Valentine's day (got in some wine and chocolate), New Year's, or my birthday. My next one's in 5 weeks, and I think I'll have a donut and a Guinness...Yeah.. that can take some doing. I'm picky about.. most foods :)
and it sucks to buy something and then decide that you don't particularly like it. "hakarb"? More like "hikarb".Awesome progress! String cheese, Hormel Pepperoni Stix, pork rinds.  And pork rinds are cheap :)how do you know when overtraining is becoming an issue?I'm a slot attendant at a casino. It's just ten hours of nonstop walking unless I'm stopped helping a guest, over a large amount of casino. It's true that it's *technically* better, but it's almost meaningless because beef simply isn't a significant source of those fats - we're talking piddlegrams of the stuff.

There's tons more stuff floating in the thread which that's an excerpt of.At least in my understanding, all "Lazy Keto" means is counting carbs, but not counting anything else. In my case, I just keep below 20g per day. I also only eat once (big meal though) per day and fast every third day.

I don't track the rest of my macros though.Me neith.  But, it can't hurt to try . Also, I love keto, so still a win.

Sorry I'm an idiot.You look like you could be your own son!KEEP THE SOLID WORK UP YOU GLORIOUS BASTARDThat stuff is freakin' amazing. I didn't care for the honey variety (way too sweet), but the hickory is great.I haven't been that great in terms of adherence. That's why when talking anything about experience I usually say when I originally started rather than "how long" I've been keto. It's probably not really not too much above 50% at this point.

And honestly, my first year and a half I was probably something like 95% adherence. I had one or two cheat days in that time. I got down to my lowest weight since HS easily. When I got my new office job is when things started going way downhill. For the past year or so, I'd guess, I've been constantly waffling between high and low carb. Enough that I gained the 90lbs I lost back and then some.

Keto is really the only way of eating for me, but it's also not a magic bullet. I realize the reason that my adherence isn't great has more to do with my environment and my tendency to want to eat out of boredom.Stellar progress, but you'd have gotten an upvote just for "makes me want to punch necks" - I *LIVE* for Throat Punch Thursdays. (some of my coworkers...smh)...

Congrats on your new life!I do "lazy keto" in which I don't eat carbs except for veggies (no fancy substitutes since I wouldn't know how many carbs I was eating), plus a lot of meat, cheese, butter, sour cream, etc.  I also supplement with fish oil or omega 3 pills.

Have been on it since August 7, 2014 with 5 cheat days, all of which were for special events in which I made a conscious decision in advance that I was going to cheat on a particular meal (i.e. Michelin star restaurant, Thanksgiving dinner) and I did not cheat for the rest of the day before or after.  So...at least 97%.  Lost 36lbs in those 6.5 months after having already dropped 25lbs on a looser low carb diet (read: no glycogen weight left--it's all the real deal).

It is a way of life for me.  I would find it much harder to turn it on and off without a significant reason.  The more carbs are just something I don't eat, the easier it is to keep saying no.  When I was doing just low carb, not keto, I stalled because I didn't have such bright lines, and so I kept eating more carbs than I realized.I've never heard of keto being used to manage Raynaud's but you never know, it might help That's incredible, goal weight and maintaining in 8.5 months. You offer great advice to this sub, you're pretty much a lifer already :) Cows are supposed to eat grass not corn, the fatty acid composition of grass-fed meat is different than that of grain-fed meat.  I wholeheartedly believe in eating animals raised on food that they are intended to eat so eat primarily grass fed meat.

However, it might help if you actually linked the study you're quoting from rather than quoting it completely out of context. We have all had days like that! For me, it helps to know in about 30 minutes of getting home I can have a bleeding steak with buttered spinach and sour cream...that is my Pad Thai killer.As you should be! 198 and 170 as of this morningDo you have a specific goal weight or size in mind?

I do not see Raynauds on that list.Honestly, I don't really know... when I was a kid I had it on bread... but obvious problem.

I know there are low carb breads but I haven't tried any of the ready made ones. I have made [peanut butter bread](http://247lowcarbdiner.blogspot.com/2011/03/mr-peanut-sandwich-bread.html) (didn't really like it) and [microwave coconut bread](http://healthyrecipesblogs.com/2014/04/17/low-carb-microwave-bread/) (I think this one was better but tastes like a biscuit) but neither of them are truly bread like.

Perhaps a low carb tortilla? I've found [one](https://www.google.com/search?q=low+carb+tortillas&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS626US626&amp;es_sm=93&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=RJ41uACDSyA7hM%253A%253B1nUrREI6Qp_8lM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.latortillafactory.com%25252Fview%25252Fproducts%25252Flow-carb-high-fiber-tortillas%25252F&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=RJ41uACDSyA7hM%253A%252C1nUrREI6Qp_8lM%252C_&amp;usg=__oInxAbDydrBnZAa3AEyeb3nZc7A%3D&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;ved=0CGIQyjc&amp;ei=EuLnVP3SCYnjoAT1mIKoDw#imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=RJ41uACDSyA7hM%253A%3B1nUrREI6Qp_8lM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.latortillafactory.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F11%252Flow-carb-large.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.latortillafactory.com%252Fview%252Fproducts%252Flow-carb-high-fiber-tortillas%252F%3B1130%3B500) that is a 6 inch tortilla with 3 net carbs but it's better toasted than not.I'm very strict. Only one meal where I had a keto dessert bit it ear my birthday still less than 50 carbs. Good tip! Thank you!I believe that the general fogginess and light headedness is related to sodium, not potassium.  Potassium is more involved in muscle cramping and spasms and overdosing can affect your heart, so that is why potassium supplements are lower dosage.  Make sure you know what you are doing.Congratulations! I started on Tuesday and I'm absolutely loving it so far!

KCKO!I also had a dream I was tied up and being force fed Spoonfuls of rice. I woke up in a legitimate panic.SPAM.

It honestly doesn't taste bad concerning it's stigma. It tastes like a mix of corned beef and ham. The macros are perfect as well.

I usually dice them up into cubes and fry them with olive oil. Cook up a few eggs and you have an awesome quick breakfast.

P.S. They also have SPAM with bacon. I'm about 80 miles from Chicago. We have about a dozen places on GrubHub. The restaurant scene here is lacking in general. Some of the places on ours actually deliver themselves too. So I usually just cut out the middle man in the situation. Interesting. Mine just disappeared. I've read about other positive changes too on this site. It surely matters what exactly one is eating... I typically eat vegetables, eggs, nuts and fat. In the last week I ate some meat too but nothing happened.What's the before/after weights?In just 2 monthes you lost a towel, I joke, you look fantastic.True. But my emergency/motorbike tour food is much yummier if I use ghee instead of coconut oil. I like the subtle taste of coconut oil but ghee is just better in some cases (typically when I make desserts and ghee+walnut is dessert for me. I usually add fruit into it, sweetener doesn't needed).Flu can be avoided by keeping your electrolytes in balance.

Drink TONS of water and look into supplementing with potassium and magnesium, along from getting those from your foods.I've been doing keto for 28 months and I have graphed my weight loss, and there were 5 different slopes during that time.

Strict

Plateau

Lazy

Strict

Plateau

Strict - Now

Over the last year, I've averaged two higher calorie days a week and one really bad day a month and have had a regain of 11 pounds (Halloween-Thanksgiving.)Interesting. I live in Chicago, and 90-ish places will deliver to me. My parents live about 20 miles south of the city center in the suburbs, and GrubHub has 2 pizza places for them and nothing else. That's not CKD, that's just having a cheat day.  They are quite different.  Oh god out of all things I miss the most it's gotta be Thai food. Pad Thai, pad kee now, pad see ew, fried rice. Fuck I'm so sad. Oh well, KCKO.Maybe I'm not doing CKD properly -- here is what I do. I eat keto 5 days a week, strict. On friday afternoons and saturdays I have whatever I want. Sunday I fast, and sometimes do some yoga or even a light jog.Yeah that's my LDL :/

Edit: after researching, I determined that, in some people, saturated fat can drive LDL quite a bit (for some reason.) So, everyone out there doing keto should probably, if saturated fat is a staple, go get their cholesterol nmbers checked. For me: I'm going to switch to more poly and mono unsaturated fats, and then retest in a couple of months. oxtail, about 4lbs per pack and rather meaty; also KerryGold butterHELL yes. And now the few days of discomfort isn't even that bad.

Though I did learn not to go to bed too early.'Zactly.

My main regret is that they wouldn't record the video to disc for me to take home.

I was thinking about awesome things to pop into the DVD player when guests had overstayed their welcome.http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v67/n8/full/ejcn2013116a.htmlok I need more info on how I can get my two cats on a ketogenic diet.  Right now they have a chicken and rice based cat food and your making me worried I am slowly killing them
[only the best](http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-10-NUP_151507_0827.jpg)Followup: ALL WAS CLEAR.

But yeah - I'm starting the routine checkups a decade earlier than most and every 5 years instead of every 10 because my dad had to have a section of his colon entirely removed.

I was being wheeled down the hall and quipped to the orderly how I blamed my dad for my being in this situation, and he said (quite correctly) that I should be thanking him because now I won't need to end up having a big chunk of my guts chopped out later on.

A very, VERY useful perspective.I just had the same thing about 20 mins ago. I was reading comments on slashdot, and quite a few times I read about people losing weight with induction. I didn't know what that term meant weight loss wise, so discovered it was atkins. Read up on atkins diet a bit and since everything else has failed, figured eh give it a shot. Did atkins 2 weeks and I was no longer hungry at all, and losing weight.

Couldn't believe it. Then I found the more general keto diet and decided to switch to that insteadYeah, I have a feeling a lot of the people who have stellar results are those who weren't doing anything before, and had a lot to lose. Which, for them, is awesome, because it is getting results, but I'm in a different place. It's not a major city at all. Approximately 100,000 people. 11 years, life has continued to happen the entire time, keto all the way through :)

Feel better, oral surgery is a bummer, darn chipmunk cheeks :)Good idea. I like to make them at home with a fried egg. Yeah, planning is key to a lot of things, including keto. I will fall off the keto wagon quickly without a lot of options. I always have sausages, eggs/chorizo/sausages/diced bacon with low-carb tortillas, meat balls, taco meat, diced chicken, romaine and salmon ready.

I go with IF, so I usually have two meals at home a day, which basically means I cook at least one or two dishes a day, to keep it replenished. Romaine is easy, neither meatballs, sausages, chicken or salmon are time consuming. The breakfast burrito makings are usually one of my meals, and that does take a lot of prep. Hard? No.

Also, having multiple meals available means you have built-in variety, and an impetus to stay on plan.

Part of any lifestyle change is building habits. Planning meals needs to be one of those habits. Cooking is a weakness for me, I'm not great at it and so I actively work to eliminate that as my weakness - by planning.&gt;I am extremely careful about my macros and stay at or below them everyday and I have never had a cheat day.

What are your target macros?The longer you're on keto the easier you transition back and forth. In general maximum keto-adaptation occurs in 8-12 weeks after which time  week off doesn't really affect keto-adaptation.  At 6 weeks, many of the changes of keto-adaptation are occurring so going off keto for a week could affect you but it's impossible to know how much. Yes, I'm taking fiber out to get net carbs.  Believe me, I spent a lot of time researching, including using this sub, before and during my Keto time.

High-fat diets work for some people.  I grew up on one  and was quite fit. It was also high carb. But I was very active, too.

It seems like yes, I might be crazy for thinking I should do Keto as a short-term strategy, based on most of the responses here. That's okay; at least now I have those opinions to take into account. Same here. No cheats since day 1...including today, and I had oral surgery this morning.He does appear to be taller than the door frame behind him. .. o.oOk..., do the math.

I've been keto since around 2001....

I  probably "break" keto once for a meal every 2 months or so, so about 6 days from 365.

So, I'm on keto for around 98.36% of the time each year. :P1,000 mg isn't too bad. However, I see that active folk in ketosis usually need a bit more than 1,000 mg a day. So, personally I am thinking I will as well. I have the generally fogginess and have had a little light headedness here and there. It may already be a deficiency (or just
keto-flu
 while in the inductions tage)Holy Crap.Good to hear that! I know what you're feeling though, and if you can focus it into some sort of positive change on your life, then it helps a lot.Read this article and started googling and reading. It all made sense I dived right in. So glad. Really, so glad.

I'd be careful in supplementing potassium.

How do I replenish electrolytes?

Even if you go out of your way to eat lots of table salt and foods containing potassium and magnesium, you may find you need to take supplements. The minimum daily intake for the three electrolytes is given by Lyle McDonald as:

5000 mg of sodium (salt)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride)

1000 mg of potassium, in the form of potassium chloride or potassium sulfate

300 mg of magnesium

==========================================

awesome! just downloaded it. can't wait to read.Isn't that awesome?!  Heading out for yet another new pair of jeans this weekend myself. Keep it up!oh shit me too, always have to sprinkle garlic powder on my scrambled eggs and stuff. :(I think coconut and mct oil has a fairly long shelf life. Similar to your ghee idea. You could add it to almost anything.Sounds just right.  That was my 8/1/2013 restart keto position.  Your BMR might be about 1830 calories, so this is a good aggressive, but achievable deficit.  I didn't track back then and just dropped 25 pounds in six months, so you should do better than that if you track and stay on course.Hi, like the others I suspect your total grams of carbs might be too high.


How much do you weigh?

Do you test bg regularly?


wow!!! What a change.
yup same here man. I tried just pure calorie counting and was miserable because always hungry. Well, I havent had a lot of activity so I imagine I'll need more soon enough. I've just done light shoulder physical therapy. Once I'  more active again I couldn't imagine my levels being ok.

So thank you for the tip!What do you do for work that has you walking so many steps? I feel like I'm rarely sitting and I barely break 6k for a work day.Many have been doing this for years and never checked ketone levels. I never started and never stopped. If you follow your macros you're in ketosis. So are you on keto consistently except for a week or so here or there or cheat every Friday or Saturday? It's not clear.  Also what's your CKD approach? Are you following the CKD protocol or the "cheat" CKD approach?I don't really cheat because it makes me feel like shit.  Also I hate the idea of becoming a fat fuck again.

It's not for everyone and that's ok.  For the most part it's just a calorie reduction like anything else, with a few added benefits.Goddamn...unfortunately no joints like this around where I live. But I think I'm gonna try cooking me a bun-less burger over the weekend.Aaaa-mazing!

Throwing in a week of maintenance every once in a while, especially when overtraining starts becoming an issue has helped me break weight loss and strength plateaus, as well as keeping hunger in check long term. I completely recommend!AgreeAlso, thanks for putting it that way. It really makes senseOh my goodness that is basically the worst news ever, I've been sprinkling onion flakes on everything with reckless abandon *gulpNice job. Either you are really tall or the gal in the pic is really small.Unbelievable.Yes, some muscular guys just shrink all around so it is harder to see progress.  You have probably lost weight in your feet, ankles, and calves, which is great for your heart, but doesn't show up much on the pictures.  The "paper towel roll" effect will be there eventually when more inches drop from your waist per pound lost. KCKO.Wings!

Wingstop uses soybean oil (aka vegetable oil). Buffalo Wild Wings sells many different rubs and sauces. I'd fry up some wings and toss or rub in a Buffalo Wild Wings seasoning. I personally love the chipotle bbqYeah, I am... Lol I somehow feel like the reading will be off if I use different fingers. Silly superstitions.tuna pouchesI would think that eating keto only M-F would be difficult because you still have the food sitting around. I've been on keto for about 11 months, 2 days not keto for special events. Aside from that I probably get booted out once a month from a mistake. This has been fairly consistent. I wouldn't schedule days off because they would probably just be added to any mistakes.U/maltastic is right. Ranch *usually* isn't too bad, about 1 carb per tablespoon (that can add up though!). But that's regular ranch, low-fat or fat free ranch dressing are much higher; 6-12 carbs per 2 tablespoon servings. Hit some squats instead of cardio :DNope, that's pretty tall, are you sure it's only 20 pounds? Looks like you lost about 2-4 inches off of your waist, which would suggest a bit more, but either way, great job! You should add your info to your flair, helps make more sense of your progress for you and for us.Huh. I've always had this problem where I get super faint with blurry vision and dizziness for about 20 minutes, without actually passing out. Here's hoping this changes for me too next time I need blood taken? Ketostix dont tell you ketone level. Just wasted ketones which ultimately says nothing. I've never monitored ketones in anyway. I'm at, or under, 20 carbs net a day and my brain is functioning, ergo ketosis. No real need to test.

I advocate not using ketostix. Save your money. I love that feeling, except new dress pants are 100.00For those using mg, I used [this](http://www.onlineconversion.com/cholesterol.htm) as a conversion tool.

Fasting Chol: 285

Tris: 64.65

HDL: 56.8

LDL: 215.4

NON HDL Chol: Couldn't find the conversion for this.

Did you get a typo in here? The LDL is pretty high.
 I tried throwing it off a five foot high porch onto a stone walkway as well, didn't work. looking at your diet, It seems you may be getting a lot of carbs from "low carb" products.  If you can keep it to non-processed items like meats, eggs, cheese and greens most of the time it may work better.Congrats! I'd say you earned yourself some bacon.Ohhhhhhhhh. You do indeed. Yup, and free is always good. Its not a drink, but a 6 oz pouch of tuna will get you through the day with 0 carbs and a low number of calories.Have you actually kept track of your food intake in grams?  This looks pretty high carb to me.You live and learn. My cat is an extremely affectionate asshole and He's a lot healthier now, no choice but to keep him around after that investment on a free farm kitten.Great job champHaven't worked out at all actually!5'7Where is this? I need this. &gt; which is the opposite of what I heard I'd have to be worried about.


That's pretty typical, power of hormones.

Check out the FAQ at /r/ketogains Step one: install the GrubHub app.

Step two: live in the middle of a major city. It's working for you.Do you measure your ketone levels regularly with ketostix to check if you're in ketosis? I'm just wondering if someone who has been doing this long term still checked their ketone levels or if they eventually stopped once they got rollingWhen I say I've been doing keto x time I mean 100% of the timeIn my experience you gain more weight than you lose after going keto.

Maybe this doesn't happen to everyone, but it happens to me.   I think your naturally greedy body kicks into overdrive.

Unfortunately, if everyone ate keto beef would be like $20 a lb.  The majority of people need to eat corn or corn based products in order to supply food for everyone.  The US govt. stated this week that people should strive for a plant based (Corn) diet.10/10 would cuddle.Nothing to be sorry for. Educating yourself is Just the best tool for success. That's just part 1.  Two more parts if you go to my channel.  Same height and SW as me, I hope to look this good in time! You rock!Keto is a binary state. You're either in it or you're not. I wouldn't say I was doing keto if I was eating so many carbs that I wasn't in ketosis. Mehh.. it's not the worst. But avoid anything "low fat." Is there a website or menu online? Also you can call and see if they have nutritional information there.I read about it somewhere around 2000 and starting reading the low carb newsgroup on usenet.  The term "Keto" wasn't used much then, but a lot of people were staying in the induction phase of atkins.

I went keto for a couple of years, and lost some weight.  At the time I wasnt really that fat to begin with but I enjoyed the lack of hunger.

I got out of it, and gained some weight.  I got a job sitting on my ass and quit smoking and before I knew it I was getting fat as fuck.

I've been keto again for a couple of years and it just works for me.  I lost the weight, and I dont spend a lot of time thinking about food .  It's just an easy lifestyle for me.  I can get fancy or just exist on havarti and deviled ham if I want.   It may just be my genetic makeup but keto just feels right for me.

Also, keto sort of kills a lot of anxiety for me.  No idea of the science.Sorry! New to Reddit too hahaha. Thank you!Yay! I'm a phlebotomist and I loooooove it when people come in hydrated! It really makes all the difference when trying to find a vein:)But they tell you to avoid red meat :(Read the faq and other useful links on the sidebar. Come back with any specific questions you might have. That makes so much sense. I guess I'm just having a hard time completely cutting things out. I may need to do a reevaluation to make sure this works for me. Thanks for your words! Lol I bought one and ended up throwing it against concrete to smash it. Thanks man I appreciate all the info. I'll have a cheeseburger on usTwo weeks ago, I ate a whole little caesar's hot and ready, stayed with Keto rest of the week, weight still down from before then, still producing ketones. Pizza was worth the half a day of progress I lost.

Remember, it's not just about losing weight, it's about changing your life and your body over time. If anyone here thinks they will never have carbs again, they are being unrealistic and may not understand how it works.

It's better that you indulge in rice, pasta, bread, etc when you need to keep spirits high so that you can maintain the bizarre diet we all enjoy (but seriously stay away from soda, it's actually the devil).Happy birthday!! I was looking around for effective diets and saw keto. Then I saw the Australian Broadcasting Company's program Catalyst which had an episode about the keto diet, which the next day is when I decided to start. Now down 16 kg since November.I think if you try to "do" Keto less than 100% of the time, it pretty much guarantees results like yours. Initial weight loss, and as bad habits returns - re-gaining of the weight initially lost.

To make any diet a success, you really need to look at is a "lifestyle change" as cliche as that sounds. When you reach a goal weight, it might be time to re-evaluate, but you can't really ever go back to eating normal if you want to stay healthy the rest of your life. You can't return to whatever habits/style of eating has led you to be overweight in the first place. I love the Pepper Jack ones!Usually when I cook keto foods for my family, my mom will complain how fattening it is :PWow, amazing progress!

I fell off the wagon about 2 months ago when I got fired and pretty much just sat around eating all the comfort food. I stuffed my face all day long because of how sad and depressed I was. Needless to say I gained it all back and then some. :(

I only got back into keto this week and your progress is sooo inspiring and motivating because my before and after and body shape look somewhat similar to yours, just less impressive

Would you mind sharing your stats/measurements and your average diet/exercise?  :DGood on ya man! Incredible!Get thee behind me, Satan!All I saw him do is husk it. I bought one once and I took bricks and a hammer and could not open it. I finally gave up and threw it in the trash.1. It's up to you but I would unlink them and see how it goes as sedentary still accounts for some walking or you can do the opposite and see how it goes whichever you prefer

2.  I use a different program so hopefully someone else can chime inIt might also just be produced in a non-gluten-free facility, so there's a cross-contamination risk they are reminded to warn people about.To set the record straight, if you look closely, you can see my wife's hair in the first picture as well. She was with me before my weight loss and supported me no matter what, heavy or thin. She is my rock and without her support, I wouldn't have accomplished this.Mix it up. Ouch! That's quite a price tag! You look awesome!! I notice it in your arms/wrists too! I'm short as well (4'11) so I understand how difficult it is to lose and how differently the weight comes off. YUM! I wonder if the non keto folks at my house would notice that it is not Keto? I'm making it this weekend. screw them! :)Are rnach dressings typically low carb?Maybe check out /r/bodyweightfitness if thats your next goal.  Good work !Wings i do,so I make them use a butterfly needle,then I'm ok.Choosing foods that in general keep you in keto without weighing and measuring ... so, eat meat, oil, keto-friendly dairy, low carb/high fiber veggies, berries over other fruit, etc.
Can keep you in ketosis, and if you're starting out fairly overweight you can probably even lose some weight eating to satiety. But most people have to start counting eventually.The peanut butter is sooo good.

I haven't tried another one yet because I like it so muchCavemanketo uses lard. You want to use something that won't oxidize at high temperatures. However, to use lard you'll need the right fryer, because not all fryers work well with fat that is solid when at room temperature.

Read this for details:

http://cavemanketo.com/deep-fried-keto/I would cut out the low carb products - low carb high fiber jelly, sesame cracker, tortilla A1C went from 4.6 to 5.6 in six months of keto.
Meals:

Breakfast

eggs or greek yogurt with a few berries or Pb&amp;j(low carb high fiber jelly) on a sesame cracker or tortilla

Lunch

Salad with veggies and egg
or a sandwich with lunchmeat, veggies, low carb tortilla, and mayo or ranch

Dinner

some combination of meat(usually tuna, turkey, tofu, or chicken) and veggies sometimes with shirataki noodles
or white tortilla pizza with cheese and mini pepperoni sometimes

I always snack on nuts, cheese sticks, grapefruit, low carb sesame crackers with cream cheese, or more veggies and I always have a green tea latte with heavy cream for more fat.  A few times a week I will have 2 squares of dark chocolate.  Also, I always have trouble reaching my calories for the day if you have any advice.
That's a possible explanation as I've run out of other possibilities. If you're in the US potassium supplements are limited to 99 mg so yup it's only 99 mg of potassium. In general supplements are not useful for potassium needs and if you feel fine there is really no reason to take them. Eat food if you want more potassium - avocado, mushroom, spinach, fish, yogurt - or lite salt or no salt How tall are you? 20 pounds must be a significant portion of your overall weight. Good job!I just wanted to clarify for other people reading: the 'slow carb' diet from 4 Hour Body would not really be compatible with keto, due to A. legumes/lentils B. the weekly cheat day C. nightly red wine D. rec of no dairy which many ketoers have success with E. rec of no artificial sweeteners which many ketoers have success with

In short, modding it for keto compatibility renders any special nomenclature moot
Awesome job!Eat the pizza or don't, no reason to feel guilty, you'll burn through the carbs (unless you add more) by the end of the day and be back to keto.The recipe I ripped off of this subreddit is:

Either a .6 oz box of sugar free jello , or two .3 oz boxes

4 packets of Knox gelatin

1/2 cup of water

Mix these ingredients
Heat until melted
Pour into molds
Fridge/freezer till solid

You can do 5 packets of gelatin but they end up pretty tough to me.  I'll probably try my next batch with only 3 envelopes of Knox; I prefer a pretty soft gummy.
For the BBQ sauce, i used this: http://www.ruled.me/spicy-tangy-bbq-sauce/"I live my life 20 carbs at a time."

Old OP was [Will Sasso.](http://imgur.com/czKZGfX)I never knew, never cared, and never paid attention. My last cat lived nice and healthy 18 years old but my current cat had kidney crystals at 4 years. Cost 2k worth of vet bills and now he gets to eat way better than before.how do you find a burger joint that delivers??If you can afford it, you could make a sandwich with low carb bread from a site like www.thinslimfoods.com.

I had a BLT today.. delicious!

Ok. I had always heard that range. I stick to just over 1. Insulin resistance.  I've been on the same metformin dose for 8 years.  My A1C is still in the normal range, but it is increasing which worries me.  lol, somebody evidently has poor self-esteem...  Congratulations on the weight loss, you look great!I did Atkins long ago...and looking back, it was a bastardized lazy version of it.  My BF and I just kept it super low carb---actually staying under 20 or 30/day rather than going up the Atkins ladder.   It worked, despite not tracking protein, electrolytes, fat intake, etc.  Foolishly, we went off diet for a planned vacay to Mexico and never went back on.  I knew if I ever tried to diet again, it would be low carb.

It's a much easier diet now.  So much info on the net and so many more low carb items for sale.  Dining out is much easier since restaurants are used to dealing with low carb or paleo preferences.  Having programs like MFP and forums like this make it such a more enjoyable process!Those would be 3g net carbs a serving, and that calculation already includes the sugars in it.

As long as your nets are in the correct range you should be fine.I also had a dream (nightmare) last night that I kept eating carbs.  I was so relieved when I woke up.Congratulations man, keep up the good work!I do my own workout planning, I've done a lot of reading of the ACE &amp; NASM pt courses and use that info.  Mainly bodybuilding style with some powerlifting training mixed in.  BB style 8-12 reps, once a month do powerlifting 5x5 for a weekMaybe a broken scale?:D Yeah,I've noticed that about cat food...Not a good thing. I was in the military myself as well, I struggled with weight even with daily PT, although after airborne school and a deployment to Iraq I was fit and down to around 175.  After I got out I continued to eat the same and ballooned up to 250ish and felt awful about myself since I've struggled with weight my whole life (very top weight in college was ~330)

About a year ago I began to pay attention to what I was eating and cutting back on all the crap that had made me go back up to around the 250 mark.  About a month ago I stumbled on this keto subreddit and did a lot of reading and decided I would take the plunge.

Since then, it's been a challenge to stick to it, especially because of my hectic schedule, but I've stuck with it and carved out an hour every evening after work to hit the gym.  I already feel a lot better about myself, and even though I can't really see the difference I was able to move up one notch on the ol' belt last week, so that's something to keep me motivated to stick to it.I do count the amount I eat. I said 'handful' to signify that I wasn't eating the full 39 that would include 2g, more like 1.5g or 1g. Thank you so much for the reply - definitely reassuring.

For what it's worth, these are the ones I have been eating:

 http://www.planters.com/varieties/nutrition-information.aspx?Site=1&amp;Product=2900007325

What kind of oil?
what program have you been using?You know fibre doesn't count towards the 20 right? American/Canadian nutrition labels generally list total carbs with the subcategories sugar and fibre, so fibre may be subtracted from total carbs to get "net carbs". However, if you live in Europe, it's likely nutrition labels already have fibre in it's own category (not included in the carb count) unless it specifically states "of which fibre" under the carb count.

You need to do a little research if you're not convinced high fat can be healthy. Check out /r/ketoscience and search for "cholesterol" both there and on this sub. Watch [Fat Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcNPfZlrZs). You need not fear fat, even saturated fat, or dietary cholesterol.

Anyway, I'm not saying ketosis is the only way to go, but I don't think the current recommendations for starch, grains and fruit are necessary, and may even be harmful (the latter varies person to person and depends on activity level).

There is nothing in starch that you need. Nothing you get from grains and fruit that you can't get from meat and non-starchy vegetables (or even just meat if you eat offal). If you're not sticking to ketosis, 100-150g carbs (which is still low compared to "normal") is more than enough to eat plenty of veggies (maybe even a little bit of starchy ones) and a few servings of fruit.Congratulations! Keep up the good work, it's great to see and feel the change as the pounds come offThat's an excellent way to frame that!

[Commenting so I come back to this]Dayamn!Count net carbs. Try to avoid added sugar but there is natural sugar in foods like vegetables, dairy and nuts and no reason to exclude them for that reason.

However, I would weigh the nuts and not just eat a 'handful' as nuts are notorious for eating more carbs and calories than you think

You haven't ruined anything, KCKO


You won't find peanuts without sugar. Congratulations on your weight loss!I would use a food scale, and not estimate or guess. So when you lose 70 Ibs you also gain a girl?With more weight to lose you can sustain a higher deficit.  How much weight have you lost in 6 weeks (excluding water weight)? What are your full stats? 9/10.  Would smile at.All in time my friends! Ups and downs are something I definitely went through for sure!I use Nescafe Azera Americano from Tesco, it works just great and is fast to make.

http://www.nescafe.com/product_details_en_co_uk.axcms?Id=561Ooooo awesome!Excellent suggestion! Thanks!haha wow I hadn't noticed that! Although I think I'm always going to have baby-sized hands.This subreddit was mentioned a few days ago in a post of some guy injecting fat into a steak. I looked into it and it sounded right up my alley. Yeah I usually round up the numbers because I never believe them, but this time it really seemed unbelievable! Will definitely be coutning MUCH more rigorously as of tomorrow! Today came out ok tho, 10g carbs and at just under 1400 calories.Great job you look beautiful!Trader Joe's makes some vanilla-flavored stuff (that tastes not at all like vanilla) that only has 1g of carbs per 2 scoops/25g of protein.Woah there! I had like 10g of butter and 1 tbsp of cream in my coffee, the 2 pieces of fatty chicken with oil could definitely be 350 or even more, but the salad had just a few sliced squares of avocado and the dressing contained (altogether! it was shared) 1 tbsp of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. The broccoli soup had a lot of fats since it was made from boiling a ton of chicken pieces.Thanks again! Yes, that's what I thought! However, today I came up short again, at 10g carbs, 62g protein and 104g fat :/  Not really sure how to "fix" this because I'm also trying to eat low calorie! I am definitely drinking more though!Same thing about fruits, a sugar is a sugar is a sugar. Fructose is even the worst of the bunch.What a difference! Even your hands look smaller, congratsI'm in my first week and I'm really liking it. With the exception of missing my sweets, I find this to be a very sustainable diet.

The surprising issue I'm having, aside from the standard Keto Flu and some constipation, I'm never hungry and usually have to force myself to eat, which is the opposite of what I heard I'd have to be worried about.

Today was my first try at working out since I started (and the first time I worked out in a while) and I feel this weird mixture of feeling a lot better and feeling like a bag of pudding.

Overall, very excited and I can't wait to lose weight and start putting on some muscle. I've got to try this! I really prefer my coffee with nothing but coffee in, so I've never had BPC, but I always put cream in my tea. This sounds great!It has a lot to do with two things. In male cats, castration leads to a greatly increased risk of kidney infections and the other part of it is diet, they really aren't eating what they're supposed to be eating. Much like humans, cats are obligate carnivores, needing meat to survive, and especially for cats they do well on fatty meats as we do, dogs seem to do better on higher protein diets and can handle more grains. Cats are unable to digest grains at all, a lot of their foods are chock full of different grain derivitives and "meal" used to create volume in the food.You look amazing! What is your daily routine? Working out? A slow cooker and cheap cuts of meat are your best friend. Nothing. I cook all the time. Is that ok?I get the bacon cheeseburger in the bowl and eat it with a fork.Frozen ones have less carbs for some reason....Wow, 2 months. That's amazing progress in such a short time. Care to describe your routine? Great job!Some people in [the last thread I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2wg0ze/sv_broke_190_i_now_weigh_what_i_did_in_2003_one/) wanted before/after pics, so here they are. I had to go to a public restroom to take them, because I don't have mirrors at home that would work. Not a big fan of mirrors.

I'm not too impressed, to be honest. But whatever, I know I've gotten smaller because my pants keep falling down, and the scale shows a 40 pound difference! 50 pounds, counting the "before" pic.What prevented you from cooking this?im sure that is healthy for you too! hey im losing weight it must be healthy to eat gmo fed hormone steroid  meat!Thanks for that, I can feel I am not at my full potential but I also feel I am getting there. So true!  I love to cook so spending hours doing it is not an issue for me but it's not required to get a satisfying meal on the table. Type 1 or 2? Have adjusted your medications at all?damn whats the joint called on the off chance i live close enough to go get that in my mouth right now&gt; If I get home late a meal is never more than 5-10 minutes away

This is what I do for the majority of my meals. If you can pick a few recipes that you can do easily most of the food you cook for keto shouldn't take long if you have the ingredients on hand. Taco minus the taco is one of my staples. It's easy, there's a level of variety, but it gets old, too. Sometimes it just makes me crave the actual taco, and while I can get low carb pita here (thank gawd), it's not quite the same. But yes, good stuff overall. All the things
http://cavemanketo.com/tag/fry-day/
The science I've seen that I trust is that [moderate drinking can be healthy](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/alcohol/), but the benefits don't significantly outweigh the risks in a way that you should go out of your way to drink if you don't already. A big factor seems to be a social one. Also for keto we've got to stay away from things like beer.This was insanely easy to make! Here's what goes into it:

1/2 a large onion, diced
~2-3 serrano peppers (can be jalapenos, can be chilies, whatever you want. more or less based on how spicy you like it), diced
~3 cloves of garlic (I always add more, personally), minced
1lb hot italian sausage
2 knobs of butter or tbsp of olive oil, separated
1 (10oz) container of frozen spinach, thawed
8oz velveeta cheese (or cheddar, whatever really), cubed
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
1/2 cup cream cheese
nonstick cooking spray

In a pan, melt a tbsp of butter/olive oil and add onions. Cook until they start to get translucent, a few minutes. Add garlic and peppers and cook until fragrant and soft, a few more minutes. Set aside in a bowl. Add the rest of the butter/oil and brown the sausage, breaking it up as you go (if you got the sausage links, make sure to remove the casings first). This meat tastes really good on its own, but you can add a little S&amp;P if you'd like. Once its all browned and broken up, add it to the bowl as well. Add in the spinach and cream cheese. Let this cool a bit, then add the cubes of velveeta cheese and combine them all together thoroughly.

Grease a baking pan with the nonstick cooking spray and pour the mixture in, distributing it evenly. Top with the parmesan cheese, evenly. Bake for ~30-40 minutes at 350 degrees. It will be hot, mushy, and delicious! I ate mine with some sour cream on top. Enjoy!

Studies show that keto has a 7-9 pound advantage over just eating a carb-heavy diet but restricting your calories.

*^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^For ^questions ^or ^comments, ^please ^contact ^/u/slickytail*Not kosher, they're just so much better. I need to find some sausages I like. Atkins' reputation never meant much to me. The bad science behind the USDA's dietary guidelines has been evident for a long time, along with advice against saturated fat, salt, etc. That said, I did ensure that the keto diet was safe before emabarking on it. I'm willing to overlook the vague understanding of how, why, and even whether it's an effective weight-loss diet, but I insisted on verifying its safety. Unfortunately, my carb cravings increased steadily until I quit Atkins. That was over 10 years ago.

Studies show that keto has a 7-9 pound advantage over just eating a carb-heavy diet but restricting your calories. That's significant, but nothing to write home about. I follow the diet to see whether I'm one of the lucky ones who sees a big improvement. I'm pretty pleased with 17 pounds down so far, and what's more, I am not having any carb cravings or difficulty staying on the diet.I think I love you. Thank-you for putting so much effort into your replies... Geez, I don't even know what to say really. I had a YES moment when you talked about cutting up a bunch of veggies ahead of time. I've become the queen of tupperware, and honestly, I think that idea alone could simply kickstart me to be like, 'look at all this food I have... Now what do I do with it?!' because I'll simply have the variety on hand already, plus some quick, easy, and crunchy snacking options. There's so much great info in your post.. Thank-you, thank-you! I'm going to go shopping tomorrow... I'm almost inspired to go now. I really need to learn how to fry up some fish, besides shrimp. I'm nervous with steak, too, but I can do it. If I can throw it in the oven though, or saute, I'm comfortable, but I'm still iffy on doing those two things in particular.

As another person recommended, I think the cheat day is a good idea. I can't go a great length of time outside of keto (or rather, simply cheating to the point of sending myself out of keto) or I am an absolute tornado of intensity. I think giving myself that day is in my best interest. I've always just felt bad for eating anything carby while trying to stay on keto, and the guilt about that isn't helping.

Did I say thank-you? Because *thank-you!*no its not, your mouth is clenched in the first picture, and drooped in the second. Dont kid yourself. They do cause insulin response similar to sugar. Recent studies point to that.I thought I was on 30% at the beginning, but it seems that the fat was all in my gut - and that the rest of me was pretty OK. I did the caliper things and it was pointing to low 20s.

The most accurate would be the DEXA, but who knows?Always good to hear. :D I hate being unemployed. Curbs my ability to buy how I like. Truth!!
But me being a dummy, I thought they were Keto friendly! Some more things I didn't think of - Lettuce wrap tacos are great. You can use a variety of meats or fowl, just make sure to use salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, etc. Then, use the toppings of your choice, be it salsa, cheese (try queso fresco!), mexican sour cream, avocado, chopped tomato, onion, cilantro, and so on and so forth. Again, the customizability gives you variety. You can also use lettuce leaves for burger buns or mini burger buns. I did that just last night. I have Maple Valley sugar-free syrup. Sorbitol does not bother me so I use it sparingly every now and again.The actual results would be helpful

What are your meals like? I had never thought of making a t bar. That is genius. No. You're fatigued not because you're losing strength but because it takes time to adapt to exercise on keto, up to 8-12 weeks. Water and electrolytes especially sodium are critical. MCT oil and caffeine can help. Please read the FAQ at /r/ketogains. lol no single guy living alone f*** making up my bedHe's just going to mess it up the next night. Never got the point of making your bed.I have a supermarket here that sells that brand, I will check it out, thank you. I'm allergic to garlic but will see how the first batch with butter goes.Thank you so much! :)Always good to hear. :D I hate being unemployed. Curbs my ability to buy how I like. Hoooooooly dooly just read your stats hun. Congrats on the epic loss!!! I have 3 days where I have a high deficit (around 50%) and concentrate on getting my minimum protein requirements and 4 days where I have less of a deficit (around 25%) and it works really well for me.

All days are keto based and below 30g carbs and as others have said I actually start to crave food more on my higher calorie days than I do on the low calorie ones One TM that I went to (Chicago) was SUPER organized and very well-run.  The other one (Florida) was a pretty big cluster.  It might depend on the location and also if it's the first TM in your area; the FL one was new to the area, and the Chicago one was veteran...Ok, good. Our main goal here is to give you some more variety while avoiding decision fatigue. You already expend a lot of mental energy in school, and every decision you make outside of that taxes your mental energy further. Also, remember that most people, on a diet or not, eat the same things over and over for 80% of their meals, and throw in variety the other 20%. You aren't especially pleased to be eating keto and think you're missing out, which manifests as "I eat the same things over and over, this sucks!" I'll address this below.

This is what I would recommend. Since you already have the casserole thing on lock, I'll stay away from that. What I want to focus on are quick, fresh meals you can prepare simply.

I recommend you leave some repetition in and swap things out seasonally, or once every few months. This way, you get some variety without running into the aforementioned decision fatigue.

Prep: I'm guessing you have one day where you prepare your casseroles, so I'd roll with that and turn it into a meal prep day. By prep I don't mean cooking, I mean it more like restaurant prep where you chop vegetables, etc beforehand so when it comes time to cook, it's quick and easy.

I have a bunch of cheap little tupperware containers that I put all sorts of pre-cut veggies in. So, I get a rough idea of what I'll eat that week and buy it and cut it up beforehand. It doesn't work with all veggies, but for things like onions, celery, carrots, bell peppers, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, etc, it works fine. You're already chopping a lot of these veggies for casseroles I'd guess, so just maximize efficiency by doing it all at once.

Meals: So, if I were you I'd probably structure my day to contain some form of eggs for breakfast, a casserole or stir fry for lunch for the reasons you've mentioned, and for dinner, an easy cut of fish, chicken, or meat with vegetable based sides. If you want to do a bit more prep, thai curries and various stir fries can mix in variety.

Then, I would structure in cheat days or what Lyle MacDonald calls diet breaks. The difference between this and what you do now is that it will be planned in advance and will be a regular thing so it doesn't stress you out or make you feel like you gave in. So, either eat whatever you're craving one day a week, or take a 10-14 day break every 12 weeks and eat whatever you want, but at maintenance levels. This could significantly lighten your psychological burden if you don't trade off too much in mood disruption.

For breakfast, embrace the omelette. They're extremely quick (5-10 mins max for me), easy, and you can customize them endlessly with different veggies and cheeses. Also, it's a good way to use up stuff you only have a little of. The other day I made an omelette with a little green onion in the egg, a couple pieces of leftover smoked salmon, and a little knob of comte cheese. Took me 5 minutes. Incidentally, you can also do them for dinner with a side salad w/ a simple vinaigrette, which is very French.

On cheat days, have some french toast, or Gordon Ramsay's scrambeled eggs on toast (seriously, try it).

What I do for dinner is to just pan sear a cut of meat, chicken, or fish that I've dry brined beforehand (salt on both sides an hour or so before), and then I add in a side salad and/or veggie side. The nice thing here is that it's modular, so it's easy to switch up your meals.

So, for example, I might sear a cut of outside skirt that I've dry brined, and serve it with some kale that I've blanched and sauteed in butter with salt and pepper, and use a chimichurri as a garnish. I can put that on the table in 15 minutes as long as I put the salt on the meat that morning - your milage may vary. Another favorite of mine is to cut cauliflower florets into flat pieces and sautee them in olive oil with salt and pepper at a moderate heat to soften them and put a nice brown crust on. It will look like something from a food magazine and is very satisfying. You could pair that with a salmon filet you seared in another pan (skin side down!) and a side salad. The variations are endless, but if I keep going this post will get unreasonable. But having the prep work done makes these things doable in about 15-20 minutes. Not too shabby.

I have just started planning out low carb stir fries, so if I have something good, I will pass it along.

PS If you want to learn how to put a proper sear on meat or fish, look up videos on youtube from Gordon Ramsay and Jacques Pepin, among others. Sometimes food's unsatisfying because it's not done quite right, again, I don't know your skill level. Also, they will give you GREAT ideas if you filter for carbiness. Wowowow you were good looking before and even more so now, congrats dudeGlad it helped. If you have Frank's Redhot mix a whole bottle of that with 2 sticks of butter.  That's a common buffalo sauce recipe. Sometimes I mix garlic powder or ranch powder in to mix it up a bit, but mostly I just stick with the original. Perfect! I was wondering what I was gonna do with my shoes this year. I had been donating my shoes at the Warrior Dash yearly, but the event has been getting steadily worse (in this area anyway) so I have no plans on attending. My friends with cats have all had their cats die of kidney failure.I suspected the crappy diet had something to do with it.. I did not know about Cream Puff.I've heard keto does wonders to sufferers of PCOS, so that's great you and your friend have found it!

"How will this food make me feel, will it hurt me?" seems so blunt when I read it, but it's too true to not hit home. Carby foods do hurt me, and are not worth it. Thank you for that, it will help.PSH!! Beats a pizza any day!Well, you get to keep mustard, straight vinegar, and hard liquor.  Liver and kidneys are pretty much under 0.5 like eggs. I've found that 90% Lindt doesn't taste good enough to eat by itself, but I don't really get sugary cravings so it's ok to skip it.

I've also tried making a few keto breads but have always been disappointed, so am trying to not substitute anything and just find another meal. Taco salads are my jam, and fill me up for a long time.

Thank youHi guys, wow! nice to come home after a tough day to lovely comments. I think this was my first post on r/keto though I've been lurking for as long as I've been keto-ing. I'll be honest, every day is still like day one for me. I slip, I have cheat days. I don't think it's the best way to be, I'd prefer straight ketoing, but I'm trying to keep ketoing on &amp; remembering it's a marathon &amp; not a sprint.I love that idea of pepperonies and cheese! Very lazy and very keto. I will do that today and mess around with ingredients.

Enjoy what I can eat. I will keep that at the front of my mind, because ultimately I do enjoy what I eat and feel fantastic from it.

Thank youI'd say your protein is far too high - so all opinions are different.

I'm 5ft 6" and I aim for between 60g-80g and wouldn't suggest any more unless you are really into heavy weight lifting.Haha...well, I went from around a 40G to a 34DDD-36D/DD. I definitely lost some boobage, but they're much nicer looking now, I think. Conventionally, anyway. no, /r/ketogainsI was 296 lbs, had just graduated college, noticed my coworker was shredding weight off fast doing keto, and was looking for my next journey.  I lost 110 lbs. and I fell off of it, doing a high calorie diet while bulking over the last few months.  I stopped keto because I wasn't hitting the gym and was just losing weight, so I ended up not having all that much muscle.

I started doing keto recently because now that I lift and have some muscle, I want to shred off the last of it and finally get my BF down to 8-10% and then bulk again.5"9ish!Keto is the way I eat. I really like that.

I need to keep it in my mind that keto makes me feel good. It has stopped me from developing diabetes and I won't have any issues during pregnancy that could have been prevented. It is worth it, and having a small amount of carbs isn't doing me any good, only satisfying my mind which needs to change the way it thinks.

I have control, and need to use it.

Getting home after a big day and not wanting to make food is annoying, but yes, I will spend a bit longer making food that won't leave me feeling shit in a few hours.

Thank you, your reply really hit home.If you ever use MFP on the computer instead of mobile there is a plugin you can add for net carbs. I think it's linked on the sidebar but I'm on mobile myself right now. I am 5"9 or so, and I'm about a size 10 right now (depending on store, of course).and liquid sucralose. the splenda packets have 1g carbs each!! found that our after a week!Big fan of the lettuce-wrapped bacon cheeseburger from Five Guys.I am not hungry when I wake up so I eat right when I get home from work... which is 5:30. I then give myself a 6 hour window which is just enough to get hungry again for my second meal. I drink a cup of broth at lunch time at work and a coffee with just a little cream when I wake up.I can't trust myself with nuts or nut-like foods :c

they go from hanging out next to me... to all gone![r/keto/KETO_TIP_ONIONS](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2tzof6/keto_tip_onions/)nomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom6 months and your bed still isn't made :(Interesting. Is there a reason for those times? I only eat between 8 AM and 1 or 2 PM. 2g net in the strawberry (4g total 2g fibre).If it doesn't subtract fiber for you, you might want to only enter net carbs, because as is it looks like you're going way over your carb limits. It's more of a problem with my family, who still eat carbs, and they are always eating them in front of me. Which is fine in the moment, I stay strong but it builds up and explodes through my cravings.

However I have been noticing that what they are eating are things like bread for toast or sandwiches, or chips (hot and crisps) or another carby food that can't be made keto. So in a way, if I think of their meals completely separate to mine I think it will help.

I love explaining to people that I can eat all the fat in the world, including bacon and not just 'good fats' like avacado etc. 99% of the time they are completely confused but oh well, it's not for them it's for me.

Thank youFunny story, the people I hang out with (who taught me most of what I know about this diet) call is "keh-toe" and it wasn't until I was watching some of our fellow keto-ers on youtube that my brain exploded.

Well, I thought the first one was just... wrong, but after watching some Caveman Kitchen vids I knew it was me that was wrong!

Lesson learned yesterday xDAnother pepperoni option - buy the regular slices, put them on some paper towel and microwave them until they're crisp. Pepperoni chips!mmm mazing!It does not subtact the carbs, they're 6 each, so 6 and 12(I had two)I'm also in it for the short haul. A lot of posters do preach keeping to it for all eternity and there are posts every week from people who come back after having gained weight back when they stopped their first stint with keto, so that reinforces the idea that they should not have stopped it.

The audience is definitely biased. My theory is this: It depends on what your lifestyle and weight before keto was. You are not going to have the same reaction after stopping dieting if you were only 10lb overweight before starting it vs 200lb overweight: Those two people almost always have very different lifestyles. So in my very personal opinion, unless you regularly gain weight every other month at 140lb (for example), you are not suddenly going to begin gaining at 130lb either. Since you don't need to do anything different to maintain 130, if you were maintaining 140 without difficulty, you can do the same with 130 too.

I've lost a bit of weight in 5lb bursts over the years and I've never gained any of it back, I mean it's such a small amount I don't even notice the difference unless I get on the scale and it shows a different number than it did before, but I don't *feel* significantly different. Once I'm at a weight I'm happy with, I'm going to stop keto too, and I have no worries whatsoever of gaining it back.

I will say though, unless you just want to lose 3-5lb, 4-6 weeks probably will not be enough. Just putting it out there so you don't set yourself up for disappointment failure, it's muuuuch slower losing weight when you have little to lose.you lost a lot in your legs and around your mid section.  looks like more than 20 lbs!  great job!Maybe you can have a renewal of your vows celebration, and get some new photos of your renewed self, too!I haven't heard that saying before, but I will definitely be following it. Next time I have cravings for something carby, I will just eat something else, even if I'm not 'feeling' hungry. That seems like it would be a big help.

The grill has been thrashed by cooking a ton of meat lately! I'm just used to using my oven to make cheesy bakes or other things which will have to wait a week or two until my kitchen is back.

That would be a struggle, but well done on not giving up.

Ketosis is a godsend, and I will use it to it's full potential. My body deserves it. The clean, light energy is so good, I won't mess it up from food.

Thank youYou look amazing! Great job!! ;DI find they share a similar texture with Goldfish crackersI don't use MFP, so I'm not sure if it's subtracting fiber for you somewhere, but as it - looks like your carbs are at 33 and 67 I believe form taking a quick peak. If you're aiming for 20, and tortillas are 19 and 38 carbs...they're the culprit for you consuming over your carb limit. I could not convince myself to try the strawberry when they were on sale bec I was afraid I wouldn't like them! I keep alternating Chocolate and Vanilla, but Chocolate has slightly better net carbs so I keep going with it.  It looks like Strawberry has good ones too. Thank you for sharing!  I am also a shorty so it is nice to know what a difference it makes!  You look AWESOME!I'm from Australia so I have to ask, what does buffalo sauce taste like?

I think I will start making a weekly shopping list and keep those items you mentioned and a few more to make sure I always have something easy to eat. Pepperoni and salami is one of my favorites!

Thank youIs the Ceasar dressing low carb? I've noticed the carb count in that stuff can vary widely so I'm always nervous having it unless I can see the nutritional info on the bottle it's poured from.It's spicy bbq, just a tiny bit on there for some heat. They make it themselves so I know it's relatively low sugar. Doesn't look great on mobile. I'll check it later on a desktop. I really like that idea! To splurge out on things that are a bit out of my way will definitely help. I've recently subscribed to a bunch of keto recipe blogs, so maybe once a week I'll find the best looking 'treat' and make it.

Thank youIf it's not homemade, god only knows what was added to it!thank you and yea I'm glad I took pictures too.  The scale can be quite discouraging.I'll check the label when I get home, but they do have quite a bit of fiber in them.rofl

that felt like a post from /r/KitchenConfidential   Well played!Yes! I am allergic to garlic and recently tomato. I currently have huge, angry hives on my face from having a tiny bit of tomato sauce on Sunday night, and tomato is not coming back in my body again.

I haven't really thought about thinking of being on keto as an allergy, but I probably should because I'm very strict towards my allergies. It will help because my mind will get used to thinking of non keto foods as an allergen.

I am capable, I can do this. For me, because I can control how I feel and I am so lucky to be able to do that.

Thank youYour MFP lists 19 carbs for your tortillas, so something is wrong there.

Give Coconut milk a try, I think it's damn tasty. I like the "so delicious" brand. Cameltosiswhat kind of sauce?Oh sweet! Thanks!Does it make a difference that they are "carb balance" tortillas? They have 6 net carbs. The soy chocolate milk tastes a million times better than the almond, but I've never tried coconut milk!You are really doing great!  I'm 1 1/2 months in and have only lost 15 pounds.  I need to figure how to get a little more off each week.  Awesome job, man!Wow. I re read your comment a few times, thank you for sharing your story.

That is amazing that keto gave you your eyesight back! I had no idea of the extent of it's benefits relating to diabetes. My stepdad is type 1 and isn't heading down a good road, hopefully if I tell him your success he will come around and make better choices.

"Usually the eyesight wins out over the pizza." That hit me right where I needed it. Although my problems aren't that severe, I think I should start treating them as if they could get worse.

You're right, I am so lucky to have control over how I feel, all relating to food.

I see a Dr in SA, Australia, so if on the off chance you are living here I will inbox you his name. I've been in that boat! I had seen so many 'normal' drs who had no idea what was going on and no one referred to keto, only telling me to keep eating fruits and low fat things. The pain we go through from misinformed medical professionals is ridiculous. However I did meet a Dr in an ED who swears by keto, so word is getting around!

Thank you so much for your reply, I really will change the way I'm thinking because of you.

I'm in pre-diabetes even though my weight has never gone above 68kgs (I put on 6kgs from the blood sugar problems) however my dr is treating it all fantastically.

Between two egg/veggie/meat muffins in the morning at 6:15 and whatever we do for dinner at around 5, the shake is all I have and it does wonders.Because I already make two lunches for my wife and daughter and an up at 5am to exercise and am showered, have eaten breakfast and out the door by 6:30. So, the ease and convenience when I'm crunched for time. Plus, I like the easily quantifiable amount.As others have said slowly increase the coconut oil and magnesium as both can cause it when your system is shocked with too much - but as my husband found out check your overall diet.

He had this problem and after me asking all the usual questions it turned out he'd been eating a lot of sugar free gum - so make sure you haven't swapped normal food for lots of sugar alcohols (ie low carb atkins bars/gummi bears etc) and sorbatol
as that will give a lot of people problemsFunny!! I'm actually a huge gamer myself and I never made the association, but now I kinda see it! We also share the same cynicism haha! Yep, American! :)I started Keto and IF at the same time. I eat right when i get home and about 5 hours later I am ready for another meal. Sometimes I am not that hungry and I make myself eat or I won't have enough energy the next day. First meal is usally a stir fry and second is a big salad. Salad is good when your not that hungry because it feels really healthy.Looking great :)Intermittent fasting, I eat from 5:30 at night to 11:30. fast all night and day and eat when I get home.The very beginning... I learned how to make tasty filled toasts! I never liked bread but they were good (of course, they were crispy and they contained veggies &lt;3 I'm a tiny bit crazy about veggies, you see) so I just made them a lot. My body sent a slight sign it doesn't like it so I thought maybe I could just stop eating gluten...  After or before doing some research, I don't remember. I never liked eating sugar so let's skip that too. Along with most of dairy.
And if I change my lifestyle... why not to lose some weight? I never knew how to do that and I had fat to lose.
A dark period of my life came, I totally became food addicted and Net addicted... It was so exciting! New, unheard-of low-carb recipes, articles about how our body works...
I've read about keto too (it wasn't totally unknown to me but I barely knew anything about it before) and for some reason, I was sure it's a good way to lose weight, it's just extreme. But if I will stall, it will be my last chance. I tried to go keto sometimes but I couldn't do it. I just used it to get rid of my sweets cravings. I had raging chocolate days sometimes (it's impossible now) and I stopped them with some very low-carb days (I called them something like "keto attempt days" but I knew they probably won't last long enough to reach ketosis).
Years later (I was totally used to low-carb and it felt natural to me, I felt good), when my weight stall was 1 year old (I'm a patient hedonist :P), I decided on keto. I was pretty serious at that point. And it wasn't so hard but it got easier later. And it had great benefits! I loved them. Slow weight loss, peace and being so nicely full came after one month. My eating window became smaller and it's great.
I fell off the wagon but I always wanted to come back (even if some of the benefits stayed with me for a while) and about 10 days ago, I did. The circumstances weren't ideal but I'm more serious than ever.
Now I'm building habits to make keto more natural to me. I think.

I've read about Atkins. Definitely not for me.Holy shit, you're the American (?) version of TotalBiscuit.So me and my best friend both have PCOS, Keto helps with many of the symptoms. One day she called me saying that was too hard not to eat carbs but that every time she did her PCOS went haywire. My solution put a note on fridge and perhaps office and car that reads "how will this food make me feel, will it hurt me?". It helped her.I plan to be on keto for life because It's not worth feeling physically and mentally horrible from food. It's not worth it. Mini self realization there. I can eat whatever I want, but I want what is good for me and what won't make me feel like crap.

Thank you! Honestly, I really appreciate it.Peanut butter and butter mixed together is delicious! I use to eat PB and butter sandwiches as a child and totally forgot about it until you brought it up.

It makes the peanut butter taste a little more mild and creamier if I remember correctly, but it's a little hard to explain. I definitely recommend it but I think it would be better on something instead of just straight.Congrats! You're looking pretty damn good!

The pictures are really smart of you. I wish I'd taken pictures when I began losing. I'd love to have an immediate visual reference to go by. As it is, I don't feel like I look very different.

Congrats again!I *love* the strawberry flavor of these. Will have to pick up some chocolate.Thanks! I appreciate it :)

I'll take a look.I usually stick to some sort of dry rub.  Most wing places with buckets of flavours have at least a few of those, and many of them are absolutely delicious.I made [this](http://www.lowcarbfriends.com/bbs/showthread.php?t=694106) sauce the other day and it's pretty good. It's a little tart, next time I'll probably add a bit more liquid smoke and stevia and a bit less vinegar.What is "Lazy Keto"? My google-fu is coming up empty.Friend of mine mentioned he was going to try it again for weightloss. and I had never heard of it before, spent three weeks thoroughly researching it, started eating this way close to a year and a half ago. I recognized the health benefits of it and now I'm too far down the rabbit hole in research that there really is no turning back.My wife makes a very simple rub that is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten.

Start with Clubhouse 'roasted garlic and red pepper', and then add cinnamon and some cayenne pepper.  Ground it up in a mortar and pestle or in a food processor.  Sprinkle liberally on *EVERYTHING*.Back to business. Remember, though, that a shot of 80 proof whiskey is 90 calories each.

And we're all big guys here lol.I add peanut butter to my vanilla sometimes to up my fat with it too!Wow so I'm bad with age lolGood job - [unless you are a Mob Boss](http://i.imgur.com/2WYJ0Cr.png)...+1 for pepper jack.  Was the best out of all the ones I had.It looks as though these studies do not control for actual work done by the organisms in question.

Work done, as in, W=Fd.

As in, although the caloric consumption of a mouse or rate on a ketogenic or no carb diet may be higher, it doesn't seem as though the quantitative amount of activity (distance ran/walked/climbed, etc) was accounted for, meaning that although activity was observed, it's possible that the creatures on the low carb diets merely did more moving, ran faster, walked faster, and so on and so forth.

Additionally, these studies were rather small, introducing an non-negligible possibility for statistical error.

As a result, I feel as though the conclusion that "The ketogenic diet has the possibility of being metabolically advantageous, but otherwise ought to be treated as though it were metabolically neutral for the purposes of measurement during a human diet for the purposes of weight loss or maintenance unless actual individual results prove otherwise" is a much more reasonable conclusion than "The ketogenic diet is metabolically advantageous."

Just my two cents.

Good studies though. Do like.I would suggest sitting down and actually working out why you plan to be on keto for life.

You don't have to be on Keto - you can eat what ever diet you like (unless you are locked in a little room for life with your meals being delivered on a tray through a hatch in the bottom of the door - if that's the case sorry for this post as that would suck :) )

Your cravings are simply a symptom of your attitude so my advise would be get over it and make the decision to either be on keto or not - millions of people choose to eat crap and feel like crap so that's an option any time you choose to take it.

Alternatively you can choose to enjoy staying on the keto lifestyle and embrace all the benifits as well as explore all the taste options open to you as you'll probably end up with a more varied and tasty diet than you would have on the traditional SAD diet.
key-toeInsanely attractive face, 10/10Regular buffalo (mild, medium or hot) and garlic parmesean sauces are almost always zero carb. If something sounds like it would be sweet (or "BBQ"), then it's probably full of sugar. Adding ice is a great idea. . Thanks for this!

..and I must know the story behind your username. Holy sh... yeah, you're an amazing endorsement for /r/keto.  Great job!!lol I'm 28My emergency food is ghee mixed with ground nuts and various nuts :) I only make ghee from butter when I need to make sure it won't spoil quickly. Ghee is practically just fat if we did a good job so it's okay. But my food never lasted more than several days.

But you really can stand a few days without food, especially on keto... Okay, I think it's not as pleasant as eating something. I always have keto food if I leave the house for a longer time too.I cannot gauge your age at all. In the first pic you look ~15-16. In the last one you could be 19.

I'm going with 16 just so I can say keto + puberty is a hell of a drug.I did it last year for a bit, quite expensive to carry on.

Chicken and butter for breakfast.

Chicken and butter for lunch.

Best I've ever felt after that monthCan confirm. I'm a PhD organic chemist, so I've taken courses with dozens of profs over the yrs. It's  been key-toe every time :-)Thank you, I'm glad when people understand!Like peanut-butter. Peanut-butter overpowers basically everything. I've never done just those two, but I have done those two and a little sugar-free chocolate syrup. Even that tastes just like peanut-butter.Mental: I did keto steady for about 6 months to go from roughly 190 down to 155. Doing that gave me the confidence to know that I can lose whatever I need to. That's a double edged sword. I don't freak out when i hit 160, but I'm real tempted to say, "meh, what's another 5 pounds when I know how to lose it?". So in that way, it's somewhat risky.

Physically, just the usual: You'll feel like crap after you carb up for a few days.Why would you be crazy? :)
I planned to be on keto only to lose some weight and then back to my low-carb but not ketogenic lifestyle. Keto and me for long? Even for short time it's a miracle, I eat vegetables, nuts and some eggs and fruit, very rarely meat and cheese.
1-2 weeks later I got passionate and decided it must be my new lifestyle, I want those benefits, less hunger, more energy, even in the morning when I'm usually a zombie! It's just too good! My carb limit is 40g because my veggie lover hedonist self need to enjoy itself just like in my previous lifestyle. I feel the restrictions anyway but it's still enjoyable enough :) On summer, it will be surely too low... But I will balance my desires, needs and carbs. Eating low-carb is natural to me, now I just choose low-carb veggies if possible to make my diet even more low-carb. It's not so very hard. Even 20-30g would be simple, I just wouldn't enjoy it near this much and I'd quit.

There are quite a few great low-carb vegetables...They look good but so expensiveThat wasn't the question asked.

Ketosis and keto adaptation are different.  IF does not accelerate keto-adaptationOh, yeah, I have this.. thing about Cheezits.

But let's not act like the 2 1/2 lb burrito is coming from an all-natural health food store, either. I know what I'm getting into, thoughGood for you!!  Keep it up!!  But it takes around 3 weeks to get fat adapted normally.

You can speed up the process down to about 10days if you IF. (Results may vary, keto flu may hit harder on an IF)Neither do I. I used to eat literally none.

But eating this way taught me tolerable ways to eat a few. :)This.  They have great flavor for a protein shake.  I like to throw an extra scoop of protein power (what ever kind you like) in it to step up the protein content too.  Blended with a fair amount of ice is also tasty and gives you a pretty large drink to enjoy.Of course! I buy the best I can afford, which isn't much, but as I'm getting older, my spending power is increasing (yay graduation and full time employment!) and so the quality [and treatment of the animals] of the meats I eat is increasing too. You should find other means of getting your fat. One good option is unrefined coconut oil. At room temperature the stuff is solid, and quite easy to simple eat a tablespoon of. You can also search /r/ketorecipes for "keto fat bombs" in which people have amazing recipes for in-taking a lot of fat all at once. You should also learn to incorporate olive oil and butter into your cooking. Its easy to sneak them in when done properly.

As for calorie counting .... I for one think its worth doing. The goal is not just to use keto to lose weight, but to also teach yourself how to eat properly. The problem with Atkins was the diet cut out carbs but did not teach self-restraint. In fact Atkins specifically advertised "eat as many butter covered steaks as you want". When people got off the Atkins diet, their eating habits did not change and they gained all their weight back. Calorie counting on keto not only causes you to lose weight, but to also refrain from spurious eating, which is a life lesson on its own.Many people stay below 20g net carbs and eat the veggies listed above by /u/capughe.  As long as you're staying away from the high carb veggies, it's hard to eat too much of this stuff.  Lots of us get lots of veggies all the time.Screwedonstraight has a great recipe for peanut butter cups which is basically PB, butter, and cream cheese. Freeze, and eat.Atkins isn't supposed to be high protein though he did advocate higher amounts than most would eat.

Carbs are a limit, protein is a target, fat is the rest until your not hungry.


If your not hungry don't eat any more.

My macro numbers when I was losing weight were 20carbs, 130protein, 130fat.

Looking at my trend for the year I averaged 16carbs, 134protein, and 112fat per day.

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ketogenicI think the same way. But I still go the humanest route possible, heck when I can I buy straight from the farmer. But at the end of the day. This works for me. Putting my health first for once in my life. :) not gonna feel guilty for it. I assume you have type 2 diabetes given the meds you're on. I'm a type 1 diabetic and in exactly the same boat. I let my blood sugars run wild for close to a decade and literally went blind as a result. It was only after going keto, getting my sugars under control, and a long, painful year of laser treatments, surgeries, and steroid injections that my vision returned. Whenever I get a non-keto urge, I just remember that the choice is between a lifetime of eyesight vs. a moment of carb-y bliss. Usually the eyesight wins out over the pizza.

So my takeaway for you isn't necessarily a practical one, but a psychological one: Remember how lucky you are to have gotten a second chance, to have discovered keto and put yourself on the right track toward health and wellness.

On a side note, who is this magical keto-supporting doctor you have? All of mine have no understanding of keto and thumbs down it every time I come in (despite that fact that my a1c, cholesterol levels, and weight have improved drastically.)I really don't think they do. Unless you're talking about the protein synthesis that happens.&gt; it's incredibly difficult to curb the cravings.

That is completely a personal opinion that varies wildly from person to person.Buy a box of sugar free jello, a box of knox gelatin (to thicken it up more) and some sugar free mio / kool aid.

Follow the jello instructions and add in a packet of knox without adding more water, then add a few squirts of your mio. Make sure it's all dissolved, then let it sit in a mold or a container.

EASY AS SHIT.No, 4hb is slow carb -- the diet is slow carb, 4hb is the book.  My fault -- wrong name.

I don't like lentils anyway, so it's a moot point for me.What's IF&gt; The panel said that Americans were eating too much salt, sugar and saturated fat, and not enough foods that fit a healthy dietary pattern, like fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish and **moderate levels of alcohol.**

Wait, are we supposed to be drinking some alcohol then? I could never get past the flavor.keto = key-toe. ketone = key-toneMeat has some carbs but some kind has almost 0 and some has a lot (organ meats).
Zerocarbers eat the latter too but they need to be careful with that I guess. They know they don't actually eat zero carbs, just very close to that.You're nuts if you think I'm not already doing that. ;)I was thinking that over the past 9 months I may have unintentionally done this exactly, on weeks where I focused on eating salads and lean proteins only. Any negative side effects?Good point on the weight loss; I don't want to gain back and lose ground toward my goal.Thanks for the perspective!I could do for 1-3 day even if I don't like the idea - I'd simply fast. It would be almost impossible without it. Maybe eating some fat and nothing else...
If I eat a proper meal, it always means vegetables. Probably vegetables with vegetables. I rarely eat meat or cheese. I love eggs but I eat them with veggies, of course.
I have other carb sources too but they aren't so important. Vegetables are super important, always, as much as possible.

In short, NO WAY.

(I don't even try to lower my carb limit to 20g... I'm sure I'd hate that. I accidentally do that occassionally though. Extremely rarely.)

But I might do that for a whole day. It would be very odd and I have no idea what would I eat... But I like challenges :) (Once I did a low-fat day! Once in my whole high-fat life. It was horrible but I still ate a lot.)Not gonna give up my veggies, sorry.Balanced meaning not heavily saturated in one component, whether that is fat or carb or protein, or all fruit and no other foods, or whatever. Balanced across multiple food groups and nutrients. Like with tequila, vodka, and beer, I believe in large quantities of moderation!I don't agree that there is no scientific evidence. I don't think that this evidence actually conclusively proves anything, but I'd argue that it's not an unreasonable opinion for me to have, since there isn't any conclusive evidence to the contrary either.

&gt;In conclusion, feeding of a ketogenic diet with a high content of fat and very low carbohydrate leads to distinct changes in metabolism and gene expression that appear consistent with the increased metabolism and lean phenotype seen. Through a specific dietary manipulation, weight loss can occur secondary to distinct metabolic changes and without caloric restriction.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19082851

&gt;"Carbohydrate restriction has a more favorable impact on the metabolic syndrome than a low fat diet."

http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154

&gt;"REE [resting energy expenditure] was 67 kcal/d higher with the very low-carbohydrate diet compared with the low-fat diet. TEE [total energy expenditure] differed by approximately 300 kcal/d between these 2 diets, an effect corresponding with the amount of energy typically expended in 1 hour of moderate-intensity physical activity." (As in, the group eating a very low carbohydrate diet actually burned 300 more calories daily with the only lifestyle alteration being diet composition.)

&gt;"Therefore, our results show novel effects of KD [ketogenic diet] on BAT [Brown adipose tissue] physiology and metabolism. This study, along with our previous study on the KE diet, indicates that BAT is a ketone body responsive tissue, increasing its mitochondrial protein content in response to increased circulating ketone bodies. Previous studies in humans using KD have shown a reduction in body weight on this diet (2630). It is possible that the reduction seen is related to increased energy expenditure that may be partly mediated by the BAT activation."

&gt;"BACKGROUND: High-protein diets have been shown to increase energy expenditure (EE).

&gt;OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study whether a high-protein, carbohydrate-free diet (H diet) increases gluconeogenesis and whether this can explain the increase in EE.

&gt;CONCLUSIONS: Forty-two percent of the increase in energy expenditure after the H diet [high-protein, carbohydrate-free diet] was explained by the increase in gluconeogenesis. The cost of gluconeogenesis was 33% of the energy content of the produced glucose.Yeah that's always the best form of motivation along with health reasons. Well again keep up the good work buddy!! God bless!I'd like to know how much you lost odd off your chest? I don't want to lose my boobs Want gummies?

Buy a box of sugar free jello, a box of knox gelatin (to thicken it up more) and some sugar free mio / kool aid.

Follow the jello instructions and add in a packet of knox without adding more water, then add a few squirts of your mio.

Let it sit in a mold or a container.

[And then you have sour gummies.](http://i.imgur.com/PjNd4YM.jpg)Well, I'm limited to almost no veg because I'm trying to stay strictly within the 20 net carbs to get and stay in ketosis. I know I could probably up that limit to about 50 now that I've been solid the last 2 weeks, but I guess I figure the lower I can go, the better. 50 g would allow me a couple more servings of veg a day, though.

If I were diabetic or showing signs of pre-diabetes, I would definitely see keto as a long-term plan. However, it's hard for me to accept that eating high fat content is going to be better for me than eating a mix of fruit, veg, meat, and starches, especially since my LDL cholesterol is trending higher over the past year. Great work. I'm on day 4 of my keto start and have no idea if I'm doing it right.After getting down to the goal weight/look I desired, (155)...

I know what to look out for, but I definitely enjoy some carbs here and there. That said, sometimes the weight creeps back up. When i hit 160, i get back on keto for a few weeks. kind of a tightly banded yo-yo diet.I don't have acid reflux anymore either bro.

It's probably mostly to do with not eating chocolate or tomatoes, as they're pretty big culprits, but hey, I'll take it. You are soooo sexy to me in both pics. Nice work! Not to mention that cats are carnivores and do best on a ketogenic diet. [Creme Puff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creme_Puff_%28cat%29) lived to be 38 years old. Compare this to the ten-something year average life span of cats who die to complications of kitty diabetes, like kidney failure.
Fat isn't a goal... It's fine if you eat less fat, feel satiated and well. If your calorie intake isn't very low, it's fine. Lucky... I need to make some efforts to eat at a deficit...
Calorie matters, of course. Your weight loss depends on it. If you eat too much, you won't lose any weight and maybe you gain some, even if you are overweight. I experienced that but it's very logical to me anyway.Ditch the tortillas to lower you carbs. Looks like you're consuming a fair amount of soy products, I'd suggest switching that to coconut or almond milk if it fits your macros. While it's not perfect, the article does show there is pushback on the sodium and saturated fat claims. There's no pushback on the sugar claims.yes very consistently, 5 days a week most weeks ;no less than 4He's not incorrect. [You can loose weight if you eat nothing but twinkies.](http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/) We know that sugar are inherently bad for our bodies, but you will only gain fat if you eat too many calories.

Your body stores fat more readily and burns carbs quicker, that's why when you eat both your body stores the fat. Keto makes loosing weight easy because if keeps you full, energized and balances your blood out. There is no magic.Awesome change in only 6 months! Have you been hitting the gym too?No worries, go to /r/ketogains, /r/bodybuilding and/or /r/fitness to get ripped for summer![Go here](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/account/diary_settings) and change your nutrients tracked to carbs, fat, protein, fiber, and whatever else you'd like. I track potassium. Yes yes I know this but I also don't like vegetables much.Limit carbs to 20 net grams, meet your protein goal, eat fat to satiety *unless* eating at too high of a deficit (depends on stats)

Calories matter, absolutely! Some can eat to satiety and achieve a calorie deficit, many cannot and it has diminishing returns. You cannot eat all you want to a surplus and lose weight, no! Calorie counting is a useful tool not just for maintaining deficit but the mere act of doing it can make most much more accountable and keep their head in the game and moreover it teaches you about macros which few have any clue about until they learn. Speaking of, cheese and cream are not the only sources of fat.

Calories matter, anyone who says they don't isn't living in reality. The issue is that some don't have to count to achieve a deficit. The ability to do so often depends heavily on starting body weight. The variation in satiety is less than variation in TDEE. For example, two people eat to 1200-1600 calories to satiety. If person A is 450 lbs that's a huge deficit and he will lose easily, if person B is 140 lbs he will not. You don't have to count, it's a tool, choose whether to use it or not but ketosis != weight loss, you can gain weight in ketosis Doesn't sound fun, I'll make sure to get enough!shit I'm in the gym 5 days a weekLooking good man! Congrats.

Now it's time for the gym (:haven't posted in quite a while so thought I would.

now that the bf is getting lower its getting a LOT harder.  Any veterans on here recommend a diet break maybe bulk for a bit?  I've read places that it helps but I would really like to have a 6 pack for summer so that might hinder the chances for that to happen.This was the response I was going to give, so I'll just second this one.   OP is young and has a reasonable chance of loose skin tightening up over time naturally.Hey. I am a college student and I have been trying out Keto for a little more than a month now. Lots a few kgs. I think I had the keto calculator overestimate my calories so I recently adjusted that. This diet helped push me to learn how to cook and it's not turning out pretty well. Looking for someone to partner up with, hold each other accountable.Forgot to mention the possible side effects of electrolyte imbalance:

* nausea
* fatigue
* brain fog
* muscle crampsI could. All the veggies I like are starchy. Since they are already gone, I don't eat many vegetables. I usually struggle each day to not blow past my protein goal since I eat mostly meat. Not even meat and cheese, just meat, with a small amount of cheese. Lol. My usual carb intake for the day is somewhere around 10g. I don't think it would be that hard for me to get rid of the 10. &gt;might like to include food as some folk report decreased tolerance sans carbs

As a big guy, I see decreased tolerance as good thing ;)Shit was cash. [Congrats!](http://media.giphy.com/media/13U5CK2P7h0Jqg/giphy.gif)That makes total sense! Thank youAll I would suggest is using a different oil. I think adding recipes to MFP is super tedious so I tend either keep the recipes as simple as possible or I do a lazy log some days (bad, I know).Dude. Burger looks fucking unreal. I need twelve. I always loved onions. I couldn't imagine scrambled eggs without onion, one huge onion - one egg... I ate egg covered onions :D
I don't do that anymore but it's good I can still eat them (if I don't, I'd quit) - in a little amount. My carb limit is more generous but an onion is too much to afford, I don't sacrifice my other veggies for that. Fortunately, they are a bit like spices, a little makes a difference flavor wise :)
So I keep eating onions because I love them. And carrots and green peas. My lunch had all of them and several other vegetables (oh cauliflower, my darling and saviour, yay!).

Life is like that, you need to be careful with many vegetables on keto. You can squeeze them in tiny amounts... Or if you make a super lowcarb day except that problematic item.In my post I said we were assuming 0 = 0, and I'm 99% sure that untouched meat has 0 carbs. No worries brothaman.

And like I said, just read around a lot. Many alcohols don't list their caloric info. Surprisingly whisky and rum have zero carbs but avoid flavored ones (no blackberry brandy!)Thank you!! I've been blessed to have supporting family and friends around me the whole time!Lol I just subscribed to /r/ketodrunk, what a time to be alive!
Thanks :)woaaah. Typical day in meals? nice. that's pretty damn encouraging.Try to find unpopular cuts and products. Fatty ground beef, chicken hearts, chicken liver, other offal are cheap because no one is buying them.

Chicken hearts contain 414 mg of Phosphatidylserine per 100 g. You might have heard of the latter as a bodybuilding supplement.

Go for the cheapest cheese. There is little variance in macros, most of them are close to 1:1 fat:protein.

Lard is also cheaper than butter or coconut oil, but it might be processed.

And don't skimp on your veggies! Get some broccoli, spinach, kale, cauliflower, brussels sprouts. Use black pepper, garlic, mustard for seasoning. Onions if you can fit them into your carb limit. All of these are full of Sulforaphane, Diindolylmethane, HDAC inhibitors, Potassium and other nutrients that are useful for bodybuilding.

Depending on local prices and the depth of your wallet of course.Nice work man! Keep it up bud!those red/purple ones have CRAZY intense flavor. I've been using them for years because they're so dank. Cutting them thin is nice because it opens up a lot of the 'cells' of juice and let the flavor really leak out.

Also just a heads up, be careful with like, powdered onion and garlic spices. they can pack a few carbs.Good for you! The more moments like this, the easier it will be. Keep it up!The short version is that following low-carb / ketogenic diets will cause you to flush excess water from your body. This can cause your electrolytes to become imbalanced. It is difficult to get enough electrolytes from diet and multivitamins alone.

So.. take 300 mg of magnesium daily. Buy Morton's Lite Salt which is 50% potassium, 50% sodium. Use plenty of "Lite Salt" on your food to get enough sodium and potassium.Thanks, man! I sure will! Good luck with getting over your hump.

I'll be looking for your "Voila!" post, as well.:)I'm fairly certain that all food has some sort of carbohydrates. Even steak, cheese, cream ect. In USA the labels can be rounded down to 0 even if there's up to a half gram. I usually consider a carb for every serving of something that claims "0".

Same here. Whenever I see "Heart healthy" on a package, I don't buy it.
This is like #3 most popular question.

- http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=alcohol&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

&gt;What I understand is that my body stops burning fat until it finishes burning the alcohol in my blood

I don't know why misinformation like this pervades, your body is not binary - you are using fat every millisecond you're alive. Drink zero/low carb stuff, enjoy it, and don't sweat it - might like to include food as some folk report decreased tolerance sans carbs.Not only do I love the taste, my caloric needs are pretty damn low ( approx 1200 ), so the volume of veggies really help me stick to the plan :) &gt; Lots of fruits are selectively bred to increase their sugar content, you can't make a blanket claim that fruits are healthy

Even some zoos have cut out fruit for their charges due to the sugar content.That sounds really goodTrue - and this is certainly worth mentioning. If she goes that route I will make sure to offer that bit of advice!Alcohol is treated like poison in your body and your system will work to process it out quickly, so your fat burning will take a back seat. After you sober up it's smooth sailing. As long as you aren't consuming alcohol with carbs, you'll stay in ketosis.

Whisky has 0 carbs, so drink up. Just be mindful of your caloric consumption, be aware what's in a mixed drink and don't be fooled by tonic water.

also check out /r/ketodrunk&gt; the response from the advisory committee seems to be that an even more restricted list of acceptable foods will, this time around, do the trick.

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
 Pass the bacon.That's a simple but great idea, I can definitely do that and still get the flavor I guess. Thanks!Ohhhhh. Ha! I'm slow on uptake today. That's definitely one "gain" I never want to lose :)Same here! Had to take a pill for heartburn nearly every single day before keto. Have now been on keto for a couple of months and haven't had heartburn a single time since the day I started.What 2 pieces of chicken do you know that's with olive oil and butter that's 350 calories? Moreover an avocado alone is 250 calories ok maybe OP ate half that's 125 calories and then you add dressing...and yes most broccoli soups are loaded with calories AND then you add chicken...this is a prime example of why estimating doesn't workI think he means the girl lol congrats!Many people stay in keto under 100g carbs. Most people stay in under 50. I wouldn't panic, but now you know tha root veggies are bad news (except radishes for some reason).

If you want avoid, I recommend buying red ones and slicing them SUPER thin ..a little bit goes a long way.Isopure shake with MCT oil keeps me full forever. It's almost too much protein for my macros so sometimes I only do half. I mix the chocolate and banana creme. So tasty.Well you shouldn't.

There is no actual evidence beyond anecdotal n=1 reports that it is potentially metabolically advantageous.

It's actually possible that for some people, it's metabolically DISadvantageous.

For me personally, I can eat more calories on keto and maintain my weight than on high carb (I've checked), so for me it actually is also metabolically advantageous, as I outlined above, but for anyone to claim that Keto by nature is metabolically advantageous for people in general is silly and unsupported.We're very different, then! I can go months without touching a vegetable!WHat are some of your favorite Keto meals!?I've read it once bit haven't read the electrolyte one, going to read it now! Thank you+1 for Whole30ummm well when I was poor last week I ate eggs, canned salmon and tuna, and frozen veggies. Pretty much every day. I also had hwc with my coffee to get fat. &gt;.&lt;If I have to read the words "healthy whole grains" one more time I will punch someone in the throat. Maybe not. But dangit. is 4hb different than slow carb? 'cuz slow carb has lentils which wouldn't jive with keto.Jerky is easy to make at home and cheaper than buying it.  There are good videos on YouTube.  I would take meat, some cut up veggies and almond butter or a wholly guacamole mini tub, I'll admit to having a somewhat flippant attitude toward some things related to a ketogenic diet, basically when it comes to what will amount to negligible amounts of carbohydrates.  9 grams in a half-pound of beef (which is what most taco seasoning packets are) is insane, 12 grams in the form of a tablespoon of sugar in five pounds of pork is hardly enough to matter.

There's sugar in my coffee, I put an extremely thin stream of maple syrup on bacon or salmon, and would rather avoid something entirely than deal with artificial sweeteners.  That's just me though; I wouldn't encourage anyone else to do the same if they're getting by fine by doing it another way.Just as long as the indulge isn't a binge. Some people have problems with that. Indulge should still be a normalish meal size calorie wise just with the not as good stuff.It's a build of of several things, including saturated fats and cholesterol. However, the key point to understand is the reason why all this shit sticks to artery walls: inflammation. The theory is that artery walls become damaged and inflamed for a number of reasons, notably insulin spikes caused by a high carb diet. Inflammation is thought to be the cause to the deposits sticking to artery walls, not cholesterol itself. I've read different figures across studies, but they all noted that a significant portion of people who died of heart attacks had "healthy" cholesterol levels.

Even if cholesterol levels were to blame, dietary cholesterol is insignificant compared to the amount of cholesterol our bodies naturally make.

So what ever you believe (that cholesterol is to blame, or that the real culprit is inflammation [carbs]), lowering the intake of saturated fats wouldn't help in either case.


Unfortunately I don't have any citations. It's all knowledge I've acquired through years of reading about cholesterol (I was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia when I was only 8 years old) from the least biased sources possible.I don't understand your question. That's 40% above my carb macro...
huh?I feel exactly the same especially when I see progress pics. I just want to be able to post one at a happy weight.  I know the process takes time but I just want to be there already!&gt; The panel said that Americans were eating too much salt, sugar and saturated fat, and not enough foods that fit a healthy dietary pattern, like fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish and moderate levels of alcohol.

The average sodium intake borders the lower limit of the 3-6 grams that is found optimal in an epidemiological study investigating cardiovascular disease. Salt is not a problem unless you eat fast food all day, or have kidney issues.

We all know the myths about saturated fat. I won't repeat them here, just sharing a personal experience: My attempts to cut red meat coincided with the worst depressive episode I had so far.

Lots of fruits are selectively bred to increase their sugar content, you can't make a blanket claim that fruits are healthy. It is also highly dishonest to lump them together with vegetables.

Nuts and seeds are not particularly healthy either. With the exception of Flax and Chia seeds, they are chock full of Omega 6 fatty acids. They also tend to be rather calorie dense. Vitamin E is their only saving grace, all the other nutrients you can get from other types of food.

Whole grains are only marginally better than refined grains, it's basically just the newest marketing gimmick used by the food industry. They are completely unnecessary to, or contrary to a healthy diet.

These advice are as shit as others. Pointing out that sugar is unhealthy isn't something special. Maintaining the position that sugar isn't a problem is completely untenable, as it should be. The real problem is acknowledging the truth about cholesterol, saturated fat, red meat, carbohydrates, vegetable oils, etc.

Also, today I learned I need to start drinking alcohol to be healthy.
Looks like you gained 120 to me.I think it's worth trying for the short term.  A lot of people find other non scale benefits that make them want to continue on.  You may feel so great that you want to stick with it or maybe not.  Also, You may want to lose a little more than your goal weight because you'll gain a little water weight when you reintroduce carbs.I didn't do a proper re-intro and I kind of wish I had.  I am back on dairy and unfortunately, I think it's the cause of my back breakouts (from what I have read, it's not uncommon for dairy to cause breakouts).  They almost completely disappeared while doing Whole30.  I don't think it causes any other problems with me though. And I really like cheese.  I'm curious to see how no sugar or grain affects my breakouts though.  Time will tell!That might be exactly what she's looking for. Esp the 80/20 bit so she can still "indulge" from time to time. Thank you!I saw it and couldn't help picturing a pissed off line cook. "Oh she wants lettuce? She's getting some fucking lettuce. Give her all of the lettuce. Slice that head in half, see if she likes THAT!"Oh you mean like flavors. Most fatty is hard to say since most of the non-sweet flavors incorporate butter which is great. I'm partial to Buffalo, Lemon Pepper and occasionally those places that do a Garlic Parmesan one. That one might be the most fatty actually. Zero carbs in either of those three.He probably wants protein and not just fats. Are you taking a multi-vitamin and/or supplementing your magnesium and postassium intake? Weakness after keto-flu could be indicative of a potassium/magnesium deficiency.

Look into a 'No-salt' supplement that uses potassium chloride to help with that, and a multivitamin will make sure you get a baseline magnesium.

Everything else looks great!Sorry for not replying sooner, I've been travelling.

So, to answer your questions, yes I have read the faq. I've read it several times. My question wasn't about what's in the faq, it's specifically about what other people are doing to be successful. /u/freebit and /u/anbeav  have both given me great advice. I've actually printed /u/fteebit's list and carry it with me.

I'm not doing this casually, but when you're pushing 50 it's a little harder to change your ways. My job requires me to have meals and drinks with my customers rather often, and that makes it challenging as well, but I'm getting used to it.
Many cheeses have carbs in them due to the various amounts of milk solids present.

I would think 0 carb would be unnecessarily difficult. No avocados, no nuts of any kind, just muscle meat and fat. Not even offal!dayum, son. you look good! Definitely /r/LadyBoners/ material ;)Outside of dunking them in butter once they're at your table, gotta be blue cheese.

Blue Cheese is the One True Dressing (TM) for chicken wings anyway.HAH!!!

Was just going to post that you need to get over there stat!!

:)It should not throw you out of keto. So back to business.

However, if you make it a habit to drink, be aware that there are plenty of calories in alcoholic beverages, and it would behoove you to track them.Well I know carbs have veggies lol. No way I could do more than a day or two without veggies. How is 28g "way above" 20g?Awesome. Yeah, I weighed every week or so at first, but I had some slight cheating weekends and I realized that weighing everyday is a huge motivator to me. I like to see the ups and downs that occur if I make mistakes in order to motivate me to not do so. Weirdly, it also helps me to remember to get enough fiber/electrolytes, so I don't retain any unecessary water weight or not flushing my waste efficiently, haha... Anyway, thanks for sharing. I have tree trunks for legs so I'm excited to see what I look like at 225!Go to ALDI - buy all the salami. Problem solved :)You look so amazing!!  Awesome job!  You are truly an inspiration!
The place I'm going to has 60 different flavoursthis sub shoots out constant inspiration, every day!My friend was trying to explain the concept of reddit to me. He said, "There's a sub for everything... For example there's this whole community of people who advocate this crazy diet called KETO and they eat bacon, eggs and heavy cream all day and lose a tonne of weight." Then he stopped and laughed and followed with, "You're actually crazy enough to try it, aren't you?"
So I joined reddit and this was my first subscribed subreddit and I read everything and have since paid it forward and changed the lives of a few people including my own. Got married last year and now my husband is on it and after losing 10kg since Christmas he's pretty happy with this "crazy diet." ;) Green Onions have a bit more dietary fiber so you can discount some of the carbs. That sounds awesome! I love me some chai, and will have to try this tomorrow.

/rant - Chai means tea. So chai tea is literally "tea tea".1st or second week of January this year.

I've had success in the past during undergrad as well though. That was like a 6 month bit, and I dropped like 30 lbs. But I was also doing two-a-days at the gym and had hockey practice.

Excellent job! Thanks for sharing!Agreed Let's keep the illusion going, more meat for us, price less likely to soar if less demand.Yes, but if they are really super worn out I recommend taping your feet to avoid blisters before hand (your feet will slip and slide inside the shoe the whole race due to the mud).  And I always choose to donate the shoes after the race instead of cleaning them (it's a program they have tons of donation bins there).  So, was born and raised on BBQ in Kansas City. When I started keto I was devastated when I realized how much sugar went into BBQ sauce.

Savior - Arthur Bryant's. [Nutrition label here](http://www.arthurbryantsbbq.com/imagesa/original.jpg). It has 48 carbs per bottle, but when you put a single bottle over a 6 or 7 pound pork butt or beef brisket, well that's not very much. 7 grams per pound at that point. This is one of the lowest, non "sugar free" bastardizations of bbq sauce that I ran across in the capitol of bbq.

Caveat - if you don't know anyone in KC, the sauce is STUPID expensive. $12/bottle from their site [here](http://arthurbryantsbbq.com/ab/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2&amp;products_id=9)

If you know someone from KC (which I unfortunately am not anymore) the are about 3-5 bucks in most local groceries.

Edit: [Here](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/easy_barbecue_sauce.html) is a recipe I've used myself in the past, it's pretty good but the buyin can be pretty expensive. I usually omit some of the sweetener. Liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce can be pricey. There are plenty of other ones, the basis is tomatoes, mustard, spice, liquid smoke, a sweetener of some sort (if you are a sissy Carolinan or Tennessean ;) ) and Worcestershire. Add things to change the flavor.  are you kosher? Or just prefer them? My boyfriend doesnt do pork (except bacon.. Go figure) and that's why we do sausages. Chicken sausage or beef keilbasa.. Sauted with a tiny amount of onions.. Delicious.&gt; r/theketodiet

Ah, that must have been when it was pretty new. I remember the days of the schism. I wasn't on the diet at the moment, but I was still subbed.Yes! I definitely carried most of my weight in my torso, specifically my chest (as you can see).  I've always had skinnier legs but now I definitely have more prominent "chicken legs", which I'm not thrilled about, but I plan to start kicking ass in the gym soon. Honestly, I didn't intend on going this low, it sort of just happened. But my body seems to like this weight. I've been maintaining here for around 6-7 months. I weigh myself daily: http://i.imgur.com/WzRMyJB.png (I didn't start tracking weight until about a month or two into my journey)Are you still doing dairy?  If so, do you have any negative effects from eating dairy opposed to when you were doing whole30? I've done the whole30 a few times.  I feel like keto is more doable for me because of dairy, but I wonder if I should cut it out at some point to see if I feel even better without it.  You're not using your index finger exclusively ,are ya?I didn't know this! It makes a lot of sense. I just decided to alter my workout program yesterday to include more resistance. I definitely thing my primary goal at this point needs to be adding more muscle! Thanks for sharing this.Nice, how long have you been at it?The only thing that takes the edge off for me is taking a double dose of my tumeric supplement right before bed. Them anti inflammatory properties are no joke. I found I kind of do this naturally since I've been ketoing since last year. I do pretty strict and then ease up a bit, when the constant hunger returns. I wasn't that heavy when I started keto, and now I'm down to the last 6 pounds. This is a timely post, cause I'm at that point now. I know I need to eat up a bit. What will happen, is I will do that, then get very satiated and it will be easy for me to cut back again for awhile.Yeah white onions have a mess of carbs.

Avoiding high GI stuff is good, but a carb is a carb (in terms of net carbs). The GI plays no role in your carb counting. If the onion has too many carbs don't eat it, regardless of it's GI.

I generally cook food with onions in big rings and then pull them out so I get the flavour without all the carbs.Check out /r/zerocarb

I could, but I like vegetables too much.Alternatively

It's the carbs

And possibly the calories

That the carbs drive you to over eat.
;)Isopure protein and HWC from Trader Joes.

620calories

50 protein

48 fat

0 carbsI'd go with the higher BF% estimate at first to still keep calories as low as possible.  As you get more in tuned with your body's signals, it gets easier to judge when you need more salt or fat calories.

You might consider more of a calorie cycling approach as well.  You should be eating more protein and calories on lifting days anyways, but sometimes you might find yourself not as hungry and you can put together some low fat/low calorie days and save some calories for a weekend event.  Higher calories one or two days a week helps the psyche.This isn't the GI diet, if it fits your macros. Look up nutrition facts before eating to avoid any surprises. I plan ahead for days I want to eat more onions.Yup! Veggies have carbs! 0g carbs, 40 days.

Edit: Unless there is a 0 carb veggie that I don't know of.4-6 weeks is probably not enough to do much physically. Spending that time reading about why keto works? That will definitely translate into better eating habits after you're done.That's not exactly true. You'll regain some weight, but you're not going to gain it all back instantly like some kind of voodoo. If anything, this diet primes you for success off keto by being aware of carbs and sugars.http://www.the-gi-diet.org/lowgifoods/I have a question for you. Did you carry most of your weight in your torso? Even when you were bigger did you still have relatively skinny legs? Reason I ask is because we are the same height, but even objectively I don't feel like I look much different than your first picture and I can't even imagine weighing 154! I have a large build, and big legs all the way down, so I'm curious what the difference. The best I've gotten down to was 270, and I felt pretty great. With my frame I imagine I will look decently healthy at 225.A 1000 cal deficit doesn't seem that bad on paper when you're still getting 1900 calories, but if you're hungry that should answer the question for you. Eat if you're hungry.

Also, trust callipers over scales. I eat onions, I just eat a small amount. If it fits your macros... then eat it. I can definitely live with them. I just have to weigh them and make sure I don't go onion-crazy. :) Welcome!

Be sure to read the FAQ a few times and follow the electrolyte recommendations closely.

Looking good! Keto has totally changed my relationship with food too!Guy's sugar free BBQ sauce is pretty tasty. I got a bottle of the original and a bottle of the spicy from netrition. Haven't opened the spicy one yet but the original is good. 2 carbs per serving, which is 2 tablespoons or 30g.Does this hypothetical situation include no veggies? Tried paleo, but failed because I found it too restrictive. Saw that I could have cheese on keto and there was basically one rule: no more than 20g net carbs. It was way easier to stay committed to. I was pretty much on a low fat diet my whole life. When I added fat back in my mood and brain functioning improved almost immediately. Very noticeable to others, especially my husband! I'm a straight dude and all I have to say is Hellooooooo. So its Friday, and I hit 207 at 6'0" like you as well!  Then I see you posted a picture of yourself running a marathon.  I'll sit down now...Holy mother of God. You were adorable before, but like... damn. Losing all that weight might not have been fair of you. What are the rest of the guys gonna do to compete?! :P My brain was a huge part of my motivation to go keto &amp; KCKO too!You are kind of making a lot of excuses. You don't need to have any "keto friendly substitutes" in your diet - there are no subs for meat, cheese, fats, and veggies. If you are the type of person who can handle a regular cheat day, go for it. Personally, every time I cheat there is the potential for me to go off keto completely.You look fantastic!Meh, BPC doesn't really do anything for me. I'd rather enjoy the taste of my ground coffee.Went there last weekend for the first time and had a similar experience. You're not kidding about the lettuce wrap. I had to fork and knife that thing. Was amazing and will be going back!Oh lawd that looks like heaven.Items I buy when I'm a bit poor.

1. Eggs, at times I've eaten 6-8 eggs/day.
2. Cheap chicken cuts, thigh, legs, whole birds, and liver.
3. Pork can be had for $2-3/lb. Make it in a crock pot.
4. Frozen broccoli, generic 1 lb for $0.99. Cauliflower by me runs 1.29, still not bad.
5. Discount grocery stores for produce and spices. Go for ethnic stores rather then us stores. I've found Asian/Mexican/Indian markets have more produce variety for cheaper. Even in a mainstream grocery store spices will cost a fraction in the international section.
6. Spend some money on fat sources. Buy when you have the money and it elevates the meal when poor.

When out of money I usually skip some of the darlings of keto. Bacon, beef, cheese and dairy can all be pricey.  I did it for 28 days last year. All of February, just meat and butter. Best I've ever felt.Oh my goodness I love your dress! And even better - it looks fantastic on you! Congratulations, and fantastic job :)I tried Atkins years ago and couldn't stay on it. I hate high protein diets. Shifting to high fat made all the difference. Agreed with all of this. To add, if you NEED to "cheat" to celebrate your birthday, do it. Whatever. It's your dirty thirty. I had a few slices of King Cake for Mardi Gras over the past week. I didn't eat over maintenance, and it did me no favors, but I sure as hell enjoyed it.

Think long-term. Keep focused on the end goals. Commit to your own excellence.I read Fat: The Weight Loss Secret by K.D. Joseph almost three years ago. I started adding fat and cutting carbs. Last February my husband's mother passed away. She was not overweight but ate a very high carb low fat diet. I began doing some more research on the benefits of eating a high fat diet, led me to lchf, then keto. The first day I read about keto, I began my journey. But what exactly does "balanced" mean? I think it should mean whatever diet makes your metabolism work the best and whichever one keeps you the healthiest. I guess that's for everyone to decide for themselves.I created an account just to say this exact same thing is happening to me. I started keto in May of 2014, lost 60 pounds in a few months then fell off. I never gained any weight back, but never lost either. In around September I started doing lazy keto + calorie counting for a couple months and saw no further results so I got strict with it. Since December I've been doing keto and IF on a 23-1 schedule. I use a food scale and log/weigh/track everything I consume. I have not exceeded 1100 calories in a day since before December. I don't put anything in my body except water when I am fasting. I am VERY meticulous about it. And I have not lost any weight in months. Nothing. I have NO IDEA what is going on. I am currently 5'0" and 215 pounds. So I have a lot of excess fat to lose, but it is going nowhere. No idea what is wrong.Matt Lauer?Try reducing your deficit to 20% and see how your body responds.

Another experiment you could run is to avoid consciously restricting calories for a week. Instead, eat enough protein + fat that you are no longer hungry. Track your consumed macros and calories and see if you are eating at a calorie deficit or not just by following your hunger.I may not always eat ketogenic, but I think LCHF is a healthy diet for me and I feel more awesome when I don't eat a lot of carbs.

You can definitely eat more veg than spinach and romaine right now. Broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, bell peppers, cucumber, kale, zuchini, swiss chard, and cabbage are all great. In controlled amounts, tomato, carrots, onion and turnips.

When you're in the swing of things, have some fresh berries. They're full of fibre.

As /u/anbeav said, you can just use keto to help you lose weight; eating high fat makes it easier to eat less calories in general. But ketosis has other benefits and I don't think the 'normal' diet provides optimal health for most people, but especially not for carb-sensitives/diabetics like myself.

My ideal way of eating is mostly keto with the very occasional serving of rice/bread/pasta/potato, but not several servings of all four in a day like I might eat on a high carb diet.Absolutely. We hate shock diets here.Yes, I know how you feel! Sometimes it's easy to forget how far you've come. But take a moment and really reflect on how much better you are doing now than before. There were a couple of times I found myself being frustrated, and my husband was dear enough to point out the obvious (that I couldn't see).Incredible work, man! I'm in the same exact boat as you, on that last leg of keto but I've hit a stall myself. I feel so much better though. I have so much energy, so much more motivation, and my outlook on life has never been this positive. Good luck on the rest of your journey, and make sure you post when you get those last 25 pounds down!&gt;Seriously though, in 30 years of being unhappy, unhealthy, and unable to change, I never thought I would find a way of eating that was so natural. Every dietary change I had ever tried up until I found keto was a constant battle - a battle against hunger, and a battle against being even more unhappy and exhausted trying to just eat like a normal person.

Ditto! Your transformation is amazing and inspiring. Thank you for sharing!Is this not a strong argument for all around nutritional balance with calorie restriction/counting, instead of shock dieting?Fedora tipper, to ladykiller. Nicely done.the five guys close to us close. still mourning the loss!Awesome progress!

Where does one procure this Hotel Chocolate?See at 5'8, I would be completely underweight at 130 BY A LOT. Just from that alone, I would probably guess 35-40% body fat is probably not out of the realm.

But so what? You just keep on keeping on,  and the weight will go! Working out isn't required, so don't let that defeat you, though I really have never met anyone who was sorry they got into fitness. Skating is great for the legs! Try out a yoga class, or even a dance class. Whatever gets you up and out!Looking great! I have a hotel chocolate in my town. Their 100% dark chocolate is lovely dipped in almond butter &gt;If you wonder whether it's possible to sustain eating this way, I can tell you that it is.
&gt;I have sustained eating under 50 g carbohydrates per day on about 90% of the days since June 2011, and over 95% of the days since June 2012. I have settled in to one big meal per day, and have virtually eliminated the mindless eating that used to plague me. It might not work for you, but you owe it to yourself to try.

I love hearing this, thank you!How far into Keto are you?

Try to avoid taking PPIs if you can stand it. They cause rebound effects after long-term use.Generally it is suggested to avoid fatty foods because they take longer to leave your stomach, meaning your acid levels are raised significantly for longer.

It makes sense, but I wouldn't say that it is a cause specifically.I see a net gain of 70 lbs between those two pictures.  I can relate. I suggest limiting your deficit to your BF% for men.Ah, you bring up a good point. I do not intend to go back to eating more calories than I expend, just planning on eating a "balanced" diet with emphasis on fresh fruit and veg, lean proteins. I know where you are coming from, I can only eat the same meals for a few days without tiring of it. Though I could eat pizza or velveeta shells and cheese forever.

Take an afternoon of a weekend and make your normal food for your week, but spend a little extra time making a bunch of emergency meals. These are for the times when you know you aren't going to want to cook, or just don't have the time... busy days.

Things like bacon cheeseburger patties, a couple of chicken thighs and veggies, any casserole pre-portioned. So on and so forth. Make sure whatever you choose to make, its something you enjoy, so you will actually eat it. Freeze these for later use.

An even simpler method is crockpot cooking. Just toss everything in there and let it do the work. Pulled pork, pot roast, chicken thighs, buffalo chicken, etc. There are tons of recipes out there for this. A lot of these aren't very high fat, so you will have to supplement, but its super easy.

Hope this helps!&gt; For some heartburn gets worse before it gets better.

Mine definitely did.That'll show em!You were hot as a big lad too Keto gave me a bit of heartburn too. My 3rd week was pretty painful.

Lately, though, no issues. KCKO, as they say.Congrats! You look great! So inspiring!You look amazing. Congrats!lol, order a triple next time. Do not break eye contact with them.Sorry I'm late to this post!

I've recently joined WW because my parents are going and they offered to pay so I figured I'd check it out.

Basically fruit and veggies are arbitrarily 0 pts just to encourage people to eat them; I guess I don't expect fat people to like fruit? The meeting leader did warn my dad about gorging on a bag of oranges and expecting to lose weight, which I appreciated. Starchy veggies (potatoes, corn, peas I think) are not 0, and neither are avocados, I guess for their fat content.

Fats have the most points naturally because they have the highest caloric density. Still, the points allotted to me is quite generous compared to the old system (I was previously on WW when I was 12) and I find it pretty easy to eat keto and stay within points (which basically ensures I have a decent caloric deficit going).

So the points system is pretty flexible. Though it's easier to just eat a bunch of 0 pt foods, it doesn't matter if I eat high point meals (due to being high fat) because I don't need to eat as often or to eat the same volume of food as a high carb eater.

That said, they *are* still very anti-fat when you hear the talks at meetings. Last time we talked about dining out and people complained that when you go to The Keg they put butter on your steak and that there's often butter on vegetables. They also complained that if you order without butter and salt (and she threw pepper in there too, but I don't know why) it's not as tasty (WELL DUH) so you might as well cook at home (I guess so you can use your Molly McButter instead?). The leader also advised we drink chocolate milk after working out (for the protein!). I nearly bit my tongue off that day. And I really wanted to go to the Keg.

Side note, at my first meeting, this older woman said she can't exercise too much because it affects her insulin levels. I don't know how long she's been diabetic but she is grossly misinformed. I didn't have the guts to tell her she's wrong though. I'm awkward.Me too. Honestly, when I first came across Keto it felt to me like yet another fad diet. The mainstream isn't completely there, yet, but I know seeing things like this is what helped me to give this a try. Now that I'm 40 lbs down, I'd say it's working.This is a biased audience but many use keto just to lose weight.

Experience transitioning off keto depends. Many transition to something else and maintain weight fine, others do not and return to keto. Nice. I'm doing the Oklahoma one, which is on the 16th I believe. We got a few people together, so it should be a good time! I assume I should bring along a pair of shoes that I'm ok with ruining?Holy... http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/641/298/448.jpgI get this like three times a week. All of my coworkers think I am going to keel over any day now. Well, you have at least three questions buried in there.  Many people like me must treat keto as a long term lifestyle because of overindulging on carbs for so long and messing up our metabolism. Your decision to reduce carbs and calories to lose a few pounds is fine, however you probably do not need to drop below 100g of carbs to achieve that goal.  If you have no intention of staying on the diet for perhaps 12 weeks and finding out what keto adaptation feels like for yourself, I do think that it is not worthwhile to adopt keto.Thanks. I can't do salad because it has to be basically finger food. Usually the only break I take is to get gas &amp; I eat while driving.Agreed!You say she wants a name, say primal. For late night snacks try a hard boiled egg or something.

I saw someone else recommended Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint, he's the big "primal" guy and he'll willingly eat a bowl of overnight oats from time to time even, so not as crazy "no grains ever" as paleo people... But still pretty anti grain. Especially wheat.

But most paleo/primal people are always throwing around the 80/20 rule, saying that if you eat paleo/primal 80% of the time you're good! Leaved room for the maybe twice a week deviation from the standard diet.Dayam, looks delicious.thanks! I tried to find something like this but missed it!I really love cheese, I tried 2 flavors, I didnt think it was really that great.  pretty strange texture.er muh geeeerdthanks!I'm moving to NY shortly, and I've been doing some research on different bug out bags! If I find anything else that is super keto friendly, I will let you know. I got so fat I broke the steering wheel in my jeep, twice.Good callYou look happy. :-) Congrats!Ketosis is a very beneficial state for your body to be in, whether you're eating at a deficit ( weight loss ), maintenance ( obvious ), or eating additional calories for gains.

As you reintroduce additional carbs and veggies, you will most likely leave Ketosis, however, depending on what you add and the amounts, you may re-enter Ketosis occasionally. As you leave Ketosis, or pop in and out at various time, you will re-gain the water weight...which could be anywhere from 2-10 lbs depending on how much your body holds.[here, check this out](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq)&gt; this is a pretty huge deficit over my maintenance.

Huge deficits are counterproductive and hunger is one of those reasons got it. how long does it take to get into ketosis?I've seen many stories of people losing a lot of weight on Keto. Then going back to what they did before and gaining it all back.  Unless you make lifestyle changes from what you did prior to the weight loss, you'll be right back to where you were.Thank you! I will search for some ED threads as well!

Good to know about the xxketo stuff :DMy scale: [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L6NTHU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)1 apple has roughly 25g of carbs.... Generally 20g is recommended per dayCongratulations.  You are right on schedule.  Most people have their underhanded carb cravings pop up about this time and they start to post about "forever" and "CKD" or how difficult it is for only themselves.

Stay with SKD for another two months.  Period. Errr, looks like you've got a little something on your wall in the fourth pic there....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJnszUbkTNE

Did you understand it when you read it? He clarifies here - if you eat too many calories, even he admits you will gain weight (which is obvious to everyone else, except those who misunderstand his point)

He says that if you don't eat carbs - really, the point he makes is if you don't spike your insulin - you would have to force feed yourself to eat more than you need. Which is, yes, a big part of why keto works well for so many, whether or not his theory on WHY is correct.My friend, that is a NSV, not a rant.  CONGRATS :DHow do you know how much protein and fat you have had if you aren't tracking your macros?  Lazy keto is fine if it's working for you, but if you don't hit your protein target, you risk losing muscle.  Too much fat, you risk going far over on calories.  Depending on your macros and your totals if you were tracking, you may or may not need more fat.  But if you are consistently hungry, that is where tracking and macros come into critical play.People may downvote me for this but...I started a Keto diet (Atkins) in 1999 when I was 21.  I dropped almost 1/3 of my body weight in about 9 months.  It was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I didn't know anything about calculators or macros - I just knew to avoid carbs and the foods that contained them.  My goal was to keep my gross carbs (not net carbs) under 30 grams per day.  I didn't worry about fat, protein, sodium, or any of that stuff.  I tended to eat fatty foods just because they were more tasty.  After about a month or two, the weight felt like it was falling off me daily.

My Point:  At your age and size, I wouldn't get too caught up in minutiae.  Just cut the carbs out for now.  Read food labels and it will start to become second nature knowing what you can or can't eat.   Crockpots are awesome for cooking a bunch of food at once that can last you days.  WOWZA!

Congratulations, man!  You're doing so good.  I'm glad this is working for you, and you're soooo close to your goal.

Keep it up!/r/leangains might be a program you're interested after your Keto journey.yes, I have been watching my blood glucose...because last time I tried keto I had a bad reaction and I'm a little nervous this time around...and trying to be more careful.  So far, my blood glucose has been ok.  I have also been tested for diabetes, and I am not diabetic or pre-diabetic. Absolutely, it's just nice to know information. That would definitely upset me.  It's basically like saying "ah, you aren't serious about it, have some cake".  I wonder if she would provide a gluten filled cake to someone suffering from celiac disease?  Just seems highly insensitive.  If it were an employee of mine, I'd find something they could actually eat, or give a gift card.  I'm sure she meant well, but very insensitive IMO.

But HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!thank you so much....I think this is where I have been going wrong! So would you recommend making my own broth to get more potassium?  I love Tom Kha Gai soup, it has coconut milk, chicken, veggies, etc. Also, chicken skewers are great without the sweet dipping sauce they often with. I will try that, thanks for the recommendation! &gt; After looking back at MFP, it looks like I could be getting more magnesium and potassium.  I will try that.  I am having a hard time getting those daily goals met, but might try a supplement.

Chipotle bowl: no rice/beans
Choice of meat + Cheese +Sour Cream

Jimmy Johns - Gargantuan Unwhich

Buffalo wings(unbreaded) from just about anywhere (better if you can check on the nutrition though)

Cooking - Cook up some ground beef add 1/4 cup prego sauce, sprinkle on a little parmesan cheese.

Alternatively keep it in a patty, add a slice of cheddar on top.
Bonus: Sautee some mushrooms (might be asking too much there but its totally worth it)

Grill a ribeye steak.

Microwave frozen broccoli 105 seconds. Microwave 1tblsspoon butter in a dish for 25 seconds. Dip broccoli in butter, yum.

Breakfast is a little tougher for me but here are my usuals
1: Hard boiled eggs and bacon (prepared in advance)

2: Spamm and Eggs (Spamm is surprisingly good when you pan fry it)


After looking back at MFP, it looks like I could be getting more magnesium and potassium.  I will try that.  I am having a hard time getting those daily goals met, but might try a supplement.Do you have a menu you could browse?

My go to is crispy duck which is often made without sugar but worth asking perhaps; runner up is usually Thai basil chicken with sauce on the side



Numbers are great, but more important to me is how I feel. I feel so much better. I have less general pain, breathing feels easier, I am more awake and energetic, and just generally in better spirits. I think this intangible benefit is the best part.Exactamundo!Yup, like they said, toss all of the foods you have that are full of carbs.  Don't try to fool yourself, just get rid of them.  What I do is (since I don't have time to cook during the week) is cook meals ahead on Sunday.  I will make a big roast beef and maybe some chicken breasts  in a slow cooker and munch on that during the week.  That way the food is there, I just have to heat it up and I don't want to waste it or my efforts, so that is what I stick to eating.  Even omelets will keep for 5 days in the fridge.  Definitely track!!!  OP, I will caution you if you use MFP, double check every entry against the labels or Google... The database is littered with thousands of wrong entries.  People that aren't watching carbs, just calories, many times enter 0 or make up a number.  Once you get a history going with correct entries you can pull them from recent items, but double check it all.  That is the one thing I really hate about MFP, no verification.  I've recently started using LoseIt as well, trying out a few different trackers, including PaleoTrack.  I use to use Sparkpeople, theirs is pretty good too.I took the tests somewhere else.

The new results after 4 days of beeing in keto but with no animal fat (olive oil, walnuts, veggies and avocado)

LDL-Cholesterol = 398 mg/dL
Triglycerides = 132 mg/dL
HDL- Colesterol = 45 mg/dL
Free-Testosteron = 28,03 pg/ml
Crotizol = 18,60
T3 = 69.00 ng/dl
T4 = 11.60 ug/dl

The weirdest thing I noticed is the HDL Cholesterol difference. From 95 to 45.
She's a newbie-you don't think you're being a tad judgmental? It's normal to have slip ups at first, you just have to keep going. Breakfast - coffee

Lunch - taco salad

Snack - almonds

Snack - protein shake with unsweetened almond milk

Dinner - vegetable and protein stir fry

Dessert - sugar free popsicle

Rinse and repeat. I'm resisting all except a square. So i'm not totally out of it. Can't limit myself completely or else i'll be miserable. And who wants that!? I got my sugar free stuff for back up if my craving is that much more. But this cake is like less than a food away from me, and the smell is intoxicating. Hence, my post. And the positive feed back helps immensely!Breakfast: designer whey smoothie from trader joes.  1 cup unsweetened vanilla  almond milk,  one scoop powder, add heavy cream if you want.
~4 net carbs, 150 cal plus however much cream you use.  Cream adds up fast,  be careful.

Lunch
Chicken and kale.
Preheat  oven to 375f for 20 min. Season chicken thigh to taste.  Bake thighs skin side  down on a rack with a drip pan for 17-20 min. If it's bone in, cook until done.
 Throw a handful or two of baby kale into a tupperware and drizzle with 1 tspoon olive oil, rice vinegar, and a tspn of soy sauce.
Top with 1-2 thighs.
~ 4-5 carbs

Dinner:  al pastor tacos
Preheat skillet and add a hearty handful of preseasoned al pastor meat from the latinomeat mmarket.  Toss in 2 chopped green onions.
Divide meat into halves and put into 2 clean cabbage leaves.
Top with cilantro and a smidge of chopped white onion. Hot sauce to taste.

~5-7 carbs.

Snacks
Take celery and a serving of cream cheese.  Celery gives that crunch and salt that you crave.   Cream cheese adds a bit of sweetness.

Dessert
1 oz raspberries ~7-10 berries
3 tblspns heavy cream whipped
 Top berries with whipped cream and enjoy.  I don't add sweetener to my cream because it doesn't need it.  I try to limit my artificial sweeteners because they make keto harder for me.

I live for that dessert.  I watch my calories just to have a decent amount of cream.

Edit: I made this last night and was in heaven.  It doesn't reheat well so don't make a week's worth.

Edit 2: I'm a pasta and rice fiend and got a manual food processor and a spirooli. Game changers, my friend. Game. Changers. I know. Since I know how Marzipan is made (and having all the ingredients at home) I hoped to get some delcious results by just substituting the sugar. It was horrible.

Well. take away the sugar and you have a delicious almond paste so I would say it's ok for a keto diet,of course if you only eat 20 grams tops.

Next time I'll have a sausage with my coffee.I really agree with taking measurements. My scale was barely moving down for weeks but I lost inches.Spinach, broccoli, asparagus, salad, broccoli salad, deviled eggs, cole slaw.  When I roast beef, I usually reserve the drippings and make keto gravy... then I add the chopped beef and eat it like a stew, with added herbs, perhaps some veggies, etc.I'm hearing that a lot from people who haven't seen me in a bit. Thank you!This looks like heart disease Broth and powerade won't get you to your electrolytes.  Really focus on getting in the recommended amount and I think you will feel better. you look a lot younger now, keep it up!You may want to go to Walgreens and just get a cheap blood glucose meter. Find out what your blood sugar's doing. You don't want to be hypoglycemic - that's bad.What helped me, knowing I had to almost completely change out any food in my place is not starting keto right at the first paycheck, but buying the food.  Spend your $7-10 dollars on the stuff you eat now for the week and buy $30 worth of Keto type foods, then next paycheck buy your $40 worth and start Keto.  You will have plenty of food to start and you can toss out or donate your remaining "Carby" foods to reduce temptation.Way to go!  Sometimes it's just seeing the side by sides that make us realize how far we've come. Congrats!From what I have seen, store bought broth has very little potassium and Powerade Zero has practically 0 potassium. You may need to pick up some lite salt and/or salt substituteI get mine almost al dente by pouring hot water in a bowl and leaving them in there for a minute or two with just a bit of salt and some boullion if i'm feeling adventorous. LOL, I was just going to say your diet didn't seem like it had much fatHave you considered a keto soylent? They save a lot of time as far as meal planning and prep - portable. I have keto chow for about 1/3 to 1/2 of my daily intake. I almost always have one for breakfast since I'm not a morning person and don't have a lot of time in the morning.

Lunch I'll either take a KC with me or a salad and/or some lunch meats - if I forget lunch and don't want to stop home, I'll get a burger without bun/sauce for lunch. Dinner is usually when I make food - my go-tos are having veggies I can steam or put into a salad, bacon and cheese go with a lot of things, steak is good, and so are other forms of meats prepared various ways.

Food for thought. The nice thing about KC and simplified keto fast food is that if I'm feeling burdened with life or something, I can auto-pilot with keto chow and basic low-carb friendly stuff. I call that predictable.Well anyone can gain weight on any diet, I can only eat 1400 calories a day to maintain weight, if I consistently eat over that, even by only 100 calories a day, I'll gain weight, slowly, but it would happen. Not twenty pounds in a month though, that's crazy, that's like 2350 extra calories a day. http://lowcarbediem.com/fat-bombs-recipes-atkins-ketosis/

Pretty much melt the ingredients together.  Use myfitness pal to create a decipe. Divide the batch evenly in a silicone candy dish or mini muffin tin. Keep frozen because the oils will be too soft if left out.  Usually let sit out for like 15 mins before you eat em to soften up a bit.

I work retail so I totally get the whole "surrounded by junk food" thing. I make it work though with cooking/eating take out. Here's my typical day.

Breakfast: Turkey bacon and egg omelette (very simple, you just need two eggs, turkey bacon, butter, and a skillet)

Lunch: (Chipotle) Chicken Salad with Double Chicken, Onions and Peppers, Sour Cream and a little cheese

Dinner: Grilled Chicken with buffalo sauce (read labels, some are low carb some are not)

Snack: Pepperoni Slices and Cheese Cubes

My diet is a bit higher on the fat side so I wouldn't recommend the snack every day. Try to use water as an appetite suppressor. Club Soda (seltzer) is also good for kicking soda. So the first step would be to get rid of anything non keto in your house.  That's going to make it much harder to "cheat" because instead of going to the cabinet in the kitchen you have to go to the store or a restaurant.  Even if you live just down the block from a store you're much less likely to stand up, put on shoes, get a coat, open your door, lock your door, get in your car (or walk down the street), etc etc etc

The next thing to do is to take care of the times when you're already out of the house - at work, whatever.  You need to PLAN some snacks.  You're hungry?  You can reach into your desk and grab your beef jerky or your almonds or you can stand up, walk to the vending machines, take out a dollar, etc.  If you HAVE food that's safe and okay to eat you'll likely do that.

The other thing is water.  Even though I plan my meals and snacks and my diet if I'm hungry outside of meal time I'll chug a glass of water and wait 15 minutes.  This takes a little discipline but I'm shocked at how often I'm actually thirsty instead of hungry.  Also, if I am still hungry after 15 minutes, I'll sometimes try a cup of tea or coffee instead of a snack - even an approved snack.  Caffeine can help suppress appetite. Will do! Thanks for the suggestions!Yes, I kept in my carb limit, just used keto-friendly food to get to my desired kcal level.  I think I had some extra fatty steak that night and a half cup of heavy whipping cream whipped up with berries.&gt; I'm a super picky eater and I don't like most crockpot meals because they mix everything together, and I'm kind of weird about my food touching.

Evidently I'm dating you, and coming from a farming family where crockpot/casseroles were the norm, it drives me up the wall (I'm also the cook, she doesn't like to cook at all)


She is a big fan of tacos and fajitas so I tend to cook up several pound of either the beef or chicken, that is easily stored in the fridge and reheated in portions throughout the week.   It reheats fine in the microwave as long as you use a lower power for slightly longer time, is easy to measure and in the Keto sense, I just have the taco/fajita meat as part of a big salad (measuring portions of course).


I also like to pick up the rotisserie chickens from the grocery store.   This keeps in the fridge and reheats easily as well, and depending on the size of the chicken I can get an easy 4-5 meals out of each one for a very nice price.

Packages of frozen veg (usually broccoli and cauliflower) are super easy to prepare in microwave or saucepan, for easy sides.   If I have time I've fried them in some bacon fat and added an ounce of shredded mozzarella cheese when plating.

Otherwise always have a package of salad greens available, with some good balsamic dressing (or whatever you like)

For snacks, I like to keep easy stuff available, like pepperoni sticks and cheese for easy fat/protein counting.Sounds about right. It only takes about 15 minutes. Weigh everything, take measurements and pictures, give it 2 more weeks, if no change  reassess Hmm. Apparently they have one next to where I work.
Open to the public, they charge $50 to use it. I don't know why it would.  Zero sugar/Zero carbs.  I drink brewed Green Tea everyday sweetened with liquid stevia and I am still losing weight.  Artificial sweeteners, they say, can make you crave sugar, but it doesn't for me. I haven't tried that, but I'll try pretty much anything at this point :D. Did you stay w/in your net carb limit that day or did you increase it a bit?Totally didn't think of that. (inches) I'll have to start tracking that! Thanks! Also, edited comment to include stats I have. :)If you're hungry you likely need to maybe estimate macros. What are your meals like?It's really tough not knowing what country you are in, what your likes/dislikes are, your stats and macros.  Access to kitchen, grill, etc. We can suggest meal plans all day long, but without knowing a lot of that info, we could just be wasting keystrokes.  Also, check out /r/ketorecipes

I use the weekends to meal prep for the week.  I will usually do a quiche or breakfast casserole.  I have tons of recipes if this is something you would be interested in.  I generally cook 2 large meal focused meals (I smoke a butt, brisket, chicken, turkey, ribs, etc), make a bunch of burgers, roast a bunch of chicken thighs, roast a chicken or beef roast.  Cook a bunch of sausages or bacon. Once you have the base protein, you can do a lot of things with that.  So the butt may go into just pulled pork, some might go into lettuce wraps, some for stew, some for ketofied pad thai, etc.  The burger I may crumble into some sauce on a bed of zucchini noodles.  The whole chicken may go into chicken salad, soup, chicken and gravy, chicken caesar salad, etc.  The chicken thighs I might make chick parmesan or cordon bleu.

Then I might make a bunch of deviled eggs, broccoli salad, zucchini noodles, cole slaw, barbecue sauce.  I make up a bunch of rollups (generally deli meat, thin layer of cream cheese, chives, garlic, rolled up.  I keep a full serving of each in a ziploc that I might munch on through the day.  I always have snack bags of pre-weighed pork rinds or nuts.  I try to generally have some SF Jello and heavy cream on hand in case I'd like something sweet.

There are just literally thousands of options... but you need to do this to fit your likes and comfort level.Height, weight, age, gender?

Food scale for everything? I just ask again as the definition of using a scale seems to vary from some things to all things. Are you weighing all things?

Body part measurements. You can lose inches while the scale isn't moving yup...me to.I don't know if I could have resisted that cookie cake. That's some next level strength there! I started Keto two days before my birthday so I feel your pain.Frozen (raw) burger patty in a skillet with the lid on - (takes ~10  minutes on mediumish heat, give or take), and a microwave bag of steamer veggies. "On the table" in 10-15 minutes. A go-to for us.Believe or know? Are you actively tracking? 1540 calories / day
15g net carbs
128.0 g fat
77.0 g protein

Yes to the food scale, not sure what you mean by measurements. Newbie post, so guess I left out pertinent info. :/You don't. It won't kick you out and ketosis anxiety is a waste of time. Focus on how you feel-hunger, satiety, cravings, energy, weight loss. If it makes you have cravings, regardless of whether you're in ketosis or not it sounds like not a good choice. If it doesn't affect how you feel it's an ok choice. Focus on the effect not ketosis itself Well I was 216 Sunday morning. I got back Monday night and weighed in at 222 on Tuesday morning and this morning I weighed in at 220 so in a few days I'll be back to 216! (:I do my tracking on FitBit. I have their smart scale so it automatically links it. I also use trendweight.com to help me improve my perspective. When you weigh yourself daily, the [little ups and downs](http://imgur.com/iDuwy4U) can get to you, but when you see the trend it helps me stay on track and get greater perspective.Thanks! Do you know how I would go about finding out if it kicked me out of ketosis or not?yes, I believe I am.
Full stats? Calories? Food scale? Measurements? Natural weight loss stalls usually last less than 4 weeks, longer is usually a calorie issue First off, fantastic progress so far, congrats!  Have you tried eating at maintenance for a day?  This helped me get past a stall, was eating 1800 kcals for several weeks and fluctuating with the same 1-2lbs, decided to eat 2400 kcals one day and woke up the next day 3lbs lighter.  Just my experience, YMMV.  Good luck!If it fits your macros, it's fine

Just FYI ketosis != weight loss, it could have kicked you out, not saying it did, but it could have and you still lose weight. Many get keto blinders and forget that ketosis is just ketosis, doesn't imply weight loss or gain.Relatively new to keto here, but congrats! You sound amazing and look it too!

What app do you use that provides that chart you linked to? Well yeah, your flair has you listed at 125 lbs.  Unless your four feet tall, that's pretty damn skinny.

Besides as well as keto may work, if you eat more calories in then calories out, you will still gain weight.Fucking adore your tattoo.I wouldn't worry about it. Your body does things, many are unexplainable. I get random stomach pains or muscle twitch, it's just the way it is. Unless it's persistent I wouldn't think too much of it. Also remember that not all that happens on keto is related to keto even if it started while on keto I usually don't keep track of macros except my carbs which I keep under 25. It is hard to get a estimate of my other ones because I eat my food from my university and some of the food places do not have nutrition facts. But I keep my meals keto friendly Ugh, I know. I love chocolate but I seriously despise dark. The struggle...Electrolytes? Are you following the guidelines?I'm too curious, how did it go? And did it take a long time?&gt; I must have read it somewhere that provided wrong information

I think a trap a lot of people can fall into is there are a lot of processed Peanut Butters out there that have sugar added to them.   So if your not reading your labels, it's easy to get a lot more calories/carbs from otherwise "healthy" peanut butter.The sidebar has a 6 day meal plan, but at the end of the day meal plan or not you make the choices, so you have to stay disciplined. Junk food doesn't just walk into your hand. Junk food is everywhere, we all can find it easily, doesn't mean we have to eat it. Commit to the plan and changing your habits. No it won't be easy, but embrace the challenge.

Learn to cook, it's easy and it gives you control and options. Make a meal plan or follow the plan in the sidebar, do it again next week, do it long enough to make new habits. Easy meals-scrambled eggs, frittata, baked egg cups, taco salad, chicken/tuna/egg salad, casseroles (cavemanketo.com), roasted chicken, deli meat and cheese roll ups

&gt; My dream for this thread would be for one person to suggest three meals and a snack for one day of the week, and then another person to suggest the same for another day, etc.

Why not instead you take control? You tell us three meals (skip the snacks) for everyday and make a plan and we comment on *your* plan

Make a casserole for the week, baked egg cups for breakfast, deli meat wraps for lunch, do it for a week, repeat with something eosec

When you're at your wits end you'll do it, we can help but the real work has to come from you. A plan helps but won't keep you away from junk unless you choose to not eat it.Thanks! :) Oh i'm definitely trying to give it away as much as possible. I cut out a tiny icing free square for me, and the rest for the masses. Thank you! I only have a couple of the chocolates, and it's gotta be a big sugar/chocolate urge. CANNOT eat a whole bag in one sitting. I think that'd be a disastuh:) thank you for the reminder. It's not the end of the world, but dang, this will power test is crazy!You look great! I was confused as well. She's super skinny, and didn't used to be. Soooo, i dunno? I told my mom to make a sugar free jello parfait instead of a cake lolThere is a 6-day meal plan in the sidebar - did you have a look at that?

Anyway, here's a day from me:

Breakfast: 2 boiled eggs, 3 strips of bacon. Coffee with 1Tbsp whipping cream.

Lunch: Chicken salad over lettuce.  Chicken salad is poached chicken breast mixed with herbs, mayo, and slivered almonds.

Dinner: Big ribeye finished with butter served over spinach. Roasted cauliflower on the side.  Roast the cauliflower with oil, lemon, and garlic.

As for snacks, I never snack any more.  See if you can manage without.6 day meal plan... located in the sidebar under Useful Links:

Slight small exceptions... but I won't let it overtake what I've already lost :)I took the tests somewhere else.

The new results after 4 days of beeing in keto but with no animal fat (olive oil, walnuts, veggies and avocado)

LDL-Cholesterol = 398 mg/dL
Triglycerides = 132 mg/dL
HDL- Colesterol = 45 mg/dL
Free-Testosteron = 28,03 pg/ml
Crotizol = 18,60
T3 = 69.00 ng/dl
T4 = 11.60 ug/dl

The weirdest thing I noticed is the HDL Cholesterol difference. From 95 to 45.

Marzipan is packed full of sugar and carbs, I doubt it would fit into any macros.


There's also alternatives to erythritol, try experimenting. They can't all be winners!This happens to me when I detox from diet soda, too... About 15 minutes of incline treadmill walking.  I've got bad knees. Supposed to be within 2%It's happened twice now. Random days with random food. I don't think it's triggered by a specific food per se, maybe an odd reaction from my body? Curious if it happens to others on keto. All the more reason to buy salami this weekend!No cardio?Googled it, interesting. Would love to try one. Any idea on the accuracy of something like this?No, it's a measure of lung capacity, but it's fun to pretend it's farts. Wondering if you have even read his book? Congrats! I also had my first whoosh yesterday! High five!!!!! Isn't it the best feeling? &gt; I lift rather heavy 4/7 days a week and after every session I take a protein shake immediately afterwards.

I recommend adding 2-4 TBSP of heavy cream or 1-2 TBSP peanut butter to your protein shakes if you're hungry, that should help you with satiety Tuna salad on lettuce wraps are easy. He should be able to figure this one out, assuming he can operate a can opener. A block of kerry gold &amp; a spoonSo far none of these people truly understand your father.

Luckily I'm here for you. I don't like cooking, anything at all. I've broken up with girls who don't cook and most of my meals are at/from restaurants. Its not that home cooking is hard its just incredibly boring, time consuming and expensive.

Since starting keto the only thing I find tolerable is baking bacon which I do everyday. tinfoil on a baking sheet, put bacon on sheet, put in oven turn on oven and come back 15mins later and eat bacon. Lol is that what that means? I did 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a glass of water. Felt normal in 20 min. Awesome! I typically use 2 tubes a day when I'm first starting keto and it seems to always keep the keto flu away! Bod pod 5 day routine

Monday - Chest
Tuesday - Back
Wednesday  -  Shoulders
Thursday - bi/tri
Friday -  legs

If you want more detail I have my plan on jefit I can probably upload a link. When you say your protein levels are higher than fat... that might not be a problem. 110g protein and 100g fat is 440 protein calories and 900 fat calories... meaning if that was your only food you'd be at a 66% fat intake.

I'm usually at ~190g protein, ~125g fat, ~30g carbs per day and it works fine for me, still definitely in ketosis.Embrace the douche pic my friendREAL tomato ketchup on those ribs Eddie?Do it! It's scary at first but after the first week you start seeing all the benefits! Just give it a shot. I told myself ok 2 weeks to try it and after the first week I was like well screw 2 weeks I'm doing this for a lot longer!! (I did my research for about a week prior of starting so that helped with the scary part some too.)I like how you think.None of those are certainties, and definitely don't follow a timeline. you could just be more lenient when you go out with friends.  low carb could still work for you even if you don't stay in ketoStay strong. If you fall off the horse get back on. It's a marathon, not a sprint.I feel like I have a good control on my cravings...Im in my best friends wedding in 10 months and I can't afford to not do this. For me, having that piece of chocolate at the end of the day satisfies my sweet tooth.

I work in a restaurant so I go through my 12 hour shifts wanting a fry here or the rest of the milkshake I just made or soda(!!!) but at the end of the day when i have that piece of chocolate...all the waiting is worth it.  Nice work!That's awesome! :-)I heard arrowroot powder is a great sub for flour as a thickener.Thank you!!!!! I ran out and grabbed this, especially for my son! &lt;3Yes, but what do you put it on? I think I'd rather just eat the chocolate.. hahaI keep hearing fat bombs....what do i do? blend all that up?Few people can eat like shit, work out, and still keep weight off.

Very *many* can do almost nothing, diet well, and still lose weight. I learned this first hand doing keto with almost no exercise. What was your workout routine prior?What are your macros? Few people need fat bombs

Store-bought fat bombs-avocado, nuts, oils, butter, meat, cream; keep it simple a Keto friendly coleslaw :) Creamed spinach or kale is my go to sides with meat.
Thank you!I think this timeline would more resemble a complicated spider web. The keto experience doesn't really fit a timeline, a consistent finding, keto flu usually sucks on day 4 otherwise people are so different that these variables will be all over the mapActually there is mini-fridge downstairs. We use it for water -.-Look for things like ground beef around 83%-85% lean instead of 93% or more; if you don't mind cleaning chicken, usually cuts with the skin on and bone in are cheaper. Alternate veggies based on what's on sale this week or that. Lots of eggs.

Best place to shop is wherever you can find deals, which depends on where you are. For example I know I can get my produce pretty cheap at the local farmer's market, but I prefer to go to ShopRite grocery stores for other things due to the savings. They list their flyer online every week too so I can plan ahead.Congrats!! I'm brand new to Keto and seeing your pictures are inspiring me to keep this going.  You look even more beautiful! Two two-liter bottles of farts inside your body.The past two or three weeks I've actually noticed myself in the mirror at the gym.  I find myself comfortable being without a shirt.  Never have either of these things been true in the past.

KCKO keep it up I guess the nice thing about a cake is it can be shared with everyone else. Give it away - I'll sure there will be lots of takers at the office :-)

Happy birthday!How did you generate these figures?That explains the clogged pipes Now that you're back on keto, what does your weight look like?  Did the loss of water weight bring you right back to where you were?Thanks, I had forgotten about that part.Wait a second ...I thought ketosis made it so the fat on your body is burned, but any extra just runs through you?

/sKeto is a wonderful way to reduce body fat and all around feel better. On the sidebar, you can also find a keto calculator that can help you work out what your macros should be for weight loss (how many grams of carbs, fat, and protein). What's your gender, age, height, starting weight, goal weight?Yes. I feel hungry frequently Read this from the FAQ
____________
What will my weight loss progress look like?

Results vary, but you will typically go through three phases
1.Honeymoon: Lots of weight comes off fast. This is water that was tied up with glycogen. Note: if you dont experience rapid weight loss in this period, do not despair. Not everyone is so lucky, and men may be more likely to see rapid initial weight loss than women.
2.Keto Adaptation: Water and glycogen find a new balance and this causes a stall or even weight gain, which lasts for a week or two. Relax, this is both normal and temporary.
3.Fully keto-adapted: After 3-4 weeks the body is burning fat as its main fuel and the brain has switched to running on ketones. A bumpy downward trend in your weight will begin. The trend is "bumpy" because there will be days or weeks when your weight stalls, or even goes up slightly. This happens to everyone, on every kind of weight-loss diet. Please dont post to /r/keto that you gained a pound or two, or plateaued for a week. The trend will be especially bumpy if you are female. In particular, shark week will play hell with your scale weight.
I agree! To be aware of the way someone prefers to eat and then buy them a cake...I'm not on the same machine where I was yesterday so I don't have the same result in Google. But if I pick 1 ounce (28g, close to the 24g that would be 3 packets) here, it shows 4g: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/foods-from-taco-bell/6486/2

I see 0g on Taco Bell's site also, but given that it's thickened with corn starch I don't think it can really be 0g. I'm not sure of the rounding rules for labeling small quantities on the single serving (1 packet).It looks good.

I would discuss it with your parents so they don't eat your food, seems simple enough.  I check out my guns on the regular.  Don't feel bad about it :PJust add it to make food and drinks palatable not really sweet Just FYI you can gain weight on keto. Insulin is not the entire story of all weight gain or loss I had the increase of heart rate at first. It goes away. But make sure to get enough electrolytes. Especially salt and drink tons of water.I'm sure she had the best intentions, but that would bother me. My family was kind enough to not buy me a cake when I asked them not to for my birthday last Friday.Carl's Jr. has a great chicken club that you can get with breaded or grilled.  I just get a grilled version, take one piece of bread off and use the other to help me hold the darn thing, then eat around it.  Chicken+veg+mayo+bacon+cheese... delicious!Oh man, I can't fucks with sugar alcohols in those sugar free chocolates. I'm glad you can!

Edit: forgot to say happy birthday!The crazy thing is I worked out a bunch before I started keto.  Recently I've been too busy so that was all diet.  I only do this when fish isn't outrageous but I like blackening salmon. It's my lazy food and fish is my effing FAVORITE.

 Blacken your salmon on both sides with a seasoning blend of your choice first! Preheat your oven to 400. While that's happening, set your stove to medium. Heat up a nonstick pan (or a cast iron skillet) with JUST enough olive oil to coat it. Put your blackened filet skin side up and cook it for only about a minute, then do the same to the other side! Pop it right into the fully preheated oven after that (skin side down). You can either use a very lightly oiled baking sheet or if you used a cast iron skillet, just pop that sucker in. I cook mine for no more than 10 minutes if it's about an inch thick at the fattest part of the filet, my rule of thumb is 5 minutes for every half inch for reference. Take it out and you're done! All in all it's about a 12 minute active time!

I hope this was simple enough :x I went from cooking never to cooking every single day when I moved out so I might have a weird perception of how easy something is. It does taste good though :) Good luck to your ketodad!

ETA: time!if possible, you could get a mini fridge to store your food items if your family won't leave it alone in the main fridge....

Use a database app like LoseIt! or Myfitness Pal... lots of foods are already input into the system and all you have to do is search them and add them to your log. I personally love LoseIt! because it has all kinds of charts and a majority of the database items are correct (even scanned barcode items). Plus you can set it to store an unlimited amount of foods that you have eaten so it never forgets. Once you start building your log, it gets easier and easier to log every day.It sure is! I'm thrilled and know that without unreasonable expectations I'll be able to maintain and stay healthythose results are awesome. the end.I'm not OP, but for me it's just a lot of curling... bacon towards my face.Well done.  I'm at the 11 month mark, and 48 pounds down, so were almost on the same schedule.  To me there isn't anything "slow" about that pace. Don't get jaded by the fact that some people lose super fast on keto.  By any other diet's standard, a pound a week is fantastic.Are you hungry all the time?  If you aren't then you don't need more fat.I used to live in Southern California with an Avocado tree. So nice. Now I'm in the Midwest. I rely on Costco. My favorite way is grilled with salt n lime n salt.  That's awesome.  Just curious, what does your exercise routine look like?Never seen a malasada before, but now I want oneAwesome, easy to focus on that.

But....how long until I notice a difference? I work out virtually daily. I envy your willpower if you can stay on Keto on your birthday, that cake looks delicious Pork shoulder in a crock pot + water + vinegar + pepper + cumin, 8 hours on low, pull out of liquid and shred, squeeze lime juice, mix.   Three days or more of lunch/dinner.  Add Mexican blend cheese and sour cream with a side of avocado.  Top with eggs for breakfast.  Roll in big leaf of lettuce for a 'burrito'.  Add to chicken stock and green onions for soup... the options go on and on.I'm actually contracted so I get paid hourly, but wages might be higher. I don't really know anything about the economy in Brazil. It would be fun to have an adventure down there sometime. What about veggies during the week, out of curiosity?salami has fat to spare, it can handle itNo shame in your game! I've only been doing keto a week and some change and I caught myself looking at my waist today, like, "Damn, this is working!" Also I live with my boyfriend who is a gym fiend and I see him flexing in the mirror for forever after a workout, so I assume this is common :P

Keep killin' it, dude! You're doing great!Since I've used a scale, I have no problem maintaining loss.

I'm at normal bmi now per the charts, but once I dropped 50lbs, it became hard to budge.

I am 0 carb except for Saturday's with a single meal that has up to 100 grams, for some reason I am always lighter on Sunday.Instead of eliminating try adding from nothing. Go zero carb, meat and butter only, then add things one at a time.

If you don't react well to certain vegetables, there are plenty other to choose from along with significant evidence that they aren't even necessary for good health.

As for dairy and chocolate, pay attention to not only the cow part but the way it is prepared and additives since they could be an issue too.ttespots represent! Too bad they screwed over PrimeFace, legs, shoulders, wrists, chest, waist, butt. In that order.You are following the diet advice of a guy with a degree in journalism, looking to sell a book.

The mayo clinic and many other sources will tell you that calories are the most important thing when changing your weight.

http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/weight-loss/in-depth/calories/art-20048065Agreed- 5 days' worth of carbs in one day isn't a good indication of being ready to truly kick off keto, IMO.  Imagine eating 5 days worth of fat, protein or calories.  Yikes!You are looking at it backwards. If he is claiming that calories do not cause weight gain, he has to present evidence that they do not. He would, naturally, not be providing evidence that they do, so you wouldn't see it. However, an overwhelming preponderance of empirical evidence, even without worrying about the science, shows that eating a lot of calories will cause you to gain weight.Read the FAQ in the sidebar to the right, then post again if you have any additional questions. Yes I know that,  read my title again Awesome job!Well... I haven't listened to his book, but I doubt that is what he is saying. Insulin isn't the only hormone which is relevant here, and you CAN DEFINITELY gain weight by eating too much keto food.

The diet isn't magic, your body is still a reactor, input = output + accumulation. You have to account for efficiency in the input part, but if you eat 1000 calories of pure fat above what you need, even in perfect ketosis, you will gain weight.Way to go dude! Keep it up!* 1949 kcal Goal, a 20% deficit. (1252 min, 2436 max)
* 25g Carbohydrates
* 140g Protein (104g min, 171g max)
* 143g Fat (66g min, 197g max)

That's what I'm getting when I set it do sedentary.

Honestly, I'm probably going to have trouble keeping track of all that I eat like the specifics of everything. I'm afraid if I do a meal prep Sunday, my food will get eaten (full time student living in parents house) I could probably talk something over with them but still.
Years ago I had lost 45 pounds on the Atkins plan, and kept them off for 5 years.  I came off it big-time - on a long cruise.  I gained 15 pounds in 17 days.  Sam's club roasted red pepper.  It was fairly low carb so that's why I chose it.  It was good. And how he is 100% incorrect? All the information he presented in his book does not provide any evidence that calories are the main cause of weight gain.Thanks you guys...I am so excited to find this site!  Now I don't feel like I am all alone on this endeavor.No it won't stall you out. It might make you crave sugar, though. For me, I use sweeteners in my coffee and have since I started keto cause I don't like coffee without sweetener. Do what works for you, there's no "rule"Everyone is different, some people report that sweetener affect weight loss and/or increase hunger or cravings, for most they do not, you'll have to see if they affect youTo get started, set activity to sedentary, you can try at 25g but many start off at &lt;20g carbs. I'd increase your protein to 140g also.Any particular brand ? He is 100% incorrect.

Manipulating your insulin may allow you to eat a bit more or less and not gain weight, but calories are the driving factor behind weight change.

Keto is a great tool for losing weight, but it isn't magic, you still need a caloric deficit to lose fat.Even if you exercise, set it to sedentary, set deficit to 20%, set protein to 137 grams

Keto is just food - meat, seafood, low carb vegetables, nuts, cheese, oils, butter, cream, eggs, avocado

Meal ideas - http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/o6vei/here_it_is_the_unofficial_tell_me_what_to_eat/

Keep it simple, try not to think of keto as particularly special, yes an entire macro group is limited but I just cook and exclude the carbs so don't limit yourself to keto-specific recipes - lettuce wrapped burgers, deli meat and cheese wraps, scrambled eggs, omelet, quiche, frittata, stir fry with cauliflower rice, salsa chicken with cauliflower rice, taco salad, fajita lettuce wraps, roasted chicken with asparagus, salmon with spinach and Hollandaise sauce, zucchini noodles with ground beef and marinara sauce, steak and mashed cauliflower, casseroles (Cavemanketo.com), mashed avocado and tuna, green salad with steak or chicken and dressing, pulled pork, braised chicken thighs, soups, stews, chili, pot roast, chicken cordon bleu, pizza chicken with pepperoni and sausage, sausage and peppers, cabbage and sausage, parmesan crusted chicken and broccoli, stuffed pork tenderloin, stuffed mushrooms or peppers, baked cod with tomatoes and feta, collard greens with smoked turkey or hamListening to Gary Taubes book, calories actually do not cause weight gain. Its the insulin that causes weight gain. If you manage your insulin secretion with food you will not gain weight. For me it seems like sugar cause a large release of insulin which then gets stored in my fat cells but my body is handling carbs better than sugar.
I think they are fine as well, in moderation.  They are definitely the bastard child of the nut world, but only because they aren't nuts, so people always gasp that you are eating legumes on a low carb diet.  But they work fine for many people.for some people, it's a slippery slope that makes them lose control! Sure you can experiment, find what works for you, but stay alert, you might not want to end up full carbs!That's like almost double the price. Yeah I didn't take a picture but there is sauce on if. $40/week is fine.  Last week I picked up a few boston butts for @$12 each, they were 10 lbs each, plenty to feed me for the week.  Big giant bag of broccoli, salad, etc. Few pounds of ground beef.  Value packs of chicken thighs.  Some butter, eggs, bacon.  You should be able to get all the above for $40 and have plenty of food.Good job, i started my keto again about 2 weeks, didnt Weight myself yet, but the last time i did keto, i went down line 10kgs in a month.  Keep going !It wasn't the same bowl as the cantina bowl, but it was like the same size as the nachos but a bit bigger. Are you getting enough calories? Something that I find with keto is that you don't feel hungry. Seeing as you are active, you may be burning a lot more calories than you are ingesting, which would make you feel tired (as you lack the energy provided by calories) Just ask! They'll give it to you no problemI ordered from there like this twice so far and I didn't get any "huh?" Or "what?" from them. Chicken is the same price as the steak here, and the ground beef is 80 cents. Someone told me the ground beef has around 2 net carbs per serving, but I'm still way under my daily limit. As for the bowl, just ask for it!

How I ordered:

Fast food intro salutations

Can I get two sides of steak, a side of guacamole, a side of sour cream, a side of three cheese, and a side of pico? And can you put all that in the same bowl? Thank you. Guilty here as well... and every time I read it, I see it again.Calories caused your weight gain.

A piece of bread may have 100-200 calories in it.

An ice cream cone may have 700-800 calories

Carbs also increase the waterweight stored in your body, so some weight gain could just be water retentionNot strange. You should be proud.

I have 2 mirrors in my bathroom. I'm liking the one that gives me the nipple up view more and more. The one on the door that gives me the whole body view, I still avoid looking at.You need to spend a week eating 20g carbs or less. You will feel hungry at first but then it passes. Having a 100g carb day on day 2 is ridiculous, you either do keto or you don't, you can't be half hearted with it or it won't work.At one point I worked in a pub / taphouse chain restaurant, on the menu was an item called "Steak Bites".  It was cubed steak that we'd deep fry for 20-25 seconds (have to have them medium or above based on appearance), and then served with a chiptole mayonnaise.20 pounds? That's not hard at all... That's a 4400 average over a month. That's an extra few slices of pizza or an extra half entree from Cheesecake Factory a day.With you there too! 283 down to 245!!Weight loss is not linear, marathon not a sprint, you can often stall for 2-4 weeks and that's normal. Count your calories accurately with a scale and be patient. The only veg prep I do is my zucchini noodles... I sweat them and drain them prior to putting them up.  I put them in a tupperware container with a few paper towels on the bottom.  No, never a problem... 4 days later they are fine.  I don't make salad ahead of time... I've done mason jar salads with some success, but for me, salad is quick so I don't really bother with it.  You could cut some veg ahead of time if it helps.  Generally while I'm heating up my dinner, is when I prepare my veggie.  I'm not the one judging.

You're just being mean and rude.

I happen to think you're incorrect, and you happen to think I'm incorrect, but you're the one turning it into an ad-hominem attack.

There's no need to be rude or unfriendly here, so please take your attitude to someone else who feels like dealing with it.

Thanks.Right, I guess my point is that relying on one single food to make you feel less deprived in a diet is not really sustainable, the way you eat shouldn't make you feel deprived. Though perhaps some time without dairy will allow you to change your mindset about how you feel eating keto and be beneficial in that way as well. grilled nuggets at chick fil a, grilled chicken strips at jack in the box, grilled chicken breast at mcdonald's, KFC grilled chicken, boston market is great - and just about every single grocery store deli has rotisserie chicken :)
Lose the sugar all together and your gut will be gone. ALL TOGETHERHa! You got me!!Do you get sufficient iodine in your diet?I would see someone else, this sounds quite atypical, unrelated to keto and not sure related to any of these foods. You might try a complete elimination diet like Autoimmune Paleo Protocol. The only thing I grill actually "done" is chicken.  I eat pork medium and beef very rare.  If you cover the items and use a lower power level on the microwave, you should be fine.  Add a little chicken/beef stock to the container to keep it moist.Yes, I have upper-normal levels of thyroid. I should have mentioned these things; please see the edit to my OP.Sorry  I should have mentioned these things. Take a look at my edit at the bottom of my OP.I have a long history of yo-yo dieting and restriction is usually difficult for me. On keto it's mostly not. I don't usually feel deprived, but one of the reasons I don't is because the full fat dairy products are very rich and satisfying. Sort of the way people feel about bacon I guess (which I also enjoy)--it's decadent in a way... so it is not only physically satisfying, but psychologically as well.Peanuts are fine for keto - not if you're zero carbbing, but its fine.  I eat them nearly every day.  I can't eat tree nuts so I use peanuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds for the additional fats and as a nice snack.
Peanuts have long been the bastard child of the "nut" world - well - they're finding out that they're actually quite nutritious, just like tree nuts.
You do have to watch your carbs.  Stay away from the honey roasted and just go with the salted and roasted.
Interesting! But I guess your salaries are higher anyway! In the end you can save lunch money but we are forced to use it for lunch =(&gt; My question is, what can be causing this issue for me?

My question is, have you seen a doctor? It could be something else completely unrelated I know what you mean; I find myself eyeing my biceps when I'm doing curls. Like, holy cow, there's a muscle under there!I've been worried especially about veggies.  You didn't have any problem with the zucchini getting gross? Because I've been wanting to try zucchini noodles! Also have you ever tried to prep salad? I know a lot of people do it but how do you keep the cut up veggies from getting old? Some people say mason jars help keep it sealed really well.  What's been your experience?So happy I read this post! Found out I have a menchies nearish to me!! I have been wanting froyo so bad lately, and actually ended up getting a sugar bomb from cold stone last night because I couldn't find any good froyo near me. Now I feel like garbage! Can't wait to try menchies next time I'm getting a hankering for the stuff, thanks!Nearly same stats too. 5'9, starting at 287. Down to 272 after 1 month. I hope to join you ladies at 30lbs down soon!An article that might explain why I asked.  http://www.marksdailyapple.com/cruciferous-vegetables-hypothyroidism-sprint-frequency-protein-sources-orthodox-lent-saunas/#axzz3W6wkepw0Could be both and that's okay.Yes. Yes, I think I have to make these tonight.If your body wasn't retaining a lot of water for whatever reason, there is no water weight to lose. Without water weight, you'll lose weight as your caloric deficit dictates. At a moderate 15% deficit for someone as small as yourself, it could take weeks to see a reliably measurable difference on the scale. By comparison, some of the larger keto'ers might lose a pound every two days on a 15-20% deficit simply because for them a 15-20% deficit represents a daily deficit of 1000 calories.Out of curiosity, have you had your thyroid checked?What do you guys think of these tortillas from trader joes?
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ELDR_Z9rxUU/T-zQkC3NNSI/AAAAAAAAAGE/GQGpT8OCRjM/s1600/low+carb+wraps.jpgI definitely agree!  Again, sorry you felt offended, it was not my intention, but I can be a smart-ass sometimes and it doesn't come across as well in the written word.  Have a great day!I love the way grilled meats taste and they are great reheated too!You can do it, Z! I reheat pretty much everything in the microwave. Some stuff works better than others, but imo, you just have to reheat in short increments and check it often so that the toughness or dryness doesn't happen.I have to be pretty careful with dairy.  I go through periods where I don't have any.  You could use ghee for cooking.  Try using full fat canned coconut milk rather than cream.  There are plenty of ways to remove dairy and still be full on keto.  If you are worried about whey protein, try pea protein... there are brands that have 1g or less carbs.  Make your own dairy free yogurt with coconut milk.  There are plenty of ways to eliminate or reduce dairy to suit your needs and comfort.  Good luck!!Thanks! I love the dichotomy of a grown man who hunts and fishes, but takes a gummy bear multivitamin.I misread your title as, 'eating myself out' and thought: ewwwww.I've been keto for almost 3 years now. I stay keto cause when I cheat with carbs I can feel those old cravings coming back. The fat man isn't dead he's just in a cage waiting for me to let him out.Stir fry. Bacon and eggs. Meat + cheese wraps. Anything you can make in a crockpot all day. the dark meat stays pretty moist, but the breasts still get a bit crumbly, but still really good. I actually used some of the breast for my daughter's meal and what I did with hers was add some shredded cheddar and some real bacon bits to it in a bowl, nuked it, then added a couple tablespoons of ranch dressing (to add moisture). She loved the stuff!Your dad can likely learn a few simple cooking skills and can make a ton of meals within a 10-20 minutes.  All of these ideas require basic skills and are super easy -

Scrambled eggs, quiche, frittata, baked egg cups, lettuce wrapped burgers, roasted chicken, deli meat and cheese lettuce wraps, taco salad, green salad with steak or chicken and dressing, pizza chicken (bake chicken breast, sauce, toppings), steak and mashed cauliflower, casseroles (Cavemanketo.com), tuna/chicken/egg salad, mashed avocado and tuna, baked salmon and asparagus, salsa chicken with cheese, chicken wings

Nothing strange about it... well, hopefully not... cause I've been doing it too.

Congrats man.. keep up the good work!nice! I only spent about $10 on a couple gas station snacks and a temaki roll snack, but that's it. I used to eat out a lot though, but I never counted that when I was tallying grocery costs. I probably cut more than half by just stopping eating out if I were to count total food cost.Me too!Great job, and super motivating! You should definitely be proud :) can't wait to reach the 30lb mark also! &gt; So in the last 1-2 weeks, Ive noticed a general sense of fatigue (best way to describe it), all over my body. Its the worse in the morning and subsides as I progress through the day

Electrolytes...are you following the guidelines in the FAQ?

&gt; My wife says that my muscle size has gone down. Could this be a sign of the muscles getting catabolized?

No, subjective opinions about muscle size are not useful. Your water weight and glycogen status changes on keto so your muscles might look different. If you're eating adequate protein and calories you're not losing muscle mass.

&gt; Is that a common experience on this type of diet?

No, keto is incredibly muscle sparing so long as you follow the plan

I'm in Michigan in the US. I work for the Federal Government and none of the employees get that. I haven't even heard of any private employers in the US doing it. But that's pretty sweet! Wish I could go out every day for lunch! Save myself some prep time and have someone do it for me!Whether it is muscle Catabolizafjon or not, let's touch on a few things - are you meeting your protein macro ? Are you doing any sort of measurements ? What your wife sees may not actually be reality .  Are you supplementing your electrolytes ? Some people experience sleepiness/exhaustion feelings by taking magnesium, try only taking that before bedtime. I'm seeing a lot of info about endurance and high intensity sports so I thought I should ask what your event is..it could make a big difference in which advice is best to followvJust because you feel more hungry eating carbs, does not make the carbs unhealthy, the quantity is unhealthy. ( I have the problem too which is why I eat keto, but that doesnt make me think carbs are evil).

Complex carbs is not a misnomer. Quinoa is not straight up sugar. Takes longer to break down and digest since the sugars are bound with fibre, so your insulin wont spike as fast.

Sufficient magnesium without supplementation is also fairly difficult to get on a low carb diet unless you like eating a couple hundred grams of spinach every day.

Have you ever looked at a mennonite cookbook? Those recipes have 2x the amount of sugar a in it than a normal recipe. Want to know why? Cause they were out working in the fields 12+hours a day and needed the quick energy.

Maybe your the one that should keep your judgement to yourself.
Thanks.Thanks, I love to learn about other people's opinions and I think that's a much more constructive way to disagree.  I will definitely take a look those articles and maybe show them to my old coaches hahaThanks for the answer. The loss had been pretty consistent up until this last week and a half so I figured it must be a stall. Guess I just need to be patient.Omg, cauliflower and kielbasa are my favorite combined (I'm think that's what's on top of one of your zoodle pics).  I usually add the kielbasa to the cauliflower for the last 10 minutes of roasting and eat them together with a runny egg on top.Just remember you can't change other people or control what they comment on. You can only control yourself and your reaction to their comments. I always give people the benefit of the doubt when they make comments or ask questions. They aren't usually trying to be mean or offensive, most are just curious or want to let you know that they have noticed and are proud of you.It's in the sidebar somewhere I think (I'm on my phone) but you can visit http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com to get a listing of how much carbs, protein, and fat you should be getting. Remember fat and carbs are a limit while protein is a goal.

Grab you some zipfizz or something similar to help keep your electrolytes in balance, otherwise you'll feel like hell for awhile. Chicken broth works okay as well from what I hear.

Don't worry about limiting sodium on keto, honestly if anything you'd want to be eating more sodium. I average about 3300mg of sodium a day.

Also get the myfitnesspal app and start tracking your food intake, it takes a bit to get in the groove but after that its second nature.

My username in myfitnesspal is Tannermidd, feel free to add me!1 week is not a stall

Keep it at sedentary, changing it to moderately active makes no sense to be honest. And, the activity levels overestimate and unless you're an athlete *and* a construction worker 4 to 5 times at a the gym is still essentially sedentary for calculator purposes.

You're not in a stall. &gt; if I want to try a couple of weeks without dairy for the above reasons, does that mean I should avoid my whey isolate protein powder?

It depends on how strict you want to be about 'dairy.' If you actually think it's something in dairy that's affecting you then it would make sense to eliminate all dairy including whey protein powder.

Cutting out dairy seems to work for some in that mostly it reduces calories as people tend to underestimate intake from foods like cream and cheese and butter so naturally if you eliminate it and thus reduce calories you lose more readily.  It is interesting that you feel deprived on keto, perhaps something to think about and address, why is that?  Feeling deprived does not really make for a sustainable way of eating if keto is your long term goal. The brain fog is mostly just the first three days through perhaps three weeks.  Drink bullion or broth.

50% protein is not beneficial (unless you are doing a Protein Sparing Modified Fast.)  Run the keto calculator on the sidebar and set your protein at 0.8g/LBM pound on rest days and 1.0g/LBM pound on heavy weight lifting days.  Higher protein than that is just burned for energy as your body cannot utilize nor store excess protein.  If you are eating at a severe caloric deficit (not recommended at least the first two weeks) you might get a 40% protein diet, but that came with bad constipation for me.  Ratios are unique for everyone and their goals, but you will probably find that 30%-35% protein works better.Powerade Zero helps me when I'm low on electrolytes. Put cheese on top and now you have a meat pizza slices!Woot!Great work! Keep going!Stalls are normal.  Changing it to moderately active for regular workouts isn't really going to keep a stall from happening.  A week is not a stall however.Which is why I posted several articles for endurance sports, including one on carb refueling and it's importance.  I agree, he will need to make his own decision based on everything he finds in his research and how he feels.  I'm sorry you felt offended.Hahaha! I totally read your title as "Eating Myself Out".... O.OChicken bouillion broth. It saved my life the first few days. I think what you are doing is fine if that is what works for you.  When you are ready to transition to keto, it may help you that you are cutting down your carbs.  But if you want to really do keto, you need to follow the macros which include fat, and includes keeping track of your carbs, and most stick below 20g net in the beginning to make sure they are in ketosis.  It sounds like you are doing a low carb, low fat, low cal diet right now (without seeing your actual numbers).  Have you used the calculator to come up with your macros?they aren't horrible for keto but other nuts definitely have less carbs.Headache and exhaustion usually indicates you're low on sodium.  Try drinking a cup or two of chicken broth.Anyway, OP will read all the comments and articles listed here and make the decision for himself.  There are many ways to view this question, so is important the opinions and facts on both sides are shown.  I'm just giving OP some facts to base his decision off of and I'm sure that people who think he should do keto will do the same.   Keto is be great for many people, but I think that everyone will agree that it is not right for everyone.  I know this sub is mostly keto supporters, but i still think it is important to tell someone when keto may not be right for them. I'm sorry if my wording bothered you but putting a winky face at the end of your comment didn't make it any less offensive to me, my opinions, and my integrity.There is a local restaurant with pot roast nachos on the menu... I've ordered it without the chips and it was amazing. Just ate it with a fork. A new keto menu option available in most American restaurants--any nachos with toppings only. Keto flu is generally an electrolyte issue, so just keep up with those, keep your water intake up and push through it, it will pass soon :)Really common.  I dreamed about guzzling regular Cokes, eating entire DQ ice cream cakes, picking corn on the cob out of the mud and eating it.  I'm not a huge fan of cooking in the crockpot myself, unless it is just a single piece of meat, so I get you there.  I have been prepping for ages, and one thing that is a key piece of equipment is a Foodsaver.  I generally take 1/4-1/2 of meals I make on weekend and freeze them in portions.  I have probably 2 weeks of meals in the freezer at any given time so that if there is a wknd I can't prep, I don't have to worry, and I always have a wide variety on hand, just in case.  I roast a bunch of chicken thighs, you can do anything with those... many times I will just top some with a little Rao's Vodka Sauce (3 net carbs) and provolone, quick bake... done.  The only thing I've done in advance is cook the chicken.  I will roast whole chickens and use the drippings to make a gravy (heavy cream, little sour cream, little arrowroot, broth), or make chicken salad.  Make a meat sauce with ground beef, ground pork, sausage, pepperoni, etc.  I used to do my own sauce, but with Rao's being so low, I couldn't really make my own that low, and it's easy.  Then I make a bunch of zucchini noodles, sweat them and put them away for the week.  I will smoke chickens, turkeys, pork shoulders, ribs, etc. or roast them.  Make juicy burgers ahead of time... I cook or grill mine in advance, I just take them off a little early... I don't feel like grilling or cooking during the week. I almost always make a quiche or some type of casserole (another thing that I freeze portions of).  I cook "live" on weekends because I usually do steaks.  I will make ham rollups (with chive sour cream) to have on hand.  Portion out nuts and put in little snack bags.  I just make sure I have 4 full days worth of food in the fridge by Sunday night.  That sounds like an excellent buffet to me!I'll try and resist :)

thanks for the information!eek thanks for that. I have limiting myself to 20g of carbs so I still dont think I went over the 40-50g mark to kick me out of ketosis with my miscalculations Hm,  that doesn't sound too bad.  Do you find that the meat reheats better than cooking it another way because it has all that moisture?I must have read it somewhere that provided wrong information :( Enjoy your peanuts! and make sure you dont go over your macros!Awesome thanks for your help! I've been worried about reheating meats.  Do you find them getting tough and gross when you reheat them in the microwave?Cravings suck. You'll be torturing yourself. That feeling you have about ice cream? It probably wont go away if you keep priming your sweet tooth.
Look, I tried fitting junk into my carb macro the first and second times I attempted keto. It wasn't until I cut this stuff out entirely that I made it passed the cravings and on to losing all my weight. Its not that you cant do it this way, its just a bigger gamble and none of us want to see you fail.  I'm fairly picky as well. What I do is boil a dozen eggs and grill a bag of chicken for a weeks worth of meals. I also add a serving of microwaveable veggies to each meal.I've gained six pounds. However, I'm not doing the keto thing to lose weight but to help manage symtoms from a neurological thing. To be completely honest, I probably needed to gain the weight because I was starving myself and obsessed with being skinny before. Now foods just fuel and I dont feel guilty after every bite I take.

edit: I am very athletic, and muscle-y, not a chubby short girl.I make them ahead on the weekend... I sweat them for a pretty good amount of time, rinse, fully dry out and then refrigerate.  They hold up very well.  I usually do 3 zukes at a time.  One of my favorites!!Well done!!!!!Weigh them, if it fits your macros Similar story here, it was a friend that lost weight, she didn't go on a rant but her comment when people started praising her success was "why didn't anyone tell me how awful I looked before"

That story plus the concern that illness is the reason for weight loss makes me nervous to say anything. Yup if it fits your macros

Yes "fibre" is always already subtracted so you don't subtract. Actually I did not search to match my opinion, I was not in fact of that opinion most of my life.  I wanted to eat a lower carb diet for a lot of my swimming career and had all of my very experienced coaches tell me I couldn't.  In addition, USA swimming is generally viewed as the best swimming organization in the world.  As swimming uses your body in a very different way than land sports, I would suggest following the advice of an accredited swimming association rather than the advice athletes who do not have competitive swimming experience.  Of course. Everything is ok as long as you don't go over your macros. You can eat a spoonful of sugar every morning if you want to, as long as you have no other carbs for the rest of the day :-O

But don't though. I totally get the picky thing - i have several crockpots so I don't have to worry about that.  I, in fact, do most big holiday dinners in crockpots (all of the sides are cooked in crockpots)  Its something definitely to try.  If not, what about grilling?  I grill up a weeks' worth of lunches at a time and portion them out in containers that just wait for me in the fridge.  Works great.
You can really do the same thing baking/frying.  I just prefer grilled.
I grill up chicken breast, pork loin, steaks, brats, etc and just toss them in the fridge to be reheated in the microwave later.  I'll add veggies and cheese to them as desired and don't even worry about it all week.  I also love dinner leftover for lunch, so I take those when available too.

I do the same with breakfast - I make up egg and cheese with bacon/sausage/ham in muffin tins and toss those in the fridge too - they reheat great.  About the food:
Last week I put a whole chicken with celery, carrots, an onion, a couple cloves of garlic, some seasonings, filled the crockpot with water and turned it to high for 8 hours. Then I pulled out the chicken and removed the bones and cartilage (it won't even stay together when you pull it out). I used half the meat and half the broth and veggies for chicken soup. Then I used the breast meat by itself with some carrots sauted in butter for another meal. I used the dark meat to make chicken salads for a week. I was planning (but didn't do it) to use the extra broth to make egg drop soup. So, from one whole chicken and some veggies and eggs, I had at least a week's worth of meals for myself.

Exercise:
no need to skip anything because you are changing eating habits.
it will take a couple days to get used to it, but you won't be seriously fatigued or anything.
I need to play around with it.. I think it would make an epic ice cream.Boston Market is great if you have it.Wait, peanuts aren't good for keto? I've been eating like a 1/4 cup of them every day. It doesn't put me over my carb macros(I'm always a bit high on the protein anyways) or my calories when I enter it in MFP.Good for you!  No need to be hesitant, let alone super hesitant, you've made a lot of progress and you should be proud!  I bet your face looks slimmer, too. Don't forget to take those progress pics as well, even if that's not something you want to post online.

Congrats, and keto on!I know you said no crockpot, but hear me out... Last week I put a whole chicken with celery, carrots, an onion, a couple cloves of garlic, some seasonings, filled the crockpot with water and turned it to high for 8 hours. Then I pulled out the chicken and removed the bones and cartilage (it won't even stay together when you pull it out). I used half the meat and half the broth and veggies for chicken soup. Then I used the breast meat by itself with some carrots sauted in butter for another meal. I used the dark meat to make chicken salads for a week. I was planning (but didn't do it) to use the extra broth to make egg drop soup.

So, from one whole chicken and some veggies and eggs, I had at least a week's worth of meals for myself.Yumthanks :)Watch this video

Your results look great. Trigs at 44 is awesome, HDL at 50 is good. LDL is more complicated. Next time ask for a VAP test which will look at which subset of LDL you have. Your trig to HDL ratio suggests you are pattern A which means your LDL is benign. Either way your LDL is not high but could be considered borderline if you disregard particle size.

This video is a bit tougher to follow, its not really meant for non medical audience.

 http://youtu.be/an6L9VY0v8AHa! I cut my bills in half just because I stopped eating out (0_o)When your weight loss is going to be super slow and you add in factors like water retention it's impossible to tell exactly how much your losing except when averaged over the looooong term. I'm around your general stats - 5 foot and 105. When doing keto and exercising/weight lifting you have to look at progress over the last month or more because when you are already tiny it's hard to eat a huge deficit. For instance I averaged 850ish calories a day for the month of March and lost 3 pounds. That's probably about right for my TDEE at my sedentary job and also considering I may have gained a bit of muscle. Plus my weight can fluctuate up to 5 pounds from working out / sore muscles holding onto water.

I like using [This tracker](https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/HackDiet/) because it'll give you an average and even when your weight jumps all over the place you can see if it's a downward trend. Words of advice from an old fat guy, it isn't about the pizza, it is about hanging out with your friends.  You can hang out and not down a single piece of pizza.  I don't regret hanging out with my friends when I was younger, I regret feeling like I had to eat all the junk food and crap that usually went along with it, when you really don't have to.

This type of situation is something you are going to have to deal with for the rest of your life, right now it is pizza with friends but eventually it will be kids birthday parties with cake and ice cream, etc, etc.  Figure out what works best for you, but be aware this is going to be something you have to face the rest of your life, that being social situations that center around food.Wow! You've done such an amazing job! Congratulation!https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faqSalami and pepperoni make the best chips... I use Boar's Head for both and they come out so crisp and perfect.

Great with a little hummus :)It is :)

I have to break a fast with a tiny meal.. something high fat like that... if I break with a big meal I end up feeling sick..

Little snack then one big meal works best for me.Me too! I have recently found unsweetened cashew milk.  It does have 1 carb per serving, but only 25 calories, 2g of fat or 2.5 and it is the most rich, creamy thing in the world... Like as creamy and rich as heavy cream.You have to do what's best for you. A lot of people do well switching to Paleo when they feel that keto is not right for them anymore. You can't really was out of it though - you are really either in dietary ketosis or you aren't, so add some carbs to your diet and you'll be good to go.

Do some research to make sure you are getting enough. Going from keto to barely-not-in-keto can result in low carb limbo, which is no fun. Basically a state where you don't have enough glucose to provide you with energy, but too much to produce ketones.

And for what it's worth, eating pizza after months of avoiding processed junk food is going to make you sick no matter how you normally eat, so make sure it's worth it (read: get some damn good pizza).

If you are interested in gaining muscle in keto, check r/ketogains.Zaxby's salads. Just order without the fried onions, and get the chicken grilled. Oh WHAT !? I never knew that the nutrition table in EU displayed the net carbs. Yikes I have been eating more then I thought. Thanks for that.

In regards to peanuts, are they ok for keto if I hit under my net carb anyways.
What is keto? A huge mixed greens salad topped with pepperoni slices, bacon bits, shredded or sliced chicken thighs, shredded or cubed cheese, avocado oil, and olive oil.

I've been eating this for lunch for over a year now. At first it painful to eat this every day. Now I kind look forward to it every day.

It's extremely easy, super cheap, doesn't taste bad, and easy to change to your liking.It really was. I almost made a post out of it, but didn't think it was too high quality. I'm only on week 3, after all!I work at the brazillian version of wall street, i can eat anything anytime i want!

not looking for tips, just curious what other people eat!string cheese sounds deliciousNot as funny, but more interesting: http://www.gnolls.org/3374/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-calorie-to-your-body/Never? In most companies you get a prepaid card for meals, to be used on restaurant. Other companies also give you prepaid groceries card to be used on food store as part of the benefit plan. This is extra from the salary.

It is a thing in Brazil, anyway.I have a string cheese and a diet soda... I IF though so this is the first "break" in my fast about 1 or 2pm then I eat dinner about 5pm.Fantastic! I feel like I've gotten more gainz in the last few months from lifting weights than I did the other nine months doing BWF. The feel on the muscles is no comparison, really.Congratulations!! That's amazing... Keep up the great work.Measure all the parts!

I am having the opposite problem, the scale is moving down super slowly but I am losing inches.  It's an EU/AUS/NZ style label, fiber is already subtracted, net carbs equals 5.7 gramsGargantuan!It took me into week three. Keep going. eat when you're hungry. true, it is sustainable for some, but not all. I wish I could eat at that deficit... I would cut grocery bills in half!wow... I've never heard of such a thing!!!KFC has zero carb grilled chicken is some markets. A normal breaded double down is 9net but its a good size meal for that amount. I haven't had my period for 26 years! You need to go over to /r/ketogains Immediately!  Theres a whole community of athletes and body builders that NEEDS to know this important information.  God... To think if all the time they're wasting over there... If only you got here sooner.  I cant thank you enough, the lives you will be saving. The blog I Breathe I'm Hungry is fantastic. They have full week meal plans three meals a day with two snacks, as well as prep instructions  which are very simple to follow. It helps because you just don't have to think about it at all. You might need to increase the portion size a little to hit closer to 2000 calories. Lookin hot I was about to say "muscle gain?" but glad I don't have to. Oh wait Magic :)Good point - if I plan ahead, I salt to get some of the water out. It does improve it markedly.All I care about is number of carbs and absence of artifical sweeteners. Works for me. I believe, from several readings, that the difference between "pampered" food and industrial food is minimal and can be balanced quite easily.High of 57 today! Upvote for being a Michigander! I find it best to start the day knowing what my plan will be, but that doesn't always happen.  But I try to work around a plan.  On workout days, I usually have breakfast.  As the weather gets warmer, I tend to get just one large meal in the evening.  Eat in a manner that works best for you.  There are no rules on timing, just make sure you are paying attention to macros, and make it work for you :)yes, 85-90% dark chocolate is fine, if it fits under your daily carbs limit.

I do not recommend chocolate made with artificial sweeteners, but know that some ketoers consume a lot of food that contain a lot of those sweeteners and appear to be thriving.Woot! Great job so far! Lololol


 Damn!  Awesome work!  Truly inspirational! Ok, then add carbs, you're out of keto :) Yeah, that too.Don't you have to most of the water out before cooking? It seems like such a pain. The couple times I've done it the results were very mixed, but maybe my technique is poor.I know how to maintain the calories, I am adapt to doing this now, it is easy to count calories. My plan is to add more calories though, to gain weight through muscle. I will be getting a gym membership and working on finally getting into proper shape.Day 4 of keto and the only hiccup I've had mentally so far is trying to put my shirt on as pants.  Other than that, sharp as a tack.Add carbs slowly focus on vegetables first then other carbs, monitor your weight. Go back to what you were doing before and the weight will come right back so keep an eye on your weight and after you gain water weight adjust calories accordingly to maintain Most fast food places have grilled chicken as an option... you can get it on a salad or bed of lettuce or a lettuce wrap[You can eat before midnight, because that's also after.](http://i.imgur.com/Uq9xJMn.jpg)You have to suck it up and just do it.  Are you eating enough fat?  The fat is there so you won't feel like you are starving.  Follow the guidelines, follow your macros, keep your carbs less than 20 net and you will get there.  If you keep starting over each day, you won't get there... Man.... What I'd do to have my own personal Avocado tree. Wish I lived in a warmer climate. I agree, been eating them for years and have never pan fried them, definitely going to try this.GotchaI love unsweetened almond milk. Its especially delicious with a little heavy cream.I know that a few packets won't kill me, but it does make me crave more.We sure don't. I have the same question about the containerhttp://amzn.com/B0091QO57SNot everyone eats processed meats... I have pepperoni or salami from time to time, but it's not a daily, weekly or even monthly thing.  But if people want to eat processed meats, that's up to them.  But you can get organic and all natural meats such as pepperoni ;)  Now, if you are talking spam?  I stay far far away lol.Rotisserie chicken It's breaded....:)Verified by McDonald's... you can always go to their site, remove anything from the sandwich and see the carbs of each portion.  11g for the patty is correct.  http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/product_nutrition.chickenfish.4314.mcchicken.htmlI have this too. Dream of having eaten a cinnamon roll or pizza or something, and then freaking out. Years ago, I was eating vegetarian and I had the same kinds of dreams, just with meat involved instead. I think it means you're really on top of this keto thing!Chick fila has awesome grilled nuggets and even the regular nugget 8 count is less than 10 carbs The first few weeks your body can do some crazy things. There is an interesting balance between dehydration/water retention. If you're drinking 3 liters of water a day, just keep doing that and eating to your appetite, keeping carbs low and your body will normalize. I cook all my bacon in the oven on a cookie sheet. I line the cookie sheet with reynolds non-stick aluminum foil. Cook the bacon, I keep some fat for cooking other foods (I have a jar I keep bacon grease in) and I pull the whole sheet of foil with the grease off the pan and throw it away. The pan never gets grease on it to begin with. Easy peasy. 11 g for one piece? JeezBuy the cheaper roasts like pork shoulder or boston butt. Put the whole roast in the slow cooker with some spices that you like. (I recommend cumin, chili powder, onion powder, garlic, salt and pepper to make a taco-like spice). Cook until it falls apart. This will generally be 4-6 hours on high. If you get a shoulder with that layer of fat. Cook it in the crock with the fat on top for like 4 hours high. Take it out of the crockpot and place on a baking sheet and put it under the broiler in the oven to crisp the fat (like bacon). Divine!

Beef ribs in the crockpot turn out very tender.

I also cook chicken thighs in the crock pot. They will in turn be very soft, but tasty.Thank you! Not sure why I was downvoted it was an honest question but I appreciate the answer nonetheless.Chicken leg quarters are usually very cheap at about .59/lb when you buy 10 lbs.
The cheap ground beef is higher fat content - 70 - 73%.
Frozen or canned veggies - spinach, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower are usually cheap.

I've been eating 1/2 a tube (8 oz) of ground beef per meal ($3.79) and a bag of frozen veggies (&lt;$2/bag) That's &lt;$6/day, and well under your monthly budget. Eat the fat that comes off the ground beef - use it to flavor/sautee the vegetables. That's the key to keeping your macros right. I only eat 2 meals per day at about 1680 kcal per day. If you added a 3rd meal of eggs fried in bacon grease you'd be closer to your calorie requirements. (and a little higher cost, but eggs are cheap). awesome &lt;3http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/mcdonalds-mcchicken-patty-only-no-bread-lettuce-or-mayo-49272979

You might just want to not eat breaded chicken Dem paint skilz, doe .... ;)

Congrats, OP! Great progress!Fantastic! congratulations!I noticed it first on my collar bones. I lose from my torso first (pear shape). And one more thing, if you go to that website. They recommend using cranberry juice to help flush toxins out while you're going through withdrawal. I used cranberry capsules instead. I'm not 100% convinced that it made an effect--but I used them and I was successful. I quit smoking while low-carbing years ago. Once you get through the withdrawal the key is to "Never take another puff". When you're ready, check out www.whyquit.com that's what I used to help me quit cold turkey. I found after quitting carbs--quitting smokes was the same process.  Using support boards like reddit for low carb helped me with the carbs www.whyquit.com helped me quit the cigs. (Both cold turkey) Good luck on both!!
Yea which is why i wanna know how much carbs on breadedSkip breakfast and eat big meal in the afternoon you look great!!!Isn't it breaded?Number #6 is correct though right guys??That's an amazing weight loss! CongratsEating at big deficit is usually not a problem as long as you have some weight to lose and get adequate protein ([Hoffer, 1984](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6707202/)), studies usually look at up to around 3 months and they show no issues with metabolism or losing lean mass (muscle). If you add resistance exercise you might even see a small increase in metabolic rate, this study was in women at 800 kcal/d:

[Table 2](http://imgur.com/At85Fpl)

R+D = resistance exercise
C+D = cardio
LBW = lean body weight, muscle
RMR = resting metabolic rate

&gt; No decrease in LBW was observed in R+D. In addition, R+D had an increase (p&amp;lt;0.05) in RMR O2 ml/kg/min (2.6 to 3.1). The 24 hour RMR decreased (p&amp;lt;0.05) in the C+D group.

*Bryner RW, et al.* ["Effects of resistance vs. aerobic training combined with an 800 calorie liquid diet on lean body mass and resting metabolic rate"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10204826) *J Am Coll Nutr. 1999 Apr;18(2):115-21.*

I haven't seen any studies looking at diet breaks but it might be a good idea to plan some structured diet breaks every few months, Lyle's ["The Full Diet Break"](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-full-diet-break.html) has some discussion on the benefits like normalizing hormones and helping long term adherence, [here's a /r/keto thread with an n=1 experience of a diet break](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2u4yxi/update_how_i_fared_on_lyle_mcdonalds_full_diet/). Most very low calorie diet studies I've seen tend to go for around three months at most, so that's probably be a good upper limit before taking a break.

The max deficit numbers are probably pretty good as an estimate of how low you can go with caloric intake, I have yet to see any better estimates. The 31.4 kcal/lb/d number come from Alpert's 2005 paper and are mainly based on the Minnesota semi-starvation study by Ancel Keyes. It was already lean men ([before/after pics](http://i.imgur.com/6byrpun.jpg)) who ate a high carb protein deficient diet, ~40 grams protein per day, and this was also at a huge caloric deficit, ~1600 kcal/d with a energy expenditure of 3200 kcal/d, so it's probably a fairly conservative number for someone who eats adequate protein.

I posted this in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/13xakw/just_a_quick_question_is_it_very_bad_if_i_variate/c77zxua):

---

You don't slow your metabolism markedly when restricting calories, even when doing drastic cuts, as long as you have enough fat mass to keep up with demand. You get a 5-10% drop after the first three days, then it doesn't decrease more unless you surpass what your fat stores can supply. So if you feel hungry or not doesn't really affect how many calories you burn, unless you're really lean and actually going into real "starvation mode".

Martin Berkhan over at leangains has some studies in ["Top Ten Fasting Myths Debunked"](http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html) showing that the first three days of calorie restriction (fasting) you increase your metabolism by around 10%, but it drops by around 8% below baseline after the third day (amount and time frames varies a bit). Studies at six months with a 25% caloric deficit shows a 6% loss in metabolism (above that which your lower weight does):

&gt; These "metabolic adaptations" (~ 6% more than expected based on loss of metabolic mass) were statistically different from controls (P&amp;lt;.05).

*Heilbronn LK* ["Effect of 6-month calorie restriction on biomarkers of longevity, metabolic adaptation, and oxidative stress in overweight individuals: a randomized controlled trial"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16595757) *JAMA. 2006 Apr 5;295(13):1539-48.*

And doing a more severe deficit shows the same thing, a 800 kcal diet over three months, resulting in 30 lbs of fat mass lost, with no slowing of the metabolism (above what's expected from weightloss):

FFM = fat free mass, lean mass.

&gt; RMR decreased both after short-term weight loss (2 wk) and after 3 mo. When corrected for FFM, however, no significant differences were
present both at short- and long-term evaluation.

*Van Gaal LF, et al.* ["Factors determining energy expenditure during very-low-calorie diets"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1615888) *Am J Clin Nutr. 1992 Jul;56(1 Suppl):224S-229S.*

The only time you slow your metabolism is when you restrict calories to a point where your fat stores can't cover the deficit, and your body starts to break down lean mass. Your body will use up unprotected lean mass before digging into muscle and vital organs, roughly 2.72 kg in the Minnesota experiment according to Alpert (but it's not all energy). I'm guessing it's glycogen stores ([up to 450 grams](http://books.google.se/books?id=rXSO9YLr72YC&amp;amp;lpg=PA263&amp;amp;ots=0ABhb1mvyw&amp;amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false)), amino acid pools ([around 135 grams](http://thinksteroids.com/articles/protein-lyle-mcdonald-04/)), intramuscular fat ([around 200 grams](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15358749)) and whatever else that's not essential for survival. After that your body will have to start using protected lean mass and that's when you get a reduced metabolic rate to protect vital organs (real "starvation mode").

&gt; Even though we consider the FFM to be a single energy
entity, we in no way imply that the FFM is a uniform
structure. Possibly the shielded part of the FFM deals
with vital organ systems while the unprotected part has less survival significance.

*Alpert SS.* ["A limit on the energy transfer rate from the human fat store in hypophagia."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615615) *J Theor Biol. 2005 Mar 7;233(1):1-13. Epub 2004 Dec 8.*

In the Minnesota semi-starvation study that Alpert uses as one of his sources the individual variance in reduction metabolic rate is huge, towards the end one subject has a decrease of over 35% of baseline even after adjustment for FFM (average reduction was 21.5% after three months):

[Chart](http://imgur.com/atx71).

&gt; Taken together, these results in normal-weight men responding to severe food deprivation reveal anthropometric predictors for human interindividual variability in the capacity for energy conservation and suggest that the adaptive reduction in BMR is partly determined by an autoregulatory feedback control system linking the state of depletion of fat stores to compensatory mechanisms that suppress thermogenesis.

*Dulloo AG, Jacquet J.* ["Adaptive reduction in basal metabolic rate in response to food deprivation in humans: a role for feedback signals from fat stores"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9734736) *Am J Clin Nutr. 1998 Sep;68(3):599-606.*

But as shown above this reduction in metabolism doesn't happen when your fat stores can supply enough energy.Well done!Don't explain, eat. Order sashimi and salad dawnAnd many newbies who think they are at 20 net grams are often at 30-40Use the keto calculator, set to sedentary as the activity levels overestimate, set protein to 0.8 grams per lb LBM, deficit to 20%How often does it happen? Have you tried to correlated with certain foods?Nice progress!! Another testament that the scale isn't the whole story.

&gt; Note to calorie conspiracy theorists: My mass decreased when I decreased calories, yet my mass increased when I increased calories. I don't know what to tell ya.

Mind = blown, really? :)Don't guess, track your electrolytes Tis true guy that feels the need to post his stats online. A balanced diet is best and the body depends on carbs, otherwise it breaks down proteins and that is no bueno faggot. MFP is good for logging food and not for calculating deficits. It assumes you're going to add exercise which is not recommended.

&gt; suppose my thinking is if my maintenance intake will be about 1200-1300 calories at goal, why not get used to it now?

Because the thinking is flawed, you'll stall and then what? Nowhere to go with calories

Set a 20% deficit with the keto calculator and don't make it harder than it needs to be. Whatever studies are posted in real life unless categorically morbidly obese, high deficits are counterproductive Kinda unrelated tip but if you change the sugar column for a fibre column you can use the browser script from the side bar to automatically work out your net carbs :)Salami nachos coming right up!For the record, you can gain weight on keto. Most aren't trying to which is why you don't hear about it, but you certainly canI think the majority of people here (and probably other similar communities online) don't actually care about what's healthy, but only what will help them lose weight. Sad but true. My personal policy is I don't mention weight to anyone, under or overweight you never know how it will be received. Why did you put your legs in a twix wrapper?LolTrust me, I don't usually correct grammar. I consider myself a closet grammar nazi, in that I tend to notice it but rarely mention it, as long as a salient point is conveyed.

I do take pleasure in correcting correctors, though, when they are wrong, but that was already done so I merely confirmed the correction already made.

You should thank /u/mike9974 for the original "correct" correction.You have less weight to lose so will lose it slowly. You will not lose weight as quickly as all of those progress pictures you see. It's been 2 weeks, it's going to take months not weeks for results. Moreover with less to lose, the scale isn't a great metric, measurements and body fat.

You need to change expectations, it's been 2 weeks and you're already discouraged, it's going to be slow going, get used to it, you realistically might lose 1/2 to 3/4 lbs a week and it takes more than 2 weeks to establish a trend

You can learn patienceYou want salt.

Have you tried 5x5 strong lifts? Good program and seems like you already have most of the lifts in your routine. I felt like it was great for progressing and keeping motivated.

Lifting retains water, you may still he losing fat. I bet if you eat at maintenance and follow 5x5sl you'll get where you want to be.
Also repost in /r/ketogains theyd know better than myself. Don't measure your progress by scale. Take pictures and measurements.

What is your work out routine? Do you lift? What are you looking to improve in looks and health?

If you lose fat and gain muscle you will look smaller and more fit but may weigh more. So scale reading may mislead you.

Being skinny does NOT equal healthy. Keep keto for few weeks or months and see how your body reacts. Yeah grass fed has a higher omega3 content so it is healthier but that doesn't make grain fed unhealthy.

You might feel better knowing your food is pasture raised/grass fed/organic but that doesn't make other sources unhealthy. Sure there are benefits in higher quality food but the law if diminishing returns applies.  If it doesn't affect you then why is it important what other people believe?
Just eat and let eat.I've just cut back, slowly. Use to put 2 splenda in my tea, now just one. Even fully clean, though, you can't ignore your taste buds all the time...they still have sweet receptors. Just adjust downwards: a few packs of splenda per day won't kill ya!My co-workers have noticed but mostly didn't really comment. However as I work in a store the subject of how I look has suddenly become all of the regular customer's business. I get at least 3 comments a week about it and have been asked at least twice if I have cancer because I 'suddenly' look so different.

 I just nod, smile (deny cancer claims!), say thanks and carry on working. It's easier not caring than making a big deal, but it does get to me some days.It's definitely hard to look at rice, pasta, and bread in the same light again. Watching the UK show "Supersize vs Superskinny" (interesting comparisons between over and undereaters) I'm struck by how many participants eat "chips" (ie French fries in the US) on both ends of the spectrum. Potatoes remain the big fattening food of our time, yet you never hear these carbs described as "fattening foods" which was common before WW2. Not very many of these jokes getting upvoted here, thanks for the rare scare :-)


Edit: first non-serious question would have been, "So, is that the same period of time you started injecting yourself with tons of insulin?" :-P Wow at your triglycerides...you've taken some amazing steps to protect your heart from further damage. Well done!

I've been reading about how they calculate LDL (the old formula from the early 70s) and it tends to overestimate LDL. I'll just post the relevant info from the fantastic book" The Art and Science of Low-Carb living):


&gt; LDL-C = Total Cholesterol [HDL-C + (Triglycerides/5)] A major assumption is that the ratio of triglyceride to cholesterol is constant. VLDL is estimated as equal to triglycerides (mg/dL) divided by 5. This presumed 5:1 ratio is not constant, and the errors from this LDL-C calculation are significant[52].My mom is a first-time grandma this year (I'm the monkey's uncle). Still counts, right? :-)  &gt;You ate less than one serving. Or more. Whatever

My favorite :-P I make sausage gravy the same way I make alfredo. Butter, heavy cream, parmesan for thickening. Along with sausage and seasoning of course. It just can't really be cooled and then reheated without separating horribly.My scale purposely won't show results that don't differ much from the last reading (ie a 0.2 difference) so I find I have to reset it by weighing my toe :-P then, it reads back the raw number. Right on! Keep on trucking, my friend. Wishing you continued success for year two.Since it's fitting your macros, it's only a problem if it causes you to have food cravings emotionally and/or stimulates hunger  physiologically (esp in people with reactive hypoglycemia). Before keto, I lived on mostly fruit ("nature's candy") and fresh bread, so on keto, I would often budget in a single slice of my beloved grapefruit. I was always well under 20 net carbs/day, but I felt serious hunger pangs a couple of hrs after breakfast on grapefruit days. So while it fits my macros, a slice of grapefruit just doesn't work for me. (An unexpected benefit of dropping that part of breakfast is that the longer I went without my former favorite fruits, the fewer carb cravings I had &amp; I could better appreciate the fruits that are more keto-friendly like raspberries &amp; blueberries .)Great job! Keep us updated, man.Thanks Brit!Yes, it could be. Do you track electrolytes? Try getting more sodium.Nutrient timing within a day is largely inconsequential beyond your own personal preferences. Eat once a day or eat eight times a day, it doesn't really matter.Way to go -- you're looking great :)Keto is terrible for you no matter how much you weigh. Try making a thin layer of cheese first, it becomes really crispy in a fry pan then you can make the pizza on top- I make it for a type 1 friend who eats low carb, he loves it.

You'll ruin a few because there is a softness when it's in the pan, and hardens quickly when it cools, but its a small amount of cheese.All my gym shorts have a drawstring,don't yours? The elastic is starring to go on a few of mine (I don't buy clothes often) so I'm worried about this in the future, too. There are worse problems to have, namely not being able to fit in them cause you're too fat (a rare occurrence with stretchy gym shorts, I admit!)thank youfeelin good, lighter, faster[Celsius](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=375f+in+c)suddenly things got sexual or I'm just a weirdo.  but its definitely one of the twoGo to sleep at night. Can't eat when you're sleeping.Work the perimeter where fresh food resides Meal frequently won't make or break the diet.  I prefer 2 meals a day because on a caloric deficit my meals feel large.  Keto makes the meals that much more satisfying when it comes to the fullness factor.

The whole eat 6 small meals for better metabolism is bogus too.  It's the foods you eat that determine that part.
posted pics now, sorry for the late replyHa, I like that!Eat when you are hungry. Don't bother with how many hours, even the labels of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Keep a meal plan of what you want, know your macros, keep your carbs under 20g net and you'll be fine. I am always amazed how much 30lbs makes on a woman's figure compared to my 5ft 11in male. Your rocking it!If your worried don't eat processed meats. It's just like diet drinks and artificial sweeteners. Do what makes you happy.

You can find processed meats with out chemical additives if you look hard enough. Look at the ingredients, then you will know whats in them.Yes. Very much so. You have it backwards. Hit you protein goal, eat fat for satiety (you do NOT have to hit this goal) and keep carbs under 20g net.

-

Sugar alcohol does not count. You subtract dietary fiber and sugar alcohol from total carbs. And that's keto breath. It should fade in time. Processed meats or non-organic meats? Because by processed, I think of sandwich meats, hot dogs, et cetera. If you are talking about grass-fed or organic products, well, it's all about availability in both stock and financial means.

-

Grass-fed products have a leg up in certain minerals and vitamins, but to say that anything else is unhealthy is ignorant. It doesn't have to be organic or anything to be able to find out where it comes from. It's as easy as giving a call.keep at it, results will come. and remember, complete keto adaptation takes up to 12 weeks. don't expect results overnight. also, if you want to go a little more analytic about it, buy ketostrips and check your fasting urine every other day. that's what i do.Hey - many congratulations!I'm not jumping down anyone's throat. Methinks the lady doth protest too much.Restless, achy legs are also a classic sign of potassium deficiency. Try using a salt substitute and eating (more) avocados. Yeah! Intermittent fasting rocks!I haven't bought bread in months.

I refuse to enter a bakery in the same way that vegetarians refuse to go into a butcher's!c'mon! None of it will actually :) It's all your imagination

I could agree on raw egg white texture though. Nowadays I make raw egg shake with sour cream, stevia and vanilla. That's a tasty mofo! You can't tell there is an egg in it. 5-6 egg shake basically suppress my appetite for solid 6-8 hours. If you want to do a protein fast for a short period, consider doing a /r/PSMF/ for a week. It is safer than dreaming up your own regime.My first thought was 'eating too much, you fat shit..'

Sorry bout that..LOL.. probably formaldehyde sugars Found this really helpful guide that really lays it out for you! http://www.ruled.me/wp-content/uploads/RuledMeKetoDietPlan.pdf       Im on mobile so im not sure if the link will work on desktop.Nah, it works. I've thrown them under the broiler with a cheese cube on each slice before. It's like salami nachos.I started Keto without sugar additives.  I was drinking sugar free red bulls before.  I had a piece of sugar free gum because my breath could make a spoiled fish gag.  It was way too sweet! It took me only a week! Unsweetened almond milk has really been a great drink for me when I need someone other than water.  I'm not sure what the Keto Calculator recommendations are based on, studies show that long term success with high deficits is just as good as, or slightly better than, a more moderate deficit.

&gt; VLCDs, compared with LCDs, induced significantly greater short-term weight losses (16.1 +/- 1.6% vs. 9.7 +/- 2.4% of initial weight, respectively; p = 0.0001) but similar long-term losses (6.3 +/- 3.2% vs. 5.0 +/- 4.0%, respectively; p &gt; 0.2). Attrition was similar with VLCD and LCD regimens.

I know what you mean. I moved within the last couple weeks, and threw away all of my fat clothes instead of packing them up. I now have no shorts. I'm going to have to go buy some shorts.First thing I thought when I saw this was "This diet is so weird".

At least it's working!I wonder if almond flour would work as a substitute in gravy? or maybe coconut flour? psyillium husk? -- I'd experiment myself but I really, really dislike gravy.How much cheaper would it be to get chicken instead of steak? Do you just ask for a bunch of sides and ask for them in the same container? They don't look at you weird or anything?If you can't measure on a scale, you can eye ball it like so:

1 ounce of cheese is the size of two dice.

A 3 ounce serving of meat, poultry, or fish is the size of a deck of cards or a checkbook (depending on how wide of a cut).

8 ounces of yogurt or dairy is the size of a tennis ball.

Two tablespoons of peanut butter or salad dressing is the size of a ping pong ball.

1 ounce of nuts is the size of 4 dice.

1/2 cup of vegetables is the size of a lightbulb.

One serving of butter or olive oil is the size of two quarters. yea, but too much heat and the fat runs off.  we needs the fats :SI was skeptical at the start also. Didn't happen. Down 40 pounds since Thanksgiving.Standard keto is probably not optimal for competitive high intensity sports, you might want to look at TKD or CKD. But as you're probably burning through lots of carbs per day with 2 hours of swimming a non-ketogenic diet is probably a better fit for you.

&gt; Higher intensity cardiovascular exercise is a little bit harder to pinpoint in terms of carbohydrate requirements and can vary pretty significantly depending on the intensities and volumes. A sprinter running 60m repeats isnt using a lot of glycogen, a trained endurance athlete working near their lactate threshold for extended periods can deplete glycogen fairly completely in 1-2 hours. Even at lower intensities, the 2-6 hour sessions done by endurance athletes can completely deplete both muscle and liver glycogen stores on a daily basis.

&gt; Full skeletal muscle glycogen depletion for these athletes might represent 300-400 grams of total carbohydrate or more.

*Lyle McDonald* ["How Many Carbohydrates Do You Need?"](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/nutrition/how-many-carbohydrates-do-you-need.html/).

For details on TKD/CKD and actual implementations the FAQ/posts/people in in /r/ketogains are probably one of the better sources out there.

Even if lipolysis was increased the ATP generation from fat isn't fast enough to keep up with demand at higher intensities.

[Table 1](http://imgur.com/J5WhnWV).

&gt; From Table1 it is evident that carbohydrates can produce ATP at twice the rate that fat can be maximally oxidized. Since there is a common oxidative process from acetyl-CoA onwards for both carbohydrates and fats (i.e TCA Cycle), the slower rates of ATP production from fat must be as a result of slower rates of entry into the muscle cell or uptake across the mitochondria, or that beta-oxidation is slower than TCA cycle activity.

*Karen Birch, Don McLaren, Keith George* ["Sport &amp; Exercise Physiology"](http://books.google.com/books?id=xhJr9k1zx5YC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). *Garland Science, Jun 1, 2004*

&gt; Therapeutic use of ketogenic diets should not require constraint of most forms of physical labor or recreational activity, with the one caveat that anaerobic (ie, weight lifting or sprint) performance is limited by the low muscle glycogen levels induced by a ketogenic diet, and this would strongly discourage its use under most conditions of competitive athletics.

You do need carbs for intense training.

You have three types of muscle fibers, Type I, Type IIa, Type IIx. Type I is mostly long endurance fat burning (can work continuously for hours), Type IIa is mixed fat/glucose (can do continuous work for &amp;lt;30 minutes) and Type IIx is almost completely glucose (&amp;lt;5 minutes). When you do exercise you recruit the different muscle types based on intensity:

&gt; With regards to specific fiber types, Type I fibers are recruited from zero to about 60% of maximum force production capacities.  Around 20% of maximal force, some Type IIa fibers are recruited and are maximally recruited around 75-80% of maximal force.  Type IIb fibers do not begin to recruit until about 60-65% of maximal force production and continue to be recruited up to about 85% of max. as stated before.

["The Ketogenic Diet"](http://books.google.se/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;ots=dNISh1zQJz&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by Lyle McDonald, page 176.

So to get full performance out of Type IIa/x you need glucose, Lyle provides a chart showing when glucose starts being used:

SO = Slow Oxidative (aerobic, oxidizing fat)
FOG = Fast Oxidative Glycolytic (aerobic, oxidizing glucose)
FG = Fast Glycolytic (anaerobic, using glucose, creatine phosphate, ATP)

[Chart](http://imgur.com/Ax77b).

With fat adaptation your muscles get better at using fat (higher adrenaline sensitivity, higher mitochondrail number/activity, etc.), but as some of the muscle types just aren't able to efficiently burn fat you won't get full performance without carbs. I'm guessing you'll max out at around 60-80% of your potential when doing intense exercise (high intensity endurance, sprinting, strength training).

&gt; It is a basic physiological fact that Type II fibers require glycogen to function optimally. Therefore, a SKD will eventually decrease performance as well as inhibit muscle growth. Individuals who wish to weight train on a ketogenic diet will have to consume carbohydrates at some point.

["The Ketogenic Diet"](http://books.google.se/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;ots=dNISh1zQJz&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by Lyle McDonald, page 215.Pulled pork! A condescending, non-supportive attitude would be compelling enough for me despite appearances.Hey, give this a try. While you can definitely do that I found out something that is simply delicious. I took 90% dark chocolate (Lindt brand) and melted down two squares. To that melted chocolate, I added some slated butter, heavy whipping cream and a few teaspoons of erythritol. My god, it tasted like milk chocolate.

-

Now I have a wonderful low carb chocolate sauce to add to some things if I feel particularly happy with myself. I seriously recommend it.

-

Here's what I did:

- 2 Lindt 90% dark chocolate squares (buy in candy bar)
- 1 Tbsp Torani chocolate sugar free syrup
- 4 teaspoons erythritol
- 2 Tbsp heavy whipping cream
- 2 Tbsp SALTED butter (trust me. salt counters bitterness!)I don't know if I'm the exception but I'm having an easy time resisting buying the carbs and junk *(the remnants left in my cupboards are sometimes a little tougher)*.

You can do it.  Don't think you can't.It's a marathon not a sprint.  You probably took a long time to put the weight on and it will take a bit to get it off.

If you do such a bug deficit you may encounter cravings that you don't resist and sabotage yourself.  Also don't  be suprised if you stall every few weeks on such a deficit.My husband gets more upset than me when we cheat. I always tell him, "its just some food. It's not poison, it's not cyanide, its not going to make you gain all your weight back. Just get back to it tomorrow and you'll be fine." That usually helps him out too.Make fat bombs.  Find a coconut oil, butter, cocoa powder, your choice sweetener recipe.  I prefer adding a tbsp of peanut butter too.Just search this sub, please. This question comes up about every 4 hours and there are tons of threads discussing alcohol and keto.I hear you for days that I don't have many carbs left....but for days that I have plenty of carbs and cals left...why not? (serious question) I have a slow cooker! I can cook anything in it (it's big)...

But, I can't do anything fancy... what do I cook it in? Broth? What about alcohol? Do you guys have a drink on the weekend and what do you like to drink or what drink is best when on a keto diet?Is there any sauce between the bacon and cheese ? Looks good though Good idea.Same here! And if I can't use the grease or don't want to, I soak it up with salt and throw it away. Careful. If you're going to have chocolate, make it as dark as you can stand. It'll reduce carbs and increase fat if you do. I personally like Lindt 90% dark, as it's 11g fat, 2g protein, and 3.5g net carbs per two squares. Good to top off a day with.Eggs, tuna, cheap fatty cuts of meat like pork shoulder (do you have a slow cooker?). Get rotisserie chicken on sale when you can. Biggest bags of frozen chicken thighs you can find. Broccoli, cauliflower, butter. Good job. You look great.  I'm starting strong lifts tomorrow.  EekI wish i could have gone outside. I get off work at 4am every night and have class in the mornings so i never have time to go outside.Try some raw, fresh [sauerkraut] (http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/sauerkraut-anti-cancer-fermented-food-that-restores-gut-flora/) to help add some probiotics to your digestive system. I found a delicious, 2 carb per serving, one at trader joes. My waist. I know this is way late, but I just saw the original post and wanted to congratulate you on your amazing transformation!  You look great, and I'm sure you feel amazing!  Wish you nothing but further success!I made a meatloaf with cream cheese and spinach.  Google keto meatloaf goat cheese spinach.  I subbed cream cheese for goat cheeseWell, I'm not small or petite and I'm eating 1400 cal/day and losing at a rate of 1.8lb per week. It does seem high, and you have to control your carbs first. michigan weather today was glorious! good for a keto run, too
I adore lily's. I'd try chocoperfection if I could find it locally. You should never feel starved, you should eat foods filled with fat until you feel satisfied, don't let yourself go hungry even if it means eating a lot while adjusting to low carb.

You will however for the first couple weeks feel an appetite for carbs. The best advice I can give is don't worry about calories as long as you are eating a low amount of carbs each day without cheats for a while.

If you go for a while (say a month) with no change in weight then you might look at your calories, but it's too early to worry about that now. First comes kicking out the keto flu (if you even have it) and cravings.

Also, I would highly suggest 20g of carbs a day if you want to really kick off ketosis and then adjusting it to 35 after the cravings are gone or a couple weeks pass by.HECK YEAH! A very Happy Ketoversary to you! How do you feel?!Juanelo1946!Sometimes it's best just not to think about it.  ;{If you see somebody multiple times a week, they are less likely to notice a difference as the change in weight is usually gradual.

Most of the people I see at work (and I see them at least 2-4 times a week each) haven't seemed to have noticed anything but every time I get to see somebody that I haven't seen in multiple weeks really notices.Now go get some lily's :) "complex carbs that are rich in nutrients" that's sort of completely worthless.

I also eat very little artificially anythinged anything.

A banana is unhealthy because it spikes your blood sugar. Same with everything else you listed given you consume them in quantities that provide you a non-negligible amount of carbs (sugar).

"Complex carbs" is a misnomer. It's pretty much either fibre, or it's sugar. If it's fibre, it's fine, if not, it's not.

As for "But these things have nutrients and stuff!" Yeah, so does everything else, especially meat and leafy greens. There has also been no observable difference in absorption between supplemented nutrients and nutrients received through food, so it doesn't make a difference anyway.

Why are carbs evil? Because blood glucose and insulin. Simple as that.

Can you eat carbs and still be healthy? I don't know. Can SOME people eat carbs and still be healthy? Sure. You? Him? Me? Not sure. It depends on the person. I know that when I eat carbs, I feel too hungry to maintain my weight while simultaneously eating to satiety, and instead gain weight.

So I personally have difficulty being healthy with carbs introduced in non-negligible quantities in my diet. It sounds like the OP does too, by his own admission.

Keep your judgement to yourself please. Thanks.Yeah that sounds like it would help me losing weight cause all of these would make me throw up :PRead up on what potassium and magnesium do for your body.
In other words: electrolytes, electrolytes, electrolytes.Hahaha! You made my day Holy shit... that totally blows.  I'm so glad you didn't say anything!That is so awesome! Good on ya for beating the craving. They do get less intense over time. Keep going. You got this. You look great!  Stay motivated!  :)Raw eggs sounds hardcore. You sound like a manly man. I grew a beard and chest hair just reading this. Don't read too much into it. Also keep in mind it depends on what you were wearing in the pics, the angles of the shot, how close up or far away the image is, what it's being viewed on (old phone vs. 27" computer screen for example.)

I've seen some pics on here of people who've lost a LOT of weight, but it's hard to see because in both before/after pics the clothes don't allow seeing all the contours, or they're only front pics or only side pics.

Just food for thought. Either way, don't get discouraged - you're making progress! Keep it up!I broke mine doing a 2 day fast.  I was stuck at 213 , did a 2 day fast and got down to 208. Its been almost 3 days now and none of the weight came back Congrats! Wondering why you say that BWF was a waste/misuse of time? It feels amazing! YOU GOT THIS! :) Thank you so much!! :)I've been meaning to ask Reddit the same question.  I'm finally keto adapted and some days I'm not hungry.  Yesterday, I had to force myself to eat because I would otherwise have had a 600kcal deficit.  I've done some research and it says to 1) check the keto calculator and see what your max deficit can be and stay above that; and 2) always get your protein in so you won't lose muscle.

From another small-framed Asian femail with about 40 pounds of fat to lose.I was wondering if it were even humanly possible to gain that much weight in a month. Two months maybe but one would be mind blowing haha. He'd have to drink weight gain smoothies until he puked or something.Omg I want ham now.Crazy man. Wish I could lose that fast!You know, sometime during the first two weeks of keto I had a crazy dream. I remember being at special event where there were three full buffet tables of food available to me. The only food on the tables were things I couldn't eat. I figured "oh well" and went for a slice of cake but when I cut into the cake I realized the inside of the cake was actually cheese. I tried to eat a cookie but it was meat on the inside and only appeared as a sweet on the outside. Let me tell you, it was actually a very terrifying dream for me. I remember waking up in a sweat feeling a sense of fear and sadness. lol, good times... good times...Mmm pepperoni chips. Now I gotta try it.

Cheese chips are awesome if you haven't made them yet.

Cut up block of cheese into thin pieces, bake in rectangle cake pan at 350 until crispy bubbly. Hot oil warning. scrape out and put on rack, wipe off grease, eat when room temp. Great work!  Keep it up!!I was stupid and did not take any photos before I started the diet to do a propper before/after so these will have to do. I had a customer take some photos of me at work today for a comparison.  http://imgur.com/a/kNEQVHa! Yeah, I was scratching my head on this one.  I'm not aware of *anyone* gaining weight on Keto. Maybe keeping weight the same, but not gaining... Good job! isn't it great? your loss is my inspiration! this is going make me work that much harder!Looks tasty! What
 brand is the gravy?What im trying to say is is there anywhere where i can get a simple rubric of the exact amount of fat, carbs, sodium, etc, i should be consuming a day? DeglazeI don't get it, if you're a really picky eater then wouldn't it make the most sense to bake something yourself? then you can control exactly what goes into it.Did you do your keto calculator to find out your macros?  How many grams of fat and protein?  1700 calories seems high to me but that depends on your weight and other factors, not how large or small boned you are.  Definitely aim for 20 grams of carbs than to 'ease' in with 35g.  The foods you should be eating should keep you very satisfied and not very hungry, IMO... like today I only ate 760 calories when I am aiming for 1160 and I didn't feel hungry AT ALL.    Everyone's different though!Personally, I don't let my exercise change my dietary goals.  I wouldn't do it.I'd let it go.  You don't want to eat at a huge deficit regularly, but you're still getting adapted.  Work on getting your protein goal met.  After that, you have a little flexibility.I just read the entire faq. I get how it works and everything but, i would really like a tool of some sort that tells me exactly what to eat. All the things i have to remember to do seems like alot. Is there anything that can tell me exactly what to eat and how much?Depends on the sweeteners. But erythritol and stevia are classified as ok, so you should be good. :)

Edit: that is, artificial sweeteners haven't been known to cause candida, but a lot of people use stuff like nectars, palm sugars, date syrups as alternative sweeteners which are, at the end of the day, still sugar no matter how natural they are.I've eaten avocados all my life...we had a tree in the backyard when I was a kid.  And I have NEVER tried pan frying them.  Breakfast.  Tomorrow.  Thanks.Yeah it seems to be slim on choices, which is why I was going for the online consultations. I found one that I can drive to once and see if she can give advice on the phone after, but I don't know how useful that is for business for her :/Yes! Though modified from female to male.Woot! Great job!

Btw is that tat "flowers in the attic"?This weekend will be ALL #10Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

*takes in breath*

Ooooooooooooooooo! Guess I'll stick with Halo TopKeep your electrolytes up and your energy levels will come back, too.  Start now.

Brain function improves on keto.  It works for all kinds of neurological disorders and anecdotally works for the rest of us too.  The brain needs some carbs, but your body produces them on an as-needed basis so they aren't running around messing up the rest of your body.  You do NOT need to eat carbs.  There is no evidence that you do.  I've seen the articles and they are just guesses based on wishful thinking and zero science.What restaurant options are available to you?  Without this info, we can't really tell you where to go and what to get.  We need some pics!Nsv right there.That first week was low electrolytes.  Betcha anything.You look very mature for 25.Yeah, it's a crazy-maker, huh?Yep.  Electrolytes.I've been on keto for 3 years now. I recently had a major cheat weekend (crepes, holy shit, crepes) and decided to go back to super mega serious keto the next day. In all this time, after so many occasions going in and out of keto, this time I had the craziest keto flu of all. My bones ached, I swear. I was so tired, so laggy, I felt as though I could hardly stand. The strongest effect that I noticed though was the brain fog. I've never experienced it before (as far as I recall) but this time it was insane. I felt like I could hardly even open my mouth to talk. I could barely move my tongue. And I had to ask people to repeat themselves 10 times because I just didn't understand anything being said to me.

It was very strange. I've never had a keto transition like that before.

Either way, I'm on the other end of that now. I feel extremely energetic and upbeat. Totally, completely with it. Maybe even more so. I truly feel as though a fog has been lifted. So just stick with it, there is light on the other end of the tunnel, and it is good, baby!Just buy on on Amazon or ebay or something.  I have one to weight wool fiber and sometimes yarn.  Lots of handspinners and knitters do.  I imagine their are other occupations and hobbies (non-drug related hobbies) where scales are useful.  I'm not sure how many drug dealers weigh their broccoli at the table.  :DYou can buy it online or at a store. You're not going to raise any red flags. Small scales like that are used for a lot of things. Just did a quick search and you can get one at Walmart, Staples, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. I had a coworker once who lost nearly 100 lbs.  Everybody supported her while she was dieting, and everybody told her how great she looked.  She blew up one day, screaming that people were really just telling her how ugly she used to be when she was fat and on and on.  The rant went on for quite a while.  (I never heard anyone say she was fat to her face or behind her back.)

I no longer talk to people about their weight unless they bring it up.Thank you! I currently do pretty basic weight training at the gym. I go 7 times a week. I do legs 2x a week, chest 2x a week, and a shoulder day, back day, arm day, and and i will switch out a chest or leg day for an accessory day. Im not a good cook but i can do basic things like cook things on the stove and in the oven.I'm 5'11''. I have a very strange work school schedule I have early morning classes and I work until the early morning so I rarely have more than one chance a day to eat. I love to cook so I usually make one delicious meal a day for myself and tend to stay under 10g carbs.  my goal is to stay under 20 grams of carbs but I hunt and fish a lot so I have a freezer full of different kinds of meats and fish. I take a gummy bear multivitamin because im an adult and im not getting lots of vitamins from meats and if I don't have time to cook, i make a big salad that usually gets me through the day.

also, I fast one day a week. not on purpose, I just get really busy sometimes and forget.That is great to hear, thank you so much!
Thats, just. Wow!  Great job man.You need the minimum amounts  long term, you may need a little more when you're initially losing a bunch of water weight.

The big key to remeber for keto is that its not a diet - its not short term - its a lifestyle.  Its a long-haul endeavor.
Best wishes!electrolytes?  Better deliver, OP!its definitely an odd situation and sometimes an HR nightmare to comment on someone's weight - While you would welcome it, some people would actually be offended.

The other thing is, when you see someone every day, its not as noticable as when you only see them once a week/month/etc.

What matters is that you're doing great.  Keep it up :)
If we gave a rats ass what other people thought, we'd all be eating rice cakes and gain weight.How tall are you? What has been your routine?How do I acquire a pocket sale without looking like a pot head?at home - or when preparing meals to go, at home.  You pretty much get an eye for it when you're away - but if you can, use a scale.
I don't measure everything - I'm pretty well versed at measuring by size for meat - I spent years in restaurant kitchens, not to mention being a creature of habit.  I know that at some point when I get closer to my goal, I'll have to measure a bit more.For me I feel like routines helped. I do kerrygold grassfed butter in my coffee each morning, probably a little over a tablespoon, just eyeballed it really.

Then lunch is a ton of baby spinach or spring mix with sriacha chicken and some blue cheese dressing, possibly some more fun protein like bacon or salmon if I planned ahead. Definitely avacados in the mix.

I would usually have 1 or 2 cheese sticks a day as snacks intermittently.

Dinner has usually been pretty big. Sometimes a big ass steak with some spaghetti squash, a bunch of wings, slab of fish, pound of shrimp, 4 egg omelet w/ bacon, pretty much anything goes.

I take a multivitamin and fish oil, try to keep potassium levels right, tracking all of this in myfitnesspal. Average day is about 1400-1500 calories, 20-30 carbs.

I like to party way too much and I admittedly had to kind of tone that piece down. I drink vodka soda or occasionally a light beer or two, but only one night a week.

I do no cardio to speak of, but I have been doing a little lifting 3-4 days a week. Planning on ramping that piece up and upping carbs to about 50, calories to 2000 or so.

 I always get a headache as I'm transitioning back to keto after having come out, but once I get through it (12 hours or so), it's easy street. I noticed increased energy and focus, weirdly enough. I'm never hungry, my joints feel better, I sleep better, I feel more even keeled. Who knows which of these are a product of being more at peace myself, but again, it's been great.

Good luck to you all!I just disabled it this morning. I hated that it would tell me that I had gained -150 calories because of exercise and it would take it off my totals. I don't eat my exercise calories so I am actually considering un-linking my polar loop. It is just frustrating to see that it thinks I gave burned an extra 600 calories and I have a 1000 calorie deficit yet I am not losingA food scale is more accurate. You can get one for home and a smaller pocket scale for when you're at work or away from home. If you don't mind using it in public, pocket scales are more discrete than most kitchen scales. [This one](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Weigh-DBL1KG-Back-lit-Function/dp/B00GS86NJK/ref=sr_1_14?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427944273&amp;sr=1-14), for example, is very small and has a 1,000g (roughly 35 oz) capacity.I made cheese chips by baking cheese cut thin @350 until bubbly and crispy. Then I made cheese sauce with the special salt citrate and used cheese chips to dip into cheese sauce.

Was glorious . 10/10 will repeat sometime probablyFor the most part I eat at home, or foods that I've prepared. When I eat out, I accept that my calculations are probably under estimating ( it's human nature ) . So I try to calculate it worst case scenario. I checked out Loseit but will be sticking with MFP after seeing the $40 yearly charge for the premium features. I'm too cheap for all that. Try not to let it bug you.  I think that commenting on a coworkers appearance (especially with weight-related topics) is kinda risky and could end up being an awkward, uncomfortable situation.

Looks like you are killing it, so just keep keto'ing on!I actually bought a tortilla press to make these and pressed them inbetween waxed paper (same, no coconut flour).  I fried them in a well seasoned cast iron and had no trouble with them sticking at all.

They are good!!That's such an awesome NSV!  I can kinda relate to the necklace one, but my fingers have always remained skinny even though I was almost in the obese BMI so I haven't experienced that with any of my rings and sometimes it's like "have I even lost weight?!"Gloriously, gloriously gluttonous :)I use a cast iron for almost everything and cook up some spinach after to soak it all up.To be honest, I don't know if I'd eat this.  That looks gluttonous.



**Bring on the downvotes.And Canada too. I'm disappointed at how difficult it's becoming to find products with pure ingredients, such as whipping/heavy cream, full fat sour cream (added corn starch, carrageenan), full fat cottage cheese (added corn starch, carrageenan), full fat cream cheese (added locust bean gum), etc.I'll ship you someThank you very much!! :D You got this!!Thank you!! :)It's a shame they didn't combine properly, but I'm glad they tasted good. Thanks for the tip about the lemon. :)You got this!! Don't give up!! :)You're my kind of guy, EatLard.AWESOME!! :) Thank you for posting this! We look a lot alike, and I'm just getting started.  This gives me hope!I made these for the second time a couple days ago, and they're *really really good*. I had much better luck rolling them out between two pieces of saran wrap (no coconut flour needed) than on a silpat, though. You can get them a whole lot thinner (they do "plump up" a bit when you cook them) and the stuff won't stick all over the place. Definitely use a nonstick pan to cook them.Wonderful news! They're one of my go-tos between work and school when I neglect to pack a lunch/dinner for the day. Seeing as I've been struggling to go over 10 net carbs, not a huge problem for me.Read up and ordered some. Thank you! +1 on magnesium. Most grain rich foods contain these, and supplementing will help. I believe it also helps with sleep. Besides that, fibrous veggies to space out the heavy foods and you'll be good as gold in no time. Amazing -- congrats!Wow! super creepy but we have such similar stats (F, 5'10, SW 280, CW 249)! I've also lost 31 pounds as of today! Congrats! :DI ordered from them a long time ago and for sugar free chocolate it was good. I've also tried Lily's, which I found at Whole Foods. They're tasty, but I found that more than a little gave me a stomachache. In general, I'd skip it. Plus it's all kind of spendy for what it is.Welcome slyburger13!  I think it is awesome that you've been hitting the gym, 10lbs. is a great start!

Tell us a little more about yourself. What are you doing at the gym? What are your goals?

How much cooking do you do now? Are you comfortable with really simple recipes, or more in depth food prep? Do you pack lunches/bring snacks with you, or do you tend to eat out more? (Hint: it is waaaaay cheaper to make your own food...)

Run a keto calulator and post your stats from it as well please! Maybe try http://www.ruled.me/keto-calculator/

Also, you may want to try myfitesspal, there are tons of ketards on there.

Read through "Keto in a nutshell" for a quick 2 page read, and if it seems like it might be a good fit, read more through the FAQs, which gets into the nitty gritty.

Good luck!!I was so concerned for you! great work and happy april fools!I'm on off keto. But once I started Keto I don't really crave sweets aside from gum which is sugar free already. Oh that and girl scout cookies is a weak point for me. But general cakes and cookies and stuff, I don't really care for. Still tastes good but I don't scream out for them.

You will do the same soon enough,Feet, ankles, calves - and hands, my wedding ring isn't crazy tight any more and I can wear a watch that has been in the drawer forever when the band wouldn't fit.Well hello there... :)

Haha just kidding but your progress is great and your banksy tat is very cool as well! Im just as surprised as youanytime I want to cook something that's not strictly keto I look for a replacement on r/ketorecipesyeah I just sautee with olive oil until soft, just a couple minutes. My bf eats his with pesto :) They are pretty similar to pasta actually, and you can control firmness with how much you cook them.If you're looking at the picture of cheesy goodness it's just a tortilla :)
I've tried a few pizza crusts so far and the 'great low carb bread company' makes one thats pretty good and much easier than the homemade kind Oh totally. I'm trying to take photos every 3 weeks to a month so when I start lifting and toning I can really see any new definition. I figured I'd ask his opinion (he keeps saying he notices something but I don't believe it since it's all water weight) and boy did he ever deliver hahaThat's shockingly fast.You are living the keto dream!
This is really true.  After a couple months of keto I found myself going the entire day and forgetting to even eat, so I made some like 10 carb sausage biscuits just because I figured I should eat something.

Now, drinking is a different story.  Keto makes me feel like I've run a marathon in the desert.  Always thirsty as hell lol.  I guess that helps with the weight loss though.

I think that's one reason why keto is so great.  It's not like you're fighting to resist carbs to stay on your "diet" at least for me.  I also don't count calories either.  I guess some people may need to, but I seem to naturally only eat what I need somehow.  If I were eating pizza and subs that sure as hell wouldn't apply.Nice!!!!I'll let Jimmy talk about it, you can also google lots of great info

Welcome to Keto! You've made an excellent choice. Have a look through the resources in the sidebar - let us know if you have specific questions. went from 320 down to 240 todayHahaha. When I first started I had dreams about eating cake and other sweets all night long. It was really messed up.That is great to hear. What exactly is MCT? You lost 80 pounds in 3 months?My first three weeks I was terribly tired and had low energy, can't say for sure if i had a mental fog or just plain tired, i think i fixed it by fixing my electrolytes.

After that I noticed a sharp increase in my mental focus and clarity, beyond what i expected.  I was very cynical of people claiming increased mental clarity, but it's true.

I started supplementing with MCT oil a couple of weeks ago and all I can say is WOW, I noticed an almost immediate difference, within 20 minutes and I just stay mentally sharp and alert all day, even if physically tired, i've never felt anything like this before and it's hard to put into words, but it's a hightened state of awareness for sure.yes. yes we desperately need a pictureEven easier!  I'll look for it the next time I'm at the grocery store. Thanks!Wow! Best reason ever!!Nicely done!Yeah, this first week or 2 in the gym will be pretty steady and slow since I'll probably be going thru keto flu.  Week three I will probably ramp it up.  I'll check out the calc, thanks!YUM.
What is that pizza crust made out of?Store bought :3 I was at my girlfriends and her parents make sausage gravy and I saw him make it and it had only like a tablespoon of flour and a pinch of milk, so when I saw "Sausage gravy" at the store I was intrigued, and looked on the box. 4 servings, 3 carbs per serving. I used 2 servings on this, so 6 carbs for the gravy, ~2 for the biscuit, and the rest probably snuck in (i counted a little high)It is good to hear a positive story about brain function. I think I am over thinking this because I am still adjusting to the diet. Thanks for your help. Do you have a recipe for the gravy?  Looks fantastic!!Keto Calculator in the sidebar! So very useful.  1500 seems on the low side. At 5'5 and 137 lbs I am eating 1700/day (as recommended by the calculator) and losing steadily.  Granted, I have a fairly intensive training schedule atm but given your rowing background I'd be willing to bet your gym time is fairly balls to the wall!  Good luck!Looks great, but also looks like it is a 1400 calorie meal give or take a couple hundred if you were to eat the whole thing..Awesome tip :) thanks!Do you have a source for that? When I checked Taco Bell's nutrition facts on their website, all three had 0. I think you should wait awhile before expecting people to notice your progress. A good bit of your weight loss so far would be water, and since you don't have a ton to lose it might take a little longer to see results. :)say you can't eat grains right now but you're happy to meet up with them after :)?I came to Keto from years of Atkins, so the transitional period wasn't all that difficult for me.  Without a doubt, my mental faculty has improved now that I'm actually keeping myself in ketosis.  I do a lot of predictive analysis and statistical modeling, and nowadays I can remain focused on these complex analyses for hours without brain drain.  There's no chance I'd consider going back to carbs.

It might take you a while to get through the mental fog that comes with your body struggling to figure out what it's supposed to be doing, but once beyond that you'll likely start to see more and more benefits (both physical and mental) as time progresses.

Another fun one that blows my mind:  I now wake up easily in the morning when I'm supposed to.  Since I was a teenager, I've never been able to get going in the morning well.  Always late for school, always foggy for quite some time in the morning.  Nowadays my eyes pop open and I'm wakeful within a few minutes.  Thanks, keto.I fully intend to stay informed and continue researching for myself. I just know there's no way I could ever read every article and peer reviewed paper on the topic so I thought I would ask a well-informed group for some direction. I didn't mean to come across as lazy for asking :/Seriously? Sure seems like some people in this subreddit are so adamant "CARBS ARE EVIL!!!" What is so unhealthy about a  banana, sweet potatoes, carrots, squash, oatmeal, beans, etc?

These are all complex carbs that are rich in nutrients. Meanwhile many people who say those foods are bad, in the next breath they say they eat a ton of artificial sweetened, highly processed foods that are keto friendly.

Sorry, but there is no way a hot dog (sans bun) washed down with a zero coke and a quest bar is more healthy than quinoa with grilled chicken


Dont get me wrong, I sometimes do indulge in the processed keto foods, but generally try to stick to whole foods.
The main thing is knowing what to eat. Take this less as a fuck up and more the stepping stones to the path of keto. The important thing here is you lowering your carbs and you realizing what it takes. It may be rocky but you'll get there. The first day you eat under 20 should be counted as day one. Let these be your transition periods. Nice work!  I bet it feels great to feel stronger too!My mouth is watering.  I started keto a week ago and I'm realizing there are SO many amazing foods to try ... I'm kind of a foodie and I just get so dang excited about new kinds of food!You CAN'T.

Once you go keto, you never go back. Haha I found your post! Thanks for bringing that home today ;)Oh no! Someone drew on your chest with a sharpie and a neon pink marker! And it didn't wash off!Oh man... I love malasadas.  The haupia or the guava ones from Leonard's are the best!  Good job on staring them down because that takes a LOT of will power!That's fantastic!  Nice work!  It's good to see that your body loves the diet changes!Have you read the FAQ yet ? That's a really great place to start ! i appreciate you coming to my defense but its my fault I did say any errors and it was an error. =pBad habits are hard to break but give it a good solid month of no cheats and the cravings will fade. Here are some places you can look...

http://marathonswimmers.org/blog/2011/12/nutrition-vs-diet/

http://eatingacademy.com/how-a-low-carb-diet-affected-my-athletic-performance

Mark's Daily Apple has some good info on carb refueling, this is a pretty good article.  http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-athlete-compromises/#axzz3W6wkepw0
oh i calculated the net carbs as the carbs sorry. I didn't originally intend to be sharing this so i didnt bother having extra math so I just cut that part out. The carbs you see are the net carbs (unless my calculations are wrong =p).not quite what i was looking for but technically it is an error and i appreciate it nonetheless. thanks!It's not bad - you want to do a quick sautee on them, or just use ambient heat from the sauce to cook them a little to keep their texture. They'll fall apart quickly if you cook them too much.Saw the head of the hammer off. Or put padding around it.awesome How do those zoodles hold up as far as texture goes? My boyfriend loves zucchini, loves Italian food, and is keto with me. This looks so freaking delicious.MCT = Medium Chain Triglycerides

The most likely source for these in your diet would be coconut oil. Some people have GI upset after intake of MCT oils.

For potassium:

Greens (particularly spinach but not really kale)
Mushrooms
Yogurt
Bone Broth
Acorn Squash
Fish
Avocados

Even with these things it can be somewhat difficult for a ketoer to get enough. You may want to supplement. You can pick up salt substitute at any grocery store (it is called nu-salt or no salt) in the section with the salt. 1/4 tsp of that stuff is usually about 20% your daily needs.

Yes, I am going to try this. I'll be honest, I am kind of a shy person and making new friends is kind of scary for me, but I'll definitely give it a try! Yes, they would pressure me to consume carbs and make a big deal out of it. It got to the point where they would attempt to force feed me croissants or pasta or make me drinks and tell me to "don't ask questions just drink it" followed by a "YOLO" or something to that effect. Geez, I'm starting to realize they were all assholes to me. Thank you for this well thought out reply. I enjoyed reading it and I think I am going to expand my fasting behaviors based on what you have said.

I have been doing IF for a little while and I am liking it. I awaken and have coffee + unsweetend coconut milk/almond milk with a bit of coconut oil for breakfast.

Then from ~2-10 I am allowed to have:
Keto lunch (sometimes I do sometimes I just wait for dinner and have some nuts)
Keto dinner
Keto dessert
~as long as it fits my macros!~

I haven't thought to try minimalism days like you mentioned, nor a longer fast. I have only been doing keto 2-3 months but feel I have lost at least 20lbs. (No scale). If I could be more strict I think things could go even better. (I can't be further than 35 lbs from my GW and I am under-defined in the muscular department)

After reading your posts I think you've planted a seed. I have had carb cravings myself and I find it's much easier to stick to my macros if I am strict starting with my coffee in the morning. If this discipline can be increased through fasting, let's have it!

So again, thanks to you and all the others in this thread and /r/keto that are constantly helping to remind me how to achieve my goals! :DTrue. I'm boxing the sweet stuff up and putting it on the high shelf. I'm not ready to throw it away, yet.How fucking dare you like something I don't.I don't think I was. When it came down to making plans, all anyone wanted to do was eat pizza and drink beer. They would all get annoyed when I'd only eat wings or scrapped the cheese and toppings from pizza and leave the crust, haha. It had the potential to be catastrophic, diet wise. But I stuck to it and went jogging after work. I feel much better :) kinda proud of myself :)Yes! I make them and dip them in guac I would change that to say "some sources, the ones I've searched to match my opinion, agree with me" ;)salad, meat, hard boiled eggs, cabbage, dressing and cheesecake. Somedays it's leftovers.I'm not a big fan of sweetened coffee. Its either black, or I'll add some HWC. I've been making sugar free jello, adding stevia to almond milk &amp; making hot cocoa, drinking mio, chewing SFgum, etcWe had a D'lites in NC for many many years but I think they may have all closed&gt;Day three

&gt;Day two I slipped a bit and had 100

Hate to break it to you but it's actually day 1.Could be but I doubt it. I've been eating Avocados daily, salt my food like it's going out of fashion and I also take multivitamins and even had some magnesium the other night after cramping up in the pool. I might just ride it out and see what happens.I didn't realize that artificial sugar caused candida flair-ups. I primarily use erythritol &amp; stevia, as sweeteners.http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/
The macros are where you set your food intake the link above is a calculator.Yeah I know I really fucked myself with that 100 day slip up.  I've just been using the ratios for MFP, so maybe I should start being more exact.This place did. No guarantees. I also imagine this probably wouldn't work at an AYCE place either lol . They want you to fill up on rice Thanks for replying. Appreciated.Freelee should change her name to Troller McTrollington. What a troll. I agree! I actually want a deep frier now. I'd like to make these.

http://www.ruled.me/keto-tortilla-chips/Tomorrow, the artificial sweeteners are going in a box. I'm going to try to stay off for a month and see how I feel.

I liked your idea about teas. I'll be making a couple different kinds tomorrow. I grill up meats and cook veggies and portion them out in storage containers and take them to work.  I just toss them in the microwave and eat them at work.
If I need a changeup I make egg salad with some hard boiled eggs that I always have at work.  Here's some of what I've had lately:

* Mongolian BBQ, usually chicken + shrimp with some mushrooms, a smattering of onions and a huge pile of broccoli. Some soy sauce for flavor.
* Baked salmon Caesar salad with blue cheese dressing, Parmesan, bacon, and walnuts
* Spice-rubbed pork tenderloin with grilled asparagus

Did I mention where I work has awesome restaurants on campus? And that each of the above are about $6?if its bacon fat, throw it in a grease can in the fridge - cook everything in it :)
If its other fat, wipe it out with paper towels or pour in a grease can and toss in the trash.
I don't really have this issue - I grill most meats - I will fry wild game tho - in bacon fat.That 100 carb day isnt helping, neither really is 35g a day. Aim for 20, drop whatever is putting you over.
You mentioned 60% fat but ratios are useless, use the calc in the side bar and figure out your personalized macros in grams.
Don't count calories until the cravings go away.  Until then eat as much fatty keto food as you need to.

The hunger is temporary so eat. In a week or so you'll stop getting hungry and you can start counting calories. a water bottle :)
keep your electrolytes up.
Do you have a Menchies?  Their low carb/no sugar added frozen yogurts are pretty damn good.Since you mentioned a higher deficit, I would start here and see how it goes the first week or so.  You really need your carbs pretty low in the beginning to make sure you get in ketosis.  There should be nothing really hard about it. Chicken thighs, meats, eggs, veggies. $300 a month is plenty. Find out the days your butchers at the store mark down the meat, then you can get it at a significant savings and freeze it. Pay attention to sale circulars, buy what is on sale. There is no reason you cannot do this on $75/week

I clicked on this link thinking it was in r/bisexy. It was not. Still going to try.Fantastic!  Thanks for replying.  wait they will really substitute the rice? i'm drooling.Day 4 is when many people run out of electrolytes.  That's all you have to do to get over keto flu is replenish sodium, potassium, and magnesium.  You can drink broth for sodium (or just salt your food lots, eat salty foods like cheese, pepperoni, pickles).  I use No Salt for potassium.  Avocados are also a good source.  And I take a magnesium citrate supplement.this was perfect, thank you.Yeah am drinking Almond milk also. On the whole ingrained since birth thing, I am quite lucky being from an Eastern European family and we love out fats so that whole side of it I already had, for me its just the no to little carbs that has been a learning curve.

When you say Macro's this is the part I think I am having trouble with. Can you explain what a macro is and what proportions it is recommended to eat within?Grease jar.
I also always at least rinse the pan with soap and water before it cools down. This will get 90% of it off and keep anything from sticking. take them out - show them a good time.  Enjoy yourself.  Eat keto friendly.
Stop freaking out about what they think - do your thing.I don't think it's a big deal. I bought some last night and I haven't even been on keto 2 full weeks. I was a huge sugar person and I had a little bit and was like "meh, this kinda sucks compared to B&amp;J". The world did not end or anything. me neither! i know i can eat eggs and sausage but i'm concerned their choices of bacon or sausage will have loads of added sugar into it.hahaha i just noticed ur name.  the irony is strong with this oneThose would be amazing for a fish taco - just a short dip in the deep fryer to give them a little oompfh!  oh it's not that my friends hate me and what not! They just don't really KNOW my diet, like they don't understand what i can and can't eat, to them sushi shouldn't have carbs and its hard explaining keto to them.At restaurants, go for bunless burgers, steaks, non-starchy veggies, grilled chicken, salads with unbreaded meat and full-fat dressings.  Liquor instead of beer?  Or just offer to be the designated driver!probably just keto flu and your brain getting in the way of the science - its been ingrained in you since birth that you need carbs and to not eat fat.

without seeing what you're eating (not just menu items, but quantities as well as your macros) there's not much we can tell you that you obviously don't already know - the food choices are good - just make sure to stay within your macros.
I'd consider ditching the cows milk for coconut or almond milk though.  30lbs down, i began getting a jaw line and my clothing was lose. Perhaps I just missed it... where is the fiber column?  How are you calculating net carbs?Yup, looks great. Working my way up to a 10 mile swim this summer. I'm find keto very helpful. Still working out the proper carb intake, but I don't need to feed as often. I'm also using Genucan for most fueling- doesn't spike my blood sugar.You look great! So motivating!!Yes, well, my point was that two wrongs don't make a right.  You've got to let the little stuff go and not jump down people's throats for grammatical errors."A mere 65g of carbs. Lowcarbolicious."
Sorry but that really should be false advertising.  Although I like that they are actually making a couple of options.  20 McNuggets has 57 carbs.Thank you so much! :)YOU GOT THIS!!!! Thanks!! I didn't even notice until I put the pictures side by side! :Pthanks for the good wishes!This will be good for me.  My alcohol tolerance is abnormally high.  3 weeks before graduation I had to give an hour long coding presentation with live code.  (any programmers out there know this is never a good idea)  I had 7 shots of whiskey and 5 beers in 1 hour before the presentation and killed it.  Everyone at the bar who came with me before the pres thought I was gonna just be slurring and stumbling like an idiot.  When I finished they all said to me "That was incredible, and that was the best presentation anyone has given....... but there's something seriously wrong with you"yeah, probably.  but definitely not 'I'.I like the 20 gram target because you can't make excuses to squeeze in some really shitty foods and still be under.And this is one of the reasons I love Reddit.This. Cant stress it enuf xD
.... I would literally kill for that.I've only read 8 carbs per cup... including fiber.  Taking out the fiber makes it a little less than 5 carbs per cup.  Pretty comparable to most leafy green vegetables.  Keep up the great work. Doing awesome.Those green beans don't appear to have anything on them, no bacon... no brown sugar. They look like steamed green beans to me :)i am not.i don't drink soda.good plan! i like the phrase wonderful turds. and i have't had a cheat day in a while.It would. If you remove "my wife" it wouldn't be "for I" or "for me."I take a multi without iron since that's what is making you puke. Then I take slow release iron tablet separately at night, since caffeine (in my coffee) inhibits iron absorption anyway. hmmm i eat stuff with sugar alcohol but not very often, maybe like once or twice a month?i believe i am, i could be wrong though
just a multivitamin and a melatonin supplement.Electrolytes and water.  i don't eat coconut oilyes i do.
Hmm a lot of people are saying that i will give it a shot. Where can you get potassium besides bananas?Wouldn't it be "for my wife and myself".Get some food in the house you can grab without a fuss.  Hard boiled eggs, salami, jerky, maybe some nuts, pork rinds. Go where they go and eat what you can.  Call ahead or look up menus to see what you can order ahead of time.  They drink beer, you drink diet soda or iced tea or water.  Eat some keto foods before you go out and eat some more when you get back home.  Remind yourself often *why* you're not have "just one little slice."  Answer:  because there is no such thing.

Be calm.  You can do it.i think i'm eating a good balance of everything.Did it become greasy tho? Like melted the fats?What are MCT oils? and where can i get potassium (besides bananas)That's the crazy part about all this! I started right about when you did and my old food cravings are nil. I used to feel constantly hungry. Now lunch will come and pass without me thinking "man I'm so hungry, I need some food."I eat a ton of avocado! thanks!Thanks!hmm i'm not sure. i eat plenty of leafy greens, a salad almost daily. maybe a potassium imbalance though.I just started Keto today, at the grocery store my mind was yelling "GRAB THE OREOS, LOOK AT THE CHIPS, ZOMG BREAD"

Your continued success gives me confidence that I can do it.  Thank you.I wish you the best of luck! Keto severely lowers your alcohol tolerance so maybe you won't even want to drink after your first nightmare keto hangover. For me it's had sort of the wrong effect cause I can now get drunk on 2-3 drinks and it's very cheap. Oops.My back went out but adherence to the diet has allowed the pounds to come off.  I agree, you should be proud! This is a very noticeable improvement! that's possible.
New Orleans?? LMAO dude!!  That sounds impossible.  Every time I drink heavily I smoke like a chimney, it's the worst.  I'm gonna try and cut down the drinking to once a week.  And I'm going to try and cut down the cigs to 10 a day, then after a week, 7 a day, week after 5 a day, week after 3/2 a day.  Then I'll see if I can just quit altogether.  I think with a solid workout regime and the keto I can successfully do it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSg8aAnDIzk&amp;list=PLRWE2iy8FZ2a6UYVMdVHoCSv1eaLXYxb1

Jeff Volek is an endurance athlete and a lot of his work is with competitive runners, swimmers, triathletes, things like that.  Take a look.This. I've found it amazing how easy I have found it to fast for a day on keto. I've had this happen many times as well.  When I researched it I found a bunch of articles suggesting that the closer you get to your goal the more frequently you should have a maintenance level day to reset leptin levels.  I am by no means an expert on this but that is what I have read.From my experience as a life long competitive swimmer I wouldn't suggest it and most sources agree with me.  Carbs are very important for swimmers (see this article http://www.usaswimming.org/ViewNewsArticle.aspx?TabId=0&amp;Alias=Rainbow&amp;Lang=en&amp;ItemId=7782&amp;mid=11545 ).  In fact it is suggested for swimmers to have a food plan with 60% carbs ( http://studenthealth.ucsd.edu/pdfdocs/swimmers.pdf ).  USA swimming specifically recommends that swimmer should NOT do keto.Thanks for the warm welcome and thanks for the shopping list!  Any advice on how many calories I should be eating?

I'm 6'0
215lbs

I will be working out about an hour a day, 4 days a week.

I was thinking 1500 CAD would be a good start?Haha, yeah. I've quit several times for months but I always end up doing that as well. I really think I need to stop drinking in order to stop smoking for good because every time I drink I want to smoke. But I live in New Orleans and my favorite bar is a block away, so.... gonna take a lot of willpower :PHave you possibly considered just eating fish? Annoying Vegans will tell you that flesh is flesh, but vegetarians I know (my partner is a vegetarian who I've slowly managed to move towards eating fish for better health) found it far easier to accept eating fish for dietary reasons than all meat.

Either way, happy to hear you're doing so well. Oh, I had those once, in Portugal, sometime in the last century.  Those would be hard to pass up.  You deserve a big congratulations.  You've come way to far to let a momentary taste derail all your hard work.   Really good job!glad to hear it, you really have to want to quit.  I quit for 3 months a couple years ago, I didn't however stay strong.  I said "oh i can have just one"  NOPE.My most simple suggestion is to not make the whole recipe.  Only make what you cam fit in your day's macros. I have to do that or I will eat all the cheesecake.  Also it's time to find new treats. Keto has made me look for new foods to try (and I am not a new food person). The most satisfying low carb low calorie snack I've found is no sugar added bread and butter pickles. They're sweet and you feel like you're actually eating something unlike the jello and cool whip route.I once made the mistake of taking multivitamins while eating a cheese stick and maybe a dozen small pepperoni slices.

I vomited that right out in 2 minutes.

I am always worried and want to make sure I eat more than enough when taking those.Sometimes tap water tastes as sweet as I remember soda. Nah, this has been posted many times before with many variations.WatEat keto friendly food, make smart decisions, stay keto, enjoy time with your family I bulk cook all of my dinners on a Sunday. This week I've made a sag paneer, I bought two blocks of paneer cheese and a kilo bag of frozen spinach. I already have the curry spices in the house. It cost 3.90 for six meals altogether.

Last week I made a keto fish pie with cauliflower mash, frozen whitefish (I use pollock or basa) and some heavy cream and spices. This cost about five pounds and I made seven dinners from it.

The week before I made a dead easy Quorn chicken curry with cauliflower rice. It cost about 4 for five meals worth.

If you have a microwave at work, all of these things would work as lunches (or, let's face it, leftover curry totally works cold). For my lunch I tend to mix cheese and tuna mayo. Quick and easy to make and very filling. Thank you kind sir!! Chest/shoulders/waist area. I gain weight in a really top-heavy way, so it's been a relief to watch the weight come off there. Also face, for sure. I can tell when I have a big cheesy smile that my features are more defined.Thank you!

Your progress is amazing. You are so close to having lost 100 pounds!You are 16 years old? You have been doing low carb for a month? As they say Keep Calm and Keto On. Your system is still growing. Your brain is growing. You shouldn't be eating at such a deficit, whether it be just eggs or anything else. You need fuel still. Your essentially starving yourself. You need more calories for sure. I'm not going to go on the bandwagon of you might have an ed. I am going to start one that you need to look at your macros and start there.

Keto gives you a lot of energy. 50g carbs might be too much, though.I'm soooooooooo jealous! Do you take any medications in the evenings? I finally connected one of mine with my nighttime snacking, since it's known to cause weight gain due to increased appetite. Halving the dose plus exerting more self control helped a lot Tuna with Mayo, 30g of grated cheese and put in the microwave for thirty seconds to melt.

So I kept stepping on and off.  I've started eating less, I'm less hungry, and I think my postpartum hormones are working with me instead of against me.I have an analog scale.

Congrats, glad to hear! You're welcome, glad to help out.You should be relaxing when you eat, eat slow. Your brain takes aprox. 15-20 minutes to register that it is full. Like many mentioned, you should stop with the sugary stuff when starting keto, it is a batlle of the mind at first. Try eating half an avocado with 1 tbsp of mayo when snacking at night, it will make you feel full and help you with any heart palpitation because of the potassium in the avocados. Hope this help.I used to think fasting was about having zero solid food, but I realized that you can fast by eating "real" food, just much smaller amounts.

With "alternate day fasting" the definition of fasting is eating only about 20% of the calories you usually would IIRC.

So you can eat fat and protein, but just not a whole lot of it, or a whole lot at one time.

Even then, there is an intermittent fasting program where you eat all your meals in an 8 hour window and fast the rest of the time, and people have reported healing of health conditions on that diet.

So my "fasting" these days is to eat really late in the day (in the morning I have coffee with half and half or cream) and then wait until later to have a few snacks or whatever.   That way it is not very stressful and it is rather easy to do.

I have found that just eating very lightly for a few days works great to accomplish most of what I want from fasting, and I feel great and feel mentally stronger and need less sleep and get all kinds of other benefits as well.

Total liquid fasting can be rather stressful, especially in the beginning, so I feel like my "lazy fasting" of just a few little snacks here and there works pretty well.

I remember reading about juice fasting and that the people who studied it said that it worked just as well as water fasting, and juice usually has a good amount of carbs in it.

The definition (scientfically) of fasting is being in a state where you have absorbed all the food from your last meal.   So if you eat tiny amounts you will stay in that condition most of the time, and keep adapting your body to make fasting easier.

Just remember that the first time you fast it's going to be pretty difficult usually as your body has a "cleansing reaction" and starts hyperfocusing on food:  any mention of food gets your attention, and you may feel lightheaded, dizzy, weak, etc.

These symptoms usually go away within a day or two, and get replaced by a wonderful feeling of well-being and energy.   After a 5 day fast you feel amazing.

There is also proof that the body regenerates its immune system during 72-hour fast -- it basically digests all the old and damaged immune cells and then creates new one, "rebooting" your immune system.

So there are huge amounts of good things that happen during a fast that science is now finding out about (a quick plug).   It's going great! 25.2 lbs down and feeling extremely energized. Thanks for asking and good luck on your journey as well!There is a shaved ice treat here in korea. You add sweetened condensed milk to it.. I saw a recipe for sugar free sweetened condensed milk on pinterest.. add those two and amazing Work out, lift weights, and don't eat sugar. Looks like they are only in Florida

http://www.tampabaydlites.com/locations.phpWow, that only has 8mg of magnesium per serving!  I take two 250mg tablets per day.  Oh yeah buddy! I'm talking about [these images](http://imgur.com/a/FKkkB) from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/311pp9/bacon_sandwich/)! Imagine combining bacon bread with bacon filling... Where is it? Please tell me it's in Canada...For me it was both my face and my arms.

Shred the chicken. One day you can have chicken salad, then pulled bbq chicken, Buffalo chicken, etc. It lets you change the flavors each day with minimal prepIt's actually \*\*FREE**.Amazing post. Thanks for sharing this info.Please sir! May I have some more?I mean, I'm a really picky eater. So during the week, I'll just make a PB&amp;J sandwich to take to work. (Low carb bread, natural peanut butter, sugar free jam = under 20g). Then at night I just eat hot dogs, beef patties, chicken breast, or fish with cheese. Eat everything just after midnight. No calorie intake for the day.What many on here fail to realize is the keto friendly biscuits, tortillas, bread, cookie, cheesecake etc etc recipes still have a lot of calories that we under estimate.

The more you simplify the diet, the easier it is to avoid binge eating. No thanks, I'm trying to cut back.I wish, but i cant find a place to eat, dont own a car, and generally prefer to have lunch with my coworkers.

I am guessing costco is a store? that is quite cheap! wish we had keto food on stores here as well.

Not trying to find excuses, but the extra $10 a day i receive for lunch can only be used for lunch (it is a prepaid card that only works on restaurants)To each their own, I started out eating at 40%+ deficit and found it super easy to maintain.

I also happen to be stuffed eating at 40% deficit, I wasn't going to get sick trying to eat more haha Half a serving of spinach leaves + water. Low carb, low calorie, healthy, satiating. Still hungry? Other half of the serving + more water.You can also microwave pepperonis and they turn to chips. I bet you could with salami too just watch for how thin you slice them. Burnt meat is just sad.

http://the-lowcarb-diet.com/pepperoni-chips/
Do whatever works for you that lets you eat less calories. That's really what it's about. If you can stop your cravings with 40g of carbs and see results, then do that!My face. My face felt so fat before I started keto. Now I have a jawline again. Also waist, but that's mostly cause it was easy to notice I no longer have to suck in to put on my pants :)Welcome to keto!

Your shopping list looks good. Shopping on keto is easy, just think of foods you like that are keto-friendly and buy them. I'm a programmer and a smoker, also, haha. Keto hasn't helped me with the smoking thus far but it does make me feel amazing about what I'm eating! :)Someone posted a link to [these](http://lowcarbediem.com/fat-bombs-recipes-atkins-ketosis/) yesterday. I made the 'Peanut butter cinnamon chocolate bombs' last night, and am having an insanely difficult time keeping myself from eating the entire thing in one sitting. I'm going to try the 'Deep chocolate coconut bombs' tomorrow, I'm really looking forward to it![This may explain](https://youtu.be/jcfJL51Xia4 )Why not try baking something in bulk, like on a Sunday when you're not working? Then you can just grab and go./r/ketogains It's almost as if everyone has different preferences.Source?Hey do they put batter in the omlettes at IHOP? (Kidding!)I don't know about carbs, but I bet it is loaded with fiber.Pics?totally with you, in the UK entry level cream is high quality and unadulterated, I am always dismayed in the US and Australia how difficult it is to find decent primary food products at a decent price point.I most commonly add a couple of shots of espresso, so it's more like a mocca. I also use tiny glasses. The heavy cream is very rich, so small sips are fine.The merging of these two flavors just made me gag.That's alright. No biggyI bought a cheap shaved ice maker on amazon and I throw some sugar free Torani syrup on it.  You can stir in a bit of heavy cream if you want a texture more like ice creamCool, thanks! My mom loves blue cheese dressing so I should really try to make some!I have the same problem, I know how hard it is. Keto is the only eating way that kept me from binging for 63 days now. I am 43 and the longest I had stayed away fom binging was 4 nights. The biggest change in my diet was to eat as much as I want at the dinner table, then once I get on the cauch I am not hungry and I don't think about food. Satiety is the key. Also another way I kept myself under control is to cook, cause I also tend to binge on snack before dinner. I have been cooking, trying new dished  diligently. First of all it keeps me busy with food which kind of gives me the visual satisfaction and anticipation, second I try to save my hunger for real food. I have started enjoying real meals, dishes and overall good delicious food again. Binging makes me feel like a thrash can and I hate that feeling. I didn't have much to lose to start with May be 5-6 pounds at most but I needed to stop unhealthy eating habits and yo-yo weight. I have lost about 2-3 pounds, kept it off the whole time, and most importantly didn't binge even once in 63 days. When you feel like binging if nothing else works, visit this subreddit, read other's victories, motivational posts, or even struggles or vents. You will see that you aren't alone, and that would give a strength to endure the feeling. Good luck!
Yea, I think it is. I felt really bloated my first week. Make sure you're drinking a ton of water, that might be causing the bloating as well. Blasphemy! Lmao. I picture a lot of bargaining. "Please oh please just one more raspberry!"Precisely. I am trying to impress the fact that 1200 calories from Twinkies and Ice Cream is not the same as 1200 calories from Chicken and Broccoli.That's what I am saying! For sure!!it took me two days to get this - awesome!Thanks!Thank you- it's mostly avocados that I was worried about- they seem to be in every recipe! What are you full stats/height/age/sex, etc ? Thank you for the generously gracious resource! I have a skillet but have only used it for bacon and eggs. I can't wait to get more use out of it!I know I don't need to.  The body fat is estimated, but I'm pretty sure it's not far off.  I can try the 30% , it's only 140 less calories a day.  If I don't like it, I can always go back to 1520.  Thanks!Yes this stuff is great! I have low potassium to start with and these are so much better than the potassium powder they prescribe for that. I keep a box at home and a box at work. They also make a great addition to [hard liquor of choice] and soda water.It's okay. I like your name. You don't need to, just that it is possible. Excess gets drained off into a jar to be used for cooking or as a little bonus for the dogs (they have blindingly shiny coats!) then soak in hot water with some Dawn liquid... the blue kind, not the other stuff.  It's the same stuff I use for cleaning raw fleece.  It emulsifies the grease.

And no, I don't know why the blue kind is better.  It just is.  I've washed a lot of fleece.I'll give it a shot.I have no stories to share, but I'm right there with you. I switched off of sugar years ago and have been using artificial sweeteners ever since (mostly a bunch of diet soda).

Last week, I decided it was time to give them up. I haven't noticed any difference yet, but giving it up was actually a lot easier than I had anticipated (so far).OMG I'm all over this.Every day, each of us can obtain a certain amount of calories based on the amount of fat our bodies contain. The more fat you have stored, the more of a deficit you can tolerate as you can access more calories per day via these reserves. You should be fine with 30% if you're so inclined. Sausage is disgusting. I can't understand how people tolerate it, let alone like it... Do not put it down the sink, pour any excess in a jar or the trash, wipe the pan with a towel and then wash with soap and water Oh I want this but it won't let me get it in my phone :(Thanks.  30%, wow.  Really?  The calculator told me it's a massive deficit.  I guess I could try it.I do this all the time but never thought about using them for keto chips! What a fantastic idea!What I did to keep from binge eating is turn my lock to my room around to the outside of my door. That way I can lock myself in my room and have my parents unlock the door when I stop craving food. That may be a tad extreme though..Pour as much as I can onto my plate and then lick off the rest.Awesome job!  Keep on keeping on.Good catch, didn't even see that.  No way am I wasting 6g of carbs on a itty bitty piece of chocolate LOLI am black :O ruh rohGet a bottle of no salt, put 1/4 teaspoon and a couple of hits of Mio in a BIG glass of ice water.  You wont taste the salt at all and it will give you a good hit of potassium.  As far as magnesium shortage, I just take a supplement pill.I'd recommend eating and then taking the multivitamin. From my own personal experience the few times I've taken the multivitamin on an empty stomach I've had maybe fifteen minutes before I start puking. haha, yeah we both missed big parts of the conversation, haha

Good luck when you get arrested for suspicion of dealing drugs on campus.It's so much easier if you just replace the sugar column with the fiber column and it will always be on your main page :)  I have my carb and fiber side by side.

I've got subtraction down, no worries there ;)That's what mine looks like, I have no problem finding my nutrient details... the part I want to find out is where you said  "Click: More -&gt; Nutrition -&gt; bars on top right -&gt;Subtract Dietary Fiber from Carbs
done"

I thought you were referring to a setting that did that for you, but I realize now you were just telling the OP to manually subtract lol... I have the fiber column as one of my 5 columns so that info always shows on the first screen.  Just a misunderstanding, lol!!!This is amazing!  I'm going to try!

Just so you know, if this is an April fools joke I will murder you.  No joke here, straight murder.  Thanks :)correct. What kind of nasty shit hot dogs have you been eating?You can readily find many articles... here are a few

At 1 carb/serving they are a god-damn godsend for Keto.

Give them a try. Grill 'em until they split and eat with a fork. Yum. This really brings to light the difference between Keto and low carb.  I think the right terminology for us is ultra low carb.  I could just activate the American one albeit having a dutch address though.You misspelled WhiskeyIt can happen anytime you eat too much of anything.  Chill on the processed stuff.

As far as the sushi goes, ask for your sushi without rice.  I do it all the time!

To get an idea of how outsiders see us, imagine visiting a place where toilets are the size of shopping carts. I'd love one but I question my ability to help back. :/ I can be very motivating but man do I have a hard time finding things to make that don't take a long time. Often I don't have time to cook so I'm looking for something quick. I was doing well for a while then went off it.

Lol! I think I'm getting my head around changing my diet- I've always said I'd never diet and just exercise... So I think I'll be a bit more comfortable telling people (not just the bf I add) once I'm fully comfortable with it...

You're right about getting used to eating a bunch of different foods in the morning though :)I don't track calories either and I see excellent results, I wouldn't sweat it too much.

Edit: I forgot to say, you look great!I wouldn't cancel on friends for any party unless it was literally a bread-only (or dessert-only) kind of thing.

Pizza meeting?  Eat only the toppings.  Or antipasto. Or the innards of a sub.

Sushi?  Miso soup, salad, sashimi.

Cookout?  Just the meat.

Denny's/IHOP?  What everyone else already said.

Don't let keto keep you from living your life, man.This stuff rocks and I didn't mind the taste at all. I need to order more off amazon asapThank you! That's pretty helpful actuallyIt sounds like you had a challenging day, but made it much less terrible than it would have been otherwise. Congrats, dude!I've been on-and-off keto for about half a year, and my first time on I got the rash really bad around my neck and groin, the second time not quite as bad, and this is my 3rd or 4th time going back in, and I haven't had it at all this time yet (this is like my 2nd or 3rd straight week of being in ketosis, every other time I'd get a rash after less than a week). I'm not doing anything different this time, other than working out ~~a bit more~~HOLY MOTHER OF THE SALAMI GOD!!
Please upload a picture of it!!Sauces for sure, some of them contain sugar. My husband works there, so I got to look at the prep instructions that list all the ingredients. I'm almost betting that they aren't doing net carbs, but don't quote me on that. Is it medical related? I have been stuck with the flu for the past three days, so I've been rather sedentary but still chasing children.

Otherwise, I wouldn't want to publicize that one can lose weight (in a healthy manner) by simply staying in bed all day. It's rather misleading.100% this.  Multivitamins totally need to be taken on a really full stomachThis is a growing topic of interest in the world of low carb lipidology.
"However, some readers may interpret the data I present to mean its perfectly safe to consume, say, 25% (or more) of total calories from SFA. I realize I may have to turn in my keto-club card, but I am convinced that a subset of the populationI dont know how large or small, because my N is too smallare not better served by mainlining SFA, even in the complete absence of carbohydrates (i.e., nutritional ketosis)." - look under "talk 1" here for more details: http://eatingacademy.com/cholesterol-2/random-finding-plus-pi
Your fiance's values are somewhere a little below the level at which Petter Attia is talking about above. But, assuming the LDL continues to rise on a retest, here is a little more info.
There are 3 references to this situation in Jimmy Moore's Cholesterol Clarity book as well if I remember correctly. One expert says that it is a total unknown what it means to have protective ratios and no evidence of inflammation or heart disease but at the same time have massive particle counts, which ARE indicative if potential problems (Dr. ?.) Another says that it is a problem and medications or changes in diet should be considered (Dr. Dayspring) and another that no changes are necessary (Dr. Gerber?).
Petter Attia in the above link talks about success switching the majority of SFA intake to MUFA. A 2nd option not mentioned is the non-statin drug zetia.
All of this becomes a very personal risk acceptance decision between you and your doctor.That sounds sooo good. Queso fresco is one of my favorite foods. This might be a dangerous discovery :)I'd drop the 60% cacao completely. I've heard people recommend &gt;85% or, specifically, the 90% Lindt.Fahrenheit I believe, I doubt a standard oven gets to 375 Celsius.Some people can be healthy with moderate or high carb diets. Many can not.FOR MOBILE

when you are on the nutrition tab, right of the "Calorie Breakdown" above the graph, you will see a pie chart, then 4 lines next to 4 dashes.  Click that.  It changes it from the pie chart to "Nutrient Details"


Every time i hit my head with this hammer it hurts. How can i hit my head with this hammer in a way that won't hurt?Going on Keto can make a yeast infection migrate, though.

So, I think that for some people who aren't super observant about rashes/thrush/candida on the feet, they might all of a sudden see a rash develop somewhere new when starting Keto.

I am speaking from my personal experience and my doctor's input.

Of course, my doctor is a believer in candida causing immune system problems in fibromyalgia. He wrote a book and has a practice, but that doesn't really make him a reputable source.

All I know is that I went from being bedridden to working full-time, having a home business, and having an active social life. When I started the Candida cleanse, I was in bad shape and had a terrible Candida infection that while not technically "systemic" was rampant in my digestive system. I had Candida overgrowth in my intestines and mouth and I'd make a good guess that it was impacting my digestion (I could stop taking antacids after the first week of being on Diflucan and probiotics). Nutrition, proper fitness, and proper medication can make your gut flora much healthier which has a profound effect on things that you think are permanent or systemic.

So, basically, I'm saying that while you are right in saying that Candida doesn't cause systemic problems in an otherwise-healthy person, I'm saying that there are plenty of people who may think they are healthy when they are not and who think that unbalanced gut flora is a systemic problem.

So, I just wanted to make sure that people know that you shouldn't just blow off fixing your yeast problems because they aren't systemic problems or you think you are too healthy to have a problem. Stop them before they get out of control.
I get this sometimes, usually when I've had a lot of cheese and fatty meats and very little veggies that day. I just try to take it easy and maybe eat a spinach salad and then I usually feel betterCalories from different macronutrients are different yes. But if you have two meals with the same amount of calories and same macros, it doesn't matter what kind of food it is in regards to weight gain and loss. WOOO!! Do it! It's the best. You know your taste buds are changing when a bite of a carrot or a sip of heavy cream is sweet, and even 100% unsweetened chocolate is perfect on its own. A strawberry or some blueberries? Mouthgasm. Water with some cucumber or lemon? Oh damn. A cupcake, cup of juice, soda or piece of milk chocolate? No thanks, I don't want a punch of sugar in my mouth.

TL;DR: Do it. You really begin to appreciate the hidden flavors and subtle sweetness of foods.

Downside: You become quite particular of the foods you like.I put it off as long as possible, but now that I'm 85lbs down i had to go ahead and buy new clothes.
 I like Lifesum. It gives charts such as this http://imgur.com/Iu6yqMf

Also, it makes line graphs for Weight, BMI, Body Fat %, etc., and it lets you add new things which you might want to track (I made one for belly circumference, for example). Are you on any medications? Some medications can be a big contributer to diarrhea. Especially metformin if you are t2 diabeticDat trig drop :D

Youre LDL is fine at 100, get a VAP test next time. You'll find out that your mostly patterA and the LDL is completely benign.

The important part is your trig/HDL ratio which went from an 8(very high risk) to a 1.7 which is well into the safe zone.

Congrats, thats huge. Without knowing your stats, those numbers don't help us out much ;)

Are you getting enough water and electrolytes?  What does a normal day of meals look like?Are you taking any medication? When I took ceterizine for the first it was pretty much like they show in commercials, life went from gray to full-color :)Good deal. Also, those Quest bars looks awesome! Only 3g! Only downside is, they all seem to be made with almonds...and I'm allergic to almonds. :(My wife made me some the other day, it was heated almond milk with some HWC and a scoop of gold standard chocolate whey powder.Fair warning bud if your green beans have bacon in them they used to dump brown sugar in our schools. We had like a buffet-type thing and essentially any vegetable kids wouldn't eat would get sugar of some type put on it, seems legit right?Sometimes if I've had too much meat, the most appetizing thing to me is a big salad full of fresh veggies. Actually /u/anbeav posted a bunch of veggie ideas yesterday that go beyond salads and steamed vegetables. As others have said, it's mostly water weight, and it'll mostly come off quickly enough.

But you also need to learn how to maintain a certain weight as it's ultimately just as important as being able to lose weight. Often times people learn how to lose weight but not maintain a certain weight-range and they'll end up right where they started.

For example, if you're not going to be able to stick to keto, you can still keep track of calories - you don't have an excuse then, to completely be set back and right where you started.

Unfortunately, as we gain weight, our body creates fat storage cells that will remain even after you've lost the weight. Think ditches, now emptied. Those little spaces are just waiting for you to do something excessive and they'll do their duty. These things, I remember reading, can take a few years to go away, but only if you cease to make use of them...

That means that getting to a certain weight range and maintaining is both difficult but extremely important for the first few years. Keeping track of calories, even when out of ketosis, sucks during this, but it's for the best.Thanks.  Tweeted that one.Oh I wouldn't doubt it.  It took them years before they decided to put on their menu that they added batter to omelettes, and that came after people with celiac started suing them lol.  I don't trust a company that will do that to people.  When I order a damn omelette, if it has pancake batter in it, it better say so in the description.  They are shady mcshadyville.If it concerns you, make a list of the things you take daily and add yo the total carb count of all of them together.  Enter it into MFP as a Recipe.  Call it **oblivious2objections supplements** or something.  Then it's just one quick entry a day.  No sweat.Ok so Im going to buy some cheap eye round steak, cut it into chip size pieces, then deef fry for about 15s. This should make perfectly seared beef chips. Genius. I started eating very small amounts of oatmeal and an apple with breakfast, rice with lunch and a sweet potato at night. This is strictly to help build muscle, because I'm so accustomed to low carb. I've been doing this for a week or so and the weight I'm gaining is mostly muscle/water.  Yup. Its heavily hispanic, which is fine, but it can get troublesome ordering from the 'hot foods' section sometimes, depending on who is working. But when all else fails just point and say the poundage.



Also, its a great place to get ready to fry cheese for cheaper than anywhere else. Buy a package of Queso Para freir or Queso Panela and just cook in a skillet with olive oil. Keto staple for me. You can also get Queso Fresco but I like the aforementioned ones better. Just looked also and was unable to find it.Someone said they worked at IHOP and if they ran low on scrambled eggs, they have no problem using the omelette mix while someone whips up more scrambled mix. Thanks for all the time and effort you put into your reasonable and educational comments here, /u/anbeav. Seriously, I just wanna copy and paste some of these and cache them for future use so you don't have to do so much leg work. I use both, and don't see it in either.  The nutrition tab on mobile doesn't give further options... and everyone around here seems to just use the MFP script to show net carbs.  I'd love to be able to find it though since I'm not running the script at the office or phone.Yes.  And you can put in a drop of spaghetti sauce and some crumbled mozzarella and make little pizza cups.  You can use little bits of whatever you like...crumbled sausage, chopped olives, whatever.I noticed the exact opposite. When I started losing weight, people hung around me more and seem to pay more attention when I speak. Are you using mobile or website?

Mine are for mobile, which honestly is so easy i never use the website anymoreCalories are not created equal.

Calories from crappy processed foods do not equate to the calories in clean, nutrient-dense food. There is Zero metabolic cost for your body to store sugars and starches as fat, but there is a high metabolic cost for your body to break clean foods down from quality foods.True. I am just waaaiting for the day the milk/yogurt isle in supermarkets are stacked with low-carb options and all those non-fat stuff are either DESTROYED or only few left for those who can't eat fat for whatever reason. THAT would be my low carb heavenWelcome!

When you transition to keto, I would set a 20% deficit, protein to 109 grams I am not seeing that in MFP... which initial tab?  There isn't a More tab.Definitely not.  While you're still adjusting to eating less carbs (and therefore less sugar) it's way way too easy to over indulge.  It takes weeks (and for some months and more) to kick the kinds of cravings that move us to eat sweets.Have you tried [Caveman Keto's Mint Chocolate Chip](http://cavemanketo.com/keto-mint-chocolate-chip-ice-cream/) recipe?  It's amazing.Happy Happy Whoosh Day!  Have a steak for dinner.Welcome! Set protein to 84 grams

If you find you're not meeting this calorie goal, you can sustain a somewhat higher deficit, 30-35%If you're doing it for weight-loss it'd be interesting to see your loss plotted with that! I really love this [Cookie Dough Cheesecake](http://uplateanyway.com/keto/cookie-dough-pie-low-carb/) recipe.Yes, only two of the options are keto friendly but at least there are options for us. At a place that serves some of the most carb laden food ever it is nice to see them accommodating the low carb community in such a specific way. You are absolutely right about the skirataki noodles point though. The day Noodles &amp; Co offers that I will officially be in low carb heaven. I track everything as best as I can!  It's possible that during my plateaus I've been less than honest about it.  Also, as I've been going to the gym for the past year, muscle has replaced fat in many places and that kind of stalls me occasionally.  I've vowed to leave the scale alone from now on and just trust my measurements.  "I can't eat another bite"
And there is no false information in the statement that people with as much bodyfat to lose as I have may have trouble eating too much on a ketogenic diet, it's a fact. I have to force myself to eat some days. I'm sorry you're so thin. Asshole.Nicely done!

Although you've received plenty of downvotes from people that didn't quite put two-and-two together with today's date. Hell, even I thought you were kind of serious at first. &gt;.&gt;So you don't think getting the Breyers CarbSmart ice cream right away would be a good idea?My pollen issues actually cross-react with stuff like carrots and avocado, it's so sad. :'(You buy it.  You download it.  You read it on *any* device with a Kindle app.  The app is free.  You can read it on your computer, or your phone, or your kindle.I don't normally think indulging in anything even remotely sugar-tasting is wise in the first few months of keto, but if you absolutely have to have something to pair with your coffee, these [Quest Bars](http://www.amazon.com/Quest-Nutrition-Protein-Chocolate-Cookie/dp/B00DLDH1N2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427920350&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=quest+bars) are pretty great.Hmm i don't really eat any coconut products too many carbs for one meal unless youre IF, if you ask meI did mention that only 2 of the meals were keto friendly. I am not saying everyone should eat this every day but it is nice to know your options. As someone who has been eating low carb for over a year the selections of places to go can get old. Additionally, I think it is good to support restaurants who are supporting low carb because that is how we get more people to recognize this is something that can be sold and that people do want. It sucks :( but I try to get them via eBay and r braswap. Just the omelettes.  But still, I don't trust IHOP, lolBrilliant!! Most definitely doing this on my next pizza night (aka any night that I realize I still have a ton of calories left for dinner haha)The best way to not cheat is to never buy any of the stuff to begin with.

I snack on Celery sticks.Thanks for the encouragement.  I've been bouncing between the same 3 lbs for the past month and I'm starting to lose hope/get upset with my lack of progress.  I've only been watching my diet and haven't been exercising so that's part of the problem, I'm sure.

I'll be hiding my scale when I get home and hold off on weighing myself for a month, too.  Starting a beginners exercise routine when I get home as well.  I've got a lot of events coming up this month (Easter, my birthday, camping) so I don't need the scale stressing me out even more!No, it's free.  They want some reviews to boost later sales, which I think is a fine tactic.  I'll review it.I guess I just don't understand such frequent "cheating." is there a reason you do? I'd find it stressful, personally. If you go to Denny's or IHOP, stick with eggs and bacon (or proteins you know don't have added sugar).  IHOP puts pancake batter in their omelettes, so if you get one, make sure to request whole eggs and not the battered eggs.  Be specific on what you want.  You can still eat out, you just have to be careful about what you order.  It is not rude to go to a party and not eat... is it a sit down dinner?  If not, it's perfectly fine not to eat.  Good decision not to cheat... that shows you have made a lot of progress in your relationship with food :)Pancake place - get fried eggs and bacon (not an omelet or anything, those places put pancake batter in the egg mixture.)

Sushi place - get sashimi.

No sweat, right? :)Congratulations!!

Fried oysters are a nice appetizer at times :) But, I prefer the raw for sure :)Lengua (cow tongue) is the most tender, and best when you can still identify the taste buds. Love menudo with tripe. That spongy stomach lining, soaks up all the flavorOh, theres a trick to counter that that we use!

Toss the high moisture veggies with a tsp or so of kosher salt and let them sit in a colander for a half hour. It pulls out a vast majority of the moisture so it isn't usually a problem :)

This also works really well to prevent stuff like eggplant parm from becoming soupI like mine with some fresh squeezed lemon juice and a little pepper --- mmmmmmIt's a reference and nothing more. Don't take it so seriously. As I said, it came off *Pinterest*, so that right there is an indication of its quality.In this case, stir fry, but I see that's a big nono. I'll just leave it out.Cod sperm. Had it most recently with gorgonzola and toasted bread. Amazing. Nooooooooo!So do you think that the act of stir-frying makes veggies greasy or that you can't stir-fry without using a lot of oil?Snails.Just a perfect combo of meatiness, rich earthiness and buttery garlic heaven. I'd eat them every day if I could.I've never had a cooked one, my guess is it would kill all the delicacy and fresh-sea-flavoured goodness you get with a raw one.Hey now, let's not go throwing ideas like that around. Pork roll/Taylor ham is it's own sacred thing.

Why yes, I am from NJ. Can you tell? :PI can't see what problem anyone could have with haggis, apart from getting unnecessarily squeamish over the body parts that go into it. It's one of the most delicious things you'll ever eat!Just tried that. Amazing! Thanks for sharing. thank you!Time is a huge factor when concerning killing off bacteria - the longer you expose them to increased temperature, the more likely they are to die - a couple of seconds at 64C in a pan might not suffice - but an hour in a sous vide cooker killes nearly all of them. Makes no difference to the denaturation of the proteins (how done the piece of meat is) Grill up some jumbo marinated shrimp or some lobster tails.. grilled zuccini/squash and peppers and onion also tasty..same for big portabello mushroom caps brushed with oil and stuffed with crab or cheese!  A toasted grillled crostini bread with some bacon, cheese and pesto or salsa at the table for an app works too..



Kebabs area great grill item too - marinated meat and veggies all skewered to go...get some metal skewers and rock out the kebab varieties!  Pork Chops and Keilbasa/sausages also are great grill itemsI'm a big fan of the [Pie and Pastry Bible](http://www.amazon.com/Pastry-Bible-Rose-Levy-Beranbaum/dp/0684813483). 300 recipes and a boatload of technique. It's a staple in my kitchen.You're stuck carrying around your room temp lunch anyway, so invest in a small insulated one (small enough to fit in your bag) and live life to the fullest with mayo in your sammies and string cheese and shit.I've always been told that a little bit of pink inside of pork is OK. Not like rare steak pink, but a slight haze of pink. Pizza stones are good for dough and breads--if you make your own Naan bread they rock...but as another suggested you can't go wrong with a good probe thermometer - spend the $ for a thermapen model of sorts.. I have used the $10 cheap thermometers and they suck..they break, the probes are not accurate or they just die after a while(or in the middle of use which SUCKS when you are cooking something and you thermometer/timer suddenly resets or shuts off).. get one with a good range etc.

Another idea not yet suggested which I like a lot are the vacuum food storage sealers - expensive but awesome for extending food storage, sous vide cooking and for sealing up leftovers etc! Also can't go wrong with some good silicone/silpat oven mats and sheet pans.. I got a bundt pan silicon mold and I can't believe I did without one ever - they rock for cakes and muffins etc!
I've never had those before.If juices run clear, you're good.Tim Tams with tomato sauce.

A Tim Tam is a kind of chocolate biscuit (cookie for the Americans and some of the Canadians) for those unfamiliar with them.Very true. It's just a safety issue. Like what if the food wasn't up to temp but had one weird spike that fooled the biotherm (happens a lot with liquids when you don't stir before temping them).Peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwiches. Add banana for extra goodness. And bacon for nirvana.Can you link me to one for that price that would be reliable? I really want one but I dunno what to go for. Cornstarch slurry usually.....and doing what is called "velveting" the meats...which is basically the use of corn starch and egg whites and spices coating the meat also adds to that thickened textures to the sauces which are usually soy, fish, oyster and hoisen sauces in some combo to name a few...
Yeah, they're great at removing exactly this guesswork.Do you not have liquid nitrogen baths in your kitchen?Get a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes.  Drain them, then pulse in a glass with an immersion blender, or mash the hell out of them in a bowl with a potato masher.  You don't want a smooth puree.  Then add a pinch of salt, pepper, fresh crushed garlic (not garlic powder), whole oregano and crushed chile flakes.  Done.

Pizza sauce is not marinara; there's no profit in cooking the shit out of it.  The tomatoes got cooked once when they were canned, and they'll get cooked again on the pizza.  If you cook them a third time by cooking the sauce, you'll ruin any spark of brightness left in them.  I used to have this too! You can sub the noodles for rice (yes - that sounds revolting - but trust me it works) and also you can put cut up hard boiled eggs into the mix if you like that sort of thing. Also I've found you can basically use cream of anything soup and it works perfectly, we usually use cream of celery. But the real tip here is how to make the **most incredible topping known to man**: First, you get some bread and cut it into little squares. Then, you melt some butter in a pan. After that you get your little bread pieces and dip them in the melted butter, going on to place them on top of the casserole. After that baby's baked they turn into the most precious crunchy golden nuggets of love.You sooo need to rethink this as many of these countries will require their own pantry. This will not work out for you. Stick to a few cuisines rather than try and have a kitchen that is stocked for every country in the world.Reuse. I have always gotten 2-3 runs out of a good braising sauceAnd you can trade time held at a temperature for a higher maximum temperature. It's one of the benefits of sous vide.The person you replied to is upvoted.  Reddit fuzzes and delays vote reporting.


The whole "don't know why you were X voted"  needs to go away.

Unless it's a few hours later you can't tell what the "votes"  are at all
That seems inconsistent: I know we're collectively all about buying the very cheapest pots and knives off ebay the rest of the time.Also, you don't want to be replacing your probe thermometer all the time. Get a decent, sturdy and accurate one to just use for the rest of your life.MAPP hasn't been sold in the country for several years. If you ever see MAPP its probably a substitute. Best bet now is MAP-PRO. I agree that its best to go to the hardware store for torches.

Btw, I hope OP is using a 20% off coupon as those never expire. They have an expiration date but Bed,Bath &amp;Beyond is known for accepting them regardless.

Lutfisk. I think I'm just about entirely alone in my circle of friends when it comes to this "delicacy".

For those of you who don't know, lutfisk is unsalted and air dried white fish, which is then reconstituted in water, soaked in lye until caustic and inedible, thoroughly washed, cooked wrapped in a kitchen towel and finally eaten with boiled potatoes, mushy peas, a completely unseasoned bechamel sauce and sprinkled with some ground allspice. It is incredible.With tatties and neeps haggis actually resemble Norwegian Christmas food in taste, it's lovely.

But I have never tried black pudding, haven't even tried our own version of blood sausage and blood pudding... :\Doug Baldwin is also a wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks, so I bet he knows what he's talking about.Buy a thermometer.  If thats what its supposed to taste like.....nope....never ever ever againAnd beef heart tastes just like steak, it's just super cheap and great (GREAT) for stews :D Just because it's heart they're freaked out by it...

I personally prefer books from pie shops as the recipes in these books will be of those that were perfected after years of making and selling pies. My three favorite books are from [Hoosier Mama](http://www.amazon.com/Hoosier-Mama-Book-Pie-Techniques/dp/1572841435/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424517533&amp;sr=1-3), [Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds](http://www.amazon.com/Four-Twenty-Blackbirds-Pie-Book/dp/1455520519/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424518070&amp;sr=1-2), and [First Prize Pies.](http://www.amazon.com/First-Prize-Pies-Deliciously-Inventive/dp/161769102X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424518096&amp;sr=1-4) my advice? Get all of them. All three books come from three of the best pie shops in the country.You don't eat coq au vin every day, it's more of a Sunday meal, the same for boeuf bourguignon and crepes. In France there is a very important regional cuisine. You don't eat the same things in the North and in the South I think. For example people from the North usually prefer cooking with butter instead in the South we would more likely use olive oil. Things my family eats a lot : carbonara pasta, gratin dauphinois, tartes aux herbes (herbs pies), ratatouille, "pastasciutta" (corsican/italian pasta recipe with tomato sauce, veal and olives), zucchini soup, carotts soup etc... (all kinds of soup), a lot of chicken dishes : roasted chicken with potatoes, pasta with chicken and crme fraiche sauce, but also homemade pizzas or quiches (kind of pie with eggs, bacon and cream), and vegetables of all kinds with olive oil in the pan (green beans, zucchini etc) or in salads : in the Summer we eat loads of different salads, mixing tomatoes, various types of lettuces, spinaches, cheese (goats cheese for instance), potatoes, tuna, eggs...
But then I thinks it varies a lot depending on the families... Australia. I have a lot of vegetarian friends though so maybe that is why. I just have never heard someone complain about tofu being disgusting though many have said it is often bland. Having just baked a rather large breast, I did it at 400 for 30 minutes, after 20 didn't quite seem enough.Greek style yoghurt mixed in with chicken and rice. Crave it everytime I'm under the weatherNope, skin them like a carrot, then just cut them crosswise into half inch pieces.  Toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, and optionally a bit of cayenne and tarragon.  Roast at like 450 for until nice and soft in the middle, maybe 15 to 20 minutes. Make smoothies?MAPP torches are better than the ones sold as kitchen ones.Never heard of it, so I looked up a recipe...
I don't see what's not to love!I wouldn't say it's disgusting, but it's definitely not very good. It's not anything I'd eat unless there were literally no other options or I was so drunk I had no idea what I was doing.[I bookmarked this](https://i.imgur.com/T0AWh3I.jpg) some time ago, it lists three simple spices to get the **basics** of a regions taste down.The hotdog thing you mention is what makes me laugh when people won't try it. They'll eat the cheapest of cheap sausages and hotdogs with "22% pork" written on the packaging, but won't touch something made by an actual butcher, from real meat. Haggis pie is just the perfect winter warmer. Also, fried slices with breakfast. Haggis, scrambled egg and toast is my favourite cooked breakfast by a mile. Shepard's pie is lamb. Cottage pie is beef.I wonder what the science behind that is.  I was always taught that alcohol expresses flavours, but never had the first clue why.

As a note, sugar offsets the acidity of the tomato.  Don't forget that.Stick it in ice water and boiling water to check the calibration. It's not fucking rocket scienceI got tortured with mealy potato mash in creche. Still can't really enjoy even if made from real potatoes (which I love) and butter and milk and stuff. Fuck the 80s, damn right.What a pity. I think they taste very much like cabbage but more intense. I don't get any bad bitterness. They do smell bad while preparing though.

Well, I'm sure I miss out on things I don't like, too.I know a lot of people that absolutely hate it. It's a texture/improper preparation/blandness thing.

What magical place do you live that the people you're surrounded by like tofu?This. Most people (Americans, anyway) have never eaten a Brussels sprout that wasn't boiled till it smelled like a paper factory and tasted worse.Some things I throw on the grill:

* capsicums (bell peppers)
* eggplant
* potato slices
* sweet potato
* zucchini
* mushrooms
* onions
* broccoli (just trust me on this one)
* tomato halves
* haloumi
* marinated tofuI used to love it despite how much shit I got for this but the last time I ate it I got very sick and now I can't even think about eating it anymore. I'm glad I'm cured of liking McDonald's actually! Do people actually find tofu disgusting?? I have never heard this. Here's me using my fingers like a savage, thanks for the tip! I told my fiance how bad it smelled so he decided he must see for himself. Spent $10 in the supermarket to get one and he managed one bite I think. The kids found the whole thing very entertaining, so it was a fairly cheap way to entertain them for a while. Chop it all up and make a hash in a cast iron pan. Looks pretty accurate to me... http://imgur.com/mysOmcTThat whole post sounded dirtySurstrmming- Fermented herring

Black pudding &amp; haggis.If you like making tacos, get a cast iron tortilla press. It'll probably cost you $15-30 and it makes flattening out tortillas so easy.

If you've never bought masa harina (most common brand is Maseca) to make your own corn tortillas, you're missing out. The temperature reading on a cheap thermometer may not be very accurate.
Looking at your list, I'd go for a honing steel for those knives.  You might already have one, in which case I'd get kitchen shears... and if you have *those*, a boning knife.  The instant-read thermometer's a great idea, too.

Either that or blow it all on prep bowls.  I can never have too many.Isn't it? When you're used to store-bought OJ and then taste fresh squeezed, the experience is... *sigh* Even the worst oranges used for fresh squeezed juice is better than packaged juice, which my mom proved the other day because we had a lot of oranges.

How to describe? Packaged OJ is murky, while fresh squeezed is enlightenment.

I agree with TrashCannes on lemonade as well. So much cleaner tasting than bottle lemonade.pickled herring in wine vinegar mind blownHomemade jerky?  Takes a fair bit of clock time but doesn't require much in the way of prep or supervision, and if you're making it yourself you can control what goes in to get it as healthy as you'd like.

Not sure what to suggest for veg to go with the jerky.  I could see veggie-platter stuff like celery and carrots cut in batonnets, maybe a broccoli stem peeled and cut the same way for variety.

If you're craving starch to go with all that, you could wrap it in a tortilla and wrap *that* in cling-film.  The cling-film wrapper might let you get away with some sort of sauce, although it'd have to be pretty thick.  Depending on how much crushability you can get away with, you could add a bit of rice and/or beans (like a chimichanga), which would absorb a sauce without letting the tortilla soak through.  Maybe some shredded cheese, too.Yum! I can understand why people are aversed to it (the idea of eating head flesh), but it's delicious. Since it is Lunar New Year, there's an abundance of head cheese (called gio thu) in Vietnamese markets.

I also think not many know they've eaten head cheese, with the trend of banh mi. The most famous kind of banh mi [thit nguoi, or cold cut] is made with gio thu.Not sure why you've been downvoted for this, I agree with you. If it's wrong you get the shits, not a good gamble! I'd go with customer reviews too thoughGrilled calamari steak are awesome and healthy.  I'm sure you could find some great recipes out there but my lazy ass likes to keep it really simple: a little oil, salt and pepper, then grill and serve them on a bed of arugula tossed with evoo, salt, pepper and fresh lemon juice.And let's not forget the entire section of desserts dedicated to egg yolks: custards. Just add sugar, milk or cream, and vanilla, you can get ice cream, pastry cream (with flour), creme brulee, etc. Egg yolks are indispensable, period. It's amazing, how versatile this one ingredient is.Yes!  The frozen section is where you'll find duck, once I realized that's where grocery stores hid it  I've noticed it in nearly every store I've been to. Uh...I love cauliflower and broccoli, but Brussels sprouts taste extremely bitter to me.  And don't say I just haven't had them prepared the right way.  I don't mess around when it comes to oven roasting and caramelizing and seasoning.  I love raw and cooked cabbage.  These things taste obnoxious to me.  Not at all. Even a cilantro hater (genetically predisposed or not) like me can admit that cilantro has what is considered a "refreshing" fragrance.

Durian is unlike that because it has a smell that MOST consider malodorous. To me, it smells like sweaty armpit. Unlike those who have a genetic predisposition to dislike cilantro, there's no predisposition to smell of durian--it just smells bad, in the same way you know a fart smells bad.Haha, absolutely.  [Speaking of....](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/chongqing-style-beef-penis-with-wolfberries-recipe.html)Even assuming those numbers are true, it's still more interesting to know the likelihood that I'd get toxoplasmosis from eating steak tartare.  I mean, if there are two cases of latent toxoplasmosis in France and one guy got it from tartare, I'm really not all that worried at the 50% figure.  If there are two *million* cases, well....hahah. no the people I know who don't like lamb are white and latin.Most of us didn't grow up with this kind of food.That is the only way to eat it.  What about fresh sardines?I'm from the Midwest, but pimento cheese is a staple here.  We had neighbors who gave away half pimento cheese sandwiches to children for Halloween.  You had to get there early, though.  Fair point, although I think thin slices of carpaccio are far enough removed from "ground beef, ugh, cross-contamination risk" that it doesn't trigger as much of the oh-gross reflex as tartare.  It's been too long since I've had carpaccio to really remember, but IIRC with the marinade it has a sorta-cooked texture to it, too, in the same way as ceviche.

(Ceviche, by the way, is something that most people I know love until they're told just how the fish is "cooked".)#####&amp;#009;

Get a good meat thermometer.

If you look closely you'll see Alton Brown and the America's Test Kitchen people using it.

The positives are the temperature sensor bit is in the thin tip and it responds very quickly to temperature changes.  $25 instead of $5 to $15, but an extra few dollars for a tool you'll probably use most of the time you cook isn't a thing to complain about.Interesting. I'm in Toronto and as far as I can tell most people don't think twice about it. Funny, I acquired a taste for tendon because it always came with the tripe, and I felt like I should give it an honest try.  Eventually I learned to love it.  Totally different texture, though.Yeah, the minuscule salmonella risk gets played up to an obnoxious degree.  I think most people here (western Canada), confronted with an egg yolk, would also say the texture bothers them... but you can't really tell in a Caesar dressing or on carbonara, now can you?I usually just spatchcock it I want roast chicken but you don't really have to have a huge stock of recipes to justify buying whole chickens. I'll buy a bunch of chickens when they're on sale, pre spatchcock a few, and butcher the rest. Then I'll throw the carcasses and spines in the pressure cooker to make stock and vacuum pack the rest for the freezer.

And don't fret butchering, it becomes second nature after going through a few birds. It usually only takes me about 2 minutes to do a bird these days.I think you're going about this the wrong way.  Any good cookbook or tv series will give you a guide to essential ingredients.  Even if they don't, working through some recipes will give you a good idea of what is really essential and what provides the characteristic flavour to different dishes/cuisines, as well as ingredients that pop up frequently.

Rather than trying to build a one-size-fits-all pantry, actually work through some recipes.  Plan for a week (or however long 5 home-cooked meals takes you), see what you need and get it.  Do this for a few weeks and by the end of it you'll have all the essentials you need for the dishes you actually want to cook, or at least a very good idea of what you should be keeping in stock.  Had duck heart at a duck restaurant in Beijing. My friend and I were apprehensive at first, as we'd  both never had heart before, but after the first bite we ate a plate of those ducks like they were popcorn.&gt; faintly metallic "bacon" flavor

I guess this is the right thread to admit that you made fake-bacon Velveeta sound kind of appealing.  I bet it'd be great with some eggs and salsa as hardcore hangover food.Out of interest, are they Asian? I ask because my sister in law is, and she can't stand lamb.

Anyway, favourite piece of lamb for me is a slow cooked, boned and rolled shoulder. Mmm. These are not even ribs. Technically, this is sliced shoulder, a double blasphemy. I suppose it could be worse. Maybe cooking it for a synagogue function?A couple of German -- Swabian, specifically -- friends of mine made me a sauerkraut pizza.  It was not the most elegant arrangement of flavours.

On the other hand, they introduced me to sptzle, so all is forgiven and then some.It might not be a real food, but I love Stouffer's french bread pizzas. My family always said they smell like vomit but I loved them anyway. My mom would make fun of me for eating my "puke pizza" as she called it. Try it with guac and it'll blow your mind.Or the anchorman reference. OMG hell yes. Shrimp heads, especially when fried, are incredible bursts of flavor. Way tastier than the meat, like you said.Conditioning.  When I was growing up, my parents would take a bag of freezer-burned frozen sprouts out of the chest freezer, dump them into boiling water, cook them into tiny little sulfurous hate-cabbages, then dump them *unseasoned* onto my plate (because salt's bad for you).  Then I'd be forced to finish them because "they're good for you!"

Turns out you can roast the little bastards in bacon grease and parmesan, and if you halve or quarter them the inner leaves are just the ticket for grabbing onto sauce and conveying it to your taste buds.  So good!  Fuck the '80s.While an instant read thermometer is absolutely essential...there's no need to spend more than $4 on it. Shipping might take 3 weeks, but hey....it's f***ing $3.

My 2 recommendations:

1) A nice Butcher block/Cutting board. I just got a fancy cutting board and I'm so in love.

2) A good cast iron pan. If you don't own one. You need one.

***The reason I love both the above is because they are "buy it for life" kind of items. Good ones should last a long long timeI once had lunch at a small restaurant in Italy they did not have a menu, instead the owner came to our table and described the dishes. Due to the language barrier (I don't speak Italian) I went with a "steak" and when asked chose to have it cook medium.

Turns out I had ordered pork chops, which I would never have cooked medium myself. But that was the most delicious pork chops I've ever had. I just figured it came from a small, local pub farm and that as they serve like that all the time it should be fine. As long as you're certain the animal is healthy I guess you could basically eat it raw.And it's basically umami on rice.  Unagi is goddamn delicious.Try this recipe: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eTucCw1w6Ak

Maangchi is my go-to for Korean foods. Greek: Mint, garlic, parsley, coriander, paprika, yoghurt, cumin, tomato puree, onions, feta, cinnamon, olive oil, basil, oregano, ugh way too many to listdo cauliflower. My favorite roasted vegetable.Chilli, spring onions, ginger, garlic, star aniseHehe there's just something about Beef tongue. My Eastern European family (Ukranian/Latvian) makes a killer slow braised beef tongue that is to die for. Its so tender and flavourful.

PS Thank god more people don't like it, because there's only one tongue per cow....can you imagine the cost? lolNot providing a meal break during 10 hour shift is against the law in the vast majority of cases. I know that some fields have exceptions and the healthcare industry is one of them, but have you looked into this? Has anyone complained? And are you a union member?

I know that's not what you asked for but I was just really concerned reading your first sentence.
SO for a pocket meal, you might consider getting something like a panini press and flattening some sandwiches and wraps. Nothing too juicy of course or you'll end up with a sloppy mess. Ham and cheese sourdough sandwiches will keep pretty well after you've made them crisp and flat in your press before your shift.

Seriously though, in most cases 10 hours without a meal break is illegal!This guys knows stuff... http://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html#Safety

This looks promising also. http://www.cookingissues.com/uploads/Low_Temp_Charts.pdf

Mandoline slicers are also useful although they are more situational.  Ideal for cookouts where you need multiple vegetables like tomatoes, onions, etc... sliced uniformly for burgers. Or if you make potatoes au gratin, or similar, regularly.Isn't the 165 deg measurement supposed to be for 30 seconds?You could freeze a bottle of water and use that like an ice pack. I was really happy to see this in the cooking sub and not /r/trees Food processor. No, they cook the eel for sushi.pickled tongue.There was an awful disease in pigs called trichinosis. That's what has been eliminated and thus we can cook lower. Yeah, but eggs and syrup :(. Syrup and breakfast sausage, however, is delicious.Cold cooked spinach with a dollop of mayonnaise. Weird thing I got from my Dad.

Also we were having beef tongue for dinner and my father who I sat next to, stuck his tongue out at me with every bite I took just to mess with me. I do miss his sense of humor.Dried, rehydrated radish (used in a Korean side dish) has a very interesting crunchy/chewy texture. It's floppy, but so dense that there is a crunch to it. I feel like sea cucumber would be similar.Yes!! Sweet potatoes are a nutritional goldmine and they are soooo delightful prepared with virtually any method!! Today I saw an idea on Pinterest that used roasted sweet potato skins as TACO SHELLS, this is now the top of my priority list of things to try. This reminds me of Australian friends asking me about whether they make wine in 'random french area I'm talking about' ummmm pretty much always yes to that question Lima beans

Brussel sprouts

Radishes/kohlrabi Oh, I'm all about the carryover cooking. I have just never seen anything like this chart. I need a chart like this for all my meats. Grilling gets dicey when you have a paranoid neurotic wife like I do.Reduce and use for sauce!!!I've had good luck pan frying the bacon with a dab of butter. I think it must be the milk solids that produce a nice browning result every time I've done it. Also good quality bacon is critical. Nothing is more disappointing than cheap, bloated-looking bacon. (psst, bacon fat works just as nicely, and especially nicely with some crispy crumbled bacon worked in)I would describe haggis as "lovely meat hash". My background is Scottish, even though I personally have never been there, so when I had the opportunity to try it it was a "one time for the motherland" deal. I instantly fell in love. I live in Canada so haggis is a rare treat, but I love that it's a tasty reminder of my family's roots. I just appreciate it when people actually know what it is! I looked at your history and you rock my world!It's good,but way too much salt.  Even the low sodium variant.I tried it in multiple different places in Scotland and liked it every time.Don't blame me if /r/smoking shows up outside your house with torches and pitchforks.  I tried to save you. So much better, and it's usable in your nonstick cookware. I used to use a rigid metal pastry cutter thingummy like [this] (http://thisweekfordinner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pastry-blender.jpg) but it required draining the meat, transferring it to a bowl, texturizing with frequent clearing of the blades and transferring back to a pan. This does the same job, with less work and maintains the temperature of the meat since it stays in the pan. Ideal for making ground beef that requires fine texture such as Taco Bell style taco/burrito meat or Old School Cafeteria style Mashed Potatoes and Beef Gravy.I've been really wanting one of those cooking torches. Not the most useful thing but damn it would be funFarm fresh chicken from a good farm?  Yea you can eat that shit raw and they do in Japan.

It depends on the chicken you guys.  I pay about 3 bucks more for a 5 lb bird that is always trustworthySomething that I haven't seen anybody else mention:  with the increase in antibiotics and hormones to increase growth in chickens, and to reduce growing times, many chickens you get in the store are very young.  Young chickens tend to bleed more, and/or have pink tissue that older chickens don't have.  Because of this, the only safe and reliable way to know if a chicken is cooked is by temperature.  Forget all you hear about clear fluid, twistable flesh, pink tissue, or anything else.  If the temperature is at least 165 degrees, it's safe.  Even the USDA is publishing this now, and even though I don't agree with a lot of the "over" temperatures they suggest, I have to agree with this onehttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/poultry-preparation/chicken-from-farm-to-table/!ut/p/a1/jZFNU8IwEIZ_i4ceQxaKDHBjOuMIShmmo5ZenLRs2o5tEpNFrL_egCccULKnJM9-vO_yjKc8U-KjLgXVWonmcM9Gr7CGUX8SwWI16d_BPH5erx6iCMbJrQc2fwBxeGX-hTOD__IXVzQY2GW0LHlmBFWsVlLztERiQrk9WsdTqfWWOSGROiZFQcxViOQ_jN41ZDtmLBphj57wtKjq4g0Vk1a3HrctI81I5A3yF56djgN9H_M4TIb3iziE1fA3cMavH-CyIV5x2ej8uJzNTOXh2EuzKNGi7e2sf66IzDSAABzVTUPCUdcrdBvA-w7dQYQLoFZb_Az8dIMAjChxOjhXrtKOeHpahpv2Kf16nMlkzrK82998A-FYnjk!/#21

[lebanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_cuisine)I work in a restaurant and I would say 20 minutes would be cutting it close. 25 minutes would probably finish the job.

EDIT: I cook smaller breasts for 15 minutes at 400 degrees in a convection oven. I could actually do the math that I learned in Food Processing Engineering but I'm way too drunk for that. Maybe later.I'm going to have to try some. do you roast them whole?It'll start to steam at (depending on your elevation and relative humidity) around 135.  At 145 you'll have a fair amount of it.  Chicken kept at those temps long enough is fine, but I'd be careful.This guy is probably rightIf you don't have a thermometer, and don't intend to buy one soon, you can always poke in to the chicken with a knife.  If it bleeds clear, she's done.  If you really aren't certain, just cut one in half and check out the color of the meat in the thickest part, if it's all white, or even just a teensy bit pink, you're good to go.

I would cover them breasteses with tin foil when they're in the hot box.  I think Philly Cheesesteaks is one of the most awful things I've ever had. Yet, I enjoy Steak and cheese sandwich at most decent street food vendors/restaurants. The large amounts of grease and processed liquid cheese doesn't do it for me.I don't care much for tripe, but LOVE tendon in my pho.  Unfortunately, they tend to come together, and I usually end up eating half of the tripe, as if I have something to prove by eating it.You can even slow cook it and leave just a tiny bit of pink in and if you do it right it's heavenly.&gt; But you can source your chicken to be relatively safer and not have to worry as much, and even with commercially processed birds you can brine so that the higher temperatures don't result in dry, unpalatable results.

Well sure, but you can also cook lower temps and have it be *just as safe* for the home cook.

Yeeeaaa... Kind of?

The 150 is a internal temperature. So you need to raise the center of the chicken to 150 and keep it there for 5 minutes.

If you bring it to 155 and take it off the heat, you'll be at that temperature for plenty of time.  I love the tangy contrast of a runny fried egg with ketchup!#####&amp;#009;

Thanks! I spent a pretty penny on all that cheese, but the end result will be worth it!I usually recommend [this instant read from Thermoworks](http://www.amazon.com/RT301WA-Super-Fast-Digital-Thermometer-Approval/dp/B002GE9S8I/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424501985&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=thermoworks). I've had one for almost 4 years now and every time I go to calibrate it, it's been dead on. I've given a few as gifts and everyone loves them. They're quick and easy, and they're made by one of the best thermometer companies that I know of.A thermometer is a great idea! There have definitely been times I've needed one.

Also, WHOA. Never heard of a Mix N Chop before... does it really work better than mashing at it with a spatula?My wife likes Kimchi after spending time in Korea as a child, I just find it a little too strong. Though I love anchovies.A good instant read thermometer is always useful and, if you prepare ground beef frequently a Mix N' Chop, or similar, is indispensable as a texturizing tool. I call mine the Meat Mace!Whoa, so five minutes at 150 is the same as 165 as far as safety? Fuck that's good to know.I don't mind it done right (Indian bhindi masala for example), but I have a hard time getting over the mouthfeel.You're not wrong, but are a bit off topic. Not sure it deserves the downvoting you're seeing.

A lot of (potential) contamination in chicken has to do with how it is processed. Poultry raised in sane conditions, like duck, can safely be eaten without being cooked to well done. In fact, raw chicken is eaten in Japan.God, I remember eating 160 pork. It's like eating hot wet paper. An older couple made me some schweineschnitzel the other day that was clearly cooked to the old guidelines and I could barely eat it. Of course, to them I thought it was "delicious," but it was pretty much a breaded hockey puck. It was well seasoned, though, so that was nice. True, but you can probably get a cheap, new one on Amazon.I usually vaccu-suck my breasts and put them in a water bath at 140F for 1 1/2 hours.

Blast with torch to finish.

Moist chicken titties. First post that actually made me cringe.They totally would if you didn't mention it was cheek. Picky people are weird.Thailand does not. 'Garam masala' is Hindi for 'warm spices', and the three basic spices in most garam masala blends are cinnamon, cloves and cardamom. The term is not used in Thailand, and I'm not aware of any Thai spice blend with a similar composition.These are some of my favourite foods!! Steak tartar is my like my indulgent treat of choice! As someone who has spent years recovering from food poisoning (gastroparesis), let me just say that this lax attitude toward food safety frightens me.  You might be surprised to learn that you can injure someone's digestion for years from food poisoning.

Don't mistake "no one complained" for a clean bill of health.  We know complaining to the restaurant is pointless.  I never told the restaurant because I know they won't believe me.  It's not as though a food poisoning victim has proof.  Being violently ill for 4 hours the morning after a meal proves something to the victim but not really anyone else.I eat my ice cream post haste just so it can melt as little as possible. I also don't care for soft serve as it's closer to the melty texture.I would rather buy a $10 meat thermometer from Amazon or in a store than buying from Alixpress and saving $6 on something that might not even arrive or is some cheap knockoff (like a lot of things on Aliexpress). Garam masala is a loose term. Many cultures have their own versions of itThe taste is alright but I can't support the texture.Not necessarily disgusting, but I recently tried Ginkgo nuts.  They are all over the ground in fall, I might actually harvest some next year.  They remind me of tofu, a canvas for you to apply flavor.  My fellow Americans wouldn't think to eat them.  &gt; I am willing to bet I were to replace the curry paste with the curry powder along with some chilis and fish sauce, I bet that will not fool you unless you're a thai or thai food aficionado.

You think nobody's going to miss the shallots, cilantro stems, galangal, lemongrass, or kaffir lime leaves that form most of the flavor of a Thai curry paste?

&gt; And no I'm discouraged using curry powder in place of garam masala.

No garam masala in Thai cooking either, though Thai curries do tend to have a couple of ingredients in common with garam masala. We've talked about this in a bunch of threads, but you keep repeating this misinformation.Interesting! I HATE durian and am not a fan of asafoetida. I think it gives a really unpleasant tang to food. It blew my mind when I learned that they don't grow like mini cabbages.  I never would have guessed nature made a medieval mace of nutrition.  Cauliflower roasted until it's all golden and caramelized is SO delicious. I've also seen recipes where the entire head is roasted but I prefer smaller pieces since that means more areas get browned.
When in season, roasted asparagus with olive oil, splash of balsamic, s&amp;p is great too. I'll go for eel sushi.  Pretty sure its usually raw when I eat it.  All the better.  Gardening without gloves is largely beneficial.  You build up a benign microherd that out-competes pathogens for your body's real estate.  There are some rare cases of disease, but I always get my hands dirty.  I like the sound of this!And kitties.Baking soda cleans beet stains pretty well.Isn't sauerkraut fermented, not pickled?  Also, most people in the world enjoy eating muscles, so I assume you meant mussels.  They look beautiful, don't they?So sugary, flavored half and half?Would you say it tastes like an oyster but custard textured? I've always wanted to try it but it's usually expensive and I'm sort of poor so I don't want to waste the food or my money in case I hate it.I've had the pleasure of eating a few bad oysters, and I still go back for more.  A good one tastes like the ocean, pure and simple.  Pour a little mignonette on them and I call it a night of hedonism.  This isn't really true though. Ground ginger tastes different than fresh ginger period, but ground ginger is often used in baking whereas fresh ginger has its place more in cooking. Rarely will you see fresh ginger being asked for in a baking recipe.

Ground ginger is never a substitute for fresh (and vice versa), but if it's all you got, it *does* add some of that gingery bite and it's probably better than nothing.Tried them, they were good, but too chewy for me.Mushrooms. I have no idea how I ended up in the middle of a bunch of mushroom haters, but it's all good because all their mushroom are mine.It's too bad that cooking and accuracy *are* related.

If I was offered this as a source, I'd ditch it. It screams, "I don't pay attention to details." Someone like that may or may not be providing accurate information.
You ever get a soy sauce craving, go for Wild Bills Beef Jerky.  Its dried soy-sauce-beef.  If he's diabetic, skip the corn.  It's high in sugar and starch.
Pound the chicken beasts thin between some plastic wrap.  Should make a sheet of chicken.  Pick some yummy things to go inside and roll them up.  Put some prosciutto, spinach, Fontina cheese, or whatever you want on top and roll them up.  Grill them for about 10 miss and baste with some lemon and butter to flame up a bit and serve.  I'm not a grill expert either, so I'm just here with a quick comment: It's super easy to grill ears of corn. Just put them in the husks on the grill for five to ten minutes, then peel them inside. Trim the protruding silk off the top so they don't catch fire. Why not? It's a piece of equipment not an ingredient...#####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;__Kuru__ is an incurable degenerative [neurological disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder) endemic to tribal regions of [Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea). It is a type of [transmissible spongiform encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_spongiform_encephalopathy), caused by a [prion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion) found in humans.

&gt;The term "kuru" derives from the [Fore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fore_people) word "kuria/guria" ("to shake"),  a reference to the body tremors that are a classic symptom of the disease; it is also known among the Fore as the "laughing sickness" due to the [pathologic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_pathology) bursts of laughter people would display when afflicted with the disease. It is now widely accepted that Kuru was transmitted among members of the Fore tribe of Papua New Guinea via [funerary cannibalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannibalism).

Plus, its not cool to eat people.  Must be an acquired taste.  When I lived in aus I tried this and it was brutal. And cheers to you my good fellow redditor.If I'm sticking something in my food, I'm not going with cheapest version from Ebay.No worries, I guess I read smarm where there was none. Cheers.Gotcha, thanks for the correction.I really want to like cilantro.  I respect and admire authentic mexican and vietnamese food.

You know the smell [stink bugs](http://www.westernpest.com/uploads/promo/stink-bug-control-program.jpg) make?  That's what my genes tell me cilantro tastes like.  Huh, TIL. The stomach part always bothered me but after your description I'm more apt to give it a go.ANCHOVIES. And fish sauce.

Also, when I was a little kid we'd go to my brother's wife's family farm for pig roasts and they'd give me the ear. Always looked forward to that! Boil egg noodles in it. Delicious!And that's the reason the pork industry pressured them. Conditions got better so the higher temp wasn't necessary I did 24 raw oysters one night at buck-a-shuck at a local restaurant.  Afterward, I felt like an egg.  I was the shell, the oysters and beer in my stomach were the yolk and white.  It was worth it.  I freeze it in an ice cube tray as a treat for my dogsFruitcake. I'm not sure why everyone think it's discusting, it's delicious!I like it that way, but I also fry bits of it and scramble them in with my eggs.

Edit: I can buy it from any supermarket here in south east VirginiaI just had goat brains for the first time at an Indian spot I just recently found, delicious. I didn't mean to talk down to you. I assumed you were at an age where cell phones just have always been there and explained. Sorry.thanks for the info. hadn't checked cost co for lamb, but definitely will as that's a great price compared to where I usually get it.It really is. just so good.Beef steak tartare on rye bread with s prinklings of finely diced sweet white onion, salt, and pepper. Most of my friends, when it's mentioned, can't get passed the fact that the beef is raw.

Also, sauerbraten. My friends can't wrap their heads around the fact that the meat is pickled.Oh, I see. It seemed to me that they were saying they felt old because they thought the kid had a cellphone.

And you don't need to talk down to me. I didn't grow up around cell phones either. Liverwurst.  My mother is German and we had a German deli near us so our house was well stocked with unusual meats.  I got a lot of liverwurst and pickle sandwiches for lunch as a kid and never understood why the other kids didn't want to try them, I thought they were delicious and still do.On toast?the middle will for a slight bit after pulled off.  the outside of the chicken is still transferring heat to the middle, before it can lose heat.  so yes it will get slightly hotter where it matterslolCarpaccio?Fun fact. Pigeons were brought to serve as meat birds by the settlers from europeYeah. I guess raw onions are in the right thread here, too. I like to eat them like that even without the fish as a side dish. Yumyum :)How will it rise in temperature after you remove it from the heat source? That doesn't make sense, it will continue to cook, slowly dropping from whatever you pull it at but it won't pick up additional heat. lol That does sound disgusting. There might be youtube videos on pressure canning to give you an idea if it's something you'd be interested in. From my understanding, pressure canners aren't too expensive either and also use mason jars.

Have you heard of Marisa McClellan's [Food In Jars] (http://foodinjars.com/recipe-index/)? That's her site but she also has a few books out (I have both). It's water bath canning and she has some salsa recipes that sound good without a ton of acid. I like her dill pickle recipe a lot.

[This] (http://www.punkdomestics.com/) is a fun site for canning and preserving food too. Smoked eel is a normal thing to get from the supermarket here.Put them on a big mound of freshl cut onions, salt and pepper them and drizzle some pumpkin seed oil on it. Heaven.I am willing to bet I were to replace the curry paste with the curry powder along with some chilis and fish sauce, I bet that will not fool you unless you're a thai or thai food aficionado.

I had paella and a few other dishes here and there, but not to a point I can recreate all the dishes. no.

And no I'm discouraged using curry powder in place of garam masala. msgI do it like that, except passata instead of canned tomatoes. Simple, easy, tasty.Oh me too! This was the first thing that came to mind when I clicked this thread. I don't have to blend it with anything though, because I really prefer it plain or with some sliced pineapple. I will never understand how people who like cauliflower and brokkoli are averse to brussel sprouts.Ones I've had in the US, yes. They even stir fry veggiesI made it myself for a while. It's like a pet, you feed it and bathe it. And now I am thinking of the next step and refuse to spell it out." Estimated Delivery time 36 - 90 days"

I guess if you order it at the beginning of winter you'll be set for grillin' season....I don't think I could handle the texture.I had toban djan in mind when I wrote about the fermented black beans, though I guess the description applies better to dou chi. Depends on what they're cooking. But you're right about vinegar -- Chinkiang or similar.I brush it with butter, salt, pepper, and some chili powder and then grill it. Absolutely delicious. Yah that's definitely a good idea and I do that sometimes as well.

The problem with using this method though is that the foil will collect the water from the veggies and cause mushier veggies. If you don't line it with foil, the water will dry up and won't pool around the bottom of the pan. This is more noticeable for certain veggies with more water content (e.g. squash, eggplant, etc.).but not ones in the city. leave those for the marmosets. How about some almonds, some dried fruit and some good chocolate?  Kind of adult trail mix? Stuff like HB eggs and cheese cubes would work fine, except for getting "smooshed" in a pocket.I'm sure it accounts for some incidences but most people actually get it from gardening without gloves. But unless you're pregnant, who cares?SPAM. I could eat a case of this.You should watch the good eats episode in pocket piesAre your grandmas ashes a good substitute for grandma?  I thought so.  Why are my bad jokes so angry?Basically so you get veggies with some nice brownness/crispness; if you leave the pan cold, you tend to get mushier veggies.

Think about  sauteing veggies on a stove-top pan; you don't add the veggies to a cold pan; you heat up the pan first.

Check out this article, roasting veggies is #2:

Soo good!For that savory soulless flavor fresh ginger is bestSome people lived in a world where there were no cellphones when they were 7. At least they didn't have cameras yet. Check the ethnic frozen food/refrigerated sections of your supermarkets. Great idea, why didn't I think of that?! Thanks!That's true but the recipe calls for it. Don't think it would accurately replicate the recipe other wise. That sounds bomb. I'm in California, so I don't know where I can find it around here. I'll try yelping it. It wasn't really cheese. Was like mayonnaise and relish and seasoning of some sort. The jar just said sandwich spreadUhhh...  Curry powder in Thai?

Burmese must be the same as Thai because it's also in South East Asia?

Chinese too greasy?

You haven't had anything Spanish but you still comment on its flavors?

You're comparing garam masala and curry powder?

 Yes. It's delicious&gt;I don't cook Chinese, too greasy.

Just don't cook greasy Chinese food. Are you trying to say that all Chinese food is greasy?Salmonella is reduced to essentially zero in about a second at 165. ~25 seconds at 155 has the same effect.

Source: Moderist cuisine Vol 1  page 148. Related question:

Has anyone seen an uptick in the amount of red in even cooked chicken breast?

I have a digital thermometer so I'm sure my chicken is cooked, but I've had issued with both whole chicken and boneless skinless breast.

For whole chicken, recently I cut into one and had a streak of red on the breast right where it meat the breastbone. I think it's the same issue with redness you get in the thigh/leg, [since chickens are grown so fast the bones don't mature enough and you get redness from the bone marrow](http://www.hi-tm.com/Documents/Bloody-chik.html). Not 100% sure if this was the same issue, but just my guess.

I've also had an issue with boneless skinless breast where there is what almost looks like a blood line about an 1/8th into the chicken breast right on the thickest edge. Again, this would be where the breastbone is except it hasn't been cooked on the bone. Since it's not deep into the chicken, it's also impossible that it's not yet cooked since the middle is at least 155, and probably hit 160 with carry over.

It's really annoying and I've made it a habit to not butcher chicken in front of anyone who might not trust me that it's cooked. I tend to just cut anything visible away before they see anything.alot of higher end grocery stores have a orange juicer where you fill the bottle by yourself. but it is very expensive compare to the tropicana or florida natural that you can find in the fridges.People in the US are pussy faggots in general when it comes to food.   Wait around for the "OMG leike there was a bone in my KFC chiken!" posts.NO FUCKTARDI was told by fda workers that it was a result of better controls and inspections in the pork industry that made it safer at lower temps than it used to be.

That could just be the party line, though, i guess. It's ok.  We are here to help right?  ; )Get "live" kraut or just make your own.i am honestly surprised duck is not more popular in the US. its actually hard to find at supermarkets#####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;__Bayonne Ham__ or __Jambon de Bayonne__ is an air dried salted [ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham) that takes its name from the ancient port city of [Bayonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne) in the far South West of France, a city located in both the [cultural regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_region) of [Basque Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(greater_region\)) and [Gascony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gascony). *Jambon de Bayonne* has [PGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_designation_of_origin) status.

Pretty simple foods, although they definitely vary based on region.

My family is from the Basque country, although we're pretty American now; however, I can tell you what my grandmother likes to cook and what my father would sometimes cook. Lots of chicken, usually roasted, vegetable soup eaten before that, often with a green salad. Next day would be some of those things put together in a different way, maybe a chicken soup or stew. A down-home version of ratatouille (more Basque, as my grandmother says), skipping the extraneous steps, so basically roasted vegetables in a sauce. Fridays are, of course, the fish day. Special Sundays are lamb days, crpes if I can get up early enough to make them. Also ham, in many ways. But it's [special ham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne_ham).

Almost always accompanied by good cheese, baguettes, and fruit at the end. The usual. The thing is, most people don't, and didn't, have time for the ornate meals you see in movies. My family was a farm family, so food was fresh and good, but rarely fancy.

Edit: Also have to give a shout-out to Basque omelettes, because they are heaven on breakfast earth. [Simple](http://nevadabasque.com/omelette-basquaise/) and [delicious](http://www.harvardcommonpress.com/tortilla-de-patata-potato-omelet/)But even that is not enough. Neither of you mentioned any sort of vinegar or chili-bean paste, for instance. And sulfur and phophorus. There was an article in the last (not most recent) issue of The New Yorker about the paltry poultry sanitary regulation in the US.  Basically, cook it to 165 without fail. Every other major protein is highly regulated, poultry, chicken in particular, apparently had an alarmingly low amount of regulation regarding "safe" quantities of salmonella. It had to do with the fact that there are several agencies responsible for poultry safety and that the regulation itself had fallen through the cracks. It's not like the big trichinosis and e. coli scares that forced major regulatory overhauls.

That said, I cook till the juices run clear, but I'm super careful about cross-contamination. At any restaurant other than fine dining, the recipes are written like assembly line procedures, not like you'd get at home. They're made to be able to crank out dishes with as little manpower as possible while keeping the quality standards of the restaurant. In that situation, I completely understand why the cooking standards exist.

At home, though, I feel a little more comfortable cooking under the minimum temps.Ohhh yes.lolGotta use that freezer dog Maybe experiment with a foam laptop case and some reusable icepack and tupperware? Foam laptop case will keep the coldness inside. Icepack will keep the lunch cold. I can't speak for anyone else, but my distaste for Spam comes from the fact that I was fed it straight from the can, without cooking. However, Taylor ham or pork roll has that distinct lactic acid tanginess that makes it significantly different from just circular spam. ApplejuiceMAYBE NEXT TIME I SHOULD DO MORE THAN LOOK AT THE PICTURE! As someone who doesn't own a thermometer and eyeballs my meat, I say yes.

I've never gotten salmonella, never known anyone who did either.  Not to say it is not a concern, but if it looks done it probably is.

Legs for me always have some blood or pink at the bone, but everything else is done when it feels firm via the tongs.  Just letting it cool a few minutes allows it to cook a little more anyway.

Cut into it, if it looks done you're fine.

I fell in love with tripe and tendon when I started eating Ph. Oh my god, crunchy tripe and some beefy jello bits in that hot soup... *drools*! I went out with my girl friends and ordered my soup with extra tendon. Based on their reactions you'd think I had ordered extra live bugs with my soup! Their loss. Cambro makes square ones as well in a lot of sizes. Pigeons. They're fucking everywhere. Where do you think the restaurant got them? Even on the coast sometimes it's cheaper by an order of magnitudeMost European and American cooking share a good bit of herbs and spices

Dried herbs. Parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, marjoram, cilantro, dill and so on. Fresh herbs are better, but dried works pretty good and last forever. (ok not really but ok)

Spices. Garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, chili powder, coriander powder, fennel seed/powder, black/white pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, cardamon, and red pepper flakes.

These will probably get you through most of European/American cooking save perhaps some fresh ingredients that form the base f the aromatics like mirepoix (celery, carrots and onion), soffrito (mirepoix and garlic), and holy trinity (bell peppers, celery and onion) and so on.

&gt; Greek

Greek food uses more mint than others. Gyros sauce isn't the same without the mint component. Also extra virgin olive oil liek the rest of the Mediterranean cuisines

Feta, Kalamata olives are obviously essential as well, which is a fresh ingredient you can't store in the pantry.

keftehdes, koftah and gyros can be made using the herbs listd u up there. All can be served the tzatziki which basically yogurt, mint, cucumber, garlic and olive oil.

&gt;Italian

Many shared herbs and spices as above. Extra virgin olive oil also, and red and white wine for cooking. Fresh parsely goes in everything. If not, fresh basil and sage. Often butter is used along with EVOO.

Obviously canned tomatoes is essential with fresh garlic.

Just with that you can cook vast variety of pasta dishes.

Add cream or bechamel based sauces, your menu expands greatly.

&gt;French

Go away

&gt;Spanish

I haven't had much spanish food other than paella. But the flavor profiles has some commonality with Mexican food. For that you need adobo which can be made from paprika, oregano, garlic, vinegar, tomatoes, bell peppers, and so on.


&gt;Thai, Vietnamese, Burmese

Galangal, lemon grass, curry powder or garam masala, ginger, garlic, thai basil, onion, fish sauce, tamarind,  cilantro will probably allow  you cook at least 30 dishes. From Curries to thai style stir fries, to pho, to ban mi. All of that can be made from from those ingredients.

I haven't had Burmese food, but I figure it's similar thai and vietnamese since it's in SE Asia.

&gt;Chinese

I don't cook Chinese, too greasy.

&gt;Japanese, Korean

They both have similar food. A lot of fermented pickles and grilled foods. Soy sauce, sichimi, gochujang, soy bean paste, sesame oil, tsuyu, garlic, ginger, onion, green onion, will get you through a lot of their food.

&gt;Indian

The most important thing is the garam masala. Go to an actual Indian grocery and buy theirs. The curry powder you get from megamarts do not even compare. Then ginger, garlic, onions will form the basis of their aromatics. You can use the garam masala by itself in tomato base to make vindaloo, use it with cream/yogurt to make tikka masala base, or use it with yogurt to make tandoori marinade.


went with frozen peas instead. It's now in the oven baking, thank you. :)Indian: cumin, coriander, turmeric, red chile powder, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, dried red chiles. Ideally, buy them all whole, and toast and grind as needed. Also rice, refined and whole wheat flour, and lentils and beans of various kinds.

Fresh ingredients: onions, ginger, garlic, green chiles, cilantro.

Extra credit: asafoetida, fennel, mace, nutmeg, mustard seeds (seeds and powder), fenugreek (seeds and leaves), tamarind, amchur (dried mango), anaardaana (pomegranate seeds), black cumin, black cardamom, nigella, curry leaves (can be frozen), bay leaves, saffron. Buy these as needed for specific dishes.Seriously! I went to lunch with an old friend of mine. I ordered sushi rolls and she ordered what looked like a big flat chicken nugget. Which was all that looked "appetizing" to her from the menu.

When my dish came out, she would stare at my plate while covering her nose, and mouth, and repeat how "disgusting it looks" and how she couldn't believe that I was eating that. "Ugh, ugh it looks so gross"
She did that the whole entire time that I was eating my meal.
It was so fuckin annoying, that a grown ass 34 year old woman couldn't behave like an adult.  I never went to lunch with her again.

Also scallions and dried red chiles. And depending on what regional Chinese cuisines you're interested in, maybe Sichuan peppercorns, fermented black beans, five-spice, cumin, chili oil, and preserved vegetables.My grandma told me when she a kid (pretty poor, lived on a farm in east TX), whenever they'd slaughter one of the hogs they'd cook the brain up with onions and eggs and eat that.

Can't waste anything, I guess.The term is, "opaque"...
Yes, we Cook the living shit out of poultry in this country... You don't have to.Scraps of pig ground up and mixed with cornmeal and wheat flour. It's grey and comes in blocks. It's incredibly delicate and crumbly, you slice it half an inch thin, fry it in a pan until it's nice and crisp on both sides and eat it with other breakfast foods.

It's incredibly delicious, and has great texture with the cripsy outside and mushy inside. It's a Pennsylvania Dutch food, but you should be able to find it in certain sections of super markets, yuo can get it in Publix I know. Oh get over yourself.Onion and garlic.  I use OXO square canisters because they take less space than cylindrical ones.  Easy to open and clean.Well, some ingredients you need to have in your pantry to cook Iranian food are rose petals, angelica, dried limes, and sumac. Amongst other ingredients.

Not sure how that helps you or anyone else that I said that. Unless you are interested in cooking Iranian food and building up a pantry for it.  Also good. Fermented shark.

Roasted fish heads, the cheek and eye meat, plus up behind the eyes just before where the body connects..... Crap that was my dinner guess I'm a hobo Large chicken breasts on the bone? If they're boneless I would sear it on a pan or grill to get some nice color / caramelization then stick in really hot oven, like 450 for 8-10.

Step 1: Take the liquid and throw it out.
Step 2: Take the ribs that you have defiled and throw them out.
Step 3: Buy or build a smoker and make proper ribs.
Whether it's white, blonde, brown, or dark has to do with the cooking time, not the fat used. Different cultures use different fats, but you are correct that a traditional French Velout would use butter.Grill it. Grilled okra is the golden tits. All the flavor with none of the slime. Ever had Finnish salmyakki? It's like the Dutch stuff turned up to 11. If I take a white person to the taco truck, I just tell them it's like Mexican pot roast meat. Then they love it.pick whichever one you want, i'd be curious to know :)If I take a white person to the taco truck, I just tell them it's like Mexican pot roast meat. Then they love it.Good thing there isn't much overlap between cooking and spelling.What's scrapple?Brown the beef and make a gravy out of it (SOS or chipped beef style.)  Top the potato with the SOS and cheddar.Saving for laterMy SO is like this. He leaves nothing on his plate, even when there are things that I think should be left. And he eats high volumes. Especially shrimp related things. He eats all his tails, and mine, every time, which is pretty often since we live in a place with cheap sushi. I'm just waiting for a bowel obstruction so i can say I told you so./r/homebrewing did a test of it and it was very accurateI'll try that in the summer when I grow some.

He said it was his favorite thing as a kid along with pigs feet. He gave it to me one night and it was wonderful!You want us to list the essential ingredients for 13 world cuisines and "etc."?!

Good grief...Would be easier using an electric skillet. They are cheep.Shiro's? I've had their uni. It's fantastic.Another 2 favorites:

Boil a pot of water and add as much salt as possible, it will take a lot. Then boil small or fingerling potatoes till soft enough to pierce with a knife. Cool on a wire rack, serve with butter. They will be coated in a fine powder of delicious salt.

Popcorn. Melt butter in a pot and pop corn. Grind salt in a coffee or spice grinder until it is a fine powder. Apply salt powder to buttered popcorn.What an oddly specific stereotypeThis, with lots of garlic.maybe try the type in the jars instead of in a can? The USDA [lowered](http://blogs.usda.gov/2011/05/25/cooking-meat-check-the-new-recommended-temperatures/) the recommended temperature for pork, probably with pressure from the pork industry as the old recommendation had a lot of people eating dry, overcooked pork! Many people still use old meat thermometers and cookbooks too. Those can give you terrible temperatures.I use a portable butane stove (link below). These get super hot!

Much quicker than a grill like what you're saying.

I wish I could buy chicken breasts they weren't monster size. With sides I really just don't need that much food. And they always come in packs of three at my local store, probably because they know most people are buying in multiples of two.Blood sausage is heaven.No.  If you absolutely have to use dried in a recipe that calls for fresh and cannot use another recipe, grated citrus zest - about 1/10th of the amount of fresh ginger called for plus 3/10ths dried ginger "works, but it is not a desirable substitute.  Fresh ginger can be frozen or kept in the fridge in sherry for a long time.   There is no truly satisfactory substitute; at an ethnic store it is dead cheap.  Came here to say this!no I think they mean sandwich spread like Thousand Island Dressing aka Big Mac Sauce Yes they come in different sizes in the link.7-11 spicy wings are delicious! Can of whole Italian tomatoes, ground through a moulinex food mill, olive oil, 6(or more!) smashed garlic cloves, salt and a little sugar.  Simmer until thickened.

Sometimes I crush the tomatoes by hand for chunkier sauce.

I like simple and my kids love it.I've definitely done it before and the recipes still work (usually a garlic ginger sauce-complete heresy, I know). They're much better with fresh ginger, and clearly that's preferable, but depending on what you're making you might be able to make it work. Depends on the recipe. If it's for a rub, then yes. If it's a significant part of the texture and the flavors, then noShun the nonbelievers! SHUNNNNNNUse another vinegar...not balsamic thoughGiven the buttermilk and the soda amount, it is mainly rounding out the flavor.  Use the schnappes for flavor or some OJ or other vinegar.  Any should be fine.I.. um... I don't know what to thinkI could eat eel and crawfish every day if I knew how to cook it myself and had the money. good idea, added some examples above!If you've got the time for it, cooking it at 250 until it hits 120-125 then blasting it at 500 for 15 minutes makes it godlike. Baste it with some honey glaze with a bit of hoisin mixed in before you toss it into the inferno. You can't beat a crispy crust.

And yes, I can't stress enough just how much fucking lamb 5 pounds is. It's way more than I thought five pounds would be.Good, someone already mentioned it. I love horse fillet. And rabbit. And deer. And alpaca.Mmmmm lengua, as op mentioned it's Spanish for beef tongue and is spectacular on tacos!

This is definitely my choice. Lots of friends think it's gross, but I'll fool them when we go and after they eat it (and love it) I tell them what the translation is. My sister in law is the pickiest eater I know, like used to eat Mac and cheese and hot dogs only picky, but has started growing out of it. We got her to try the taco truck and I had her try mine, after telling her what it was she freaked out... But now that's what she orders. The terminology around offal amuses me to no end. "Pizzle" somehow sounds more ridiculous than "penis".roasted beats are really good. we usually prepare them with a little salt/pepper and olive oil. our 2 yo loves them. but beware, you'll poo/pee blood red the next day. I would not be comfortable without a thermometer, particularly for water-chilled chicken. As other posters have stated, a relevant factor is the amount of time spent at a particular temperature. Fresh basil instead of dried would make that infinitely better.I imagine you must live somewhere in the midwest or very boring if these foods are considered gross. Goose is amazing. I had roast Christmas goose in Germany once and it was fantastic. I'd love to eat more of it but I can't find where to buy goose in Australia.

I'll second (third?) duck. Peking duck and confit canard are both delicious, but unfortunately both can be fiddly to do properly.put it into a tupperware container and use it for future recipes. i save my bacon grease and use it for all kinds of things. rices, potatoes, chicken dishes. its all good. re-use it on your next ribs. Why don't you list off some cuisines you want to cook, then we'll go from there. Haha, this reminds me that when I was a kid I used to eat PB and Dorito (nacho cheese) sandwiches. Nice and crunchy, good salty combo. I thought they were great, so many people thought it was weird.I grew up dirt poor too. My mom added a ripped up piece of American cheese and some milk to what you listed. It's still one of my go to comfort foods.If you have had salmonella poisoning, you will certainly be sympathetic to the safest route. But you can source your chicken to be relatively safer and not have to worry as much, and even with commercially processed birds you can brine so that the higher temperatures don't result in dry, unpalatable results.Scrunchins It is delicious fried (as most things are), and I've had cattle brain tacos that were pretty good. Definitely a much better texture than tofu, although not as good as a cut of steak. When used as a substitution for ground meat, it is a delicious and typically healthier alternative.I do whole chickens in a wood fired oven at 325 for about 1 hour 15 minutes. The ones I get are usually partially brined, which does make a difference (more water = longer cook times, and sometimes temps stall due to this as internal moisture rises  outwards). At 400, aim for 35-45 minutes for brined birds.

Always cook to temp. Those push up indicators you commonly see on thanksgiving turkeys are unreliable pieces of shit that often result in overcooked meat. If you don't have a thermometer, I highly recommend getting one even if its a cheapo.  Best investment you can make. Its the most widely used tool in my arsenal.Exactly. I'll eat Kraft singles all day but the value brand singles are awful. Fry up the beef.  Stick half of it in the freezer and make a white cheddar cheese sauce to dress the other half.  Use as a topping for baked potatoes.  The eggs will be fine in the fridge for weeks.Interesting . . . I never knew that!  However, I also never bake :-/Lard won't be very good for deep frying since its smoking point is pretty low. (280-390F) For application requiring higher heat, lard will smoke.

But it has porky taste which is far better tasting the vegetable oil. lengua is very tasty and heart's ok b/c it's muscle, but brain and liver are gross.  Stomach and intestine are good too.I'm pretty sure they meant the chef took a picture of their son.Chicken will continue to cook after you pull it off the grill. I pull mine off at around 155-160 for it to finish at 165ish.

As long as your finished product is at or above 160 for a few mins, you should be safe. 165F is a catch-all safety measure.

Everything that doesn't get put in the hotdog is how I had it described to me. So delicious... :DDuuuude, sauerkraut with butter and sherry...And shrimp tails! So crunchy and yummy in tempura.It's so good for you too. Protein: If you want a more subtle taste incorporate the offal into a gravy or sauce of some kind. I recently made a roast chicken with sauce and I just put all the liver, heart, and lungs into the pan under the chicken. They pretty much dissolved into the gravy when it was done. It adds a delicious richness that's not too strong. Just make sure they are covered in sauce or at least cover them in foil so they won't burn.I totally agree, which is why I tend to buy locally-sourced air-chilled chicken whenever possible, to minimize contamination. I worry that the water-chilling process spreads any contamination throughout all the birds in the processing batch.They have a place, and that place is on a classic grilled cheese made with white bread and lots of butter, with a side of tomato soup. That's childhood right there.I dunno, it didn't taste particularly bad.  Though it's not good.  It's... Weird.  But not in a good way.I agree for air-chilled birds, but for water-chilled birds, where they throw them into a liquid solution that can spread contaminants, then I tend to cook to a higher temperature./r/nocontextAsparagus with lemon 10/10. Personally, I focus largely on how the chicken is raised and processed. If it's a chicken that is locally raised, worry less. Similarly, if the chicken is air-chilled (as my local hens tend to be), I worry less. If it's a commercially-processed, water-chilled bird, then I worry more about contamination and I tend to focus more on the final cooking temperature.I love cows head! Barbacoa tacos with green salsa and a big red. Texan here!!!The $.99 great value "american cheese product" and etc are absolutely horrid, hit otherwise processed cheese is just fine by me.Sauce for the baked beans to accompany the ribs.Pretty much everything in this thread. Anchovies, sardines, bone marrow, sauerkraut, you name it. I was raised to try all kinds of food. No picky eaters in my house.

&gt;he was 7

&gt;then took a pic with him with his cell.

This makes me feel old.

Ham steak is always very salty. Serve with fried potatoes (extra salt), and you can easily exceed reasonable intake.

Or any recipe by [Anne Burrell](http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/anne-burrell/recipes.html), she is known as "the salt lady" in my house. [Link to her shows](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/secrets-of-a-restaurant-chef.html).It would be great if just once in my life, someone not working for a firm with an editor on board would produce an infographic without careless errors in the final version.

I can't wait to try that *sweat* diced onion. What is "Worchesteshire"? Is that anything like *Worcestershire*? Is "Chateubriand" the same thing as the correctly-spelt *Chateaubriand*? *Mirepoix* is one word, not two. Why is "Reduce" broken between two lines when there's *plenty* of room for it on the second line? Even *Barnaise* is misspelled, and that's not even slightly obscure to anyone who knows anything about French cuisine. I'm sure if I gave it another couple minutes I could find more.

People who make graphics with text need to talk to an editor, or run their stuff by at least one person who's actually literate. So many otherwise great infographics are dragged down by poor writing, and it makes me wonder if they actually have any idea what they're talking about, since they don't seem to be into reading much.
Canned sardines straight out of the can. Well, any canned fish straight out of the can. Anchovies too.

Hummus is a great idea, actually. Everything that goes with it keeps just fine.

I know some cheeses are stable at room temperature as well, maybe there's something there. You don't have to kill for it, its super easy to make!Bacon goes very well with kimchi!That's a pretty small container for flour or sugar. 4qt would be better for home use I think. The pictures are 8+ qt I think. It IS popular among Israeli troops. They don't just get a lot of tuna. They get a ridiculous amount. Some people just don't like the taste of pork. So far I've been getting used to pork with bacon and Weisswurst and ham, but fresh pork is still not my cup of tea. I've eaten a Japense pork katsu before which would be similar to schnitzel and I could immediately tell it wasn't the chicken katsu I had ordered after eating it (on the outside it looked the same because they're both fried and breaded with the same crumbs).

I like the Italian veal schnitzel and the turkey schnitzels in the UK though, and chicken schnitzels are nice too. But I'm sure they're all very different from pork schnitzel.I would generally agree, but cheap cheese slices are the grossest thing ever. They have such an offputting, fake taste and it makes me gag. Buy yourself an oven probe thermometer for, yes, the oven, and a hand-held instant-read for stove-top/grill/direct heat applications.  Best thing I ever did.  When I'm baking chicken, I usually pull the meat when it hits 155-160 F and will coast up to a "safe" 165 F.  Combination of anxiety from salmonella and not knowing you chicken's internal temp causes 99% of dry, tough chicken in my opinion.

No, don't. My brother came back from the army having learned this trick and did it outside under the kitchen window. It smelled for a long time That looks delish!Most of the recipes you find online are pretty "generic" and they all should come out pretty good.  One thing I would say is always use a little bit of alcohol (usually wine, but really any "neutral" alcohol can work - vodka, sherry, etc.).

The reason is that there are some flavor compounds in tomatoes that will not be "expressed" to your pallet unless you use some alcohol.  In essence, you won't be tasting the true tomato without it.

Some of the other suggestions mention it but some don't.  I make sure any dish that features tomatoes has some bit of alcohol added.  (Chemistry is so cool.)Kimchi. My local teriyaki place knows it to. If I don't order it they get me some anyways. I have only ever paid for it once. They also call me the white Korean. Shepard's pie.  You'll need some spinach though.I can't say I blame you. And yet, there was a time less than a hundred years ago where unrefrigerated foods were the norm, because refrigeration wasn't widespread. Japan's even got a whole Bento culture based around unrefrigerated packed lunches.

I kind of wonder how we've forgotten how to not refrigerate things. http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20100413-Sous-vide-chicken-chart.jpgThey're missing out, beef tongue is the shit.Kimchi! Oh lord kimchi. All kinds. Cabbage, radish, cucumber, whatever. I don't give a fuck, I want it all!! But I'm not allowed to even keep it in the house.  tacos de lengua.Maybe I missed something, but brain to me is just kind of bland and has an odd tofu-like texture. I had the Mexican veal-brain in a taco (sesos), dunno if another prep method tastes better.#####&amp;#009;

&gt;Health concerns have reduced the popularity of this meat dish in some parts of the world because of the danger of contamination by [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterium) and parasites  such as *[Toxoplasma gondii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii)* and *[Taenia saginata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_saginata)*. However, when basic hygienic rules are followed and fresh meat is used, the risk of bacterial infection is low.  Even when these provisions are met, it is nonetheless not recommended for pregnant women (due to risk of congenital toxoplasmosis in the fetus),  people who have a weakened [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system) or suffer from a chronic illness, as these individuals are at a greater risk of infection from *[E. coli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli)* and/or *[Salmonella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella)*.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak_tartare#Health_concerns

According to that link, it is thought that raw meat consumption can account for 50% latent toxoplasmosis in the French population and 10% in the UK population. Wonder how true that is?I like [this one](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=879241).Yeah, it's law here too, but someone on reddit a while back was saying how bacteria died very quickly at 165 (maybe 10-15 seconds) and will also die at 150-155 but only with a longer exposure.  The reason 165 became law was erring on the side of caution and not making complicated levels of "doneness" for cooks to follow.  165 for 15 seconds is just the easiest and safest route (and who can blame the state for taking that path?)That's a great philosophy you've got there, Doctor Lecter.God help me, so do I.  Especially the faintly metallic "bacon" flavor.Production!

Trichinosis is largely eliminated by modern pig farming techniques. Conditions are cleaner, animals are fed a regulated diet, and antiparasitic medications are increasingly more common.

It's so safe that the FDA relaxed the requirements for cooking pork back in the 80s, and it's now considered to be as safe as raw steak. Which, as we all know, is as American as raw steak.

(To clarify: There are roughly 11 cases of Trichinosis in the US per year. Most of those are from wild game or home-raised meat.)Bone luge being a shot of whiskey down the bone? If yes, yes it's delicious, and it's only the price of a shot of whiskey. I've never heard of anyone ever saying sauerkraut or schnitzel is gross. Schnitzel is one of those things that I get people to try and they freak out over how good it is even when I think it was botched by the chef.Every pig slaughtered is inspected &amp; tested. Fresh Mett must be sold on the day of production with strict cooling standards. Packaged Mett (sealed in modified atmosphere packages) has a very short shelf life. Both fresh Mett and opened packages can be stored in the fridge for only a day.

It works because of regulations and because everyone involved knows how things must be handled to make it work safely.
If you like it a little chunky. [Wegmans San Marzano Tomato Sauce recipe](http://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10052&amp;catalogId=10002&amp;productId=699419)
I use this mostly on pasta but pizza too.Yupyup.  No mushrooms for me though. The combination of sweet potatoes, carrots, and onions is amazing. My personal favorite. Yeah, I can't even cook spam with my girlfriend in the same room without her gagging. I have no idea why.Went to the best, most widely known sushi restaurant in Seattle.  Chef opened it up right in front of me, I am CERTAIN it was still alive when he broke into its shell to get into it.  I stood there in excited anticipation, only to be let down by the gross flavor and texture.  NEVER EVER AGAIN!When I use thin cutlets of chicken and roll it up, I just use a toothpick at each end to keep it mostly shut and don't have too much of an issue with the filling leaking. We weren't particularly poor but tuna noodle was still my favorite. My mom made it for me all the time.#####&amp;#009;

It is a fish meatball. It is not eaten like matzo balls though. It is eaten cold and it comes jellied in a jar. It can be made fresh though. During Passover Whole Foods usually sells fresh non-jellied gefilte fish.There's not much that I would eat after being unrefrigerated for several hours. Maybe beef jerky and potato chips.If you use the freakishly giant ones from the grocery store you may be okay.Mmm... Spam Musubi... Get a thermometer. They are like 20 bucks and make everything easier. Something like that.

And we shall call the people who dislike cilantro heathens. Cook an appropriate amount of rice in it instead of water for flavorful rice, assuming it's really liquidy.165 is required by law where I live, but at home I stick to about 155 as well. Lots of people overlook their chicken for fear of getting sick, but a little bit of pink is actually desirable. So long as the meat is fiberous and the inside is hot. Like you said, it ends up super juicy and delicious.I've heard tripe can be really good if you cook it right. I've always wanted to try it. Shirasu. Japanese dried baby anchovies. Love them:  http://imgur.com/VfsdQ78
Liverwurst. Throw some of that meat paste between two slices of good rye and dreams come true. Ooh! Ooh! My mother is from a rural area in Japan and my dad is from Vietnam. That said I have eaten a lot of gross stuff. Things I love:

- crab brains (best with lemon!)
- locusts, teriyaki glazed
- natto (fermented soybeans that look like snot. Love with mounds of green onions and mustard!)
- beef tongue, intestine, stomach, tripe, tail...
- pig feet (boiled)
- whale (haven't had it since I was a kid. It's like meaty tuna)
- uni, most clams, sea cucumbers (nudibranches?)
- sea snails (sazae is my fave!)
- chicken gizzards and cartilage

Things I have tried and do not recommend:
- horse meat ice cream (sold at a train kiosk in Japan. It was gross.)
- sunfish (my grandpa accidentally caught it while fishing so we decided to try it)
- live whitefish in a shot glass (I was small, it was a fancy restaurant, I am scarred for life)
- horse sashimi (wedding present - needs ginger)
- chicken sashimi (served with a tall glass of milk. Tastes like toro, but if you are immune compromised it is a bit risky)
- land snails, even with garlic and butter.

Edit: added more stuff
Brussels sprouts, they're probably my favorite veggie. Roasted with some salt, garlic, crushed red pepper, and olive oil. SO good. Yeah... I prefer Australian, honestly. It's big and soft and chewy and sweet.

I actually had a bag of Katzen Ohren a while ago, and it tasted like wax with a hint of licorice. It's honestly put me off the dutch licorices. I've had it out in Lancaster, can't get over the texture.Fine, i'll eat itOh yes, I think most people just haven't had lamb done right.  For those of you in the U.S.A. Costco sells 5 pound Australian boneless lamb leg roasts for 20ish bucks.  Rub it with sea salt, pepper and garlic, 325F in the oven until it temps at 130F, let it sit for 15 minutes you're good to go. Lamb for days.Yeah half an hour would probably do itYou can get them even cheaper online. Around $5 on Ebay.Everything but the oink!I've always wanted to try shrimp heads but all the stores I go to have the heads off already! It's such a bummerOh god, there are no longer any brazilian places in my area that do chicken heart. It makes me so sad.Dr. Browns Cel-Ray soda.  Delicious.A lot of cooking is a tradeoff between safety and deliciousness. Most meats taste better when cooked to a temperature at least a little lower than the USDA Minimum Safe Cooking temperatures.This sounds like it would be bone dry. Personally when doing bok choy I like to pull each stem/leaf off from the group.  I've never seen it done cut in half/quarters until I just looked it up on Google right now.  Usually buying from the supermarket they've got dirt down in between the stems, so pulling them apart individually makes it much easier to clean.

[Whole](http://simplysmoothies.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bok-Choy-2.jpg) then cooked either [Pulled apart](http://noshmyway.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Crispy-Roasted-Baby-Bok-Choy-Recipe.jpg) vs [Cut up](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3609/3477022463_c80f49ca3a.jpg)I'm from the US. The people I know are scared of getting sick by eating any parts of an uncooked egg. They don't know any better.Menudo it is soo fucking good and smells horrible while cooking but god damn its soo fucking tasty.Just about any frozen fruit in a saucepan with a little sugar will turn into a sauce. I use that to fill crepes or top pancakes. Black pudding / blood sausage. Travelling in the UK I got absolutely hooked on it, back in Australia the stuff I can find is okay, but just nowhere near as good.
Yum yum yum. Wish I could have it for breakfast every day.Because I don't own one.

I could buy one, sure, but then I'm stuck carrying it until I get a chance to toss it back into my car. I think 45 minutes would be good for bone-in, but boneless wouldn't need 45..?That shit *cries* for pepper.What a lot people don't know is that in super rich tonkotsu ramen, more often than not the cows head is boiled with the bones. Because braaaaains make for creamy soup!I'm always a fan of making lettuce and pasta salads and buying the dressing on campus or pack it. Italian or olive oil and vinegar/lemon juice. I also like veggies and peanut butter. Hmm... Hummus keeps. Non meat or dairy can stay un refrigerated so remember that.You mean pimento cheese? That is a fond childhood memory.Natto has the distinction of being the only "food" I won't eat.  You know how when you accidentally leave potatoes in a bag to rot, and they leak out that black ichor?  Mix that with some fingernail polish remover, and you've got the flavor of natto.

Natto ain't fermented.  Natto is *rotten*.Why can't you just keep your lunch in an insulated cooler with an ice pack?
Kimchi Creamed Peas and Salmon on Toast.

MmmmmIt's based on internal temperature, not color. Look at the graph here:
http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/sous-vide-basics-low-temperature-chicken.htmlActually those are really interesting. Thank you. I still can't imagine a spice company deliberately adding a common allergen to defray such a small part of the cost, but maybe their margins are that thin.

Post it from a throwaway as a comment to your post. No one would know.  It's a perfect plan!Just call it cabeza, and enjoy the deliciousness.I grew up in NOLA &amp; the stuff on that article is pure magic to me. Thanks for sharing this find. It seems like it would take considerable effort to get chicken to an internal temp of 165F for less than 10 seconds....why?  I mean, I don't think it's manna from the gods or anything, but it's reasonably tasty and mild.  Seems pretty inoffensive to me.I cannot stand foods fried in lard or vegetable shortening.

Things fried in oil that is liquid at room temperature, I can deal with.

To some extent I can tolerate things fried in butter or bacon grease, but I have never deep fried in either of those.

It's not an issue of taste, or cost. I just really hate the way that lard/solid fats make my mouth feel all... greasy after eating, and I have to wipe it out with a paper towel to get rid of that awful feeling.

Commercially though, I think it is all about cost and trying to please the largest range of consumers, who may or may not animal products for health/religious/moral/what ever reasons.
Fresh ginger can be minced and sauteed like, say, garlic.  Dried powdered ginger is good for many baking recipes, but I don't think it's a reasonable substitute at all for asian dishes.Ice cream melted. My friends yelled at me when i told i liked my ice cream that way.I usually do 350 for 45 minutes. 20 at 400 is probably not enough.In terms of learning about other cuisines and their essential ingredients, we live in the best of times. So many excellent cookbooks being published now with real up-close knowledge of so many other cuisines.

If you want to know the essential ingredients, just get such a cookbook of the cuisine you are interested in, and you'll find a list of those ingredients, often with advice on where to find them. I like to roast whole hogs. Every roast I make sure to eat the cheeks and eyeballs first before anyone else gets to them. Cheeks, because they are the absolute best part of the pig, and eyeballs for the novelty. Sometimes ill eat them brains as well, but only if they havent been burned from the skull being split.
I love this.  Only we  add canned frozen peas.  So bad for you but so yummy and comforting!I really hate to burst your bubble with this... Sandwiches (baugette, butter, ham &amp; cheese is really popular) &amp; doner kebabs. McDonalds hamburgers are also more routine than not.

The old world rustic french cuisine isn't as common these days. Sadly, the restaurants serving these types of dishes in Paris are a dying breed - but some will always remain as a respectful nod to the culinary history and its importance to the country (ie: Chez Denise - La Tour de Montlhry). France has undergone a culinary revolution in recent years that has gone against the old school, professionally trained,  white tablecloth, &amp; waiters in suits way of doing things. The new leaders appear to be those with little-to-no formal training, but demonstrate stunning creativity and simplicity. The guys behind Frenchie &amp; Le Paul Bert in Paris is an excellent examples of this.Are uncooked egg yolks weird/uncommon/disliked where you're from? Some people get offended way too damn easily &amp; have no sense of humor.

Have an upvote.Next: lemonade! It's amazing. So  good when you make it from scratch. Add a little water (counter intuitive), sugar, and the juice of an orange as well. Oh god that's horrific. Most Southerners appreciate good pimiento cheese. I miss my grandma's; we'd eat it on plain cheap white bread, but it was so delicious. More of a drink, but I love my kombucha. The booch!I didn't like sauerkraut until I had a bomb-ass reuben, and now I love it. Get that up to 500 watts and chuck tits bruhMy co-worker brought durian cookies in to work a year ago. A year later, I can still smell it if I try. Shudder. Buttermilk.  Ideally with broken crackers in it, eaten with a spoon.Hnnnnggghh I miss Hawaii!Isn't it kind of like how some people are genetically predisposed to dislike cilantro?Salmon collar is delicious meat but goddamn is it an ass to eatAsparagus - just coat in olive oil, season with kosher salt and black pepper and roast for ~20 mins at 400.I'm curious about this, too. I don't think I'd risk it. They are not even the same thing in my mind. So I'd have to say no. What are you making?Big sauerkraut guy here, I grew up on it. But past couple of years the stuff I get out of the can at the grocery store actually triggers asthma attacks. Makes me cough and wheeze. I think it's sulfites used as preservatives in the cheap kind. Does this happen to anyone else?Not for the nutrition info, but started doing this a couple weeks ago, life changing. Infuse your oils! No matter what you use, evo, avacoado, etc. Put your oil in a saucepan, add some herbs like thyme, dill, oregeno, rosemary. And garlic! Whatever you fancy. heat it until it starts to boil. Turn off the heat right at that moment. Then use that to drizzle, sprinkle spray, pour on your veggies. Such a difference between just putting them on directly. Plus the house smells.....All cheese is delicious, even if it is "cheese food"... I even like the spray cheese.They sell these at the Harvey's in my hometown (Georgia). I've only ever seen black people buy it, though. My grandmother cooked gizzards and chitlins, and occasionally she'd have head cheese, but I've never had these. Sounds interesting. At first I read that as "squid testicles." Chinese Pantry: Soy Sauce, Oyster Sauce, Sesame Oil, Cooking Wine, Rice wine, Chili Garlic sauce, Ginger, GarlicTo me it tastes like rotten onions- sweet, but not in a pleasant way... I guess I'm in the "hate" camp on this one.Most people I know like bone marrow. Its delicious. Also, brain, from my experience, is good. Never had crab brain, but Cow and Pig brain are top notchWho in their right mind doesn't love marrow?I was at a large table that received a round of  uni sashimi. 95% were disgusted. Me and Pete ate 9 pieces each. Thanks Pete!Real sardines, like at a restaurant and not from a can, are excellent, cheap, and so underrated. With a little Dijon on it...the best. It's basically just fish meatballs, right? Is it prepared sort of the same way as matzo ball soup? I feel like I'd eat that. Grapes are awesome frozen by themselves. So are most melons. I would try freezing the flesh as is and seeing if you like it.You really need to get a meat thermometer for the future. You will have the juiciest chicken breasts, and most perfectly cooked steaks and chops.

Here's where I got mine. If you haven't discovered this site yet, you're welcome in advance. PS that price includes shipping lol

http://www.aliexpress.com/item/free-shipping-Digital-Probe-Meat-Thermometer-Kitchen-Cooking-BBQ-9782/561246320.htmlOne time I pranked a friend when he went to the restroom at a restaurant we were all eating at. He had a coke, and I put a ton of soy sauce in it. The color didn't change, so he didn't notice anything until he took a sip. His face... I lived in fear for like a month waiting for him to get me back. Never did. Perhaps he's still plotting my doom. I've never really smoked before, but have always wanted to try and have always been interested in cooking.

How exactly does this impart flavor?If it's not fresh it tastes like sea diaper

When it's fresh it's like luscious silky sea custard!Costco. The selection is decent for both unfrozen and frozen fish, and the quality is very good. International Farmer's Markets and International grocery stores often have good quality seafood for cheap too.

Note: In the middle of the country, if you see "fresh" fish, know that is has been frozen, unless it's been flown in on an airplane and costs what you'd expect from such. You'd be better off in many situations just buying it frozen and defrosting it when you need it.

I have a friend that worked at Publix. Among others, they had two types of fish: store brand frozen and "fresh" fish. The "fresh" fish was the store brand frozen that had been removed from the retail package and defrosted. It sold for 2-3 times the price.MacDonald's food.
//at least they claim they think it's disgustingI haven't tried that, but that's a great tip. Sherry Vinegar sounds like it would be great on Veggies. I have a sherry vinegar with Tarragon inside, will try that soon.To me, they're milder and somewhat richer than canned tuna. I prepare them the same way, with a little mayo, dill, and lemon pepper. Pimiento cheese spread?American black licorice is pretty good, but the Dutch variety tastes like piss.  Appropriate post for this thread.Keep in mind that restaurant standards tend to be more strict than the actual limits of what is healthy. That's for legal purposes so if they get it a bit wrong it's still fine. My completely uneducated opinion is yes, but I've also tasted fully white chicken which tasted undercooked. And if you leave it all deconstructed and add a hamburger patty and brown gravy, you have Loco Moco! Breakfast of champions. My mom used to top hers with crushed potato chips. Mmmmm. I know this isn't what OP meant, but heh. Someone recommended coconut oil to me recently, and it turned out *alright*.  Also, I like to sprinkle grated mozzarella on me veggies. My philosophy has always been, if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, I'm cool with it. I suppose I've never had that tested on anything stranger than chitlins and gizzards, though. Your body stores years worth of B12 at a time. You should be fine unless you plan on doing this for the rest of your life. Vitamin D is more important, because it is what your body uses to absorb calcium. Getting appropriate amounts of both in your 20s and 30s helps majorly to prevent osteoporosis in the future. A more acute shortage of it will lead to the development of osteomalacia. But most of your vitamin D is synthesized in your skin anyways when you get sunlight exposure, so you will probably be fine with this also, unless you spend most of your time indoors. That might be going in my Bento boxes in the future...I love bone marrow. My parents are Asian but I was born in the US so I had it growing up from giant bones in brothy soup. I never realized it was weird and not an American thing until a few years ago. I describe it as meat butter.Veg oil has less saturated fat. Does anyone know where they got those flour containers?!I love it fried crispy, with a runny fried egg on top and a drizzle of sriracha Seeing a lot about temperature here (down vote if you'd like) and I'll say this:  when I used to cook on the grill at a college I worked at, I'd get the chicken breasts to 155 and put them out.  Juicy, clear liquids and people DEVOURED them.  In my mind (and my kitchen), 165 is too high.  Let it get to 155 for a good 10-15 seconds and you're in a good spotParsnips, sweet parsley tasteThat's how I do it. It drives me crazy if I bit a big jar of honey that won't fit anywhere except the Italian shelf though.Bone luge. Sounds fun. Isn't that actually barbacoa? As opposed to what Chipotle sells.Durian fruitHaggis. My only addition would be cream of chicken,  cheese and pepperChicken heart and kidney!I ate the heart last year while making the stuffing at Thanksgiving, and it was the most delicious turkey-related thing I've ever had! It's like marrow: super-concentrated delicious essence-of-meaty-goodness awesome.I also use this recipe. Like everyone else. The San marzonos are necessary. I didn't realize til I finally used them, excellent stuff. One thing I will mention you do... get bulk spices in the whole form. So, dried ginger roots, turmeric root, cumin seeds, black peppercorns. Store them in your pantry and grind only what you need to last a week or two at a time. Then you'll always have fresh spices. Any Indian market is good to source these from.

Also, get a whiteboard/chalkboard so you can write a note when you're low on things, or when you grab the last of something.Yes, usually. Make sure you let the chicken rest for 5 minutes or so before you cut into the middle to see if it's white; the heat from the outside continues cooking the inside for a while after you take it off the stove/out of the oven.Sometimes it's too strong for me, but I do like BBQ lamb and goat.Black pudding, haggis, and mayonnaise. My life wouldn't be worth living without them.It's actually amazingAs an American...

How else are you supposed to eat a brat or a reuben without sauerkraut?

Schnitzel is one of the great pleasures in life

Steak tartare... is kind of gross, yeah.  :-/Cottage cheese. I blend it in some desserts for amazing texture. And for a snack, I love it with fruit/nuts/dark chocolate/sweetener.Pimento cheese, the quality homemade stuff.

It's tasty and reminds me of childhood, but even with the best I've made most folks don't care for it.My mom often made this for us as kids. As an adult, I've been repulsed by the idea that I ate that. Now, I'm pregnant, and it's all that I want. I dream about it. Booked a ticket to the east coast next month so that I can beg my mom to make it for me.  For me, if the center is piping hot (i.e. you can see steam under light), it's safe.Usually I line 2 rimmed cookie trays with aluminum foil and grease that (cuts down on cleanup). I throw the veggies on cold and pop them in a hot oven (400 for brussel sprouts, 425-450 for root veggies) for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Dove is also worth hunting. You have to shoot a few of them, but god they are delicious.I really enjoy sherry vinegar. It doesn't have the extreme sweet flavor that balsamic has, but it's still divine on roast veggies. It brightens, and is still sweet and fruity, just not in the same way.Alright.  I'll check that all out once I get my package in a few days.  Thanks!For nutrition, I'd add some rice into that mix. I see one complete protein (the tofu) and one partial protein (the chickpeas). The rice will help complete that.

In addition, I fed everything you listed into the Spark recipe calculator to see if anything was really lacking. There is no vitamin B-12 or vitamin D. 0 percent of your daily value. The bigger concern is vitamin B12 because it's so important. D you can get by spending time exposed to the sun.

For B12, not sure if you're a vegetarian, if not, add a little meat. Otherwise cheese, eggs, yogurt, or nutritional yeast. Here is a list of [vitamin D](http://bembu.com/vitamin-d-rich-foods) rich foods.

As for other roastable veggies, this past week I've fallen in love with parsley root. Imagine that carrot, celery, and parsley got together and had a 3-way-baby. It's hard to describe, but absolutely delicious. Especially roasted in a little duck fat.Deep fried chicken livers with horseradish sauce.  Amazing.  My SO says he won't eat any "filters" but he's missing out.You can get a digital probe thermometer at any major big box store for not a lot of money. Bought my first last year and have never looked back. Perfectly cooked meats with no second guessing. Someone wrote 'the turn of the century' in a comment and it took me a while to realize they meant 2000.How do you get around the whole trichinosis thing?Kibbeh Nayeh is the shit dudeBLT with peanut butter instead of mayonnaise.That sounds amazing. I thought eggs and ketchup was a popular thing?More or less, yes. Check for clear juice.. Not pink or bloodyAlso pickled daikon, delicious if you know whats up, however I do realize that it does have a ripe feet smell.A good pizza sauce is very simple. You saute garlic very lightly, then add canned tomatoes, salt, pepper and oregano, and simmer for an hour. Instead of the oregano you can also go for basil or thyme or any other herb you like.Definetly going to try thisraw oystersOatmeal cooked with chicken broth and an over easy egg ontop. Mmmmm!Head cheese.Albeit I haven't tried a lot of different recipes, for what I've made (Pizza, Dipping Sauce, Pizzadillas, Marinara) [this has worked out great](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/pizza-sauce.html).  Simple, has all the ingredients you'd expect, no fluff you wouldn't.This is such a great description of uni! I'll describe it as custard of the sea and see if that'll get people to want to try it. I do know some people who hate custard, too, though... :S&gt; Roast everything in that fat. It is life changingly good.

I'm going to hold you to this claim.Sometimes when it's super fresh and good, it can taste fruity like mangoes. Something about it is so...seductive, too. So much more sexy than oysters, I think. I can relate to the bechamel for really good mac and cheese. My ma-in-law taught me how to make it. To me it makes for perfect macaroni and cheese.They are similar, but I was raised with vegemite, and I think it is so much better. Marmite is okay, but I would never crave for itMmm... tripe.Smells bad, tastes even worse (which is actually hard to believe because the smell is so fucking strong and bad)Are you out of your mind?  All of those foods are highly regarded.  Maybe not raw oysters.I honestly like any pan sauce or gravy. Whether it's bechemel to make sausage gravy or bacon gravy, or a pan sauce from deglazing.

They're simple, they're practical. I don't make a lot of standalone sauces without a good reason (outside of tomato, ketchup, or mayo).brain is one of those things that gives me the heebie jeebies, but not for any particular reason. one of these days maybe...there's a mexican place a block from me that serves *lingua*. i forgo it every time because i love cheek so much, but it's next on the list.
i've only had grocery store kimchi. i'd kill for some of the homemade variety
Butternut squashYeah there's plenty of room in the budget for a lot of proteins.you ever done a bone luge? i want to try it so hard...but it's like a $15 bite.I was about 10 years old when my uncle came over and ate about a pound of my mother's baked mac &amp; cheese, the real shit tons of cheddar and glistening with that oil that makes when baked. He had too much of whatever else the grown-ups were into and spewed all over the bathroom. Intact macaroni's and all, but the smell was just slightly off from fresh out of the oven, now it was on the bathroom wall and would stay there for a couple days. Just thought I'd share a random related story while we're being off-topic.Vegemite Im not sure how a whales vagina has to do with mustardCame here to recommend brussel sprouts. I do mine in olive oil and balsamic vinegar, with salt, pepper, and garlic.Mmm...now I'm interested in that snack!  Red, white, or black grapes?Tofu. That stuff is the shit. If all else fails. Cut the breast in half and check for yourself.I haven't had pheasant since I left my home town over twenty years ago, and I still miss it.It's the only meat that should be sold as a gray cube.Psh, you don't needa tell me about spam musubi! I'm Hawaiian, that and Maruchan made up my entire childhood. My mom's tuna casserole, from the days when we were very poor (so poor we were one of the families the food you donate on thanksgiving goes to).

It's just egg noodles, a can of tuna and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Baked.  That's it.  It costs around $3 and can feed four people, but most people I've tried to feed it to find it really bland.Absolutely not. There's a brightness and freshness in the flavor of fresh ginger. Dried powdered ginger does not, it has warmth and a bit of a kick - but it's just not comparable.Nitrogen is very important as well.Chicken gizzards, breaded, fried, with mashed potatoes, gravy, and biscuits. Heaven on a plate. No  one in my family will eat them. I have to wait until I go to my mothers. She'll make them for me, but won't eat them.Black Pudding (Blood Sausage)! Looks gross - tastes amazing. Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen.
With a few metals and trace elements added in here and there, you should be able to make just about anything.

I don't get why people think Spam is gross. It's basically just salty ham. If it came in a circle, you would call it Taylor ham and no one would think about it twice. Soy sauce. Sometimes when I get a salt craving, I just take a little sip and hold it in my mouth then swallow. Fascinating I know. Not sure what this has to do with wine.I'll make a post about it.  I would guess that 20 min isn't long enough for large breasts. If you want to be safe just turn it down and maybe cover them &amp; leave them longer, if it's low enough even another 20 minutes won't hurt.Wait wait wait, sandwich spread and peanut butter? Like... together?Thank you so much! :) And I 100% agree. The thing i love the most about this sub is it seems to be really open to actually talking about food and cooking. I flat out gave up on /r/food because most folks there seem to be confused that their sub is actually /r/foodporn. So anyone who posts questions or a picture of something less than photogenic gets a rate down. It was a big turnoff. This sub has been the exact opposite.Thank you! :) I am just shocked how much food and ingredients I get off of one duck, like every single time I get one.I'll go one further. Where I work it has to maintain that temp for 10 seconds.Could you? Sure! Would you want to? Ehhh, I'm not sure. It would be totally doable but you're going to want to trim off nearly all of the fat and skin first. Most of the cooking processes for duck involve finding ways to get rid of excess fat. Under the skin you can sometimes find upwards of 2cm of fat... you need some of that to render out. That's why duck has a reputation for being "greasy."

Once you trim it down, fry'er up! It's all dark meat, so it would be really forgiving in a fryer I imagine.Let's say I baked 3 large chicken breasts at 400 for about 20 mins, would that reach 165 internally? I don't have a thermometerSpam. Grilled spam and cheese sandwiches for life. It. Is. Awesome. Make sure to try it when having thw chance!Reduce it down and pour onto the ribs, would be my first thought?You want it to reach 165f I believe so it may take longer after it's not pink to reach that tempSquab is young, tender ones. I'm talking about the ones in the city you could catch by the dozens with a net.I could eat gallons of velveeta queso. That stuff is gold.I don't know of where I would find any classes like that, but we are interested.  We did up salsa last year in water bath, but we had to add so much vinegar and lemon juice for the recipe it tasted like crap.  Way too tart.   I would love to can our soups and chili instead of freezing them.  I mean....I eat store bought canned chili all the time.  Chili (with beans and meat of course) is probably one of my favorite foods.   We some times do up 12 gallons of Chili for winter.  We use the 7 gallon and another 5 gallon pot. Roast brussel sprouts may be one of the best things ever. I'm from NZ and Vegemite or Marmite split opinion. NZ Marmite his horrid though and nothing like the British stuff. I quite like the British Marmite, but Vegemite is still my favourite.Aldi sells frozen whole duck.  Less than $10...I had Uni once.

Once.


Never again. Ever. Roasted parsnips are wonderful. Celery is nice roasted too.&gt;I recently ground down the pebbled cooking surface that come stock on my Lodge cast iron pans.

How?For tomato sauce I just buy the cheap canned shit in the store because I am lazy. For white sauce I make a bechamel and add a bunch of garlic and Parmesan cheeseNot to mention stock. Fatty shrimp heads make a great stock!I have found that if I whip just the yolks and lemon juice for longer prior to starting to add the butter, it tends to thicken better. Also, a squirt of sirriacha or chili sambal gives great color and a nice little kick. Serve that on a hamburger with a fried agh, lettuce and a fresh tomato and you really have something.&gt; most of my friends draw the line at tongue or heart

What?!  Tongue and heart are mostly muscle, which is *what meat is*.  It's not like you're asking them to eat tripe or pizzle.

This is why we can't have nice things.  "Oh, we don't carry beef tongue, nobody will buy it."I tried the flax seed oil thing for a while, but the seasoning always flaked off. I finally decided to fall back on a few hundred years of cast iron wisdom and just use the same oil that I cook with, and have not had any problems since.

The science-y blog post is very popular, but Sheryl Canter has degrees in psychology, counseling, and fine arts--not chemistry.I don't think I can afford a whole duck either...I think a lot of people would freak out if you put a plate of raw beef (tartare) in front of them.I roast 1/2 sweet potato, 5 halved brussel sprouts, one small sliced onion, and a few whole cloves of garlic with olive oil/salt/pepper almost every morning, and then I put a fried egg and cholula on top. Its so tasty!!!I especially don't understand why people wouldn't eat beef cheek Roasted radishes are really good!You...you eat corned beef out of the tin too? My family pretends I'm not there whilst I'm eating it, but I can feel the judgement. I live in the Arkansas River Valley. The only way we get fresh seafood is one little store downtown that has very inconsistent hours/days. But her seafood is brought in fresh every day that she's open. Never touches a freezer at all.asian stores for the freshest [This recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/10/new-york-style-pizza-sauce.html), but be sure to use San Marzano tomatoes. Also, I prefer to hand squeeze the tomatoes instead of using my food processed. And I use a zester for the garlic to get it really fine.Yes, yes, and I haven't had it.

One of my fav memories of my kid - he was 7, we were on vacation in a super fancy well known place, we ordered the roasted bone marrow.  He ate it, then started picking the scraps off the bone with his finger and teeth.  The chef came out, I tried to get the kid to "eat properly," and he asked me to leave him alone and let him eat, then took a pic with him with his cell.  I find that's the best way to get a consistent color to bacon all at the same time.  Plus, way easier to glaze it with honey/brown sugar/teriyaki/maple syrup/cracked black pepper.  I just picked up about five pounds of these for chicken-kale stew.  My plan is:

* Debone the legs while [pretending I'm Jacques Ppin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku5p1CcGn70)
* Brown half of the legs in a stew pot to make a fond for soffritto
* Brown the other half in a skillet to make a fond for some sort of bacon cremini gravy... thing; I dunno, but it's gonna be tasty one way or the other
* I'm thinking fennel, chili flakes, thyme, oregano, and sage, maybe throw in some anchovies
* Kale, obviously, and brown rice as a starch.  I love overcooked brown rice in soups and stews
* Make a bigass pot of stock on SundayIt tastes like peanuts to me for some reason... I love it as well.sardines. use the dried ones to make stock, then i eat the fish separatelyI've always wondered how far Vegemite is from Marmite. I fucking love Marmite. Absolutely the best part. A simple dish of pasta or risotto can be elevated to high end cuisine by putting a soft cooked egg on it. An egg yolk with a bit of salt is one of the most amazingly luxurious sauces you can get and _it just comes out of the chicken like that_. You don't even need any skill to make it.Cod Cheeks and TonguesNone of the things you listed are gross in the states. I love German food.I'm not sure if this applies in the US but in the UK/Europe, if you have eaten a lot of salami from delis, then you may well have consumed more horse/donkey than you imagined.natty lightOk, prepare the chicken using the spatchcock method ..basically cut the back out of it and break the breastbone. Then you stuff the center of it with cut potatoes, celery, carrots...whatever floats your boat. Tie all back together and roast it.

Makes for an amazing bird presentation. Think stuffing a turkey for thanksgiving but with a chicken. Maybe a good soup or some kind of sauce for a baked potato?Fuck yes haggis. Haggis is delicious and I'm not even Scottish.

If you are scared of haggis bear in mind the following things:

1. It is traditionally cooked in a stomach but you don't eat that any more than you eat the container of a microwave meal.

2. It does contain a fair amount of scary offal but it's all minced up super fine and mixed with oatmeal so you won't even know. In the eating, it's basically just like a sort of intensely sausagey risotto/polenta/grits. Genuinely delicious stuff.

Also at least it is made of identifiable animal parts. If you have ever eaten a cheap hot dog or sausage you have eaten far less palatable things.

While we're on weird Britishmeat, I would like to put in a word for black pudding (blood sausage) which looks a bit off putting but tastes like it is just the platonic ideal of all sausages. Make faggots, tell your friends they're meat balls. After they love them laugh evilly and tell them they just enjoyed delicious innards.Pork roll.  I love that shit.What? No beets? Roasted beets are lovely - if you loathe beetstain, try yellow beets.


Parsnip's been spoken for, and rightly so.

Fennel is another lovely roasted veg.A roux can be made using any fat, but Velout is supposed to be made specifically with a "blonde" butter-based roux.

At least, that's what my googling indicated. I am not an expert and have only made velout by accident when I wanted gravy but had no meat drippings :)Taylor HamMan, this is why I don't use cast iron anymore. Too frequently, something goes wrong, screws up the seasoning and you have to experiment over and over again to find the right process to fix the seasoning, or start over again. I had a similar issue. I wasn't sure what the issue was. I ended up scrubbing those areas with a nylon scrubber till I got close to the metal, then started it over.

I had to do that enough times that I just gave up and used my stainless steel any more.Not a single thing you mentioned is considered gross. Anywhere. Calamari is the best. Yes! Roasted asparagus is really good.Or mixed in with a bit of bacon.  And BTW, you know you can roast bacon in the oven too?Sour Beef and dumplings,  I've loved it since its was a kid, made it for a large gathering of coworkers had to order pizza that nightroasted asparagus is so delicious!!!Scrapple! But I like a lot of the other answers here too. Various offal. Chicken feet. Shrimp heads.I love okra, but almost everyone in my family will have nothing to do with it.Crispy Tripa tacos on corn tortilla with grilled onions,  lime and cliantro
And they're quite yummy. I believe the dish is called squab?Yeah. Another benefit is you get that delicious cows tongue with the head.Sauerkraut. They're not too bright.Costco sells whole duck. White CastleWhat does that add? Normally I chop and prepare the veg while the oven is preheating then chuck it in. So cold pan with veg into hot oven Not to mention an uncooked egg yolk.Anchovies Trying this. http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/02/how-to-makethe-best-coq-au-vin-chicken-braised-in-red-wine.htmlEating faces is metal as fuck.

&gt;

&gt;__Asafoetida__ /sftd/  is the dried [latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex) (gum [oleoresin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleoresin)) exuded from the [rhizome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome) or [tap root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_root) of several species of *[Ferula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferula)*, a [perennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial) [herb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb) that grows 1 to 1.5m tall. The species is native to the deserts of [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran), mountains of [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan), and is mainly cultivated in nearby [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India).  As its name suggests, asafoetida has a fetid smell  (see [etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafoetida#Etymology) below) but in cooked dishes it delivers a smooth flavor reminiscent of [leeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leek).

&gt;It is also known as asant, food of the gods, jowani badian, stinking gum, Devil's dung, hing, kayam and ting.

I dont think it would hurt to try, although I dont know how crisp the skin will be after the braise. Still, it would add some richness to the dish. Yeah... a lot of people do not enjoy the smell. I like it, and I love the fruit! On the other hand, to me durian smells reminiscent of [asafoetida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafoetida), which often evokes a similar response (albeit less severe) from people.

^(The asafoetida also lives in the garage...)If you've eaten homemade Caesar dressing, you've probably eaten anchovies.That's so cool!  But I'd never do it in my kitchen... Fawk yeah!My supermarket sells whole ducks all the time. Black Liquorice, especially the super-salty and dense Dutch variety.There's one on [this](http://www.thesavory.com/food/master-these-mothers-learn-how-make-5-classic-sauces.html) page. We usually do most of the same, but lately we add beets and asparagus to the mix. It's really good!We always add beets, they are so good!That first requires finding a place that sells duck. I've never seen it anywhere here in the US. I'm not saying it's impossible, just that I haven't seen it.They just taste like salt to me. Oily salt.Eff yea, anchovies!  Delicious little umami salt bombs. I eat them with chopsticks straight out of the jar. Heh, there you go. :)Sorry, England. No swan for you unless you're royalty.I was about to say I dishwasher them =DClean with water and detergent and dry in the oven (this should be the only time you use detergent on the cast iron). Try preheating the cast iron at around 200-250 degrees Fahrenheit prior to applying the oil. This opens up the pores and allows the oil to be absorbed more easily. Also, you should repeat the seasoning process about 4 to 5 times prior to using. Once seasoned, I try to cook fatty foods initially to condition the cast iron. Hope this helps.Don't have to get the duck fat by itself. Roast a duck, save the rendered fat.Gotta say, you are *killing* it in this thread.I think a lot of people just don't like to be reminded that they're eating something that had a face.It's famous for smelling terribleIt smells awful (to most people, apparently). It has a, uh, [*distinctive* smell](http://www.thetraveltart.com/smelly-durian-fruit-banned-singapore-metro-hotels/).Spam. Duck fat is the best, but chicken fat is easy and plentiful if you make your own stocks.  Make, strain, and chill stocks.  Peel off layer of fat on top of stock, melt into jar.

Roast everything in that fat.  It is life changingly good.  Sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts, waxy potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli.  oh man.  I have a special pan that I use for this.  It's basically just an old aluminum half sized sheet pan that I have seasoned like cast iron
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rI2ihV1.jpg)I just googled it, doesn't look bad, what's up with it?You're not losing anything by roasting that you're not losing from any other cooking methods. On the other hand you may not get as much fat as you might need.I tried to make a sort-of chicken and beans stews last week, and holy hell this looks lightyears ahead of mine! **Gotta** try this one!!!Interesting is definitely a good description for it.  I've had it on numerous occasions before I decided I really, really don't like it.  I love my mother in law's cooking, if she can't make it taste good I doubt anyone could. I personally love spam and kimchi, both of which people freak out about.  Living in Hawaii as a child may have given me a taste for them.Are you sure that the roux has to be made with butter instead of chicken fat? I was under the impression that it was a roux as long as it was fat + butter.Why have I not been making quiches directly in my pyrex?  I can't believe it took me this long to see that opportunity.I love spam!!!! If you have the chance to have spam musubi (google it) you will be very happy!Yeah if I could find leg quarters for that price I'd certainly buy them over whole.

As well the one's i get for $1/lb come without neck and giblets, so the added weight from giblets/neck doesn't worry me in this situation luckily. ...Dijon is also a city in the Burgundy region of France.Yeah, I've only done water bath canning as well and I teach workshops for it actually . I sat in during a pressure canning workshop and it seemed fairly straight forward so maybe it's worth checking out in the future. I haven't tried it because the don't think it suits my lifestyle since I like making small batches.Rabbit Liver...Yeah, you're right, it's mostly from China, Taiwan, and Latin America.  Avoid the stuff that comes from China, they are full of antibiotics and are fed chicken shit and other animal waste.

If it's grown in the USA it's usually from Florida.  The live stuff you buy in tanks is almost always Floridian.Yeah, I know -- still makes for more corners and crevices to clean, especially inside the seal strip.  I probably wouldn't complain if I had a dishwasher, though.Anchovies.  Gimme the whole can.Let me ask.  I was thinking of making coq au vin tomorrow.   Would you suggest using duck fat to brown the chicken or just using the fat rendered from the pancetta I was planning on adding to the braising liquid.   Are you sure about that? Perhaps you're talking about fresh (alive) tilapia, but I was under the impression almost all tilapia was farmed in Asia. It is not a suitable substitute in curries, stirfrys, soups and the like, but it is in cakes and biscuits. My favorite thing to eat salty is potatoes! So anything that has potatoes in it would be a good juice. I'm not sure what mustard has to do with my question I love smoked tuna, and do it an even easier way using toilet paper (seriously, here's how):

I don't think OP's cited article was meant to be a comprehensive, detailed recipe. I think it does a good job glossing over common derivatives of the mother sauces and making the reader aware of what's possible.

On a related note... I think veal stock can be replaced with beef stock so long as it's made from collagen-rich bones &amp; parts - the whole point of using veal stock being the collagen content, after all, not so much the flavor.You should check out /r/castiron but you may try seasoning the pan several times in a row, before cooking on it, to build up a couple layers of seasoning.Depends on where you stick them. Also great for making crispy skin on roasted fowl. Try his caramel chicken. It's a revelation.I think it really depends on the recipe.

For me, ground ginger doesn't work in dishes with a lot of other strong flavors.

I exclusively use ginger for desserts, and I add in fresh and crystallized ginger into those too. McDonald's used to use Beef Tallow to fry their french fries.  They moved to vegetable oil in 1990.

The primary reason is that it's cheaper and they can now market it as vegetarian (which caused a lawsuit in the early 2000's as they still used a "beef flavoring" in their fries).Gefilte fish! Everyone I know, besides my Jewish family, hates itThis is one of my favorite recipes - it sounds kinda weird, but I promise it is amazing and EASY.

[Jamie Oliver's Chicken in Milk](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chicken-recipes/chicken-in-milk/)Thread just went meta. I get a pleasing synthesia from it... it tastes the way the sea smells.duck fat isn't really too expensive if you [reuse](http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html) itI just put san marzano tomatoes through a food mill and add some salt. Horse meat. I live in Sicily and grew up with horses.  Love riding and think they're amazing animals...but damn they're perfect for a 2am drunken panino. I don't think they were trying to be an ass. Just saying that they get those ingredients for less. Maybe it's good advice maybe it's not. Settle down a bit. Dash of cayenne is nice tooThese are not that crazy, but many people I know hate them.

-Liver (I think I've only had beef?)

-Beef Tongue

-Chicken Pateta (which upon Googling is mostly referred to as a pate in other countries)


A lot of the American friends I grew up with are horribly picky with their food.I just stick it in a glass bowl with a lid I have.

I reheat it either as fried rice or mixed with taco filling, I've never actually tried reheating it to eat straight white rice.Around here I can get leg quarters around $.70/lb. versus $1/lb. for a whole chicken, and my breasts don't seem to get freezer burn in the amount of time it takes to eat them. While I do use carcases for stock, I don't really consider that as adding much value, and I don't like organ meat. It certainly isn't worth the difference in price to me to buy the whole chicken.I was curious so I googled and wikied. My conclusions:

2. Gravy is much more broadly and loosely defined than velout. You made gravy by almost any definition, but you didn't make velout because you used chicken fat rather than butter.

1. Velout is not generally considered gravy since it substitutes butter for pan drippings, but that's not uncommon in US gravies, so why exclude velout? It may not have as rich a flavor, but it's more gravy than the stuff you get at KFC. Adding some herbs, onions, mushrooms or whatever leads to something we have no better English name for than gravy.It's a custard that came out of the ocean. It's magic! Like having raw sweet shrimp, but not crunchy. I second this. We don't have a pressure canner.  We just started boil canning and pickling in the last 2 years.   Pressure canning is a little intimidating if you have never done it.If you can figure out how to order it you need this:

It kills on roasted veggies.Guineafowl is tastyIt's my understanding that frozen seafood is as a general rule probably fresher than the "fresh" seafood that you can buy. Unless you are buying it right off the boat from the fisherman, you have no idea how long that seafood has been sitting there and whether it was previously frozen. But frozen fish is normally frozen (and therefore preserved) on the ship while at sea within a few hours of being caught.And if they're fried, they're so crunchy! I just didn't get the fuss. I love nearly all foods and I like every type of seafood I've tried (a loy). I just don't get why people think it's so damn good. I like it enough and I'd eat it happily, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it or anything. Probably for being an ass and assuming the other person doesn't know what they're talking about. If you live in Canada, $6 is already absurdly cheap for wine. I don't think I've ever seen anything cheaper than $8, ever.Oh I can see the confusion! I didn't mean "this sucks" as in those sauces suck. I meant it in terms of "this Sucks for me". I read this as food most people love that I find disgusting.  The answer to that is mac and cheese.  I don't like a slimy feeling.  Can't eat beans (like canned beans) for the most part either.  I just gag as my brain says "why is there vomit in your mouth?".Do you have link to a recipe for that? Sounds awesome. Probably goes really well with lamb or boar. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRIZtPl9nb9RiXc9btSTQNw

He's from Foodwishes and has lots of good recipes. : ) Beware: The way he talks will either make you love him or hate him.I'm not even sure it's food, but velveeta.  I fluffing LOVE velveeta dip.  The foodie in me is appalled, but my taste buds say bring. it. ON. I've got mine organized by things that go together.  Bottom shelf is cat food and bowls.  Second shelf is baking supplies, flours, sugars, baking powder, soda, nuts dried fruits, etc.  Third shelf is coffee/tea stuff and snacks.  Fourth shelf is pasta land, avariety of dried pastas and all kinds of stuff for sauce making, can tomatoes, can clams, sundried tomatoes, capers, artichokes, etc.  Top shelf is dried stuff and canned stock and beans, so rice, polenta, couscous, barley, chicken stock mostly.

Don't know if it's the best way but it works for meI haven't, but now it's next on my list.  I got the cookbook, found the beef bourgenion (I am pants at french spelling) and stopped there.  Now I'm trying to go through and try all kinds of different things.  Between that and serious eats, we've been eating like kings of late. :)ditto.  all tomato items go together, all pasta items go together, all pasta items go together, all ethic items (chipotles in adobo, fish sauce, coconut milk) all on a shelf by type of food (Mexican, Chinese, Indian/Thai), all beans go together.

I've heard/seen some pretty nifty things on pinterest but I don't have the money for that sort of organization.I'm surprised Spam isn't on this list! Sure, it comes in a can and smells like cat food, but if you dice and add it to fried rice, it'll taste like heaven. I like cooking the breasts and thighs by steaming them and finishing in a hot cast iron (stolen from Good eats). Then toss everything else (carcass/trimmed off extra skin) in a pot and boil it along with the juices from steaming and get a really rich amazing stock.


Serve the breast with some greens and rice add a couple glasses of wine for a tasty dinner (my go to "fancy" date dinner).


Shred the thigh meat and toss it in the stock with some carrots, red waxy potatoes, celery, and onion.  Best stew you will ever try.Have you ever tried Julia's recipe for paprika chicken breasts? Supremes a la Archduke or something like that I think. I swear it is a revelation.  I seriously lick my plate the sauce is so good. Pretty sure I could eat shoe leather with that sauce.I spelled the words correctly, my phone just autocorrected the accent mark and removed my hypen... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-1qas-CL14&amp;t=1m13sI would enjoy more of that recipe.  The last time I tried making beef stock it was horrendousRed wine and beef stock.  Since breakfast is everyone's favorite meal (right?) and so many breakfast foods are fabulous vehicles for salt why not make her a breakfast extravaganza! The traditional eggs, bacon, toast with salted butter, hashbrowns is always good, or consider these salty international options...



British - keep the bacon and eggs, use salted french fries instead of hashbrowns, make toast and then pan fry it in salted butter, and add baked beans, salted and fried half tomato, and pan fried mushrooms.



Greek - keep bacon and eggs, use buttered bread instead of toast, potato wedges instead of hash browns, and then a greek salad with salty feta and olives.




EDIT spellingVegemite. Nothing better on toast for a hangover.I think that depends a lot on the region. What's popular in Marseille may not be as popular inland say in Dijon.  The inside seal is removable, just pull on it and it'll come out and you can push them back in - that's why I love them. I dunno, calorie counting plus self imposed dietary restriction sounds closer to an eating disorder than actual vegetarianism. That might be the hangup there.Mm... creamy yummy porky goodnessApparently, this may make me a broth viking.  I'm not entirely sure though.just made some.

I just sauteed about 1 diced white onion with olive oil (bout 8 minutes), with a pinch of salt

Then added about a clove of garlic, sauteed for a bit,

Then added tomato paste 1tbsp, saute about another minute,

Then add san marzanos and just simmer it with some red pepper flakes and italian seasoning - I use this http://www.mccormick.com/Gourmet/Spices-and-Flavors/Herbs/Italian-Seasoning

Then adjust for seasoning with sugar and salt (I like my pizza sauce to be a little sweeter than what I would put on pasta)

Some people add carrots and celery with the onion, some add unsalted butter and anchovy paste. i'll add those when I have them.I understand what people want when they say "I want the Thai mother sauce," but I don't think there's an analog to the mother sauces in most cuisines (I don't know everything, promise!). The mother sauces compose a large portion of the French repertoire, largely through the daughter sauces. There is a lot of Indian, Thai, etc. cuisines that cannot be reduced (har har har) or factored down in to "mother" sauces. Yeah, same vibe. Works great. Nice thing is you can eat it right away as a moist roast chicken, or save it to use in a whole bunch of other recipes. Add to ramen, or make chicken salad, or chicken tacos or pasta or anything. And way harder to screw up than poaching chicken and easier to flavor. Reddit confuses me. Have an upvote.Anything can be a vehicle for salt. Ramen, miso, cheese, butter, chili.... French cuisine stands out more than Italian in my mind, regarding high salt content.I'd try that!  The texture of dried sea cucumber has got to be interestingCandle sticks taste awfulI know a few people who (for some reason) do not like lamb at all and I LOVE lamb. I also love this one Lebanese dish called Kibbeh Nayeh which is just lamb tar tar, but it's mixed with a good amount of salt, cumin, garlic and olive oil and usually bulgur wheat and topped with chopped onions and pine nuts.&gt; Sorry if this is posted twice.

No worries! For some odd reason it shows up on my mobile app for reddit, but not on the computer? Weird lol

Here! Here! My husband can't stand it though, and has relegated it to be a "GARAGE ONLY, GET THAT OUT OF HERE FOR FUCK'S SAKE" food at this point. :PCauliflower!!That sounds awesome!

I remember at some group camping trip I did once, we did "hobo meals" and basically threw some meat, veg, and potato into a tinfoil pouch and let it cook over a grill. Never occurred to me to try something like that with chicken!Most of the best meat is in the head and I don't think people realize that.  Same goes with fish, the cheeks are the best part.
Bone Marrow.  Beef is good but buffalo is better and bigger.  I like it with salt or sometimes a drop of green tabasco.  I could eat it everyday.  I also love uni even though it looks so unappetizing.  I also really loved canned corned beef.  I don't know why but I will eat it directly out of the tin.
Edited to add crab brain.  It took me forever to try it but now I will fight you for it.The cheapest I can find breast (boneless) is for $1.99/lb. But, it comes in a large package and I have to remove and store them in some fashion. So I also have to consider the effort it takes, plus the small extra $ it takes to have plastic wrap/bags to properly freeze the breasts (I consider the wrap almost mandatory as they've all gotten freezer burn pretty quick without it).

On the other hand, I can get already individually packaged whole chickens at $1.07/lb . In pretty much every case, I've never thrown anything away from the caracas, I try to find a use for it in some fashion. I know, it's weird. I can't fathom where the gross factor is if you're not opposed to eating meat. The number of calories?Natto is not tasty on its own, it's a bit bland and odd. But it does make you quite genki, I will attest. Also, very healthy. It rates far above kale in my personal tastes.I used to get a lot of whole and half chickens from my CSA and this is what I did.



Put half chicken in the middle of a big square of tin foil on a cookie tray. Pulled up foil so it makes a little pouch for chicken to sit in.
Add to pouch a tbsp of canola oil, half a packet of taco seasoning, one sliced jalapeno, two heaped tsp of chopped garlic, lime cut in half, and salt. Rub all over chicken then close up pouch leaving small vent for steam. Put in 375 degree oven for 45 mins. Let chicken cool, close up tin foil pouch and pop in fridge until I'm ready to use it. Shred for salads, tacos, enchiladas - whatever.




Bonus! Juices and fat and yumminess will congeal at the bottom of the pouch. Just mix this in with the chicken when its shredded before you roll the enchiladas. Will add tons of flavor and moisture.




This method actually works really well for lots of things...other 'flavor pouches' I like to make include (all plus salt and usually pepper)...




Half a lemon, big sprigs of rosemary and/or thyme or a good TBSP of dry herbs, and whole, peeled garlic cloves.




Lots of grated ginger, sesame oil, Chinese 5 spice and a big squirt of Sriracha.




Olives, sun dried tomatoes (fresh tomatoes do not do well!), and a TSP of dried tarragon.#####&amp;#009;

&gt;___Doenjang jjigae___ is a variety of *[jjigae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jjigae)* or stew-like [Korean traditional dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_cuisine), made with *[doenjang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang)* (Korean [soybean paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermented_bean_paste)) and available ingredients such as vegetables, mushrooms, seafood, or [dubu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubu) ([tofu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu)).  It is regarded as one of the representative dishes of food in Korea along with *[Kimchi jjigae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi_jjigae)*.

&gt;The dish is the source of the name [Doenjang Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang_Girl), a South Korean stereotype of a woman who eats cheap food at home so she can drink expensive coffees in public.

It's breaded and fried! I will happily make myself some delicious fried mock-cutlets. With some gravy. And mashed potatoes. And some butter on the potatoes.

I just made myself so hungry. Tonight is potatoes...Head meats of all kinds: brains, cheek, eyes. Especially from fish. Seems to freak a lot people out.

Any kind of fermented soy bean product, especially [doenjang chigae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang_jjigae) - even the Koreans look at me funny, when I order it.Most tilapia purchased in the USA is farmed in Florida.  They die at 50 F so only in the deep south can they be farmed.

I can buy living tilapia quite cheaply here in Seattle.  Shipping seafood has gotten a lot better.

I ate sushi at quite a good sushi restaurant (fish was very fresh, and there was quite a variety) at a restaurant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, so you can definitely get all kinds of fish even in the midwest.  As a Seattleite who has eaten a lot of quality sushi I was scared, but it was good.I organize mine by type of ingredient. For example, I have a spice 'area,' where all spices that I have have their label facing forward so I can see easily what I have. Next to that is my baking spot, which has the lesser used ingredients towards the back (i.e. agave, powdered sugar, cocoa, etc) and things I use a lot up front (i.e. sugar, baking powder/soda, my giant kosher salt, etc).

On my top shelf, I have bottled items. Such as my olive oils (arranged in a row so things don't get hidden), balsamic vinegar, other vinegars, cooking spray, etc. Below that are my canned goods organized by likeness. For example, my boxed pastas are on the left (label facing out so I can see what I have), all sorts of canned tomatoes (if I have 2 of 1 thing, I stack it so I can see it from the back), moving towards canned soups, olives, or whatever else I have. I left a 2 inch space between each 'row' so even if something is in the back, I still can see what's back there.

Hope that helps. Cauliflower with some red pepper flakes

How interesting. Like a tartare of pork. I've never had the pleasure.BTW, the recipe looks lovely. I'm sure they'll love it!You can either assemble completely, refrigerate and bake the next day or bake, cool and reheat. Either will work perfectly well with no issues. Go with whichever you're more comfortable.



If you assemble ahead and bake on the day, pull the lasagna out of the fridge about a half hour early to take the chill off then bake according to recipe.



If you reheat, make the lasagna in a microwavable dish (so not metal like in the recipe pics) and microwave the whole dish from cold for three 3min bursts on high. Then put in, uncovered, into a 425 degree oven for 5-10 mins to brown the top.


Will work either way, so go with whatever will give you the greatest sense of calm!Yes!  I came here to rave about parsnips!Always wash your unwashed masses before you cook them.I start to get upset when people tell me they don't like sea urchin, But then I remember that means there's more for me.I haven't seen these things mentioned before, but here are a couple things I learned:

1) Use parchment paper when roasting

2) If you're not using parchment paper, leave the sheet/pan in the oven while the open is preheating. Spread the veggies on the hot pan (e.g. they will sizzle) and roast. wrap them in tinfoil with some ginger and some honey!I generally agree with you, but then my Chinese mother in law prepare a dish with dried razor clams and dried sea cucumber. That makes me considerThe hell!? There are non-vegetarian people who don't like schnitzel? What if you told them it was a cutlet?Ugh. Can't do itpickle juice and hot cheetos are so good!The word is hyphenated, and the acute accent is incorrect in all cases.I love roasting sweet potatoes brushed with coconut oilWhen I roast a chicken I usually toss in whatever vegetables I have, but favorites are:

* baby carrots
* cloves of garlic, smashed
* baby potatoes
* radishes
* parsnips
* pearl onions

Toss them in some olive oil and give heavy shake of salt, pepper, maybe some rosemary. Roast on pan with the chicken (but not all of them -- don't crowd the pan too much.)   Anchovies, too.  I know a lot of people who've never knowingly eaten an anchovy but will swear up and down that they're horrifying.This is more of an ingredient list, right?  Thai peanut sauce has soy sauce, rice vinegar and coconut milk, but not any fish component.  So the base Thai sauces would be, peanut sauce, pad thai sauce, and then perhaps a brown sauce of some sort?  I do this, too. Not sure how big your pantry is, but definitely keep your most used items in the closest / most convenient spots. Sardines!I imagine the sauces would mostly be onion/ginger heavy and then there would be different spice blends and different vegetable agents at work.  Like onion/ginger with tomato, milk and cumin heavy spicing and then another onion/ginger with coconut milk and garam masala leanings.  Carrots. cut them as well as you can lengthwise, and sprinkle a little bit of cumin or some cumin seeds on them and roast. yum.I make all of my lunches for over a month in one day. Some of my favorites:

- Stuffed bell peppers

- Pasta w/ sauce and cheese

- Orange chicken &amp; veggies on rice

- Some kind of curry on quinoa

- Chili

- Soups

- Peanut chicken saute with veggies and rice noodles


Really, there's a ton of stuff you can freeze that you wouldn't expect. Sometimes the texture isn't perfect, but I really don't have any problems with it in general. And considering how cheap it is, and how good and healthy you can make your meals, it's a worthwhile tradeoff.

There are a few good books out there with recipes for this type of stuffcheck out Once A Month Meals (OAMM).That's the best part!Well yeah. The "five mother sauces" is a French concept, so an article about them is going to be Francocentric. What would you expect? Thank you this was very helpful. I would have liked even more pairing and tweak suggestions but that's probably me being greedyI group similar foods on shelves. Not much more to it than that, I suppose. One shelf has prepared foods, like cans of soup, canned tuna, soup mixes, etc. One shelf has all of my cans of vegetables and beans. Another shelf has all of my noodles, boxed rice and some grains. Another shelf has condiments, sauces and misc. jars of stuff. The bottom shelf has all of my flours.I like to chop up some san marzano -a type of plum tomatoes- garlic and basil. I brown the garlic a bit in a very little bit of butter and olive oil and throw in the tomatoes. Fresh ground salt &amp; pepper to taste and then the basil. Occasionally I throw in whatever other fresh herbs I might have. Oregano is usually a go to. Not including salt &amp; pepper I always keep the spices and herbs to under four. Adding too much takes away from the beautiful simplicity that is pizza. If I'm feeling it and have an open bottle I splash in a tiny bit of red wine.

When your sauce looks like sauce your done. Let it cool. Your sauce should always be cold when making pizza.

I've been making homemade pies for about 2 years and just learned from doing. I make my sauce from canned whole tomatoes. I puree some with my immersion blender, and then I crush the rest by hand for a slightly chunky sauce. You can puree everything, if you want. I sautee some finely diced onion and garlic with salt and black pepper, then I dump in the tomato puree/chunks and I add a little red wine. I let this simmer and reduce. When I can take a spoonful of sauce and it plops into the mixture (rather than runs), I know it's reduced enough.

I usually season with additional salt, black pepper, garlic powder, basil and a tiny bit of sugar.You're being downvoted for attitude. The five "mother sauces" are a fundamental element of classic French cuisine. Just because your son can't eat some of them doesn't mean they suck. I have no idea since it's my GF who makes it here. Tip though: when it's on the plate, sprinkle it with a high quality cold pressed olive oil and some sea salt. Yummy!Durian!You can make a roux with any fat. Classic Southern sausage gravy is made with the pan drippings and fond from frying sausage patties. From there it's basically a bechamel, but with lots of black pepper and possibly crumbled sausage. Oh god, I totally meant to put pine nuts in my list! That's so important! Thank you!&gt;they learned everything from the Italians.

French cuisine was originally influenced somewhat by Italian cuisine during medieval times.  This is of course when most meals consisted of sliced meat eaten by hand, with no particular order of service.

By the 1600s, France had developed a distinct and indigenous food culture that has influenced modern European cuisine in many ways that can be directly traced back to it including aesthetic, restaurant operating standards, and professional presentation.Yes! *YES!*I'm shocked by the number of people who think a runny yolk is disgusting.  Or a soft yolk.  Or really, any egg yolk at all.Haggis!Swan.

Don't know what it tastes like, don't know how to cook it. They look awesome and are angry all the time so they must taste delicious.
i rounded way up, i think. and double checked fresh direct when calculating which is probably why it's so high.

I use toothpicks, but be careful, gotta make sure you take them all out!Just search /r/pizza for sauce. I wanted to post the link for you but I keep getting 503'd. [Food52 has an article on the subject.](http://food52.com/blog/3198-pantry-organization)For what it's worth, I find that chicken leg quarters and those bulk bags of chicken breasts are actually more ecconomical than a whole chicken where I'm paying more per pound than leg quarters and getting a lot of backbones,  wing tips, organ meat, ect. that certainly isn't going to be worth per pound the difference in price between leg quarters and whole chickens.

Your area may be priced differently than mine, but this is my experience.I'm the other way around -- my bar for "new and relevant" seems to be permanently set in the mid-'90s.I've just spent the last two hours watching this guy's videos.Indian cuisine doesn't really have "mother sauces", it's usually just a base of butter with onions and garlic and then a specific blend of spices and sometimes tomatoesSorry to disappoint but I'm no where near 100 years old. I understand now it was intended to mean the early 1900's but I still find the concept pretty crazy.I did the serious eats pesto recipe and let me say he isn't joking when he says to use a good olive oil. I thought I could get by with a mediocre one because the basil, garlic, and cheese all have strong flavors, but I can really taste the medicrity through all those layers. Bought myself some really good oil for next time. Bearnaise is a derivative of hollandaise.Gai Yang is a classic Thai grilled chicken dish. But I also marinate it in the same ingredients and bake it whole. Small, yet common mistake, and I know I'm splitting hairs, but it does matter: pistou is pesto without pine nuts. Pesto always has pine nuts.Don't knock it till you try it...

I only recently started making homemade tomato sauce and I can't believe I ate jarred sauce and liked it for so many years. SmhNah, I'm with you on this one.  Espagnole is the mother sauce I'm most interested in making, and it's the one they detailed the least.Heads, particularly those of seafood. Shrimp heads, crawfish heads, lobster heads, fish heads. When I see people throw those parts away, a little piece of me dies inside.

^^I ^^think ^^shrimp ^^heads ^^taste ^^better ^^than ^^the ^^meat..."1900s" as in "1900-1909".  Escoffier published *La Guide Culinaire* in 1903. (Although I can't rule out the possibility that you're over 100 years old, which would be pretty awesome.)* Dried anchovies. Fry 'em crisp and I could eat them all day.

* Durian. Even Andrew Zimmern (of Bizarre Foods fame) won't touch it.He meant EARLY 1900s. Le guide culinaire was published in 1903, but Escoffier's works precede 1903.Liver!that's not how any of this works.I'm sorry your girlfriends think your pork is gross :(I mastered Hollandaise many years ago and for a long time - until fairly recently, in fact - I very much enjoyed whipping up a Hollandaise in front of my guests (no double burner, pan right on the cooktop).  So delicious and impressive! Friends were always extolling the virtue of blender Hollandaise but for me it was nearly as easy and much more dramatic to just knock it out in a sauce pan.  Then I ran across
http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/04/foolproof-2-minute-hollandaise-recipe.html  which uses an immersion blender and a glass.  My new go-to method!

Also works perfectly for Bearnaise, but of course do't blitz the tarragon leaves too much and make it turn pukey green! (I've heard from a friend that happens.  Yeah, it was from a friend that  I learned that)    That is a super fun fact! Also I totally ate that ad up, haha!
Norway just keeps on moving higher and higher on my travel list! Ooo! That sounds delicious!I've made blackberry ketchup more than once.  Drizzle it on pecan crusted catfish.  Ooh la la!   Wow! Impressive! Have you ever tried pressure canning? That might free up some freezer space. Thanks! That'll help me remember to read it correctly.*Do not* use avocado oil. You'll gain 10 pounds!
I like that.I sadly have never actually been to Germany. Born and raised in the States but in a very German-Centric environment. Awesome! And trim the tops and bottoms of the radishes, or at least the tops.Here you go http://www.food.com/recipe/no-fail-microwave-hollandaise-sauce-195437/review

http://www.food.com/recipe/no-fail-microwave-hollandaise-sauce-195437theres just a bunch of other shit you can add to it.  shallots garlic thyme etc.  by using the rendered fat and pan bits you made what is considered a gravyI love to add a few star anise to my beef stew. One or two is plenty. It gives it a little asian flair that my family really likes.My new favorite for roasted vegetables is parsnips.  They are amazing. If I had the $$ for fancy ingredients, that sounds like something to try! ; (How do you store the rice? ELI5 cause I feel like an idiot having to ask. Any time I make rice ahead of time it never tastes right reheated, I'm assuming user error. Try doing this with duckfat. It is amazing.Thanks a lot! I think this is what I will do instead of pre-baking.Peasant Perfect, I think a reason I stay away from unfamiliar veggies is because I'm not positive how to cut/cook them.

Looks like I'm trying baby bok choy and radishes today, sweet!It is probably genuinely one of the best things I've ever discovered in the whole of life, right after masturbation lmaoThis sounds absolutely perfect, going to try all of that!Yes I did mean pre-assembling the entire dish the night before. So, just putting it in the fridge and later fully baking isn't a good idea? If you think pre-baking it and reheating is the freshest way I'll give it a try. I'd just be SO disappointed if it ended up ruined.
True. The reason 10 hours is needed is because duck leg is a tough cut, and the extra time is needed to break down the collagen. Duck breast for instance would only require 2-3 hours as you advise, because it's a tender cut and doesn't need the extra time to make it tender.Oh man scrapple is so tasty.  I haven't had it in many years.  I'm guessing that you buy yours already made?  I need a good recipe since I can't buy it.I've been to several places in Germany and Austria and you guys have some of the best food I have ever eaten! I could live on schnitzel and mustard!Yes. Sometimes oil oil is hard to find, in which case I use olive oil.Celeriac, aubergine, parsnip. Use mixed herbs or smoked paprika for flavour, and coarse sea salt.Sorry if this is posted twice. For some reason it is not showing up.

You could cut up the whole chicken as /u/brobrobroccoli said. Alton Brown has a good explanation of how to do this on an episode of Good Eats called "Fry Some More". I linked in my earlier comment, but I'm not sure if it's why the comment is disappeared.

You could also [roast the whole chicken](http://www.designsponge.com/2010/09/in-the-kitchen-with-molly-shusters-herb-roasted-chicken.html) and then have some roast chicken and use the leftovers for chicken tacos/nachos/burritos, chicken salad, salad with chicken, chicken wrap sandwiches, shredded bbq sandwiches, quick chicken soup, quick chicken 'fried rice', nearly anything that's not fried. And then once you've removed all the meat you can, you can make stock/broth with the carcass.&gt;oil oil

MillefeuilleI just wing it depending on how much I'm making so I'm not really sure. I just add some in while I'm cooking and then keep testing and stop when it tastes perfect. scrappleThis is so totally off topic but does anyone else find it weird that we say "the 1900's" as if it were a long ass time ago? I was born and can remember the 1900's and yet it seems like ancient history. It's taken me 15 years to realize this too...

Ok sorry, off topic rant over.&gt; I am a clutsy person and I've never chipped Pyrex!

I'm guessing it chipped in a sinkful of dishes.

I have one (4-cup) container with the grey lid, and the inside seal is a pain in the ass to get clean.  I like the built-in steam vent, though.  The plain red lids have been pretty solid for me, but just in case I carry them in a plastic bag when they're full of stew or chili (which is almost every time).Ah, yeah, now I see your point.I think Indian cuisine would revolve around the different spice mixes, like garam masala would be a base, and adding certain spices to it would make a tandoori masala. A Thai version could include the different types of curry pastes among other things. Street chickens..yum.Oh and the mix we did recently was:

Brussel Sprouts

Garlic

Sweet Potato

Butternut Squash

Baby Bok Choy

Radishes

Carrots

Broccoli and Cauliflower if you're down

Turnips would be good in this too.Yes lard wins for flavor, usually, sometimes.  It depends on both the type of lard and the food frying in it.   Last night I roasted a chicken. I took the rendered fat and pan bits, added flour, then thinned it out with chicken stock. According to this article I made Veloute and it is only a starting point to become gravy. I always thought I was making gravy when I do that. Am I just shitty at gravy?Conventional wisdom agrees but the scientists say otherwise.

http://www.cookingscienceguy.com/pages/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/A-Common-Misconception-About-Frying-Food2.pdfYeah, like it's kinda cylindrical shaped so I chop it in half length-wise, and each half again length-wise so you end up with 4 *wedges.*  But it's leaves and stalk and stuff so it's not really a wedge.

I think I trim the bottom if it needs it, and wash them really well, but I cook the whole thing.  Never done a big Bok Choy though, just the baby ones.

edit: Seriously though, get some radishes.  Cut them into quarters like you would a red skin potato and roast them as well.  Maybe mother curry pastes would be a better approximation.Roasted brussel sprouts are amazing, especially when roasted with some salt and oil oil. I also like roasted carrots.

also roasted cabbage wedges are deliciousLots of Whole Foods have a big juicer in the produce section that juices the oranges right before your eyes.  It's not cheap, but it's fantastic and so fast.I keep wanting to try baby bok choy, I think I'll pick some up today.

Do you mean wedges like potato wedges? Also, do you cook the entire thing?I'd do pulled pork, 3 pork butts (~8lb each on average) should give more than enough meat and are hard to not get right.  Add some sides like cole slaw, mac and cheese and you'll still have money left over.Nice, I'll buy some of those todayYes, the balsamic is a great trick! I read about it on here only a couple weeks ago.Sounds awesome, I'll try that! How much of the Liquid Aminos do you normally use?Maybe be means one large drink, like a singular drink. Personally I just cut the chicken up into pieces most of the time and use/freeze them seperatetly. Breasts for stir frys, legs for curries or soups, wings for soups, carcass for soup stocks.Hah, no kidding. I definitely enjoyed the post, It's inspired me to give Hollandaise sauce another go after my last ugly attempt.Completely fair point. But most Thai dishes don't "build" on red or green or white curry, as far as I know. Those are individual bases  which you then combine with these others to make the dish...Penang Curry, for example, is it's own curry paste, as is massaman, as is orange curry.  You don't really add that red curry sauce to something else afterward to make a new dish- you stir fry it with oil and other ingredient and them *boom* food's done. Though I suppose you could say that depending on which proteins you add, you could have pork with red curry, or shrimp with red curry...but then, every Thai dish with every kind of Thai curry is a candidate for being the "child" of a mother sauce.

Either way, I feel like no matter how I try to reason it, I'm making a bit of a stretch to compare what is done in the French culinary tradition vis a vis mother sauces to the way Thai cooking is done.Roll the hell out of it on the counter then cut the stem end out (make a circle just a little bit bigger than the stem).  Drink the juice straight from the orange.  Wonderful treat that reminds me of childhood!If you use a lump charcoal you could sear your meat directly on top of the coals, no pan required.Sandwich spread (the Orange stuff with the relish in it) and peanut butter sandwiches. Also almost all the canned meats ( spam, potted meat, Vienna sausages, deviled ham, etc).The Sauce should hold up fine. For reheating, I recommend microwaving in short intervals (1 minute at a time) and stirring. While doing that, get the Lasagna noodles boiled, assemble and bake.

That being said, Lasagna as a whole will also work well. In which case, I recommend you bake the entire dish, let stand for ~ 30 minutes - 1 hour, to cool, then refrigerate. When it's time to get it ready, bake at 200F for around 30 minutes to 1 hour to get it warmed up. 200F shouldn't burn anything, but will bring it up to temp nice and slowly.You should be able to make it up to the point where it's assembled but not baked, then cool it down at room temp and then refrigerate it. Then bake it off Sunday night.

It'll probably taste better too.
Baby bok choy is really good.  Cut it into *wedges*, if that makes sense.

I also like roasting radishes.  They mellow out a bit, and are super cheap.

Also, buy a cheap bottle of balsalmic vinegar (like $2.50) and reduce on mediumish heat for a while until it's a syrupy consistency and drizzle that over your veggies.  I also squeeze some lemon and salt my veggies pretty heavily (again) when they're right out of the oven.I didn't realize how controversial sauce could be -_- Dang, I will try this.&gt;I was never quite sure, but is there any difference in taste?

Since most of us probably don't deep-fry with lard like you do, shouldn't you be telling us the difference?I'd argue that those are the go-to Thai seasonings, rather than mother sauces. I'm not that experienced with Thai cooking, but I would suggest red curry, green curry, white curry, the base broth used in pho, whatever the base of the peanut sauce is, and I've had a brown sauce too. The idea of a mother sauce is that multiple dishes are built upon it, rather than them being mixed together to make dishes as you were suggesting with your ingredient list. Canola oil or peanut oil should work fine in a roux also.it really irks me when people refer to any food and "disgusting".  Food is something that someone took the time to prepare, put care into it with the intent to nurish.  Referring to food as disgusting is insulting pigeons. they're everywhere.You should try turnips and rutabagas as well. They are so good roasted in the oven with olive oil and salt.Probably canned oysters. Or canned seafood generally. My brothers and I had the same problem in college with roommates who protested the eating of kippers with the windows closed.sounds wrong but taste so right.I agree that OP's comment should not be downvoted. But no one is really looking for "Mother Sauces" in other cultural cuisines. I think they're looking for basic sauces from other cultures explained simply.

I don't really know any, so this may sound dumb. But maybe a description of Indian butter/tomato sauces, curries, etc? Thai peanut sauce? I guess, how would they fit with other sauces in their own cultural foodscapes?&gt; head tacos.

Just sounds so wrong.:)I wouldn't say that in the Thai tradition "mother sauces" exist, but as a basic flavor component of many of Thai dishes, you will find:

Fish Sauce

Soy Sauce

Oyster Sauce

Rice Vinegar

Coconut Milk (not really a sauce, but you requested five)...

...and these are combined in various combinations and with various dried and fresh spices and vegetables to build the flavor profile behind almost any dish that could be described as Thai. There are of course exceptions, and other "standard" ingredients, but those are the go-to Thai sauces. Canned Sardines!Lard tastes better and fries crisper. It is! I was skeptical at first but its my go to substitute for cream. Its awesome in Mexican hot chocolate even.I have a peanut allergy as well. I'm sorry I know how hard it is and frustrating. If you are ever curious or wanting to experiment look for vegan versions of recipes. They will explain how to substitute even if you still put in meat ect. I use a lot of rice substitutes for milk and cheese actually. Good luck!it should be fine.Cow Tongue and SweetbreadsTry it, them come back and kiss my feet :P lolCame here to say add just a splash of Balsamic when roasting veggies, but you're already doing that. Learned that trick from Jamie Oliver, so goodEscoffier refined what we now know today as the mother sauces, back in the 1900s. The term mother sauce is concreted to refer to those 5 sauces because of how important Escoffier's Guide was to French cuisine.

I frown the downvoting of OP's comment, but I suppose it was rude. The comments in this thread made me briefly consider suicide.[Big](https://i.imgur.com/towlH65.png). Although he gets a little musty under the costume. #####&amp;#009;

Could I deep fry a duck? I have an indoor turkey fryer and want to fry a duck, but understand that the legs and breast should be cooked to different temps. Any tips/ideas?Just curious what you used to juice the orange? Definitely do it this way if you have an immersion (or stick) blender. I have one from Cuisinart [that I bought off Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HB-155PC-Stainless-Blender-Silver/dp/B00DOK0R2O/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424455128&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=stick+blender) and it came with a perfect measuring cup to make the sauce in. Comes out beautifully every time! Also, say hi to my puppy in pic 1!Sardines. My daughter loves them as well. Hubby can barely stand the smell of them, much less the sight. Cow head.



What you do is get a cows head and steam it in the biggest steamer you got then remove all the delicious head meat and chop it all up get some tortillas and eat delicious head tacos.Put the breast between two sheets of plastic or butcher paper and smash it flat with a cast iron skillet. Then stuff and roll it up so that there's some overlap at the edges. That or just use the slit method and then wrap in pancetta or bacon Hackepeter or Mett depending on which region of Germany you are from.

The first time I saw it I wasn't exactly disgusted, more like mortified. Having grown up in the US with the evils of eating undercooked pork drilled into me, it absolutely blew my mind that there was an entire country that has been eating it raw.

It. is. fantastic. People make disgusting faces when I tell them about it.I second duck. It was easily one of the most delicious birds I've ever cooked. Just don't see them that often. Mostly (all?) dark meat, so if that's not your thing, skip it. It should be the setting that looks like a sidways Wifi signal. You use that setting to make sure you've got the right wires going from the plug to the STC1000 and relay. I don't know anyone that likes pork and fried food (which is a ton of people) that would think schnitzel is gross unless they're just that type of person that thinks anything with a different name is automatically "weird".You might try searches on /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and /r/slowcooking. And Google "[once a month cooking](http://onceamonthmeals.com/)."Been making pancakes from ground oatmeal, a banana, an egg, salt, butter and some baking powder in the blender.  They've been coming out perfectly and it's easy to convince myself I'm eating healthy.None of my girlfriends have touched it, saying it's gross.. so.. yes! Boy this sounds.. wrong..Wait a minute, there are people on this planet that think that schnitzel is gross?

Everyone I know loves fried pork.If you have a slow cooker, pepperoncini beef is the absolute best. I don't remember the exact recipe at the moment, but all you have to do is throw a chuck roast (I think) and half a container of pepperoncini in the cooker for a few hours on high. If possible, put some meat on some cheap Walmart Italian bread, some mozzarella on top, and stick it in the oven for a bit. It is tricky to find.  I think it's under next weeks shipment and then there is one small link at the bottom.  I didn't know about it until I read a review online about blue apron.Depends on the meat and what I'm making.  I do when developing something new like a candy or a bread both of which require precision in measuring ingredients.  I don't for everything else.  I velvet meat differently (but I've seen many other people describe this method)

I cut the meat into bite sized pieces and add about 1-2 tbsp of soy sauce and enough corn starch to just coat everything. The corn starch shouldn't be dry anywhere, and should only be a super thin coating on the meat.

It should look something like this - http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20110401-seriously-asian-velveting.jpg

I then let that sit for about 10-15 minutes while I prep the rest of the veggies, etc.

When I cook the meat, I don't fry it, or coat it in anything else except the natural sauce that results from reducing my wet ingredients.

Also, refrain from adding corn starch slurry to thicken chinese dishes, I find taking the time to reduce the sauce to thicken ends up much nicer than artificially thickening with lots of corn starch.Cool trick. I knew about the smoking oil thing, but I'm going to try the velveting next Stir-Friday. I'm in the binder club too. I notate changes I've made and put gold stars on the ones that I'm done updating. Yes.  They soak the chicken (beef or pork too) in a solution of baking soda and water for 15-30 minutes (15 for beef and pork, 30 for chicken)  After this they rinse the meat thoroughly and then par boil.

They do large amounts at a time.

When an order comes up they just toss it in the wok and finish the dish.
I don't use tenderizer, but I will brine meat that really benefits from it, especially poultry. The meat always turns out much juicier and tastier after brining. I think you missed that part about food processors vs. by hand. My pie dough will body slam yours on the counter and take a shit on it's face. Google docs. It makes searching for something easy, I can make a copy of the recipe if I want to keep multiple versions with variations, and I can share them with anyone who has internet access. I can use them in the kitchen on a tablet, netbook or smart phone.The only way I've found to make it work at home if with a heavier wok and basically making one portion at a time. Even then it's not really hot enough. I've had success preheating the wok in the oven too just be careful of burning your hands. You're better off purchasing one of those xmas tree stand propane burners that sound like a small jet is about to take off. That's the good stuff.I have the 3 burner stove with the oven box. Works really well for smoking ribs but rusts quickly. Great for that high heat I need occasionally, and you are outside so no smoke inside to deal with I've only heard of it referring to the (very small) dice.  Maybe I'm wrong about that....Maybe try investing in a gel mat for your kitchen? I wasn't experiencing neck stiffness, but my feet were getting sore after 30 mins or more of standing at the stove everyday, as well as my wrists--I have carpal tunnel in my dominant hand, and the chopping motion was making them sore. I got a [Gel Pro mat](http://www.gelpro.com/) and it makes a huge difference--no more pain or fatigue in my legs, and my wrists no longer freeze up. Aw man, I wish I'd gotten to see the nastygram before s/he'd deleted it.Keeps me thin :)This poached salmon recipe is incredibly easy and really yummy http://blogs.kqed.org/essentialpepin/2011/09/11/poached-salmon-in-ravigote-sauce/[Here](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/07/chinese-velveting-101-introduction-water-velveting.html) is an introduction into Chinese Water Velveting

Also, you want the oil to reach the smoke point before placing the meat into it. As soon as you add the meat, the oil temp will drop significantly (assuming you're using a standard at home kitchen equipment). Here is a [breakdown of oil smoke points.](http://i.imgur.com/hyQqWMK.jpg)It is awesome, application is available too. You also have the option to create a shopping list which is incredible.I use my 3qt, straight sided saute pan.  To be honest, I use that pan for most things, it's my go to everyday panOuch, that has to be tough one to avoid.I don't know if there is a better place in the world to get bagels and lox. My family has been going there for three generations. I beat all of my steaks with a meat hammer before cooking.  The better the cut, the more effort you want to put into it.  I bought a prime dry aged porterhouse last weekend and beat it until the meat was falling off the bone before cooking.  It was so tender I didn't need to chew.French onion soup, needs a lot of babysitting but tastes incredible.As elsewhere stated, yeah you won't get as hot as professional wok. So you don't move the bits as much. If you want them to brown or get a seer. As far as the marinade, add something acidic. It tenderizes the meat AND the marinade seems to penetrate better. Personally orange juice (from an orange) works best for me. It adds hardly any sweetness or sourness. So you have more control over the taste. Yeah thats the same reasoning here. Also if you look through the book you see recipes you havent looked at and might want to try again as opposed to type in Chicken and ignoring everthing else left and right.You can use a turkey fryer with a higher BTU burner to achieve the same thing.I started doing the same thing. I tried using evernotes, but found that  paper was easier because it would force me to read recipes before trying things out.

I leave the back of every page blank for recipe notes. I'd do this based on situation. You need one 'oh shit' recipe for unexpected situations. A couple common situations-

- Invasion: Fifteen teenage boys will be at your house somewhere between one and three hours from now, and if you don't fend them off with something they'll eat all the ingredients you had planned for the week. Solution: Chili. Easily scaleable and endlessly variable, you can tailor this to meet most dietary restrictions, most people will eat it, and you can dress it up with individually applied condiments (hot sauce, avocado, cheese) without a lot of effort.

- College: You've got one pot, a fork, a pretty crappy grocery store, and somehow you've got to make dinner. Pasta is an old standby, but I prefer Wilted Spinach and Protein-of-choice salad. Buy spinach or whatever salad green they have, parmesan cheese, some kind of oil, and eggs or spinach or tofu or canned tuna (black pepper and/or basil are nice, but not required.) Wilt spinach, lay out on plates. Saute chicken or fry eggs or tofu, or drain tuna. Put this over the spinach, and top with parmesan cheese.

- Oregon trail: You need something that travels well, cooks simply, can be unrefrigerated for 6 hours, and isn't heavy. Solution: fish and green salad. Salad is sort of a 'duh,' but for the fish: it goes in a plastic bag, frozen, with a citrus/garlic marinade. This goes in another bag, and another bag if you're a worrywart. It'll thaw/marinate as you hike, and can be fried in a pan when you arrive.That's why mine is always different!!! Thank you for solving the mystery. I'm doing that now, but I think I want to write stuff down eventually.  My wife and I took stock of what my personal recipes were 5 or 6 months ago.  Probably need to revisit that eventually.  Usually, though, I just figure out what kind of dish I want to make, pick my flavors, and taste until I like it.Same here.  This answer should be higher.  Once I get a specific recipe nailed down the way I like it, I print it to a pdf file and throw it in my dropbox.  That way I have multiple copies of it on different computers/devices and I can access the tried-and-true recipes anywhere.  I LOVE copymethat for its ease of use and can't recommend it more.You can just use a charcoal grill, really. Or there's burners you can buy for use outside too. You don't want a commercial wok burner in your kitchen lol. [13 Delicious Chicken Tenders](http://imgur.com/gallery/j7NFy)

Not sure how much of these things you have on hand, but they all are basically glorified versions of Shake-n-Bake using different seasonings and panko. I enjoy the Honey Sriracha ones myself.

I'm sure you could use whole chicken breasts, pounded flat, instead of tenderloins.Also can make pizza dough! Pancakes. Throw in some scrambled eggs, bacon, and your on your way to a quick and simple breakfast guaranteed to impress every time. I swear it's the only reason my SO has stayed with me all these years... Pancake breakfasts every Sunday. Use a metal scrub, after that you can boil some water with alot of salt. Then reseason.

edit:link&gt;You will never be able to replicate the jet-engine-esque burner that powers a professional chinese kitchen wok

I don't know how much it would cost but if I ever get the chance to build my own house or redo a kitchen I'm putting in one of those.Maybe I was misinformed, but I thought that if you allow an oil to smoke in the pan, then it has become too hot and exceeded its "best" temperature to cook with.  Is that wrong?  I recall seeing a chart with different oils and how hot you could get them before they'd smoke.Your FP isn't Internet enabled?  C'mon man, this is 2015! Get with the program! Rebel Fish salmon fillets.  Comes with seasoning packet.  Ready in 90 seconds in the microwave.  Grilled asparagus.Second this suggestion. I'm convinced barkeepers friend is magic. I made a huge pot of soup for having some friends over, and left the burner on low just to keep it warm if people wanted seconds, then proceeded to get really drunk. I forgot to turn off the burner. (before I get shit on, yes this is incredibly unsafe, I was young and dumb at the time). Anyway, a ton of shit burnt to the bottom of the pot. 30 minutes and a bunch of barkeepers friend later, pot is like new and has been used to this day.Some places will battery and deep fry, using the wok to cook the sauce and toss everything together. Thumbs up for Evernote.  I have ~300 recipes in there now, and am able to take notes on them as well as tag them with according to their meal, season, or dietary restriction.Just used mine like crazy putting a seder meal together.  Used it on the apples for the Haroset, and then to create the rub for the lamb shanks.  I've used it the past for my grandma's cranberry relish and to mix pie dough.  My husband likes it for pesto.I don't buy meat that I feel would need tenderizing :)  If your meat needs tenderizing it's likely because you're not cooking it in a way fitting for that cut of meat.Moules fritesI just use the brand Better Than Bullion. It tastes great and I don't have to spend hours making stock.  I make my own peanut butter, but with honey roasted peanuts.  Just put a bunch of honey roasted peanuts in and turn it on, pour in a bit of peanut oil, let it keep running and add a bit more peanut oil as needed until it has the texture you like.  So good.It took me so long to figure out why my breading would never stick and can definitely say that it was because I didn't prepare my chicken in this order.  It is super critical to do it in this order.Depends on the meat.

I don't use commercial tenderizer though.

If I'm making Braciole or Chicken Piccata/Marsala, I have a rubber mallet for pounding them out and making them even, which also tenderizes the meat.

Lots of stuff gets marinaded overnight in an acid (fajitas, etc). Chickens get an overnight brine sometimes.

I like to "low and slow" stuff too: Smoker or slow cooker.  Then if I want fall apart tender and fast, I have a pressure cooker: throw pretty much any cut in there for an hour and it shreds.I save recipes using Pocket, and write notes about them using the android app Keep. Crucially these are both automatically backed up, so I won't lose anything when my phone is lost or destroyed.I second a good pasta and salad. You can feed a bunch for pretty cheap and it's extremely versatile. Alfredos are goid, as are scampi or other light sauces. But make good salads. Don't just throw iceberg lettuce and tomato together. Look up salads and find one with different things in it- like one with berries and nuts and stuff. It's still just as easy as a regular salad but people get all impressed with them.Well, the ones I know off the top of my head aren't probably the most useful ones.

There's the pizza dough, which is a cup of water, yeast, half a cup of vegetable oil, some corn meal, and fourish cups of flour until it starts looking right, before letting it rise most of the day in a bowl with a wet towel on it.

I've learned to make several quick lazy breakfasts. Biscuits and gravy is always a good one - fry sausage, add flour and butter, and milk and pepper. And the biscuits are just baking powder, flour, cheddar, old bay seasoning, and water. But also crepes - one cup of flour, a bit more than half a cup of each butter and water, stuff with fruit and Nutella, top with cream.

And of course there's fajitas, which make for a really good lunch the next morning. Onions and bell peppers, fried. Guac - avocados, lime, onion, tomato. Tofu/shrimp/strip steak/chicken fried in some blend of spices (cumin, chili powder, cayenne, brown sugar, black pepper, garlic powder). Shredded cheese, flour tortilla. Roll it up, crisp it in the pan, and wrap it in foil.

And cookies. These took forever for me to get just right. Two sticks of room temperature, not microwaved butter. Cream in the sugar, 3/4c white, 3/4c brown. A splash of vanilla, a couple eggs, and a pinch of salt. Add in two cups of flour, and mix it until it's almost all folded in. Over mixing is a huge risk at this point. Add in a bag of chocolate chips. Mix until just enough and no more. Refrigerate overnight. Set the oven to 325F and scoop out the cookies with a melon baller, so they have a uniform shape and volume.

Basically, I learned to cook the things I liked eating. And I do it enough that these are the recipes I remember. Not strictly useful things (it's hardly going to have broad applications like knowing how to make several sauces would) but it tastes good and makes me happy, and that's what my cooking is all about./r/homebrewing posts deals and reviews on a variety of burners...That's a great suggestion about the thighs! Thanks!I need to add that into my dinner rotation. Those sounds amazing. Thank you.I'm allergic to eggs :(BiscuitsI made tacos/raps/burritos for my friends on my last birthday. The ground meat was the biggest expense but it worked really well. People enjoyed them and there was enough room to get wasted. You have to count on your guest not to binge on your food (you know them better than me) and you won't have a problem with bloating.Always learn how to make a simple roux. It's like the basics of SO many sauces.Does a brunoise require a blanche or does it refer specifically to just the dice?

Wikipedia is unclear :)Interesting. I had that problem with shrimps a lot until i decided to use a whole lot of paper towel to soak up all the water. I also find that the finer the panko the better it sticks. I got a can of the coarse grind panko crumbs and it stuck a little bit but it looked like a hack job.Another option for prep is to mix the chicken pieces with corn starch, an egg white, and some soy. Then let it chill for about 20 min.I look at it this way too except that it only takes me a couple of minutes to wash the food processor, cutting board and knife while doing all of the chopping by hand can take much, much longer and I may not get the consistency.

I use mine to make bread crumbs a lot while I'll chop other things by hand. I can either use the food processor or crush the bread in a bowl with a juice glass. The processor wins every time.Knowing how to roast vegetables is really helpful for all weeknight meals. We usually have at least one roasted vegetable with every dinner. Our go-tos are broccoli, asparagus, brussell sprouts, carrots, onions, potatoes, and sweet potato fries. You can easily make all of them with just olive oil, salt, and pepper, but our veggies usually get tossed with some variation of those three and garlic powder, chili powder, and/or smoked paprika.

The greens go in an oven for 15-20 minutes at 400-425 (depending upon what else is in the oven). The starches go in the oven longer. The time changes based upon the cut size.I just throw in the wok, keep it in there alone for about a minute then add veg.Get a round of Brie and smear some mascarpone cheese on the outside of it (to act as glue) then stick apples and walnuts all over it, drizzle with honey and bake it! Serve with crackers, it's the cheese equivalent of chocolate lava cake, it's the first thing to be finished at any party I've ever served itThat's a really good idea. My wife eats gluten free, so my go-to replacement for a crispy crust like this is Chex cereal. Honey Chex is a really good one for the honey-dijon flavor. I'll have to try out coconut, though.I don't like hummus to be a smooth puree.  I like it better when it has texture.  I use a potato masher.[Perfect burner for work.]( https://anibundel.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/office-space-milton.png)Precisely the same way as I use a lab notebook for scientific experiments. I tend to use legal pads, but any paper will work although I strongly prefer one that is lined with ruled margins.

Whenever I cook a recipe that I'm still working on or tweaking I write the date in the margin so I have a continuous record. I write my ingredients, methods, etc. and update the variables each time. After cooking I add extra space to make notes upon tasting, ideas for the future, and problems that need to be corrected.

The pages typically get held together with a paper clip, hole-punched, and placed into a binder where I store all of my printed or created recipes.You need to use flour. Without it... well, it's just not the same. The breading won't stick as well or be as nice and thick.

Steps (for ~1 lb chicken):

1. Dry Seasoned flour - 1 cup (salt &amp; pepper minimum, I like garlic and onion powder too ~1 tsp of each per cup of flour)
2. Egg wash - 3 eggs, 3/8 cup water/milk (~2 TBS or 1/8 cup per egg)
3. Breading - 1.5 cups

If you want, you could create a panko/parmesan breading. Also, you could add dried basil or oregano (or whatever herb you like) to the breading as well.

I use an app called paprika to store all my recipes. It has places for notes as well, and I can adjust ingredients, quantities, directions, etc on the fly. Plus it syncs between my phone and iPad so that's a cool added feature Chicken piccata, the classic breaded cutlet dish with lemon, capers, and parsley, is a crowd pleaser and relatively easy to make. I think traditionally it is made with veal, but veal cutlets are outrageously expensive (at least where I live), and chicken gets you just as good results at a fraction of the price. You can either use pre-made cutlets, or whole skinless chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise. Giada's [recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/chicken-piccata-recipe2.html) is lip-smacking good.

Pro tip: if any in your party don't like capers, like my SO, jarred sliced banana peppers are a fine substitute. I do this too. High five! When you print out your copy do you also add helpful tips from the reviews? I find that helpful.I write down notes on the recipe. It may seem unnecessary but I always print a recipe, or if it's  a complete experiment, just write it down. Then jot down notes. I also use a digital format for my notes.  I have a folder in gmail where I keep all of my recipes.  I reply to myself with modifications I made, what worked, what didn't work and what I think I should try next time.  Searching for previous recipes is easy in gmail, and all of my notes/replies stay nested together. It's not a marinade. You take the steak, lay it down as is on a plate and coat one side of it with a thick layer of coarse sea or kosher salt. You then rinse the huge layer of salt off in the sink and season with dry ingredients. While cooking, I'll make notes on a pad of paper, especially any variations or unexpected results (extra 1/4 tsp of this, took longer to brown than expected, etc). After I'm done, I then transfer them to a Evernote db I maintain. I have a number of "master" recipes I've developed, ones that I'm happy with and fairly confident of the results, but I'll still put a dated entry under the recipe for each time I cook it with anything notable that cropped up, especially any hardware or process related issues. It can be very useful when going back through for planning. For example, here are the notes from making my Green Chile Pork &amp; Posole Stew last year:

&gt; =============================
&gt; Notes, 2/10/2014:


&gt; Making a 6X batch.


&gt; - Stock was 5 lbs chicken leg quarters, 2 lbs chicken backs, 2 lbs chicken feet, 5 lbs pork neck bones, 4 lbs quartered pigs feet, 4 lbs fresh pork hocks. All pork parts soaked, rinsed, and scrubbed by hand several times to remove bone dust. Also 2 large yellow onions, 6-8 med. carrots, 1 bunch celery, 1/2 bunch flat leaf parsley, 1 head garlic, 2 tsp whole black pepper corns, and 2 gal filtered drinking water. Took 2/3rd meat, half of onions and carrots, roasted in 450-500F oven until browned. Found out roasting at top of oven is much more effective. Crushed garlic cloves with butt of cleaver, then let sit for an hour covered to develop flavor; much stronger. Added everything but celery and parsley, brought to simmer, let run 12-14 hrs in oven; added celery and parsley around half way through. After straining and defatting, recovered exactly two gallons of stock. Next time, remember to use normal sieve on top of chinois to help catch bigger bits. Excellent quality stock, medium brown, lots of gelatin, very good flavor.


&gt; - Used 12 7oz cans of HEB brand Salsa Verde, similar to the Herdez canned salsa. Has a kind of sweet and sour flavor, good, but may want to add 8 cans, then taste and adjust. Much cheaper than other verde salsa, may be a bit thicker as well (first ingredient is tomatillos, on others it's often water).


&gt; - For meat, used 8 lbs of assorted pork chops (Butt &amp; Loin). Easy to cut up, but had significant issues with bone dust, lots of scraping. Lost right around 2 lbs from trimming fat, bone, and connective tissue. Next time, may try using kidney plate on grinder to do super coarse chop, maybe of some butt or shoulder. Cut into bite sized pieces, seasoned with garlic salt, fresh pepper, and reconstituted garlic granules, mixed and allowed to sit in fridge for ~4 hours. Stirred in uncooked with pot at a boil, allowed to cook at least 10-15 min. Very tender, not stringy.


&gt; - For chiles, used 2 cups Hot Hatch Paste, and 6 cups Mild Hatch paste, both from this year's (8/2013) batch. Was originally going to do four and four, but two cups of the Hot Hatch pushed it right to the edge of too hot for eating (backed off a bit once other things were added). Next time processing chiles during Hatch season, may want to buy 2 or 3:1 mild to hot. Also added 10 poblanos, peeled, seeded, and diced. Blistered the poblanos under the broiler; it *kinda* worked, but left the chiles excessively soft, didn't really "pop" the skin. Next time, try to make sure a torch is available.


&gt; - Used three large yellow onions, fine dice, added near end of cooling. This was by accident, should have added full amount of onions much earlier in cook.


&gt; - Used two large #10 cans of white hominy (HEB brand), rinsed and soaked ~10 minutes three times


&gt; - Recipe as cooked (2 gal stock + chiles + hominy + meat + onions) *just* about fills up my large Tratamontia stock pot, maybe 2-3" of headspace.
Understanding how to make all kinds of stock correctly is important too.I am a member on Allrecipes. I save my recipe variations there. Cup of soup: Just add soup. Scrambled eggs. You need to add additional salt after it has marinated in salt for one hour per inch?Hummus!You're missing an important step here - after you've let it simmer (I let mine go for 6 - 10 hours if I'm making a huge pot of stock), you need to strain the solids out.  (Cheesecloth works well here).  Let it cool, put it in the fridge overnight.  Next morning, skim the solidified fat off the top, and what's left is chicken stock.  Make a big batch, and stick it in the freezer in containers.  Liquid gold that everybody should have in their kitchen.

Good luck!Lobster in shell has an approximate edible yield of ~20%.

Which means a 16 oz lobster has about 3.2oz of meat.

So per pound of meat you're looking at $60.

Not really college student cheap.

Hard to skip leg day when you're literally dragging children around every day.I made some excellent salsa in mine last week. Veggie (or meat) loaf with gravy and salad. Feed an army.

There are many good recipes for loaf and it's easy to just take every vegetable remnant from the fridge, add grains if you've got any, spices and bake. Top with cheese if that's what you're into. Pure meat into it if that's what you're into, as well.
Make simple miso/mushroom gravy or just mushroom or mushroom and beef bouillon.
Have salad.

others:

stew and grains

spiced chickpea stew in a pot with pitas - self serve chickpea wraps.

combination of salads: potato &amp; dill, chicken, pineapple and rice, greens, fennel and apple, pasta, artichokes and sundries tomatoes, etc.

dips and veggies/breads: babaganouj, hummous, tapinade, pt with all of the cheapest veggies and discount breads available

or even bruschetta with onion focaccia - easy, very easy, easy to make a lot of. Add greens for extra colourI like to coat the top of the meat in salt then let sit for 1 hour per inch thick and then rinse off the salt when done and season with salt, pepper, garlic salt, and onion powder.If you have a nice Italian market near you, you can go in and ask them about it.  I work at one, and all of my coworkers are very knowledgeable and helpful.  You could also get some nice sliced meats to go with the cheese and crackers like Prosciutto di Parma and porchetta.A wok ring will get you most of the way there. Most round bottom woks used to come with them, I don't know if the one you ordered will or not. It allows the wok to sit in the ring over the burner. Your other option is to use a chimney starter. If you are doing stir in the more traditional sense, the starter will burn more than long enough and hot enough to do a good stir fry.Imo there's a good chance they might get overcooked this way. That's an acquired taste.  I wouldn't serve it unless you know your guests will eat it.It really has to do with the presentation.  Find a Goodwill and you can get a couple if really nice pieces that will class that shit up.  Really good cheese, bread and meats is expensive though.My food processor doesn't have search, what make/model do you have?Pasta! 100 gr. of flour, 1 egg, food processor, pasta-dough. Or 50/50 flour/ semolina. Or 1 egg and 1 yolk + ca. 140 gr. of flour.I consider myself a semi-pro at separating eggs using the eggshell halves. My dad has an allergy to the yolks, so I learned at a very young age how to separate the yolks.I add the recipe or notes to a recipe on evernote. it lets you tag the recipes.I heard that [papain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papain) is harmless but I've never used it.Watch Good Eats.Beef and veg stir fry, easy as fuck and takes less than half an hour to make.I've thought my self a decent home cook for years.... I don't know anything.Arborio is cheaper and more widely available. In my experience carnaroli produces better risotto. Don't do it!

Unless it's done slowly, in a marinade...Absolutely this.  It's easy as hell to make the couscous...five minutes, tops.  Mix in some lemon juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar, feta, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, and spice it up with cumin, turmeric, cayenne, and whatever else you can imagine.  If you wash off all the baking soda it won't affect the flavor. It's more of a texture thing. Paired with a nice sauce you'll get more more of it sticking to the meat. In my experience it makes the meat more tender and juicy.  the flouring does help the egg stick everywhere for the breading, but if the chicken is too wet, you'll find the flour doesn't stick to the chicken well and sometimes your "crust" will slide off when you attempt to cut it due to the excess moisture left on the chicken. You don't have to get obsessive about drying your chicken, but a good pat with some paper towels on both sides does wonders.

Alton Brown even recommends to place chicken wings on a wire cooling rack, over a pan, and place in the fridge for an additional hour or two prior to cooking to help the residual stuff dry.Cook the proper cuts of meat and slice them properly. You shouldn't need to tenderize.You are wrong. If you want a course on  germ theory let me know. There isn't a case where this is okay. I've found that most butchers are onto it now and are charging much higher prices for hangar steak. Most of the time it costs close to what I'd pay for other steak cuts.

It's a great cut though and perfect for *steak frites* or any application where you're making a steak with a simple pan sauce in the French style.I print a copy of the recipe and make notes on it every time I make it. I organize them in a binder with dividers (soup, salad, seafood, chicken, beef/pork, veggies, pasta &amp; grains, bread, dessert, and "misc"). Old fashioned, but works for me. :)TIL I'm your granma!I'll second this.

They take very little time, make their own sauce, pair amazingly with crusty bread or french fries (call them *pommes frites*, that's the secret to being fancy), and are often pretty inexpensive.

Pour about 1/2 to 1 cup of white wine into a large pot. Add minced garlic and parsley. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and add the cleaned and sorted (throw out any that are wide open or refuse to close when tapped) mussels. When the shells open they're done. Put them in large bowls and cover with the cooking liquid.

An excellent tomato-based version can be made with Bloody Mary mix (I prefer spicy). It's something I got from Jacques Pepin and it makes plenty of sense: unlike pure tomato juice it's already seasoned and ready to go for a quick meal. The method is exactly the same.I pretty much only cook from books, but I'll make notes of things to change, to keep in mind or variations to try. I always thought the flouring step was for drying it to help the egg stick everywhere for the breading.My grandmother was just like you.  Then she got older and started doubling the salt or leaving it out altogether.  Consider using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. They are moister and much harder to overcook.
I lay them out on a platter and season them first, then sprinkle with a coating of flour. Next, dip in a wash made with egg and 1 T. water. You'll probably need a couple of eggs for the amount of chicken you're talking about. Then dip in the crumbs with maybe some grated parmesan cheese. Bake on a lightly greased, oil lined sheet pan at 375 for about 35 minutes, I use an instant read meat thermometer to check internal temp which should be a minimum of 165. I go to 170. http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/mintemp.htmlI can't type on my phone when I'm cooking; I need pen and paper.  I'm a chef, and I use yellow college-ruled notepads.  Every day I use 1 page as a personal to-do list; when everything is crossed off I get to go home.  And scattered through are pages of recipe ideas with tests and corrections.  I keep all the notepads.  If something turns out to be good, at some point I'll type it up.  Other times I've had to go searching through the boxes of old notebooks.Ah

Does it do anything to the taste?yeah, I've been doing this wrong. Thank you!That's the velveting. It makes the chicken look shiny and slippery by breaking down the proteins on the surface. Thank you!

I'm curious - do most Chinese restaurants boil their chicken for the bulk of its preparation? I notice the chicken (specifically white chicken breast) tends to look way different than when I stir fry and my best guess is that they boil the chicken for 90% of the preparation and then toss it in the sauce before serving.Basic bread, pie crust, biscuit recipes. Basic tomato sauce.Thanks!Thank you for sharing your secret! Ive been enjoying blitzing up a frozen banana to make ice cream. I'm really looking forward to having ice cream every day come summer.another key part to this is patting the chicken dry with a paper towel before dredging in flourIt's never crossed my mind to take notes on cooking. I remember things that taste, smell and look good and forget things that taste bad- unless they taste *really* bad. I use mine to make Hummus all the time. So easy.Flour first, then eggs, then breadcrumbs. This is critical to making the breading stick properly. Gotta have all three in that order or it won't work as well.That sounds like a very good idea! Can I pan fry them the night before, or would morning of be better? I've never actually pan fried panko chicken, I always bake- is it just like pan frying floured chicken?Thank you! I have been frustrated in the past at how my breading sticks unevenly!45 seconds is never long enough to pre heat a pan. I add the oil to a cold pan and once the oil just starts to smoke, that's when you know your pan is at the right temp. The smoke point of most good cooking oils is the same temp as what you should cook in.

If your pan does heat up in 45 seconds, it must be a thin aluminum pan. A pan with a try ply bottom (stainless with an aluminum core) or even cast iron will not drop in temperature when you add the food like a thin pan would. This makes sure your pan stays consistently at the proper temp.Door stop.
Boat anchor.
Hang it on the wall and call it art.

Or, you could, like, search teh great Gazoogle or sumpin. Try velveting your meat prior to stir-fry. This is done by tossing the bite-size pieces of meat in baking soda for 30 seconds before rinsing well and proceeding with the cornstarch coating and frying.


Smoking oil is a good thing when it comes to stir-fry. You will never be able to replicate the jet-engine-esque burner that powers a professional chinese kitchen wok, but having your oil smoking hot for each component of the dish as you cook them one at a time so as to not crowd the pan will result in well-cooked components that can be mixed at the end once cooked and tossed in the wok with sauce to finish. Pasta. It always screams fancy. Add some form of meat or seafood and vary the sauce accordingly. Just add salad and candles and fancy is complete. Also it's wicked cheap.I'll post the recipe I use to make it at home!Save yourself a couple of bucks and buy block cheese and use the processor to shed it. Also more varieties available in block form. Nut butters - Almond, Peanut, etc
Chop dates for homemade Granola BarsI just bought some Panko for chicken strips, I'll probably use this recipe since I haven't chosen one yet. Thanks!Haha thank you! I posted an update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/30mdi4/update_thanks_to_you_guys_my_dinner_was_awesome/).I make something similar to this but with spicy mustard and like to add flaked coconut. I use the sweet kind of coconut and I think it's a good complement to the spicy mustard. Make sure to dredge in flour before coating in egg so the breading sticks.This may be out of your league and/or budget, but a BBQ wellington kicks ass. Smoked or slow-roasted prime rib cooked medium-rare, smeared with mushroom-almond pate and wrapped in hockory-smoked bacon inside of a puff pastry is fucking amazing. Grab some powdered deli-glace to make a gravy with and you'll impress the queen of england. Shit got serious! Serve an assortment of appetizers. These three require little-to-no cooking at all, but still appear fancy as hell.

* Prosciutto wrapped asparagus
*  Crostini with smoked salmon, capers, tomato, and red onion
*  Roasted figs with balsamic vinegar, honey, thyme, black pepper, and goat cheese.

If you do this you probably won't even need to serve an entree, but if you don't think that appetizer will be enough, perhaps try making a sophisticated pasta dish. Something like penne in a mushroom cream sauce, with caramelized onions, garlic, rosemary, a pinch of nutmeg, Parmesan cheese, gruyere cheese, and maybe a splash of wine. Garnish with fried shallots to really kick up the * *wow* * factor.Yo, have you actually stopped and appreciated the difference between well made home made pie dough and the fake shit they call pie dough you buy in the super markets?  It is like saying McDonald's burgers and steaks are the same thing cause they both come from a cow.

You come down to my place and I will make you a chicken pot pie followed by an apple pie that will make you wet your panties. Then will make you want to make me wet mine.


That's it, this is a pie dough throw down.www.copymethat.com saves recipes, and has a notes section. Steak tartare is really easy and about as fancy as it gets. Just be sure the meat you buy is very fresh and be sure to chop it up a la minute (at the last minute.) Up your presentation game with a sunny side quail egg on top with a light dusting of very finely-diced chives.Chicken soup/broth:

Chicken/chicken parts, carrots, celery, onion, some cloves of garlic. Throw them all into a along with some salt and pepper with cold water. Bring to a low simmer, skim the fat every now and then and let it cook for 3 hours.I just use my memory, I can replicate stuff I've done 30 years ago.Wow I never thought anyone would actually ask. Where I work we have round screens to at least give us a shape to strive for, which helps.but that's not all the magic. The thing to remember is temperature control, and that the dough is your bitch. You can make it do whatever you want if you pay enough attention to where what your moving is coming from. So, moving on. Flaten your dough by hand into a round disk with smooth edges. The smooth edges is fucking key. If you have cracks its going to split later. I hate cracks. Anyways, flour your disk heavily. Rub the flour on both sides to smooth it, and start rolling it. Do even amounts in a t shape with gradual intensity, like a couple times either way. The key is symmetry. Always stir it the same direction, and always keep it even on all sides. Once the disk has grown, gently tug it into a circle. Then hold it in both hands just below face level, raise it at an equal speed with both arms while spinning it. At the last second flick the dough with your finger tips. It adds a lot of spin which smooths out the dough. You will feel where the dough is uneven, and you will need to adjust accordingly. Catch it with both hands on the very lip evenly and don't just catch it, bring it out of the air with your hands. Be gentle, don't wear rings or have rough edges. Use the back of your hands or your knuckles. Lower it while it spins in your hand. Don't stop the spinning, let it run out. Repeat until proper size and thickness. If its oblong, just lay it down and push out the long sides from the lip and it should right itself out. Also, having something round to top the pizza on would help dramatically because you can micro manage a pizza round just by having a dough ball on a plate. So if you have a semi flattened wad you should be able to tweek it a smidge. Any questions in how to deipher my idiot speak feel free buddy, and power to ya!I have a book, one with actual pages. Each recipe goes on a page and then the rest of the page and the opposite page are for comments.

After cooking something I go there, write down notes what to change the next time or cross of things which didnt work out as intended.recipe please! Yum!Yum!If you hashtag spaghetti, yes. I only cook 3 times a week, that's 156 times a year, that's around 500 times every three years. I'm happy looking through my pics.What about when you wanna go back and find all the different spaghetti you've made?  Can/do you just search for #Spaghetti or something?Soups and fried rice.Also, if the bananas are turning black and need to be eaten, take them home and make banana bread. Bring some into the office and it clear your conscience of taking the bananas in the first place. :)

And pistachios. If they aren't being eaten and they might go to waste. Grab em. Those things are expensive!
When stone fruit are in season:

1. Slice fruit in half and take out seed.
2. Top with brown sugar and butter. Cinnamon and Nutmeg optional. If you wanna kick it up a notch, black pepper is astonishingly good.
3. Place in a lined baking tray. Cute little cast iron skillet is preferable but not necessary. Bake at 375-400F until the fruit is tender and the tops are caramelized.
4. Serve with scoop of ice cream. Garnish with mint and a tiny sprinkle of salt to enhance the sweetness.I think I might actually make and enjoy spamchos. I actually use Instagram for this. A photo, a quick explanation, enough that I'd remember, and I'm good.My mom makes a kind of caprese-esque cherry tomato salad that I love. As far as I remember you half them and mix them with feta and basil, olive oil and balsamic, salt and pepper, maybe a bit of oregano. So damn good.For two college students that don't know what classy food is?  Beats mac n cheese.You want the best fucking beef tacos you've ever had?

FTFY: Shit, ain't that classy!foremothers always skipping leg dayProcessing food.Eggs are always good.

* If you can hard-boil an egg without overcooking the white or the yolk, you've learned a lot about temperature control and how boiling (or steaming) affects food.

* Separating eggs teaches you a lot about damage control (the three-bowl method), if nothing else.  I gather it's also kind of helpful if you want to bake stuff.

* Omelets -- [both kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s10etP1p2bU) -- let you develop a fair bit of intuition about how food behaves in a skillet, and how to control heat (especially if you're not using nonstick).

* Poaching eggs gives you confidence handling delicate ingredients and, well, poaching them.

Also, making some variation on pico de gallo on the regular will teach you a lot about balancing salt, acid, bitterness, and heat, and will really develop your knife skills.  (Dicing a tomato and dicing an onion are a bit different, and I like to brunoise the jalapenos.)Blend mushrooms and nuts for beef Wellington &gt;We've already reached the 80s where I'm from some light food just sounds good right now, lol.

It's 42 with rain here and the other day the wind was strong enough to push me into the road!that sounds yummy, thanks.Roast chicken is great for developing or demonstrating a number of techniques.  You're cleaning and trussing / stuffing / spatchcocking / basting the bird.  You're controlling temperature (of the oven and the meat -- breast, thigh, wing, whatever).  You can take the drippings and make a pan sauce, resting the bird and incorporating the liquid it releases.  You carve the chicken.  Possibly you have leftovers; what do you do with those?  (I'm partial to burritos.)  Finally, you take the carcass and make a stock. So many things you can learn, so many skills to develop.

If I sound like an evangelist it's the zeal of the newly converted; roast chicken was always "too much effort" at my house growing up (shit, so was making a roux!), so I never learned until just recently.Essentials are the 5 mother sauces, how to prepare your starches (bread, potatoes, rice etc.), and how the proteins work. From there, you can make almost anything!

Good example: meat loaf. Protein? Minced meat, binders, seasoning and into a tray. Starch? Boil potatoes. Sauce? Gravy made from drippings. Boom. Dinner.I love to use mine for pesto. Basil, olive oil, pine nuts,  parmesean and anything else you may want to addIt would definitely be light but I figured since summer is coming up it might be a good thing to try. We've already reached the 80s where I'm from some light food just sounds good right now, lol.Sounds lovely, I'm not clear on the timing for this yet but if it's going to be earlier in the afternoon something like this would be great. Might be a bit light for an evening meal though maybe?Tiny cubes of perfection salad... no. don't ever do that.

But sushi-style rolls filled with something safe at room temperature is good. There's some good ideas over at /r/SushiAbomination I'll second this, knowing how to make a sauce from roux or mirepoix will get you so, so far.Bonus round: stuff the days with soft chevre goat cheese and herbs (thyme, parsley, basil...). If you don't like or can't find dates (HAHA OP CAN'T FIND A DATE! Sorry, I'm done), dried apricots are also pretty tasty. Spear them with toothpicks.You need to tell us the flavor profile and link us their picture or something. There is no such thing as BBQ in mongolian cuisine. They do have some cooking methods that's kind of akin to BBQ that is "take hot heat to the meat", but really it's not close to American BBQ at all.


Seeing as how it's asian, it probably has soy sauce, sugar, salt, garlic, ginger, scallions, onions, fruits of some sort, maybe sesame oil. Omg why the downvote? Duck fat is miraculous!Yes... Also cheese spread. A bag of shredded sharp cheddar, splash of Worcestershire, garlic, and a half a pack of cream cheese. Process until smooth The reason we like stainless pans is because we can scrub it. Get to itLearn all of the sauces... you can make all kinds of good stuff with the right sauce.Simple roasted chicken is always good and super easy! Bro, do you even bake?This really depends on your skill level. Also depends on what you guys normally eat for dinner.

Something foreign can be fancier than something familiar done in fancy ways or something new done in a familiar way.

Take for instance, steaks. Nce ribeye will be fancy if you don't normally eat ribeye. But if you do eat ribeye normally, then rack of lamb grilled in similar fashion will be fancy.

Or you can add a fancy french sauce for your ribeye.

Or change the cuisine entirely, and cook something she's never seen/had. Obviously that will take considerable skills on your part. If you want "classy" food, make sure you have three things:

* Clean presentation (nothing dribbling off the side, everything looks like you put it there on purpose)
* Some kind of sauce
* Some kind of garnish

Have a look at the way [Thomas Keller plates the chicken at the end of this recipe](https://youtu.be/Zxm1vPwUQDY?t=393) (and I'd recommend that recipe, too: a roasted chicken looks amazing right out of the oven, and it's dirt cheap and hard to fuck up).  He uses a bigger plate than strictly necessary to provide a clean background for the food (instead of making it look like he just filled the plate until he had to stop).  The chicken's arranged... not necessarily *artfully*, but at least *deliberately* -- he didn't just throw stuff onto the plate and hope for the best.  And when he spills some juice, he wipes it up.

Keller's demonstrating a dish, not a full meal, so he doesn't add a sauce -- but I bet the roast chicken in any of his restaurants comes with at least a [simple pan sauce](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/05/mark-bittmans-chicken-cutlets-with-quick-pan.html).  You don't need much... you can use water to build your sauce if you don't have wine or stock; the drippings in the pan do most of the work.  For a garnish you can just chop up some parsley and sprinkle it on top.

Really, what these elements do is show your guest that *you paid attention to detail*.  It's not necessary that you *went to extreme effort* to pull off those details, or that you *spent lots of money* pulling off those details... just that you thought about them, and did something about it.  (Also, on the subject of details: Cloth napkins.)Shit ain't that classyBread crumbs!Adding chopped red onion, green salsa and something leafy as a garnish helps up the anty.A wok isn't *supposed* to be heated to the same temperature throughout, that's why it's a large bowl shape and it's also why you'll be stirring the ingredients around so they cook evenly. Having only one point of contact with the heat source should be fine. Chances are your stove burner lacks the heating capacity needed (which is why cw236085 mentions a turkey fryer as a better alternative) but as long as your wok is carbon steel, crank the heat up and give it a try, anyway.Any country's food, including America, would be ethnic.  It's not really a term that has much use.  I suppose it would rule out a recipe you just invent yourself at least.  I know it's not Moroccan, but wasabi mashed potatoes are bomb. I would use mine more, but often it means I need to wash a bunch of extra things instead of just a knife and cutting board.  In fact, I need the knife and cutting board to cut the items down to size so they fit in the food processor, so really all the cleaning is truly extra.Holyshit, I thought you were looking for a throwaway cell phone or a gun with the serial number scratched off. Then I looked at the subreddit. Cheese plate is like zero effort and looks classy as shit. Get a variety of crackers, a variety of cheeses, some grapes, almonds, jams, olives... BAM. You don't even have to prep everything, you put a knife in the cheese and let the guests do all the work themselves.

As far as picking a GOOD selection of these things.... I am not the person to ask for this.Brine the chicken overnight using [this recipe](http://www.kitchenkonfidence.com/2012/06/brine-recipe).  Pat them dry.  Then do a 3-step breading process.  First dip in a seasoned flour, then in an egg wash, then in the panko and onto the sheet pans.  You can just use seasoned salt to season your flour, or salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, oregano.

If you're baking rather than frying, I'd spray the breaded breasts with spray oil after you arrange them on sheet pans and before baking.  It will help the panko crisp up and make it taste better.

A simple sauce for 1 dozen servings would be a sauce Dijon.  This will give you about 1/3 cup per serving.

    1/2 cup olive oil
    1/2 cup minced shallots
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 cup brandy or rum
    1 cup Dijon mustard
    3 cups sour cream
    salt and pepper to taste

Heat up the oil in a saucepan.  Add the shallots and garlic and saute until the shallots are translucent and the garlic is fragrant.  Carefully add the brandy or rum, and let it flame off.  Add the Dijon and sour cream, and bring to a simmer.  Done.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

    I can't fathom that people still make pie dough by hand....like our foremothers...with their burly forearms and strong constitutions. Mussels! My now favorite potato dish that I was introduced to in Istanbul - Kumpir!!

http://www.livashop.com/uploads/urunresim/kitir-pilic-kumpir-166.jpg-Alfredo: butter, flour, milk or cream, Parmesan, fresh parsley, garlic
-Shrimp or chicken breasts
-French bread, or whatever baguette looks good, and olive oil (day-old bread is OK)

-Noodle of your choice, fresh or dry

-Marinade: White wine, lemon, S &amp; P, fresh herb of your choice and garlic

Whenever you put your marinated chicken on the grill start boiling water if you chose dry pasta.  When the noodles are in the boiling water make your Alfredo sauce.  If you chose fresh pasta simply simmer in your sauce for a few minutes, tasting often for doneness.  Grill your halved bread face-down after you've brushed it with olive oil.  If you chose shrimp put those marinated crustaceans on the grill along with the bread.

Don't forget to let your protein rest!  (10 minutes for large chicken breasts or a few minutes for shrimp)

Combine it all (bread on the side,) garnish with parsley, and enjoy your grilled chicken/shrimp Alfredo.     Made Zimmermann's wings yesterday, so damn good and sticky.Crystal meth.  The other day I made an awesome pie crust in mine, then inserted the slicing blade and threw in peeled apples to make the filling. Delicious and easy. Super random but I use it to cream rutabaga into a mashed potato consistency and add butter and either chicken broth or milk/milk substitute. The other day I added a little cheese to it as well..so good without the carb and starch count of regular potatoes, but without a food processor mashed root veggies are too tough for me! Also great for making guacamole, chopping up nuts for desserts or meat crusts (for ex: chicken breast dredged in pecan crust), combining butter with dill/Rosemary/chive etc, and chopping up annoying things like onions, garlic, and spicy peppers that can cause irritation. "How to Cook Without a Book" by Pam Anderson not only gives you basic recipes, but also basic cooking techniques, and the knowledge for building on them. It's a great beginner's book. Otherwise, hit up the library and browse the 641.5 section.I would consider pan frying them ahead of time to get the panko super crispy and then re-heating them in the oven at 200 degrees for 5-10 minutes before you're ready to serve.  Chutney or a relish.  Noticed a recommendation of powdered sugar... I recently tried to make myself a batch of powdered sugar and it destroyed my blade :(Oh I would skip the sour cream - just a hint of parsely or dill - the butter , salt and pepper seem lovely too! :)+1 for parm, that's how I do it. 1:1 Panko to Parm, with some parsley thrown in for colour.Lobsters, seriously.  People think they are stupid expensive, it's not true.  I live in Central TX, and lobsters are regularly $12 a lb. sometimes they go on sale for as little as $9 a lb.  Super Market Lobsters general come in at a pound or less.  Cheaper than a prime steak.  There are lots of great grilled lobster recipes out there.  Alton Brown also has some great lobster recipes.On that note you could also bring out the sour cream :) but I do really like the purist butter salt and pepper. I'm going to bread them and bake them.  Sure it won't be exactly the same but honestly i was never too fond of the French's canned fried onionsTHE BEST Cesear salad dressing!Whatever you make, try to work on making a nice presenting dish it'll make it feel more classyYou could make some awesome-ass warm desserts by slicing bananas/apples/pears (choose just 1 per dessert), and layering with crushed granola or diced cinnamon bun. Ideally, splash some milk and cinnamon and sugar and espresso on there before heating it up too. Enough milk to almost but not quite cover everything else. Making this in a bowl or coffee mug is fine, but if it's your contribution to the office potluck then make it in big glass serving bowl and mix in a box of raisins for a touch of... sophistication. Yeah.

In case this turns into a zombie survival situation, go ahead and make a hearty stew out of milk, cayenne, pepper, seaweed, beef jerky (dice it up first, or tear it, it's your survival situation so it's your rules) and your choice of starchy noodle substitute. I'd go with the pretzels, but you chose to ask this question so I figure you're more into the cheetos.I don't know how much these are. They're fascinating.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejR6ClRtR_AAwesome, thank you. I'm gonna try this soon! You don't necessarily need to be jumping straight into recipies - that's almost akin to running before you can walk.

Like /u/BCsounds says, start off small with breakfast items (omlettes!). Cooking, espeically cooking protein, is all about the art of applying heat-transfer from your stove top to your dish. If you break it all down scientifically into small managable parts, cooking is easy. Just like the science experiements you may have done in high-school, cooking is essentially a repeatable experiement where you eat the results.

The most important thing is to not be afraid to go off the recipe and try new things. My love of food comes from coming up with complimentary flavours and balancing the aroma, salt, sugar, oil/fat and acid content to suit the dish.

An idiot's guide to cooking would be a huge undertaking but a simple stew should not be beyond most people and almost impossible to stuff up. You whilt some leek and onion, add salt, brown some cubed meat, add salt &amp; sugar to taste, add tomato, add celery, add potato, add bell peppers and boil with one to two soup bowl/s worth of water until potatoes are edible. Throw in chopped herbs (try different combos - see which one you like). Serve with bread. :)Very true - a bit of parsley and/or dill is nice with this too :)Make your own pasta from scratch. Super cheap and super easy. People are always impressed.Even a perfectly baked potato with salt, pepper, and a touch of butter is plenty rich and flavorful...I was hoping to be able to use it for other stuff. That's a nice looking stove, but it still seems to have the flat bottom. It's also pretty expensive, and I was looking into the $50 range.Pie crust is what I immediately thought of, the only other thing I ever use it for is guacamole.If you are just going to use it for woks, you may want to look at this:

I have one of these:

And the 60K BTU side works pretty well for woking.

Well from that list as long as you don't batter and deep fry it you're sure to ball park it. Oh, i totally forgot about garlic aioli! Better than any store-bought mayo, hands down. pesto, biscuit/bread dough, whipped cream, grated cheese, etc. though you need the right attachments.Calm down there, cowboy. /u/iredditinla is right, after all.A wine and cheese pairing is classy as fuck. Prosciutto wrapped dates also scream class.

Google both of them shits and get classy. I'm so late here and maybe you've already answered this elsewhere, but how did everything turn out? Did you end up having an awesome belated birthday get together? I NEED TO KNOW. But for real, I hope everything came together for you and that you had fun prepping/making everything *and* had a blast at the actual get together! So Canadian mashed potatoes are out. Really, what the fuck ethnicity do you want?With prime rib, id go ethnically 'French' and do dauphinoise or Yukon golds roasted in duck fat. Basically peel, halve, parboil, then roast in an oven in a quarter inch of duckfat turning occasionally. Make a good brown gravy to go with this - you can do a roux with pan drippings, a red wine deglaze, an au poirve - or even go bearnaise. Add something green - roasted asparagus with olive oil, lemon and Parmesan, broccoli rabe seared with onion and garlic, Brussels sprouts chopped and sauted with bacon, or even just green beans with butter and salt and you have a pretty killer three course meal going. Add something sweet at the end - I suggest grilled pineapple with ice cream - and it's feasting time.

Chopping up filling for lumpia (aka eggrolls)! I'm amazed that my Filipina mother never discovered how much time she could've saved with a food processor...&gt; It said to use 1 tbsp of oil, and it didn't seem like enough so I added two tablespoons

Asking for recipes to learn how to cook but ruining them with arbitrary decisions based on nothing but your own inexperience isn't going to help you.

Don't let anyone discourage you from trying &amp; learning but you shouldn't be making your own changes without any cooking experience at all.  Honestly pick up a good old fashioned cookbook like the Joy of Cooking - it'll give you a basic recipe and instructions for just about anything you can think of.  Make the recipes as written.

Once you have that recipe base you can start adding/testing your own flavors to see how they add or detract.  But without any sort of baseline at all your changes will be totally arbitrary and likely pointless.

My secret, which everyone loves, is to mix some jiffy corn bread mix into the panko (2:1 panko:mix)...deliciousCheck out home brew supply stores. Okay, this is what I'd do:

1) Make a list of stuff you know you like and want to try making. When you're trying a new recipe, it helps a lot if you have a basic idea of what it's supposed to look+taste like at the end, so you can know if you fucked up and where.

2) get a good basic beginner cookbook. An actual book, so it's easy for you to keep with you in the kitchen and go back and check the recipe as you go. Fannie Famer, the Joy of Cooking, or the America's Test Kitchen Cooking School book would be my recs here -- they're all aimed at beginners and have a bunch of supplemental information on ingredients, measurements and techniques that should help you start to be able to tell spices apart. You can pick up a used copy on amazon for a couple bucks.

The internet can be a great source for recipes...but it's also the internet, so a lot of what's out there is badly written with unclear instructions or mistakes in the ingredients or is just plain bad. And when you're just starting out its hard to tell which recipies are terrible.

3) Check out some quality cooking shows. A lot of stuff in cooking is easy to understand if you see it done, but tough to wrap your head around on the page. America's Test Kitchen is very good at explaing how recipes work --- most of their stuff is paywalled, but you can watch episodes from their current season (or their other show, Cook's Country.) Alton Brown's Good Eats is also excellent for this --- they have some episodes on Netflix, and I'd bet you could find a torrent for them.  On youtube, try Jacques Pepin --- dude is a master, just incredible skill. Also look at the Food Wishes channel --- the guy who runs it, Chef John, is a former culinary instructor and his videos are quite clear and concise. Plus he's from Upstate NY himself and makes a lot of stuff from up there.

4) Learn how to chop an onion properly. (AKA, watch some youtube vidoes on knife skills). In general, knowing the right way to cut up fruits and veggies quickly to the desired size makes cooking a million times easier. You'll be slow starting out, but this is the Karate Kid stage, the super basic stuff you need to know in your bones in order to become good.

5) before you start cooking, read the recipe twice, and make sure that you have all your ingredients prepped and ready to go. (They call this "mise en place" in pro kitchens.) As you discovered with your peppers, if you have to start prepping in the middle of cooking, shit gets fucked up. As you get better at cooking, you'll be able to juggle more stuff at once and have stuff going on the stove while you're doing other stuff, but when you're starting out making sure you have everything you need ready to go means you can concentrate on the actual cooking and makes everything much easier.

6) Get a cheap probe themometer. Makes cooking meat a million times easier.

7) learn to season, e.g, adding salt to your ingredients as you go. Small amounts of salt, when it dissolves in your mouth, actually enhances your taste buds' ability to preceive the flavors in food. Try cooking some rice in plain water and some in salted water to see the difference. Or scrable one egg without salt and another with a pinch mixed in. When you cook, you want to make sure every part of your dish has just enough salt in it to bring out the flavors --- you don't want it to *taste* salty, like a potato chip or something, just to make sure it's not bland. Properly seasoning food is one of the foundations of good cooking.

That's about it, to start off. Once you have some ideas of what you might want to make and some places that can show you how to make them, dive in and have fun. Choco-banana smoothie: 1 banana, 1 cup milk, 1 shot of espresso, and 1 tbsp hot chocolate mix blended with the immersion blenderHummus, only hummushttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku5p1CcGn70Braised new red potatoes.  Cut in half, braise cut side down in seasoned water (So many ways you can go here.) with a good amount of butter in a non-stick skillet.  Allow the water to cook off, leaving the butter to brown the cut face of the potatoes.

I picked up the technique from America's Test Kitchen on local PBS TV.  You may be able to find the video of it on ATK's site or on PBS's Create site.Flap meat + Butter + Food processor = Amazing homemade burgers.Obviously, because rather than accept people have different opinion than you you chose to engage in a rather stupid and pointless slapfight.

To be fair, I'm guilty of that myself.  Though I'm going to do what I probably should have done a while ago.

Ta...To add, it's good for speed and consistency too. Your extremes of ethnic and american are one thing, but what about quartered gold potatoes with olive oil and rosemary (and salt/pepper). Bake em for a while, squeeze out a little lemon on top, done. Not necessarily exotic, but far from the obnoxious american potatoes you seem to be avoiding.

You could go extreme and make samosas. I've been knocking on that door for a while, probably making them from scratch soon, and those technically have potatoes. Not sure how panko chicken does after sitting out because I always eat it too fast. It's just too delicious. I found a recipe that uses dijon mustard and a few spices instead of egg and does equal parts parmesan and panko. Also fantastic. Find a good butcher near you and call and ask if they have hangar steak. If so, ask them to trim it up and you have possibly the best combination of flavor and tenderness on the cow in a moderately priced cut. It can be hard to find but it's worth it. Cook it medium rare or how you like filet mignon.Absolutely - water and baking soda!  [Kenji](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/08/quick-caramelized-onions-recipe.html) of course.  With a couple of flat tops, you can knock down 50 ponds of onions in no time.  I am a home cook with regular access to a commercial kitchen and i always do my onions there, because while 10 or 15 pounds is a gracious plenty for my feezer living alone, it is so bloody easy on a flat top.
Thanks! That made me smile, I appreciate it.A lot of good suggestions here.  I would like to add pate to the list. roast some sweet potatoes with cardamom, salt, pepper, a little brown sugar;   or add some garam masala or curry powder to regular potatoes.I make [this recipe](http://thelemonbowl.com/2012/12/baked-chicken-fingers-with-panko-and-dijon.html) at least once every week. I cook them at 475, takes about 12 minutes, flipping them once halfway through. You've actually addressed the reason. If you don't have a strong food processor yeast doughs or heavy doughs will destroy your machine. I have a pretty cheap food processor, so maybe I should amend my statement to " only make yeast doughs in a strong high quality food processor".

The other thing to keep in mind, is just because it works doesn't mean you should do it. If you do make yeast dough in your food processor, it will wear down the machine faster.I live in Upstate New York.

We have Wegmans' nearby if that helps haha.

My family is generally Muslim so they don't eat bacon/pork-related items. Why avoid yeast doughs?  Plenty of "experts" have acknowledged that a food processor can simulate traditional kneading in a fraction of the time.  And I don't even use the plastic blade, just the traditional one.  Just need a somewhat strong one, otherwise it will bind up.

[My favorite pizza dough](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/10/new-york-style-pizza.html)

[Bernard Clayton's book covers the food processor and includes its kneading time in most recipes](http://www.amazon.com/Bernard-Claytons-Complete-Book-Breads/dp/0743287096)

https://www.cuisinart.com/recipes/breads/436.htmlYou have a grill and want to be fancy? [Grilled rack of lamb](http://dartagnan.scene7.com/is/image/DARTAGNAN/Recipe_Roasted_Rack_Lamb_Peet_HomeMedium?$EDP$)! Go to [Cash &amp; Carry](https://www.smartfoodservice.com/) and get a frozen rack. Season the outside of the rack with salt, pepper, and cumin, and grill until it gets dark but not burnt. Then wrap it in foil and cook for ten-fifteen minutes.  Serve with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus (the tuxedo of vegetables).My advice is to improve upon things you probably already know how to make. You made a quesadilla and didn't completely burn it, that is a success. Maybe next time cook grill some chicken and throw it inside. Then on your 4th try add some fried green peppers, onions and jalapeos. Making hot dogs? Fry some onions and throw them on top.

in fact fry onions for everything, it is the single most important basic skill involved in cooking damn near anything. Indian, Italian, French, Thai, American, every cuisine uses onions as a foundation in a number of dishes.  But I digress.

Making a turkey sandwich? Grill that motherfucker with some cheese and bacon. Boiling pasta and using jar sauce?  Chop and saut some garlic in olive oil with crushed red pepper to give it some zing.  Making eggs?  Try eggy in a basket or slow cooked creamy scrambled eggs or try your hand at a basic omelette.  Having salad?  Nix the jar dressing and make your own balsamic vinaigrette.

Slowly up the ante on these simple dishes, adding things here and there. It will teach you the knife skills to chop everyday veggies and teach you how to control your heat. Then start to branch out and learn new things. You are going to burn things, I still do and I have been cooking since I was 13. Good luck man. We love mashed garlic yukon gold potatoes garnished with parsley. We find prime rib is such a rich, succulent meat the mashed potatoes are just sooo good with it :)To extend on this, the foot you place slightly behind the other one should be on the same side of your knife hand. If you use your right hand, put your right foot back.I find that almost taking a boxer's stance with my feet helps a lot. That, and good shoes or a padded mat to stand on. If you haven't cleaned it yet, you can boil water in it and the food will  scrape off easily.I'm a hospitality major whose graduated from culinary school so you're in luck ;).
As far as the sauce is concerned, your sauce *has* to be hot before you add the cheese. It must be bubbling. Instead of garlic salt, I tend to use 3 cloves of mince garlic. Most sauces online don't add enough spices, but it's really a personal preference.

 Okay so if you ever cook chicken on a high heat, it has to be pounded out. You want it a half an inch or less. It you ever cook just chicken breasts, it doesn't need to be that thin, but you want to pound it out so the entire piece is even. Now by high heat you really need to use a medium high heat. The smoke is a sign that your oil is breaking down and your pan is way to hot. I think your pan in general was just too hot. As a general rule of thumb, you can use 4 oz of chicken per serving and I think you could get away with a quarter of a pepper or less per tortilla.

An easier start would be to do poached chicken and couscous. For poached chicken, put the chicken in a pan with enough water to cover the chicken all the way. For one chicken breast, slice up one lemon and put about a tablespoon of dried rosemary in the water. The water must never boil, but it can simmer. Boiling is for pasta, and simmering is gentle bubbles. Cook the chicken for maybe 5 or 7 minutes. The chicken should feel firm compared to the raw chicken. Set the chicken off to the side when done.

Couscous has instructions on the side, but you can use the water from the chicken. Make sure to strain out as much as the rosemary as you can and I would remove the left over lemon. You can grate a carrot and cut up some bell peppers to add into the couscous. If you're going to cut up the peppers, aim for about 1/4 of an inch or less.

If you need any help for any of the recipes, feel free to message me.Wrong, I couldn't give any less shits about meaningless downvotes. I use mine to make [tomatillo salsa](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=tomatillo%20salsa)

This is an awesome thread. I'm prob going to look up half of these suggestions and try them.Make fresh salsa!Pizza / bread dough - great for "kneading". Super quick!

Do I just toss all the ingredients in and pulse or what?
Pie crust. Check out cook's illustrated's recipe with vodka (which cooks out but makes a great crust).

Pizza / bread dough - great for "kneading". Super quick!Think of it as a time-saver instead of the specific dishes it can make, and suddenly you'll be using it a lot more often.

* Fine chopping: Need something turned into crumbs? This is the easiest answer to "what can my food processor do?" Crusts for pies and lean proteins (macadamia crusted halibut) are suddenly easy to make at home. But let's say you need powdered sugar (or superfine sugar, for that matter) to finish a recipe--now you can just make a batch instead of making a special trip to the store.
* Pasting and pureeing: [Peanut butter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PAT_TKUO9U)! Cheesecake, soups made of soft, cooked vegetables like squash are finished dishes that need it, but the interesting thing is that it's *secret weapon* that lets you do cool stuff like turn a watery, lumpy broth and aromatic vegetables into a thick, velvety soup base.
* Kneading: high protein flour doughs can withstand the punishment of the hard plastic attachment. This means you can make all manner of pizza (with a pound of cheese grated by the same machine!), chewy breads, and long pasta dough.

* Grating: Fondue date? Hell yeah you can make cheese or chocolate fondue in twenty minutes without being sweaty. Grate carrot and onion for coleslaw, or potato for latkes or hashbrowns the morning after in the time it takes her to shower.
* Slicing: This is kind of an advanced set of uses, but you can slice the cabbage for your coleslaw, prep a few pounds of carrots to be glazed, thinly **and uniformly** slice apples for a tart (crust made out of almonds from the fine chopping bullet point? HOLY CRAP IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER NOW)

There are a ton of things this tool can do. It depends on what kind of food you like to eat and what kind of cooking you like to do. So what do *you* want?I want the reversible steel and ridiculous flame thrower. Even the damn April fools recipes have shit I want in them. The only thing I could find with your listed ingredients

Ingredients
Leftover Mounds chocolate layers (from Tom Khaa recipe)
1 packet instant coffee (or 1tbsp)
1 Snickers bar (or 2 mini Snickers bars)
1 packet instant hot chocolate mix (with or without marshmellows)
Hot water

Combine leftover Mounds chocolate layers with Nescafe and hot chocolate mix. Add hot water until a thickish paste forms.

Cut Snickers bar(s) into even slices. Dip slices into chocolate paste. Plate in an interesting way. Cover with remaining hot chocolate mix.

Also if you are willing to buy cranberry juice it's really good with La Croix.  It's a refreshing not overly sweet beverage. Oh man, so much stuff! I'll suggest something that's a bit unorthodox. [Cauliflower alfredo sauce!](http://pinchofyum.com/creamy-cauliflower-sauce) It doesn't taste exactly like alfredo, but honestly it's just as good. Yep, anything goes. Except avoid yeast doughs. You can also use it to make a bang up homemade mayo.Make [pie crust](https://www.craftybaking.com/recipe/kellys-perfect-food-processpie-dough)...I'm not shitting you, it actually works really well. I use a heavy tinned copper dutch oven, except I need to re-tin it, so right now I use an enameled cast iron dutch oven instead.

As for rice, vialone nano is the best in my opinion.You're a good boyfriend.Russ &amp; Daughters is so dope.Dude, what CAN'T you use it for?!

I use it to pulse butter in biscuits, whirl down veggies for stir fry, quickly shred cheese on mexican night, mix up cookie dough, liquify chickpeas for hummus, blend up homemade pesto for pizza / pasta night, chop nuts for desserts. I'd recommend the America's Test Kitchen Cooking School Cookbook. It has tons of basic food and cooking info that will help you avoid mistakes and how to correct mistakes. For example, basic measuring skills (when do you pack a measuring cup and when not) how to make your food more even shaped to ensure more consistent cooking, or what to do to salvage your food if it's too salty.

I think it's a great intro to cooking and cooking techniques. 800 pages, full color, 600 recipes. damn dude, not too salty?Aborio is named the rissoto rice for a reason, the grains are able to soak up heaps more liquid than other grains, giving more depth to the flavours. Not saying your way is wrong or bad, but for myself I'd prefer aborio My girlfriend loves barley risotto and we always make it in our dutch oven. We usually add some tomato paste and rosemary when we're using barley. It usually takes longer to cook but it's great.Among other things, [you can use it to grind meat](http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/04/the-burger-lab-whats-the-best-way-to-grind-beef.html)."Ethnic" is a pretty generic term. You might want to be a little more specific about what you either do want or don't want. Gazpacho, pesto, blended soups and things like that can be made in a food processor. Also, any recipe that requires a lot of grating is so much easier with one. For example, I make latkes every year and if I had to grate all those potatoes by hand I'd probably snap and murder someone. If you bake, you can also use it to chop nuts. My favorite thing to make in mine is a pesto with a spinach base. The recipe I use is similar to this one, although mine uses frozen and thawed spinach and also includes a tablespoon or two of dry basil. http://www.food.com/recipe/speedy-spinach-pesto-176624Often it is used for processing food. Chopping, grating, slicing, blending, mixing, etc.Couscous saladSimilar to my chicken recipe, I just don't add the 5 spice to it. I also use galangal, turmeric and a splash of whiskey. Also works great on beef.Oh boy, I guess I'm going back to the store. I'm a big Bobby Flay fan, but really, it depends on what I'm trying to cook. For Mexican, I search for something from Rick Bayless. For Asian type dishes, Rasamalaysia.com. Indiansimmer is great for Indian. I check allrecipes quite a bit too. One trick I stumbled onto is google books. You can search for a recipe and click google books, and it will give you a free preview of the book. Really nice!TIL gluten is an ingredient in Satan (seitan). No wonder everything is gluten freeHawaiian Wedding Cake- yellow cake made from a mix in a 9x13 pan, cooled, mix together 1 package cream cheese and 1 box instant vanilla pudding, spread on top, sprinkle on 1 can drained crushed pineapple, top with cool whip, sprinkle with walnuts.

I made this in a trifle form once and won a cake competition! I just made the cake in round pans and sliced them horizontally. I used the thin cakes and made a bunch of layers in a trifle bowl thingy. A nice grilled brisket, some flour tortillas, and your standard taco/burrito toppings is a good bet.I wrote a recipe a while ago, but i can't find it right now.

-tuna fish in a packet
-wraps
-mayo or whatever you like mixed with Tuna
-sea salt
-and onions
(If you want, also cheese)
Mix the tuna with the mayo and onions
In a pan fry the wraps with either butter or olive oil to a nice crisp. Then put the tuna in the wrap, wrap them up and place them back in the pan to cook everything together No, you were simply insisting you were right and everyone else was wrong and then wondering why you got downvotes.Like I said, as long as it's clean and not still coated in layers of grease from previous use or anything. I don't know anything about grill maintenance but I find that that's all too often the case (maybe it's supposed to be like that, what do I know?).That's *exactly* what it means, just relatively as opposed to absolutely. Do you have a recipe?Those were not measuring spoons used in the video. Dis you stay close to the stated amounts of ingredients?  How long did you marinate the chicken?Oh good deal! Cooking is a wonderful world, so much to explore and learn! I agree that many so called easy recipes involve techniques that can be a bit difficult to learn or follow.

So I can get a better idea of where you can start, what area do you live? If you live in the middle of Idaho what you have available is way different than say LA.

For an easy start, I'd say you should learn breakfast. Eggs are awesome, cheap, nutritious, and easy. So many ways to cook them, and learning egg-focused dishes can help your general cooking skills. Want a bacon-biscuit egg? Learn to make simple biscuits! (pro-tip for biscuits - add sour cream instead of all water to your mixture to get super moist and tasty biscuits). Want eggs benedict? Learn how gentle poaching works and one of the five mother sauces along the way.

Cooking got a lot more fun for me when I realized that trying things and not getting great results is just fine - figure out what did and didn't work and your efforts were totally worth it. Also utilize the internet! There are tons of great places to learn more about cooking details; google is your friend.vegetarian chili. But make a lot because everyone will eat it. I use 7 beans, red,green and yellow peppers. a couple of habanero's a couple jalapenos and 1 hot cherry pepper. I use both fresh tomatoes and canned and some paste to thicken it up.Chinese cold sesame noodles. It is a sesame sauce not with noodles made of sesame. It is my go to dish in the summerIMO, a counter top that is slightly lower than your elbows when you let your arms hang is best. Any higher it would tiring to raise your arms. However, i have the same problem as you.Thank you!!I'm talking this [stuff](http://www.shop.filamasianmarket.com/images/Kalbi%20Marinade.jpg).My son started out with sauces and worked to perfect a couple at a time. He then started to learn Indian flavor profiles. Unfortunately his girlfriend is getting all the benefits of his skills now. It was like having a 4 star chef in the house. He was very good at building flavors.Bar Keepers Friend and elbow grease will do it.  My step son stole one of my stainless steel skillets and took it camping where he evidently burned whatever he tried to cook in it on the campfire.  I found it hidden in the garage a year later.  Ten minutes of scrubbing set it back to looking new.

We taking Annie Chung type marinate or homemade?

By the way,  if you ever see extra dark mushroom soy sauce,  you should try it.  It's practically sauce on its own.  It's just that a lot of the recipes I find online that are supposedly easy, just seem to be kind of difficult and utilize a lot of ingredients that have to be formed in a certain way.

I just want a 'Cooking for Dummies' kind of thing.

I don't know, really, what food I want to make, cause I haven't eaten a lot of different kinds of food like Seafood, Chinese food, Mexican food, etc.

Thanks for the advice!There's a kickstarted company in Portland OR-- called Finex-- that recently started selling a high-end smooth skillet. It will definitely be on my Christmas wish list.
http://finexusa.com/products/Hey, guy who loves cooking here! And I also did most of my learning my sophomore year of college when I moved out on my own. I would recommend you utilize the beauty of the internet for getting started - Jacques Pepin has a series called 'fast food my way' and I find it very informational and easy to follow. Also, as polarizing as he can be, Gordon Ramsay has a lot of really good videos on youtube that provide tons of good info as well.

You'll find that cooking is incredibly cheap compared to eating out. When I was living alone, I was spending an average of $40 a week and eating premium; I utilized the farmer's market and costco to maximize savings while eating well. Even now, my partner and I average around $75 a week on groceries. The one night we eat out each week tends to run at least $35. Think about that, one meal out is around half our weekly groceries!

One way to get started is identify a type of food you want to cook. For me, I wanted to get into Korean food; I'm half Korean and it's near and dear food. I went to maangchi.com and learned a lot of basics from her recipes (and bugged my aunts to learn more). From there, I dove into Italian learning basic sauces then making fresh pasta, and into French food learning the essentials.

It's really about identifying what you love in food, what you want to make, and looking at the steps you can take to make it! Anyhow if you have more questions I'd be happy to talk more!Steel wool pad and scrub away.Can attest that a saucier is by far the best way to do it, enameled (ceramic) dutch ovens and cast iron dutch ovens both perform adequately, even if you use Kenji's low stir method. I do a hybrid recipe.  Start with Kalbi marinade and add about 1/2 cup fish sauce, 4-5 cloves minced garlic, 3-4 bunches of scallions finely chopped and 2-3 stalks of lemongrass finely chopped.  Let it all marinade and then grill.  Best of both worlds!Scares me a bit also. My GF was standing next to the 800+ egg in shorts and flip-flops. I made her go inside.I wish my work cutting board was higher, I feel like I'm constantly bending over and reaching too low, its painful most for my back/neck.Discard the outer shells.  Cut off both the ends.  It will still be a little woody, but a lot easier to cut up then finely chop.  Also use a big chef's knife or asian style cleaver.As long as they don't give you any lip, that sounds like a cool place.Rabbit braised in veal broth for 8 hours.
Seperate from bones, form rough patty of sorts, and sear in butter in a pan. Put on good toast. If there is duck fat around, fry the toast in that.
Garnish with pea sprouts and serve with cauliflower pudding sprinkled with venison bacon.  Cook the vegetarian stuff first!It's probably inefficient, but I just break up the actions when chopping vegetables. For example, instead of washing everything in one go and then standing in front of the cutting board, I'll wash one potato/pepper/whatever, cut, put it into the bowl, and then turn around to wash the next one. Keeps me moving and avoids staying in that stiffening position. Ohhhh man looks like fried Asian wings for Easter!How about serving it in a sandwich? Add grilled fennel, tomatoes, arugula, and provolone all on a good hard crust roll and serve it with au jus sauce.Efficient is always the goal, lols. You could try and make specials for the restaurant, which will start developing menu building skills. Btw, how do you make the honey-adobo chicken? It sounds great and all of my recipes are Mediterranean or American comfort foods.Mmm, caramelized onions... Any advice before I go a-googling?I can eat chicken cold I would go with a lemon thyme poached chicken mixed with couscous, sun dried tomatoes, and artichokes. You can save the water you cooked the chicken in for cooking other grains in or freezing it when you're ready to make soup.

Deviled eggs, sandwiches, and raps are all good idea. If you wanted you could make a lettuce wrap. Get iceberg lettuce leaves and fill it with rice, red beans, corn, cilantro, and chicken with an Italian vinaigrette. If you make your own vinaigrette, there is less sugar in it and it's dirt cheap.Yes! I've worked in restaurants on and off since I was 15 (25 now). I got most of my scars out of the way long ago. Throw me in a kitchen, and I know how to operate everything safely. Just don't expect a masterpiece...I'm mediocre at best. But good idea. I've kind of already started shadowing. I've been asking the chef to show me how to make everything on the menu. The best so far is this honey-adobo grilled chicken we do, it is so so so good, and actually quite easy.

As far as my knife skills, they are pretty solid, I've done prep at several restaurants over the years. I'm not insanely fast, but I'm safe and efficient.and saltgo for something grilled or poached. A lemon rosemary poached chicken with a side of tri colored couscous is pretty safe.

Cover the the chicken breasts in water and add 2 sliced lemons and a sprig of fresh rosemary. The instructions for couscous come on the container, but I always add oranges, bell peppers and a shredded carrot. Since bell peppers are a bit pricey, maybe you could just stick to the shredded carrot.

You can also save the water you cooked the chicken in as a weak broth or the start to a sauce base. If you want a little extra flavor to the couscous use some of the water you cooked the chicken in to cook the couscous so you're not wasting flavor.What is your setup like?

Tons of spices and herbs. Lots more I'm forgetting. Obviously boatloads of tortillas. Chihuahua, cheddar, queso fresco, and Oaxaca cheeses.people suggest a dutch over because of even cooking. I have pans that have a copper core for even heating. A saucier is probably your best bet, but I always use a saute pan.Yeah, it's pretty nuts hot hot it gets.... Makes me nervous honestly.

That, and I have a replacement gasket waiting to be installed.Gosh, I'm not sure. Whatever cinnamon comes pre-ground in spice jars at the supermarket. I'm not very sophisticated.Will try this first. I'm thinking two eggs overhard, home fries, and either bacon or sausage. Oh! I just realized I could make a HUGE omelette...That does sound great, I struggle with the idea of a meal with no carbs but some nice garlic bread on the side maybe..Grilled flank steak on a bed of fresh arugula with caramelized onions, blue cheese, and a nice balsamic vinaigrette.

I would eat this everyday if I could.Actually using pearl barley today.Good luck!Just use them for anything. Chipotle adds a lot of taste to so many different dishes. Heck put a bit of it in a cup of hot chocolate for extra warming up. And learn to make some good mexican sauces.
Foundation of those is:
Garlic, Onion, many different kinds, some kind of vegetable usually tomato and red peppers, sesame seeds or nuts or whatever.

Chiles are amazing for pretty much anything you just need to learn which one tastes the best with what food.I make a cold taco dip. You could make it in individual single serve containers and it would be ready to eat with chips. The key is really thin layers. Here's how I do it with the thinnest layers possible. Refried beans, black beans, cream cheese mixed with taco seasoning, shredded cheddar cheese, diced green onions, diced tomatoes, diced black olives.  It does, thanksIf it makes you feel any better, I'm a professional who's been cooking for a very long time, and for many years I also thought that alcohol more or less burned off during cooking.

A lot of people suggested Portobello mushroom and the person said they'd rather have a salad and went in to describe a potential good salad. Someone then responded that vegetarians like this person give vegetarians a bad name because the salad was "too fancy" essentially.Quinoa goes pretty nicely with viniagrettes and chopped fresh veggies. There's also bean salads.Maybe you should be chopping on a more elevated surface?a pros.

Oh good deal! Roast chickens are super easy and really tasty, also very economical. Though if you want to do roast vegetables, you might end up with a super crowded oven / run out of oven space.

It's not for everyone, but if you have enough frying pans then seared salmon is very easy and tasty, but it might push the price up (if costco is nearby the salmon prices are alright).

Another option is to get brisket. Beef or pork brisket can run super low in price (my area is $5ish per pound, some areas it pushes up to $8 per pound but still low for protein). You can pressure cook it, slow braise it, or grill it. Really easy to impart a lot of flavor!You not liking something doesn't mean it tastes disgusting.Homemade veggie sandwich patties can actually be pretty good if done right. The bread is a huge deciding factor for me, but I'm subscribed to a bread subreddit so I guess I don't represent the majority. Maybe some good bread and a lentil loaf? That way you can either make a sandwich or eat the loaf with a fork.I think we have a winner. Trying to rub a handful of almonds inside a tower was a real pain, but I ended up dumping the almonds onto a towel on a table, and pressing and "wiping" across the pile with my hand. This would remove the skins from a few of them with a single pass. Occasionally I had to pick the accumulating empty skins out of the pile, but overall it was less effort and a little quicker than doing it the squeeze-and-pop way. Thanks!Good thought, but it did not work. They just bounced around and the skins remained undisturbed.Go to an authentic schizuan restaurant order either the double cooked pork belly or the three pepper chicken. You are welcome.Just be aware that some vegetarians are squicked out by food grilled on the same grill used for meat if it's not very clean.You can preassemble and let it sit with no worries.  Just be aware that it needs to rest for a while when it comes out of the oven.  You can also prebake and reheat.  I think this tastes best myself.

As for the MSG.  You can add it to the sauce and the veggies.  A half teaspoon or less for every four to six servings should be enough.   MSG will add sodium so lighten up on the salt.   Taste as you go and you'll be fine.



I would think the urge to GTFO would be stronger than "Oh, I have a flat top that I can use and then clean (again)."The ceylon kind of cinnamon I assume? (I've only had cassia which I wouldn't expect to be in there)Well I stand corrected, thank you.

Looks like slow cooker sauces would be fine, at least.How about a [baked potato bar/spud bar](http://www.theyummylife.com/baked_potato_bar)? (Using both regular and sweet potatoes). Cheap ingredients, don't actually have to cook if you don't want to, just a lot mixing.  And you can make it look pretty [fancy and fun](http://celebrationsathomeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/potato-bar.jpg). Recommend to also have a bowl of mixed salad on the side.I think using carnaroli is better than arborio rice but not sure on the cooking vessel but I do use my dutch oven for risotto.Mine doesn't stop spinning. I know I've got a problem when my XL gauge starts over again. I walk out, say "huh, 100 doesn't sound right...", burp it and peak inside the molten-red-hot-pizza-cooking-egg.

The heat coming out of that thing at 800+ is down right amazing.Salads.
Gazpacho, duh.
Crme Vichyssoise glac.  (have it with sliced baguette and butter).  You can make it with chicken too.  [Here](http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/34669/potato+leek+and+chicken+soup) is a recipe I just found that isn't at all what I usually make but which I will surely be riffing on soon.  I just add some poached chicken thigh cut into small bits.

Lots of soups are great cold, notably cucumber.

Cold noodle stuffs.  Thai peanut noodles and so on.

Pasta salads. There is so many varieties out these. Also, I love carprese salad. Cheese, meat, and fruit tray. Serve with crackers and/or baguette.These are all great suggestions. Ancho chili goes very well with black beans, I've found. Especially when combined with cumin, coriander, garlic, cinnamon, salt, onion, and black pepper.I sure as heck didn't know the difference. TIL. Thanks!I knew I was forgetting something. I'll be cooking for around 10-15 people. When I'm making a fry up similar to the mongolian style from those restaurants, I try to balance salt, sweet, and acid. Lite soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, mirin, and sesame oil are the main ingredients I use. Balancing those out tends to get a decent result!

You can also try mixing in some sauces like bull-dog sauce (typically a tonkatsu sauce) to adjust for what you're looking for!How many guests are you looking to cook for? There are a few options for protein but it depends on how many people.

My favorite cost effective and delicious side is roast vegetables. In a large roasting pan (take the rack out), put in halved brussels sprouts, halved pearl onions, fingerling potatoes halved lengthwise, carrots cut into about 2" lengths, and you can also use butternut squash. Throw in a few cloves of garlic, drizzle with olive oil, salt, pepper, and add in fresh herbs of your choice (I love thyme and rosemary). Roast that at 350 until the vegetables begin to golden; toss them around after about 10 to 15 minutes, usually takes 25 to 30 minutes to finish cooking. When the veg is about done, take some balsamic vinegar, drizzle over the top and toss the vegetables and cook for just a few minutes.It has nothing to do with friends. Any friends that knew me back when I started, well... I haven't seen them in nearly half of my life.

What I do is for myself, not other people.

Edit: also, the stuff tastes disgusting. http://www.gluten-free-vegan-girl.com/2012/12/how-to-skin-almonds-step-by-step-photo-tutorial.htmlShould make about 2.25cups, for a stir fry with around 1lb of protein and  3/4lb veg i use  3/4cup of sauce.  That would serve two hungry people or four people with self respect  :).

When adding the sauce to your stir fry, also add a slurry of  1tbsp corn starch mixed with 1tbsp water.  It'll thicken up very nicely  and coat your food. Well....  I own an XL, they are a bit pricey.

Santa Claus (my wife and two sister-in-laws) brought it for Christmas two years ago...but I hear that it was ~1000 (with the "Nest", cover, and "platesetter" for indirect smoking/baking).

Not cheap...but I expect it to last me a long time.Then what's a Pok?I'd say keep it simple also. Marcella Hazan's famous tomato sauce would be good --- it's just butter, a can of tomatoes and half an onion --- or you could keep it even simpler and do like a really quick marinara, if you can get decent fresh tomatoes where you're at. I'd just just sweat an onion in some olive oil until it goes soft, add some thinly sliced garlic and a bunch of chopped fresh tomatoes and cook them for 10 minutes or so, just to bring them together, then take off the heat and add a bunch of fresh basil. Alcohol does not fully evaporate during cooking. See linked chart for amount of alcohol retained in various cooking methods:

http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blalcohol12.htm
So cheap! Canned chickpeas. Radishes cost about 10 cents each. Kale by the bunch is super cheap. It'll cost a lot less than the meat dish, I bet!

They asked for suggestions. That's what I did. That's hot. In every sense of the word.

Can I ask what you paid for that bad boy?I totally agree!  It's the only art that uses every sense. That's a great start. Every plate's an empty canvas. Get artsy. Not sure why you're being down voted- I think you hit the nail on the head![Islamic Easter Bunny?](http://i.imgur.com/wIBgBXW.jpg)

[Halal Easter Bunny?](http://i.imgur.com/2k560Kl.jpg)You just ended up on my ignore list.

 Wow you wrote me an essay over it and it was yesterday. Let it go. And to be honest. I didnt read past your first sentence bc it's ridiculous to elaborate that much on the rare instances when someone is nice and tries to provide you with something they think you may likeIs there a reason you're arguing so strongly about this?

Like I said in my comments several times, yes, I always appreciate when someone is thoughtful and tries to accommodate for my inconvenient dietary preference. But fake meat products are polarizing among vegetarians, and those of us who don't enjoy them really, *really* don't enjoy them. They're also expensive and can be someone difficult to find, making them relatively inconvenient for the host to provide.

I always eat those products if provided out of politeness, but it makes me feel guilty that they went through the trouble on top of grossing me out. At least at a barbecue or cookout, I can eat a few bites, thank the host and then discretely toss the burger/dog/whatever once the host is in a different part of the group. At a dinner party, you don't have that luxury so you're stuck with it. And there's no polite way to say "Thank you for buying me this expensive thing but I actually think it's disgusting so please don't do it again," so you just eat it and say thanks and that's that.

OP didn't mention wanting to serve a meat substitute in her post, so why push so strongly for her to do so? All I and a couple others have mentioned is that not everyone enjoys them, so to check with her SIL before going that route. Why do you have such a problem with that? It's perfectly reasonable advice.Oh. I've never used salt peter. Just a kosher salt/sugar solution. I am a vegetarian and I completely support this. You can flavour them up really well by grilling them and they look spectacular as well. Either this or some combo of grilled up eggplant/zucchini/peppers/onion Banoffee PieThat Korean chicken video was adorable.I didn't even know it was a word until you said it before. I previously would have just referred to it as a dressing.Is 3 weeks okay when using salt peter?  I only use 1 tablespoon of it You can brine it for 3 weeks.  I have and it turned out great. I died a little inside when i saw the prime ribeyes covered in nacho cheese. At least it wasn't ketchup.I made Zimmerman's wings last night for the second time. Definitely a recipe worth savingThanks, I'll think about doing the scotch eggs for easter.No matter what you do, do not eat them all in one night.

My girlfriend and I roasted 2 pounds of brussel sprouts, ate the lot of them (Too lazy to cook anything else and we'd had a large lunch).

My farts are STILL gnarly...and I woke her up with a boisterous one that night.If you can afford it, prosciutto wrapped dates can be served cold.

My girlfriend and I stuff them with goat cheese too, mmmIt really looks like a threshold thing. As stated in the article, your kidneys are pretty good at cleaning out aluminum, so one week of indulgence per year is likely fine (I LOVE foil wrapped chicken), but it all comes down to that level of constant exposure.

My mom got heavy metal poisoning from eating fish 5 times per week after a year.  It was just cheaper than other options. Her memory went to hell. She changed types of fish and started eating more chicken and it cleared up in a few months. Scary stuff though. Good luck! "Oh yes, that fresh meat gas!"Ceviche and deviled eggs are 2 things that immediately come to mindAwesome, I have everything on that list except the wine and mushroom flavoured soy sauce. How much of this elixir do you use per stir fry? Is this recipe enough for multiple meals or is it a single serving?Maybe a dozen times a year, but generally multiple times a week when it happens. Thanks for the article, I'll bring myself up to speed.A great side dish to go with fish is yellow squash. Just cut them about an 1/8 of an inch to 1/4 inch thick. Put them into a large bowl. Put plenty of olive oil on them and put, oregano, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper. Then lay out on a baking sheet and bake at 425 for 10-15 minutes. Serve with Parmesan cheese on top. Super easy but tastes great with fish. If you want to use the yellow easter theme, you might want to try to make [Advocaat](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/11/diy-vs-buy-dutch-eggnog-advocaat-brandy-christmas-drink-cocktail-party.html) ( [a traditional Dutch alcoholic beverage made from eggs, sugar and brandy.The rich and creamy drink has a smooth, custard-like flavor and is similar to eggnog.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocaat)) and use that as an "exotic" element in a banana  split or bavarois.I'd say go for a ceramic honing rod instead a steel one. It's like a few swipes on a 1000 grit stone which is perfect for tuning up your edge before prep. And the cheap ones are no different than expensive ones.

Also ditto on the prep ramekins, and some stainless steel mixing bowls.  In general go for as much SS as possible for longevity and multi use. For example, you can flip a bowl on top of a protein to speed up cook time, or melt cheese or whatever, and I usually keep a large one on the counter for prep scraps to keep the workflow tight and toss it when I'm done.

Also learn to sharpen your own knives as soon as you feel comfortable. That's sort of semi-advanced, but really essential if you want to continue cooking safely. And also pretty relaxing, IMO. You're not going to get drunk or trigger any genes with alcohol in cooking. If you're worried about being tempted buy "airplane" bottles that contain only what you need. Now if you're worried about your stupid friends seeing you "break edge" I can't help you.That is why you add pasta to bulk it up. The per serving price goes way down.tastes like feet!My husband doesn't like lamb and I love it so this thread is just really depressing. Multiple times per week?

All depends on risk and exposure. This article covers the matter well: http://www.arltma.com/Articles/AlumToxDoc.htmNo prob, if you want to see my proportions this is what I've been making:

**Brown Sauce**

* Stocks: 1.5 cup or 355 mL (Heated Chicken or Veg. Stocks)

* Kikkoman Soy Sauce: 3 tbsp

* Pearl River Bridge Mushroom Flavored Soy Sauce: 1tbsp

* Sugar: 2.5 tbsp or 30 g

* Shaoxing Wine: 2 tbsp or 30 mL

* Lee Kum Kee Oyster Sauce: 2 tbsp or 30 mL

* Lee Kum Kee Hoisin Sauce:1 tbsp or 15 mL

* Sesame Oil: 1 tsp or 5 mL

* MSG: 2tsp (optional if you're a soccer mom)

* Green Onions Roots: 1 root or 2 tsp, sliced thin

* Ginger: 1-2 tsp, minced

* Garlic: 1-2 tsp, minced

* White Pepper: 1/4tsp, fresh ground

Combine all in a bowl (stock must be hot) and let steep at room temperature for 1hr.  Strain and discard solids.My go-to fish dish to impress is soy glazed baked salmon.

Marinate salmon portions in soy, mustard, honey and sesame oil.

Oven, 400F, 15 minutes. Baste with marinade every 5 minutes.

Being Filipino, I eat everything with rice. That particular dish, I love with steamed brown rice.

Veg: I am seriously lacking broc skills, and my skill with taters is only limited to hashbrowns and garlic mash.

As a side to fish, my parents passed on to me a simple relish they learned from vietnamese: rough chop onions and tomatoes, add lots of chopped cilantro, squeeze of lemon/lime, and a dash or 2 of fish sauce. Parboil.  Preheat your wok in the oven (500F or more) before setting it on the preheated burner.  You'll have to work quickly to get the benefit.  Obviously your wok must be oven safe to do this.I've never done it but i imagine hot sauce uses a lot of chili peppers, is scalable to how many peppers you want to use, will keep for a while, and probably benefits from all the different pepper varieties. It sounds strange, but many friends have confirmed this for me, one quarter teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder. (this is for a recipe with 1 and 1/2 pounds of ground beef so adjust depending on how much you made)

Also if it's lacking flavour add powdered beef stock.It tastes like FEET!&gt;Sorry to be that guy but its Should've or Should have. Never should of. Its a huge pet peeve of mine.

Sorry to be that guy but it's "it's" on both counts, not "its."I would love for you to type up some pizza roundening protips if you don't mind sharingThe introduction to the spamchos article was so vaguely manly that it made me have 2nd puberty and become a double man.

Edit: and the steakchos article has brought me all the way to -1 puberty. Oh right! I didn't realize you were making a sweeping generalization on the opinion of the entire human race. My bad! I was simply adding clarification to the question that was asked. &gt; Don't even have a peel, just use a cookie sheet.

That's very clever, thanks for saving me $30&gt; Some advise against any food contact with aluminum as there is no health benefit, but risk for heavy metal poisoning depending on usage and other exposure.

Do you have a source for this? We do foil-packet cooking in a campfire fairly regularly.And you miss my point, or more accurately you seem to be ignoring my point because you can't accept that there are people who don't want to eat green meat because it might make them sick.Hopefully someday you'll get over your self-imposed bullshitwhat was the other post?You missed my point. I was saying that not all green meat is bad. We live in a time where you can research and learn how to identify the differences.  Saying that all green meat is inedible is incorrect. Try this for a recipe - http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/03/greek-turkey-burgers/

They are super flavorful, the key with turkey is adding a little egg and breadcrumb to help with the texture.Yeah, very non-fishy.It's just my opinion that bad meat will make you sick?  And that if you're not about to starve and unsure about food you should throw it out rather than get food poisoning...?

Really?
Yes, the green portion is likely unsafe to eat. Unless the product is frozen, then the greenness is likely due to oxidation, making it perfectly edible. If it's bacterial growth that doesn't mean the cut can't be salvaged and some of the product is still be safe to eat. Both sound tasty to me, but I'd probably go Oreo. Maybe not, but safe food is pretty universal. If its green meat, there's a 100% chance its not good. This will be my last reply as this discussion is going nowhere. This is wrong, and you should know this if you work in the industry. Spoilage for restaurants is very different than that of charitable organizations as well as individual households. The standards are different because the expectations are higher. Plus, if you pay for food, you are expected to be served higher quality ingredients. Donations made to organizations are typically expired from the get go, and thus disqualified of ever making there way into a food industry establishment. This does not mean the food is bad, simply that it needs to be salvaged. So if a charity pays for 100kg of meat, they expect to only keep ~90% of what they bought. This includes green meat or severely damaged product. You think that if organizations were poisoning people nobody would hear about it? No, because precautions are taken so that this doesn't happen. Restaurants also salvage their inventory, but the process is much more rigorous because taste and flavor are crucial. And if you disagree with this, you either work in at a shitty establishment, are misinformed, or a liar.Pok pok means prostitute in tagalogI like your enthusiasm.You should check to see if you're buying dry-pack scallops also. A lot of processors rinse scallops with this stuff called STP -- it's basically like brining them, the scallops absorb more water, and that will come out when you cook them. The dry pack ones can be a little more expensive, but you're not paying for extra water, so I feel like it evens out. That's actually newish. When I wrote the review there was no choice for Blue Apron.They might be! But why only have one chicken wing? There's room in my arteries for more than one type of chicken wing.
Interesting how both this and a post bashing someone for speaking up about their preference on veggie options are both so upvoted...Reddit is weird.OPs look better.Oh wow...who knew a paper bad is so tasty!?!I would but I just made that for her last weekend! It's why I was clean out of ideas! :)You're screwed.I was going to say my mom would BEAT ME SOO BAD for scrubbing the flavor out!
lucky you April fools! That's a great way to explain it.It is all in one but I'm a big fan of veggies so I wanted another thing. Thanks for the suggestions!This is perfect to go with my Easter meal!  I'm making tabbouleh and fattoush for the sides.  Yeah, different cuisines, but I think it would pair well.I'd say go simple. A simple brown butter sauce with garlic, sage, mushroom, and artichoke heart! Give it a dash of lemon and some dry, nutty cheese and you're golden with the pasta as a star!My mother uses a coffee grinder. blanch and then put in a bowl with a cover and shake.  the trick works with peeling garlic so should be worth a tryThere is food that is fit for people to eat and food that isn't. Feeding poor people green food isn't okay. Yes it is logical. If you wouldn't serve food to someone who is paying for it then its not charitable to give it away. I always boil mine first and let them cool before frying. When it's time to fry I fry them for about 15 sec, let them rest a minute or so. The down again, 15 sec. 180 degrees C, and just doing that for like 10-15 times or so. Makes them really crispy.

When searing them, don't fuck with them by moving them around and stuff. just let them do their thing.I'm not uninformed. This is what I do for a living. Cooking things well done does not destroy toxins created by bacteria or fungus. You are just wrong and a moron. That's your opinion. If you are an industry professional and know what you are doing, it is perfectly fine. I was simply pointing out the silver lining to eating green meat which was the question. Saying all green meat is good for the trash is an evasive comment and doesn't take into account all the factors. Do your research and there is no reason you should poison yourself. I mean, I get that, but I can smell meat becoming "not fresh" a fair ways before I can smell it becoming spoiled, and I can taste the "not fresh" flavour in a casserole.

Do I have a fussy nose, or an iron stomach?Can anyone tell me how to mince lemongrass? The only stuff I can find is super woody, even from the asian grocery store.I'd utilize the ventilation system to make steaks.

You really don't understand how that works do you.

We are there to help people, and we work with people who know a little more about this subject than you do. Crawl back into your cave heathen! I'm way late, but was searching for posts about Blue Apron so I could give my 2 cents.  I love it...sometimes.  Last night's meal was a great example of when I love it.

Roasted Salmon and castelvetrona olives over roasted fennel root, onions, farro and cara cara oranges topped with a green salsa (more like a pesto with almonds, capers, garlic, and parsley), fennel fronds, and fennel pollen.

It was fantastic, and there is no way I could ever put together that meal with a) one trip to the grocery store, or 2) for under $20.

Contrast that with tonight's meal.  Beef shortrib burgers with hop cheese sauce on pretzel buns with roasted sweet potato "chips" is about $12 worth of ingredients.  Though it was so good I'll give it a pass.  Last week's turkey chili was the worst offender.  Dirt cheap, and nothing at all interesting about it.  I can make chili for about $10 and make enough for 2 weeks.  I should have skipped the week, but I waited too late to do so.A "sharpening steel" doesn't actually sharpen your knife, it just puts the edge back into alignment. Useful, but your knife will still need sharpening. I touch up the edges on my knives reasonably often (maybe once a month?) with fine and reasonably gentle methods. Currently, a diamond steel (diamond and ceramic steels sharpen instead of aligning), but in college I used the bottom of a mug. It worked surprisingly well. I have a coarse grit sharpening stone too, which is good for when someone borrows my super sharp vegetable knife and tries to use it to hack through bone.

I use Kiwi knives and like them a lot, but I would probably recommend either a specific meat cleaver (I'd pick up a blunter edged knife from an Asian market) or a more western style knife for cutting through bone. Victorinox is the commonly recommended western style knife. If you think those are good,  you should try Andrew Zimmerman's Grandma Chinese Chicken Wings.

Enjoy.
Oh i know but i get the flames up high around it which is pretty good.Bench grinder FTW. Takes a lot less time. Use a brush wheel. ok your moms coolGlazed carrots are amazing.

3 carrots cut into medallions, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 2 tsp sugar boil then simmer covered for 5

Uncover, reduce cooking liquid to 1 tbsp or so

Add 1 tbsp butter and 1tsp sugar, stir
For 2 minutes.

Remove from heat and add 1 tsp lemon juice or orange juice, salt and pepper, stir, serveThe smell test is meaningless to determine food safety actually. It only tells you spoilage and this doesn't mean the food is unsafe (though it will taste bad). Food can be unsafe and smell fine too. I'm thinking either some sort of pretzel crust or a coffee oreo type of crust. Yea, brining takes chicken to a whole new dimension. I pretty much never cook chicken, turkey or pork without an overnight brine first. It's a revelation, particularly when you start playing with brine recipes, which lets you add even more flavor dimensions to your meal ... try throwing a few star anise into a brine; the subtly of the anise undertones in the finished bird is just lovely.

;) [uninspired continuation of the joke by a second poster] [post that gives a legitimate answer and didn't read the self.post body] I can guarantee that it's not as hot as it is supposed to be, by a factor of 10.Meh mom hated cooking so im not surprised she never taught us anything about cooking.

She probably would have hated it even more if she had to teach us to do it lol

And she did waste meat when it was probably still good, but she usually cooked meat before it turned brown so thankfully she wasn't actually throwing out meat all the time.

I do wish that i'd known how to really cook earlier on, that is all, so I would have helped her more :)I've used this before and I just couldn't get behind the flavor. Something was off putting to me. But it's been a couple years, so I'll have to try it again! It's my first time hosting a family dinner, so I'm going a little ambitious. I am doing a leg of lamb, a slow cooker ham (not everyone likes lamb), roasted potatoes, perogies, creamed leeks, honey glazed carrots.I have a gas stove that has cast iron grate that comes off so i just set a small wok right on top of the cast iron puck that directs the flame and it works beautifully. I just have to do it in 1-2 serving batchesOh that sounds absolutely delicious. Thanks for the suggestion!I fucking love Pok Pok's chicken wings. Holy shit, they are so fucking good. We started avoiding glass cutting boards awhile ago because we saw some knife care tips from Alton Brown where he explained how bad they were for your knives. I can't find it right now, but a quick Google search shows a lot of other results where people do not recommend glass boards because they dull your knives much more quickly.

Maybe someone else here can give you a more concrete answer, but I'd say it's not a giant leap to say that your board is dulling your knife quickly.Bingo this is gonna be one of the things I make. Sounds damn tasty! Lol, I actually have some rabbits in the freezer and we saved the ears for some reason. Beautiful in its simplicity. Sounds delicious!  What crust are you thinking?turning green with envy in 3,2,1 ...Yeah that's what I love about cheesecakes you could throw just about anything in them and they will be delicious. I'm thinking a chocolate raspberry cheesecake is gonna be one of the things I make.What about hot-smoking some fish (almost any fish will do) over tea-leaves, and serving it on a bed of homemade, rustic celery-root and potato mash, steam some broccoli, and make a raw salad of grated carrot, cucumber and radish or something?

Or maybe you could make fish gratin? Get some cod or pollock or something, make a mornay sauce, cook some macaroni, steam some peas and some carrot that cut into small dice, mix it all together, put it in an oven proof container, and sprinkle on panko crumbs and pop it in the oven. Steam some vegetables as a side dish? This does mean boiling the potato though.

Make a nice seafood chowder maybe?

How about buying a whole salmon or trout, clean the fish by removing the scales, remove the innards, but keep the head, tail and the skin on. Then you smother the entire thing inside and out with butter and herbs, and stick a few wedges of lemon in the body cavity, then you wrap the entire thing in tinfoil and you cook it in the oven until it's done, then you can just run your knife gently along the backbone from head to tail, and you can flip the entire cooked fillet, no bones to deal with, onto a serving tray, and then you can gently lift the entire skeletal structure complete with head and tail, leaving another skin-side-down, boneless fillet. It all tastes quite nicely, and you can serve it with whatever you like?

What about making some gravlax wraps? Get or make some tortillas, smear one side with cream cheese, and cover it with a nice crunchy lettuce. add slices of gravlax (cured salmon) thinly sliced red onion, tomato, maybe a little bit of dill for garnish, and roll it all up, then cut it into bitesize segments, poke a toothpick through them so they stay intact, stand them on one end, and place a little dollop of potato salad on the end facing upwards. Organize them around the edges of a platter, with the center being occupied by a raw salad of shredded vegetables maybe?[this](http://www.hungryinhogtown.com/hungry_in_hogtown/2007/03/earresistible_e.html) is done as a savory appetizer, but maybe you can make it sweet instead, maybe cinnamon sugar?Consider making a plate of deviled eggs, too, if you're up for it.

* Everyone loves deviled eggs!
* They're great for a BBQ (you can even use smoked paprika to stay with the smoked theme, also because it's delicious).
* Mac and cheese, potato salad, and fruit salad are all pretty carby. Being able to pop a deviled egg or two will give a hit of straight protein/fat that will help with satiety.You have a recipe for this one?  It sounds too sweet, but intriguing. The infidel knows what's up here.^Cheesecake. It's impressive, but very easy to do in a water bath. It's also the gift that keeps giving because there are so many variations. In spring, I like to do some sort of berry cheesecake.I think you left out the vinegar in that list (apple cider maybe?), but sounds good. I think the avocado:quinoa/bean ratio is too high though; 1 avocado per 1.5 or 2 cups each quinoa and black beans might be better. I would also use avocado oil instead of olive oil. Maybe ancho peppers in the vinaigrette instead of Tapatio too.Make balsamic brussel sprouts. This recipe is OK but you probably want to double the balsamic.

http://www.onceuponachef.com/2009/11/roasted-brussels-sprouts.htmlThis right here. Shepherd's pie is heavy, fatty and starchy. You want something fresh, with some crunch and some acid to contrast.A sharp cleaver will only set you back about $20 and is great for hacking up big cuts of meat as well as chopping etc. The general rule of thumb is to start with a German knife while you are learning and then move to a Japanese one once you have your knife skills down (sharpen it with a wetstone not a steel)

A chef's knife will do almost everything and that is the knife you want to invest in. I currently use http://www.amazon.com/Yoshihiro-Cutlery-Hammered-Damascus-8-Inch/dp/B00D6DVTM6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427894541&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yoshihiroMight want to head over to /r/kitchenconfidentialI read this in the voice of Bumblebee Man. &gt;Will leaving it sitting in the pan unbaked for a few hours "mess up" the lasagna?

Clean as u go. Stay calm and try to.flow with the groove. A good chef and his souse chef should be able to flow without talking. Its like poetry in the kitchen.Your moms a bafoonMy 2 cents, do the ginger and galangal on half the batch.

One of the main reasons I posted this was I was surprised on how good it tasted with so few - and reasonably available - ingredients.

[Pok pok's chicken wings](http://youtu.be/8-0srW14-_Y) are pretty good too.So you are poisoning people who are too poor to feed themselves . you are a fucking asshole. I tend to make mine in larger batches; 2-3 lbs. at a time. I usually use 1 egg, panko bread crumbs, chopped onion, minced garlic; and then I use whatever spices I'm feeling at the time. Sometimes it's cumin and chili powder, or worchestershire sauce. Once everything is mixed together, I'll divide them up and freeze them. I try to stick to about 1/4 lb. per patty, so they don't take long to defrost or cook. Finish them with a slice of cheese and a roasted red pepper.I dont think the fact a recipe is online makes a difference. Many baking cookbooks are aimed at the casual crowd. America's Test Kitchen who aims to help novice cooks, pretty much uses
unsalted butter exclusively. Martha stewart? Also uses unsalted butter in her baking. Watch Foodnetwork. Ina Garten will often mention good unsalted butter. Salted butter is simply more common due to its shelf life and due to the fact that most people do not bake. Plus many recipes online are adapted from cookbooks so i dont see why they are any different. Smitten Kitchen is a very popular recipe blog that adapts many recipes from books. Even All Recipes, practically the home cook's mothership, stresses unsalted butter as seen in [this video.](http://m.allrecipes.com/video/519/battle-of-the-butter-salted-vs-unsalted/) Granted most recipes wont suffer from salted butter but if you're making something butter heavy such as brioche or croissants, salted is a definite no no. There is just too much variance in salt content across brands, which is why all of these sources recommend unsalted butter when baking.Well-played.....You're probably right about the charcoal. I did mine over charcoal because my gas grill is broken right now. But you're right for the best results I'd go charcoal every time.Demi glac Looks great! I'm going to make this tonight with some ginger and galangal added.Thanks! Can't wait to try this out.

My favorite way to eat turkey burgers is Greek style - with red pepper, red onion, feta cheese and seasoning added to the meat mixture. I top them with Greek yogurt,  tomato and cucumber and serve on flatbread or pita bread.They can be really really good and are pretty easy to make. You'll have lots of pieces of the cauliflower left, so you'll might want to plan a soup or salad on the following days.&gt; Halloumi and figs skewered on rosemary branches

omgAs I mentioned it's a good way to make yourself sick if it's not "Just oxidization" and your advice is bad.Veg for 14 years and I love portobellos still, but... very few omnivores do a very good job with them. I make portobellos for myself a lot and they're delicious, but when I have them at restaurants or parties they're usually under-seasoned, under-cooked, or both.

I would never tell someone in person, "don't make a portobello for me, you'll probably suck at it." Obviously. But if someone on reddit is asking for advice I think it's a fair comment to make. People generally want to make food their guests will enjoy. The point that portobellos are the vegetarian go-to for people who don't know how to cook for vegetarians is valid and useful information to have.

All this said, a portobello stuffed with smoked cheese sounds amazing.A shotgun works better tilapia is also very mild.  as is mahi mahiThanks for sharing, chicken in the video looks great!

Gotta cook this over charcoal though, gas fire simply won't do it justice.If you're going to do that, you may as well make a proper zabaione, and not use any kind of "mix." Even better, a proper English trifle!Grilling pineapples with cinnamon is great.

If you can have an oven then a recipe like [this](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/roasted-brussels-sprouts-recipe2.html) is pretty great.

Grilled corn on the cob is pretty great too!

If you really wanted to impress then you could try making pasta from scratch. It's labor-intensive but doesn't require that much experience. I don't know; it's totally optional. that makes me very nervious also I don't think the lox would be good after being cooked that long This recipe is from Stephanie Alexander (Australia's cooking Queen)

From scratch, fell free to adjust as necessary.

For the Bolognese:

1 onion, finely chopped

1 stick celery, finely sliced

2 cloves garlic, finely chopped

2 tablespoons olive oil

400g minced beef

100g pancetta or smoked steaky bacon but into small pieces

2 teaspoons plain flour

1/2 cup dry white wine

Salt

Freshly ground black pepper

Freshly ground nutmeg

2 cups veal or chicken stock or tomato juice

4 ripe tomatoes peeled, seeded and chopped or 1 400g can peeled

2 tablespoons tomato paste

1 large thyme sprig

1 bay leaf

Directions for sauce:
saut onions, celery and garlic in oil in a large saucepan until softened. Add minced meat and pancetta and fry until meat breaks into small lumps. Sprinkle in flour, then stir well. Add wine, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mix well, then increase heat and boil to evaporate liquid. Add stock, tomato, tomato paste and herbs. Reduce heat again and simmer for 1 hour, stirring from time to time. Taste for seasoning.

Bechamel sauce:

600 ml milk

60g butter

60g flour

Salt

White pepper

Freshly ground nutmeg


Directions for bechamel:
Heat milk to scalding point and set aside. Melt butter in another saucepan and stir in flour. Cook, stirring until you have a smooth golden paste. Gradually work in the hot milk and stir until sauce thickens and is very smooth. Continue stirring until sauce boils. Cook a further 10 minutes with pan on a simmer mat over a gentle heat. Season to taste.

For the Lasagne:

Olive oil

4 lasagne sheets or layers

1 quantity Bolonese sauce

1 quantity bechamel sauce

Freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 180C. Oil and oval or oblong baking dish and line with a sheet of pasta. Cover pasta with a quarter of the bechamel, then cover with a third of the Bolognese. Add a second layer of pasta, another portion of bechamel, more Bolonese and then a third sheet of pasta. Cover with the last of the bechamel, the last of the Bolognese and the remaining pasta sheet. Top with the grated Parmesan and drizzle with oil. Bake until bubbling and golden, about 45 minutes.

Edit: attempted to fix formatting.
I use this recipe as a base for my lasagne, IMHO leaving the last pasta sheet on top tends to make it dry, I use a bit of pasata on top of the sheet before I add the cheese, I also add mozzarella cheese as well as Parmesan, but I'm a heathen. I can cook on a grill or on a stove. Our stove however is induction, and I can't set the heat to high on the frying pans or it damages them.Tuna steak is expensive but the texture is relatively similar to red meat. Like, no one will be fooled into thinking it's steak or whatever, but it genuinely tastes good itself and it's a reasonable substitute.

Are you going to be cooking on a grill or a stove or what?

[This is the one](http://www.theartofcooking.org/chinese-american-recipes/chinese-brown-sauce-base-sauce-mother-sauce-or-kung-po-sauce/), in the comments he gives his restaurant version which has more stuff in it, I use a sort of mix of the two. I'm not familiar with this kombu but I'm gonna have to check that out. I don't know if you have a world market nearby, or some sort of specialty grocery, but that's where I found the marmite.ChickPea and Quinoa salad.

Cook some Quinoa, let cool.  Dump a can of drained chick peas in with it,  stir in some chopped cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and whatever veg you have on hand, like carrots and whatever.  toss in a vinegrette of lemon juice, olive oil and salt and pepper, voila.
Your dairy Queen had a flat top? Mine just had a thing you put the frozen burgers on and they came out cooked the other end. Scottish!I think the problem is that people assume that you want some sort of meat substitute, rather than something that actually tastes good.Agree. As I was reading that, I was wondering the cost of  putting together a spinach, kale, roasted beets, radishes, tomatoes, wheat berry salad, with chickpeas, sunflower seed and some good parm and a nice dressing salad, on top of the cost of the other dishes being served.

Edit: I forgot the arugula!A little late to the party, but try a vegetarian lasagne. They're so good the meat-eaters will want some too.I think it's jenni-o that makes a ground turkey with itallian seasoning and it is awesome for burgers, cook slow on low flame.My Big Green Egg gets way hot... Pizza is awesome in therei didn't downvote you, but it really seems you're splitting hairs. obviously I didn't mean not a single person in all of the 1.6 billion people ever eats dimsum. Just wanted OP to see that standard mainland Chinese cuisine and canto cuisine are NOT one and the same.

mainland cuisine is extremely awesome and delicious but very different from cantonese cuisine and OP should explore both for sure.Boil them first to cook them. Freeze them. Then cook them in oil.

It makes a much better fry

Freezing is important because it changes the texture of the center thanks to ice crystals breaking up starch pockets. It also slightly dehydrates the outer edge so they get crispier.Plus the recharge costs a lot I'm guessing. Owner won't be happy. Cut to a shot of OP running around the kitchen engulfed in flame. :)As I mentioned below, there are plenty of charities that cook with green meat, because it's cheaper and if done safely will not make you sick. Also is your green meat is frozen, it is likely due to oxidation over time not bacterial growth. This one is so easy it's basically cheating but MY GOD is it heavenly.  It's best topped with a chocolate ganache.

"Fourth down and bundt cake"

1 box devils food cake mix

1 1/2 cups sour cream

3/4 cup vegetable oil

1/2 cup Kahlua

2 eggs, beaten with fork

1  3.4 ounce package instant vanilla pudding

Powdered sugar

Mix together first six ingredients with a big spoon and leave lumpy.
Bake at 350 degrees in a greased and floured bundt cake pan for 45 minutes. Cool.
Dust top with powdered sugar.My suggestion is to not make any special dishes for the vegetarian, but to make sure there are plenty of dishes that are vegetarian friendly.  Nobody wants to feel like they are being singled out for special treatment.  But if you let them know that there is a potato side and a vegetable side and a bread or fruit or whatever side, where they can fill up their plate, they'd be happy.  They most likely don't want a special main dish made for them.Yes, I do. I work at a food bank and we frequently donate green meat to charities. The meat in its whole isn't bad, and they will use most of it to feed those who can't put food on their plates every day. Just because you won't eat something doesn't mean it's bad. It's actually a pretty big deal for hosts who want to accommodate vegetarians and vegans.  It's easy to say that you don't expect any special treatment (and thereby dissolve yourself of any stress and responsibility), but a good host will still feel the pressure of having to find a suitable alternative meal for you. It's almost double duty for a host when a vegetarian is attending - despite their claims of not being a bother. People want to make you feel welcome.  They don't want someone at their event who is not able to eat.

And then people say they are just so over portobellos. But they're not picky. But they'd rather have a vegetarian chilli.  But they're not picky.  Maybe an arugula, spinach, kale, roasted beets, radishes, tomatoes, wheat berry salad, with chickpeas, sunflower seed and some good parm and a nice dressing would be nice.  But hey we don't want to put anyone out.

I am vegetarian and these kinds of comments make me understand why people hate vegetarians.
Duck fat.The problem and advantage of ground turkey is that it didn't have much fat in it.

This could be very against fire code depending on where he lives.  He would need to look in to that before he does anything like that.  Or mushrooms. Both add the effects of msg without being msg. Since we figured out how to farm them,  shitakes have become crazy cheap. You could just throw mushrooms in the smoker with 1 hour left, above the meat so there aren't drippings. Smoked potatoes, sweet onions, asparagus, corn are all great.True this. I was browsing down and didn't see the legume quiche. The crust has eggs and the filling has cream/cheese/eggs also.Can confirm. HALOUMIIIIIIIIDo you have a link to that brown sauce recipe? I've been looking for a decent stir fry sauce Deep fried Mars Bars all round!!

Or is that just an Aussie thing?#####&amp;#009;

Suggestions:
1) cut-up veggies with an acidic dip
2) sliced apples or pears
3) apple/pear sauce
4) [piccalilli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccalilli)I'm fresh out of penises? Shall I borrow someone else's to wrap or substitute?Yeah, so it's misleading to say nobody in mainland China eats dim sum. Not  pulling your leg.  Been here for almost six years eating Chinese food. Dim sum is a Cantonese thing and mainland is overwhelmingly mandarin except for those Cantonese pearl river delta cities pointed  out already. Coffee brownie + banana slices quickly heated in some butter and quenched with your favourite liquor + vanilla ice cream + toasted hazelnut and caramel sprinkles.

You can make everything except the banana slices ahead of time.They definitely do...It works fine.  People have done it forever.  Google it if you're not willing to do exactly what you described without recipe confirmation.

Frankly don't bother putting them in the oven. Sear them turn down the heat and put a lid on, checking and turning on the stove.  It's just thighs.I swear my grandma's recipe is made to be better cold.  Picnic, breakfast, desert?  yes please.Unless you have too much money and want to buy a $500 knife, Victorinox is the answer.From least work to most work:

1. Don't put the cottage cheese and eggs in. It ruins lasagnas in my opinion. Lasagna shouldn't be a cottage cheese omelette, but delicious melted cheese.
2. Make a bechamel sauce and add it to the layers.
3. Make the meat sauce from scratch.
4. Make the pasta from scratch.

You can add msg to the meat sauce, whether it helps depends on the quality of your tomatoes. If you have good quality ripe tomatoes you don't need it. You will already get a lot of savoury flavour from the browned meat and the parmesan too.**Before you do anything else, Find out what kind of veg she is.**

 It would suck to go to a bunch of effort to find out that she doesn't eat cheese or something similar. It also really makes it awkward when someone makes you a special dish that you can't eat.

Vegan - no animal products

Standard Vegetarian aka ovo lacto (unless you are European) - dairy, eggs ok, but some veggies don't eat cheese because of rennet.

Pescatarian - fish only

Flexatarian - as they see fit.

As for actual food items, don't do portable mushrooms and think of something filling that isn't cheese. Chili is always a winner (if you go this route, get some TVP and put in it), falafel and hummus, veggie burgers, gnocci, a nice grilled panini, maybe even soup in a bread bowl. If you want to get fancy, look up Seitan, tempeh or tvp. Those are meat analogues that are high in protein and filling.I hear carb cleaner's amazing for that.I couldn't agree more. Portobello is fine and all but it sure isn't the treat that the meat eaters seem to think it is for me. Veggie chilli is a great suggestion, it can be customized for the audience (spicy or no? Which veggies? Sweeter or more savory?) and is not a huge chore to make, esp in a slow cooker.&gt; Since you have vegetables at your disposal, try to perfect your knife skills.

He said he was going to be a prep cook so I'm sure he'll get plenty of practice. We are a pie family, so if I don't show up with at least two pies, I get in trouble. I always make a seasonal fruit pie, and my latest favorite is banoffee pie (trendy in the UK in the 70s, trendy in the US now)Even with a range hood, depending on the set-up, a flambe could easily set off the fire suppression system if the flames got too high.  And while there really wouldn't be a danger of burning the place down, cleaning up a commercial fire suppression system is one hell of a big job.  I've done it.  Not fun.What's drawing you to the cooking world?Whats not to like?

Got the cream... Good!

Got the jello... Good!

Got the beef... Good!Saganaki (a firm cheese that is pan-seared) is one of my fav greek dishes.  In a restaurant, they'll set the whole thing on fire and put out the flames with a squirt of lemon.  It's fantastic showmanship, and tasty food.  Not strictly a main, but still technically 'vegetarian'.

Veggie kebobs are decent.  Grilled eggplant is better.

...and virtually everything on this list looks good:

http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-recipe/vegan-friendly-bbq-and-grilling-recipes

Olive oil, whole grain mustard, honey, lime juice or sriracha, minced shallots, garlic powder, oregano, pepper. Grilled, then topped with cheddar or boursin. This is my go-to dessert every year. Love it! Makes me think of Easter. :)I don't think it needs Parmesan- add too many ingredients and it may get muddled.Honey mustard glazed ham, with thyme scalloped potatoes, dill green beans, and garlic carrots. Blueberry pie and white cake for dessertI'd be happy with a baked portobello mushroom, or  griddled aubergine with a pesto and pine nut dressing. No recipes from me, but make sure you understand the "why"s of cooking. Not the numbers, but the actual steps behind the recipes.

Learn the techniques. How to make a roux, how to boil, how and with what to de-glaze a pan.... binging on Chef John's videos (@Youtube, search "foodwishes") helped me a lot.

For example, let's say you're trying to make a pizza. The first time you do it, you can perhaps take a look at the numbers to get a feel for the recipe. If you like it, then take note of other things. Instead of exactly 105 degrees F, water that is warmer than your hand, yet not so hot that you can't keep your hand in the water. Instead of exactly two and a quarter cups of flour for the dough, two cups to start, and adding gradually until the correct consistency. You get the idea.

Some people swear by the numbers. Exactly 50g of this, 2.23kg of that... that's robot cooking. That's no fun, and a hassle to measure out, in my eyes.

Further along the way, you should also become familiar with ingredients. What each does, the flavor profiles of each, and what-not. It's important for later on when you are exercising your own creative cooking ability.

GIANT STACKS OF GIANT PANCAKES!!


That's what we do in the kitchen I work at when there's extra batter. Use the flat top and a pizza spatula to flip it.


We found it works best if you thin out the batter a bit to keep it from getting too fluffy and not cooking all the way through.Grilled zucchini,  onions, mushrooms, and red pepper served in a hogie roll dressed with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and Italian dressing. Has the mouthfeel of a cheesesteak and is very filling.Dimsum rocks and OP should definitely get some when he can.  I totally agree If you are feeling bold and have an array of spices at hand, you could try channa masala (curry chickpeas)

http://www.food.com/recipe/channa-masala-17471Roast a bunch of veggies until they're charred a bit with high heat.  Save and use later to make amazing sauces.  Make an overnight broth with the huge pots you probably have access to. Reduce the crap out them and take em home.  And like everybody else said, fry some shit. My college had a grill night about once a week. The steak was always terrible: chewy, overcooked, and poor quality to begin with. So everyone fought over the portobello mushrooms instead, which were actually very tasty, if not amazingly filling. You may also want to look into Taiwanese food. It's very much it's own thing in a lot of ways, and a lot of it's delicious.http://www.reddit.com/r/VegRecipes/top/Fair enough. Since you were replying to a post about dim sum being "what Chinese people eat when they go out" I guess that makes sense. I just have memories of good dimsum on the mainland too so it kind of jumped out at me...I'm working all day this year (yay, waitressing) but if I weren't, lamb braised with rosemary and wine, mashed potatoes, sauteed green beans, and coconut cake for dessert. Wrap must be around your penis, otherwise the hand in water doesn't work.http://www.myspicesage.comDo you have a permission to do this? Do you have training to run all these machineries? First off, make sure the potato salad and fruit salad are vegetarian, or vegan, ovo-lacto, or whatever she will eat. Side dishes are essential for veg-heads when the main is outside of their diet. If you're not exactly sure about her dietary restrictions, ask her. Maybe she doesn't like white sugar, or maltodextrin.

Second, instead of trying to come up with a extra substitute for the main dish that a vegetarian can eat, try to make two main dishes and one of them is vegetarian. Nobody wants to be stuck with afterthought baked beans when everybody else is eating the main event. Make sure to make a enough of the veg dish so that the omnivores don't eat all of it if it's too tasty!

See all the other comments in this thread for suggestions of a second main dish that is vegan/vegetarian.

You can ask her if she wants to bring a dish. I guarantee she'll appreciate the chance to cook up her best recipe and serve it to the rest of the family.

And finally, go for ethnic. Vegetarians love Thai food, and Indian, Jamaican, Iranian, and everything else. Look up some recipes on epicurious.com.Grilled stuffed mushrooms? What's the seasoning for your smoked tri tip? Similar flavor profile for the mushrooms?

Hearty, umami bombs.

Side with grilled egg plants, asparagus, bell peppers?



DEEP FRY ALL THE THINGS!cold fried chicken is too good. Fuck. This kind of retardation is what is wrong with people today. There is no way you fucking believe what you typed out. How about some bbq ranch sweet potato pizza? [here's a recipe] (http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/09/barbecue-ranch-sweet-potato-pizza.html)I think im going with mac &amp; cheese.  Everyone will enjoy it, I can make it ahead, and she wont feel singled out.  I've always hated the whole 'hey were having a feast over here!  Enjoy your bean urger!' Thing that happens.  :(Can you spare enough grill space for an eggplant? A real live baba is way better than humus.

There's always the big ol' fuck off everything-in-the-fridge, serve it yur-damned-self salad bar. Add grilled veggies to make it pop.

Shit, put a bloody bar right next to it.

Or a cast iron pan [prizza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mldDHI9l1v8). You can prepare that shit beforehand. Save you some minutes.

Just a thought 'er two.This sounds amazing - thank you!Ha!  Yeah, i love grilled and smoked veggies.  Throw them on while the meat rests and use the left overs for salad.  :-)Ive smoked corn - usually about 15 minutes or so.  The smoked cabbage sounds amazing though.  I am a total cabbage junkie.  :-)Deep fryer?  I'd make up a bunch of fried chicken and take it home.  It's also good cold.I am 90% certain I'm using this.  Thank you!Lol ur welcome. But for real, get the thinnest metal spatula u have. Drizzle a little oil on the pan so that the bottom of the taters are touching some oil. Turn the spatula upside down and get in there, gently and slowly. Work it. Who fuckin cares anyway? They're baked potatoes. Baked/grilled eggplant with a Parmesan crust and diced Roma tomatoes. Add some basil pesto and add some cream cheese. Treat the eggplant Ike you might bruschetta here. Too good!
Spinach artichoke dip with pita bread is phenomenal too. Especially if home made with Roma tomatoes and a good helping of garlic.U r dumb. I don't have anything that will help you right this minute (sorry), but for the future the can wrap the potatoes in foil and put them straight on the oven rack.  Works great.  I love to do it that way, but put a little butter and salt on them first.Try gently removing them with a egg turnerok right..my point is it's a perl river delta/canto thing and not eaten in most of China as an everyday cuisine.[Pineapple Upside-down Cake.](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pineapple-upside-down-cake) it's pretty simple and super delicious. My sister hates pineapple and she had two pieces of this last time I made it.HALOUMIIIIIIIIThanks for bringing this up! I'm not vegetarian but I'm going to have to try this. And a layer of ground beef sauted with peas and onions. I made some tapioca pudding from scratch recently, and have now made it about half a dozen times.  I used the recipe on the bag of tapioca pearls.  (Bob's Red Mill, recipe on their website too).  Serve it cold with berries in warm weather or warm and freshly prepared in cold weather.  It was amazing and simple.Greek yoghurt, BBQ sauce, sirachi chilli sauce. Mix and eat with anything. Never turn back. My mum brought me tons of spices in little pouches from India when she visited. So I don't have to worry about this for a while **:P**

But yeah. The markup on conveniences like this *can* be extremely high. The pub down the street serves it with a salad: mesclun, candied pecan chunks, craisins, cherry tomato halves, and a cheese I haven't figured out (something like a cross between mascarpone and feta), all in a tart vinaigrette.  It's a solid contrast: the salad is crisp, tart, and pungent next to the rich, savory shepherd's pie.If you're a pretty good cook, then start learning the tips and tricks in the restaurant. The chefs usually can teach you more if you shadow them or show an interest. As for what you should do? Maybe try and focus on basic skills. Since you have vegetables at your disposal, try to perfect your knife skills. The easiest way to learn more about cooking is by studying a certain topic. Learn what the restaurant has to teach and then start looking into different cuisines. A good progression is to start with soups. By the way NoraTC is right about doing it too often. That's why I suggested shadowing the chefs.Most of the stuff you learn in the kitchen. What you need on your first day is a pocket note pad, pen, and sharpie. A pad of paper is actually great for any job to start so you can take notes. Most people can understand having to explain things. In a kitchen things should only be explained once. Your answers should be as simple as yes, no, or rather blunt. The answer "well sort of but really no" are the quickest way for someone to go Gordon Ramsey on you. Also, you should expect some rather crude behavior. Now it can depend on company culture, but most places I have worked chefs can give sailors a run for their money. It's all about experience so just hang in there. The first day can be rough but you just need to power through it.Freezing doesn't kill the bacteria. Since it wasn't thawed, you could've  just thawed it on the counter and cooked it for dinner.

You're fine just thaw it out overnight in the fridge. You're good to go.Alton Brown did an episode with green bean casserole, from scratch. The recipe is online and it's life changing. I've made it for every single holiday since I found it. It has a lot of steps and ingredients but, it's totally worth it. He tells you how to make the "fried onions" too.Donut.bread.puddin. Shutsb it down every time.Anyone said grilled tofu?

My veg friend told me the key is to buy extra firm and then press it with like a plate and a heavy soup can on top of it to help get rid of excess moisture.

Smoked tofu is also a thing I believe.

Oh and if you do end up making portobellos make sure you cook them a long time. Mushroom are just full of water and the extra cook time pays off. when one taste is overwhelming, the only way to fix it for sure is the volume up on all other ingredients except the offending one.

And it being "not that great" deosn't help us troubleshoot your recipe.

You should link the recipe so we can look at what's missing. &gt;There were also green lettuce like stripes. They were dark green.

Since  everyone  else  guessed "basil", I'll just mention -

**arugula**  (salad rocket, rucola, rucoli, rugula, roquette)  is also excellent on  bruschetta  or any similar dish.  (e.g. pizza)

Well  worth  trying!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruca_sativa#UsesThis is a great response. Sure they do. In like Guangzhou or all the other Cantonese-speaking parts of Southern China. It's not a Northern thing for sure though.I think you're looking at this from only one perspective.

Yes, it is very nice to accommodate someone who is vegetarian. However, when you provide something special for them that they don't like (which is always a risk with something polarising), the vegetarian feels incredibly guilty that you went to the trouble. And if the provider finds out the vegetarian doesn't like it, they feel frustrated, sad, disappointed, etc. So two people feel bad, which is the opposite of the desired outcome. Bagel and lox bread pudding? I can't tell if this is a good idea or not.it's consistently good. tubeplus.me has a bunchof episodes.

Check it out and decideAsk yourself what your favourite foods are. Learn how to make those first. Even complicated-sounding recipes are manageable once you understand them. Youtube is actually a great resource for this. Understood and provisionally agree regarding individuals' preferences -- though wish to state that proteins (meat-molecules) are far too long, therefore far too heavy, to be carried by the heat and smoke to infect non-meats in the smoker (they are non-volatile, in other words).  This is based on my molecular biology minor.  **However** -- yeah personal prejudices may well override any knowledge of basic physics....  (plus, if one were keeping kosher, then having the veg touch the same *grating* that previously held meat could certainly be a game-ender; I dunno if heat alone can render treyf into non-treyf)This is what I do as well. You need at least 3 recipes to understand what goes in and for how long.Also that only in hk. Mainland Chinese don't eat dimsum. Check out the blackstone pizza oven and my posts in /r/pizzaIf you wanted to get super Eastery, you could always make chocolate truffle Easter Eggs and bring them in a grapevine nest.  Doubles as centerpiece and dessert!  I made them for work one year.. a bit time consuming, but very impressive.  Basically, blow out a dozen white eggs, then boil them to sterilize, dye with food colouring, and then fill with your favorite truffle flavors.  Refrigerate upside down until truffle sets, then set in your "nest" and present :)I really don't think the MSG is necessary, and I would put the veggies right in it. You can let it sit for a bit before you cook it, it should be fine. Instead of having the veggies on the side a nice light salad would compliment lasagna nice. Good luck! I too am on mobile, but I second this. I use a recipe for southern baked mac n cheese from divascancook.com (use your Google powers). Add a little extra paprika and onion powder. And more cheese because cheese. Make plenty because the meat eaters will love it too (the paprika + smoked cheddar makes it bacon-y).They're wondering if they should post food that's stereotypically Japanese and popular among foreigners now, ha ha[This](http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Cutlery-10-Inch-Curved-Breaking/dp/B0019WSLHC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427861370&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=victorinox+cimeter) is what I use. Get the biggest one you have storage room for: the longer it is, the easier it is to get through a cut in one motion (plus the weight of the blade does a lot of work for you). Keep in mind that this style of knife cuts best on the drawstroke, it can take some getting used to. *ETA If you don't like that, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Butcher-Black-Fibrox-10/dp/B000MD9IG2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427862460&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=victorinox+butcher) is another good option.*

You might also want a boning knife for trimming off silverskin.Popcorn. Butter. Salt.  Alot of vegetarians look for protein in an entree and folks who don't ordinarily follow or prepare a vegetarian diet tend to serve protein-less side-dish type dishes. Remember that there are a lot of dishes out there that just *happen* to be vegetarian (tho not vegan) without having to resort to wheat grass and berries.

Try traditional cheese manicotti (or baked ziti if you want an easier dish). Cheesey pasta dishes with rich tomato sauces satisfy many vegetarians and is welcome comfort food with protein and some satisfying richness.This might be a little late, but if you are making the tomato sauce yourself , add anchovies when you are sweating the onions. It won't taste like anchovies but it definitely adds an additional layer of savory.Japanese speaker here.  Checked Google translation.  It works for these two (just to let you know "cool" translate to kuuru ;)Well I love my victoronox. As for a grinder I suggest you find a professional in your area. They can do it better and usually you only need it done once or twice a  year. I prefer shiitake mushrooms on a skewer. Grill till almost burnt, and serve with any sauce you like. So good!!!Cool thanks. I actually have metal skewers but was feeling lazy and picked up some premade chicken, pepper, and onion skewers from the market.

I'll try brining next time though, thanks!If you get a chance, cook your breakfast on a flat top. I used to work at a dairy queen and I'd fry up two eggs and two beef patties for breakfast every saturday morning. 3 slices of bacon on a buttered grilled bun. Oh god, I've actually made myself miss working at dairy queen...Well I think if she wants to she should anyway. I mean either speak up or be thankful that someone considered you at their husbands party.

If I can give one bit of advice: metal skewers and use a baking sheet. Place chicken-laden skewers across baking sheet, place under grill with no more (NO MORE!!) that six inches between the grill and the meat.

I do chicken tikka this way and it is perfectly cooked, juicy and slightly charred.

Actually, one more bit of advice: brine the chicken first. It will be juicer in the end, and far more resilient to the direct heat of the grill.Here are a few more --  the Pizza was especially tasty  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F59hFZIzhxFxcgQ0FspCNya3YYFmVjD  Screaming hot ovens = perfect Napoli-style pizzas ... I would kill for an oven that would go beyond 500 ...I always offer. Many people I know insist on providing something. At this point family and close friends know I don't eat those things or let me bring my own dish, but not always. I always appreciate the gesture, but those products make me want to vomit and plenty of other vegetarians feel the same way. Which is why I recommended OP not go that route without knowing her SIL enjoys them. That's not what I mean. Usually there's some sort of carb for everyone already like rice or bread.
Some great vegetarian dishes are chickpea curry (honestly any indian vegetarian food), grilled portobellos with asiago, stuffed peppers, cheese tortellini salad, omelettes.

Even stir-fried tofu is really good. I don't see why non-vegetarians think I want my tofu to look like meat.

You could always tell the host "hey Ill bring a vegetarian dish so dont worry about me". I mean either suck it up or speak up. How is anyone to know your preference? and if they try to accomodate, I mean how sweet is that?&gt; nice white wine to deglaze

mm yes. white wine, butter, garlic. combine with pasta and scallops... sooo good and so easy.this is an interesting idea... use half the pan space then move to the other side. I will try it out next time!I've been vegetarian almost my whole life, in large part because I hate the taste of meat. I've spent so many barbecues miserably choking down fake meat that hosts prepared for me (with the best intentions). I would never assume a vegetarian guest wanted an imitation meat product unless I knew for certain that they ate them. Make sure you thoroughly dry the scallops before putting them in the pan.

Typically I like to use the ration of 3/1 for pan size to scallop ratio. I start the scallops on one side of the pan to give a good sear, then flip them to the other side, that is still hot and "dry" and sear them on that side. I then deglaze the pan. Try sprinkling a bit of nutmeg on them before you sear. It adds a great flavor that pairs with scallops well and helps to carmelize the surface.[I made this yesterday and my mouth is still on fire.](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/03/sichuan-wonton-chili-oil-suanla-chaoshou-recipe.html).  But in general, I love a good Sichuan restaurant, plus the site I linked as a lot of other great Chinese recipes.Stupid first of April! I want one! Got to admit- as a veg for 12 years, I am so over portobello mushrooms being the go to meat alternative. They're not usually cooked well, and wind up slimy. A great said always wins. Arugula, spinach, kale, roasted beets, radishes, tomatoes, wheat berry salad, chickpeas, sunflower seeds, some good parm and a nice dressing...much more interesting.

Veg chili is a good suggestion, too! Or soup. Joy of cooking' lentil soup is a standby for me.

Edit- props for asking and being accommodating. I'm also not one to expect anything special for my dietary choices, but I do love when there are options. Very thoughtful! Hmm well I wouldnt want to offend. I was vegetarian for 8 years, but I actually appreciated it when people tried to accomadate me with stuff other than just carb loaded dishes like pasta. Mash some sweet potatoes with jalapeos, green onions and parmesan and put a big scoop inside some portobellos. That'll fill the gap.Chickpea curry!I can't speak for others, but I ate vegetarian for over 10 years, and it's incredibly annoying when people think that I want food that attempts to taste/look like meat.Food definitely tastes better when it's humanely prepared. I realized after posting that I was coming at this more from the point of view of a casual baker, and not the more serious hobbyist or professional point of view that most people on this sub are coming from.

I wasn't thinking of baking books,  but rather about Internet recipes. Most of those are aimed at the casual baker, who uses the ingredients on hand. Most people buy salted butter, so most of the online recipes assume salted butter. So with enough plastic wrap, I should be okay, right?**Avocado, quinoa, and black bean salad.**
*You will need:*
* 1 cup cooked quinoa
* 1 cup cooked black beans
* 1 cup sweet corn
* 1/2 large red onion, diced
* 1 large bell pepper, diced
* 1 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced in halves
* 1-2 large avocados, pits removed and diced
* 1 lime, juiced
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 1 handful fresh cilantro, chopped
* (optional) salty crumbly cheese, such as feta or cotija
* Hot sauce of choice (I prefer Tapatio for this recipe)

In a large bowl, combine first seven ingredients. In a separate cup, whisk together the fruit juices, hot sauce, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Just before serving, dress the salad with your lime vinaigrette, and add the chopped cilantro. Stir well to ensure that all ingredients are fully incorporated. If desired, garnish with cheese.Lots of delicious sounding choices. Here's my suggestion- stuffed red or orange bell pepper with grains &amp; beans and a crusty cheese topping (can be cooked in crockpot and cheese added under broiler to crisp) and romaine heart salad with shredded carrots, olives &amp; buttermilk dressing. Sliced cucumbers with umeboshi  vinegar.
As a vegetarian, I am routinely served a portobello mushroom as the meat alternative and always am totally happy with it. Re: all the discussion about satiety in this thread - as long as there are a number of veggie-friendly side dishes available in addition to the portobello that she can fill up on if she is hungrier than just the portobello, then I'm confident she'll be totally fine. Coconut cake is definitely a good idea, as has been mentioned. Can't go wrong with Alton Brown's recipe, which is as classic as it gets.

Or if you'd like something a little richer, Ina Garten's chocolate cake recipe has never failed to impress. Your waistline would probably hate you too if you eat it that stuff that often.Maybe, but honestly the flavor isnt bad. I didnt eat meat for 5 years and now it's been many more that I eat meat daily and boca burgers really arent bad.

In this case too bocas are quick *and* thoughtful. I actually prefer Boca burgers to real burgers, believe it or not. Maybe it's because Boca burgers can be cooked in two minutes with my microwave, ha.Grilled portobello mushroom, herbed goat cheese (tarragon, basil and parsley, for example), grilled tomato, grilled red onion, and a fried egg on grilled sourdough that has been rubbed with olive oil, lemon, and garlic... Divine. The perfect alternative for vegetarians at a barbecue.Sounds like the condolence currency Maury would give out to guys who have just heard "You ARE the father".Also, for sure, shake some shredded coconut with green food coloring to make "nests" and put tiny jelly beans in them! *Portobello Mushroom Burgers.*

If all else fails, check out [Vegan Black Metal Chef.](https://www.youtube.com/user/VeganBlackMetalChef)big flat kitchen grills that are only found in restaurant and "professional" kitchens are amazing. I've never used one personally but they look like they are fantastic to work with. especially after constantly watching all the things that can be done. just one big metal hot surface. amazing. Look for chef john of foodwishes on youtube. He has extremely easy to follow recipes, where the ingredients are the star, all while being really entertaining and having done every dish you can imagine ranging from meatballs and spagettis to fancy french cooking. Really easy to follow, common ingredients and every recipe I tried tasted wellconsider Hakka Indo-chinese food.  paneer pakoras... dry chili chicken...etc.  hot spicy food. very good.

also, dumpings !Trifle!! If you have access to fresh berries, it's the best!I've been on a baked beans kick recently and it's been wonderful. Add a little sour cream or yogurt (with fat!) on the side and bread or pita chips and it's extremely filling.Last night I used 4 cans of cannellinis one oniona big clove of garlic1/4 cup blackstrap molasses1 can diced tomatoes1 tbsp smoked paprika1/4 tsp cinnamon1/2 tsp cayenneSalt and pepper to tasteSaut onions and garlic in 1/4 cup of olive oil. Add spices, tomatoes and molasses and bring to a simmer, then add beans. Return to a simmer then transfer to 450 oven for about 20 minutes.If you use dried beans you'll need more liquid - veggie stock would work nicely - and also a lot more time. Navy beans or great northern beans can be substituted.I like a dash of worchesthire, paprika and mustard. By the way - i made this yesterday as well but in a pressure cooker instead of the oven. Good results although the skin is crispier in the oven. Still, the pressure cooker is done in like 12 mins though!1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup balsamic, 2 cloves garlic, pepper to taste - i use about 1/2 tbsp of freshly ground black pepper. This should be enough marinade for 2 legs &amp; 2 thighs. Heavy whipping cream, all whipped up (or cool whip as a cheater step), fold in a packet of pudding mix (cheesecake, vanilla or lemon), then fold in fresh raspberries, strawberries or blueberries, let set in fridge for a couple hours. Serve in a glass or with shortcake, angel cake, biscuits, brownies... Whatever sounds yummy to you.hungarian paprika stew. chop up a large onion, 3 ORANGE bell peppers, half a pound of mushrooms and brown 'em in a stock pot. Add 3 pounds of crushed tomatoes (i use romas) and 3 tablespoons of GOOD hungarian paprika ( i do 1:2 hot and regular) and salt and pepper to taste. stew for an hour or so. serve over pasta rice or spaetzle Something based around cucumbers.Make the lasagna pasta from scratch. Its stupidly easy, and you can leave it decently thick, so there isn't a ton of rolling and cutting involved. Really makes a good lasagna great.portabello caps, season with lots of salt and pepper, garlic powder, soy.
place in baking dish (cook 6), in preheated 450F oven, and roast for 1/2 or until house smells amazing.  Done.Don't put your hand into boiling water either!

It gets your hand wet. THIS.

To many omnivores, thinking in terms of vegetarian or vegan foods is like a foreign cuisine. So yeah, they probably have a staple diet of thing one might consider interesting as a non-vegetarian.I have never seen salted butter called for in recipes, especially baked goods. Pretty much every baking cookbook from Rose Levy Beranbaum(probably the most respected author of baking cookbooks today) to Momofoku Milk Bar speak to some extent about how it should always be assumed that unless stated, that unsalted butter is to be used. Bakers are pretty particular about having control in their recipes, stressing to weigh ingredients to the .1 g.salt is one of those things they like to control. Only times salted may be called for is as a condiment such as brushing biscuits or on corn on the cob. Other than that, this is actually the first time i've ever heard salted butter should be assumed. In france, pastry chefs use beurre de patisserie which has no salt. Where have you heard that salt was supposed to be assumed? Maybe some cornbread or potatoes too. Not singling her out is a great idea. Make something everyone can enjoy!Will do. Thanks!Caveat; I'm pulling this  number off the top my head. I can maybe give you a better answer later on when I'm at a computer, but for now I would doublecheck with the site like chef steps.Beans - high protein
Edamame - Very high protein
Cheese tray - medium protein
Fried TofuMoney.I keep Colbert Canyon Merlot around for everyday wine so that's the red I cook with. I buy the 4 packs of small bottles of Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc when I need a white wine. Lasts forever in the pantry. You can also buy half liter boxes.so good. i typically add pesto and goat chesse on the mushroomHundred and 80 for eight hours or so. Sorry for the funny punctuation, I'm dictating to my phone and it has trouble understanding me.Hey Kenji, for years I've been making a tasty ropa vieja in the slow cooker with corned beef brisket. For the sake of science I want to try it sous vide. What's your best guess at time/temp to get that sort of pulled pork texture?A neat thing to do would be to maybe take a vegetarian mapo tofu recipe and convert it into skewers with button mushrooms, grill until its as crisp and hot as you want it, and then brush with sauce and hit it on the grill again, and serve with more sauce on the side.

Or some kinda teriyaki tofu/pineapple skewer[This brownie pudding](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/brownie-pudding-recipe.html) or [this cranberry tart](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/cranberry-chocolate-tart-240427) are my absolute favorite desserts, both are easy to make (especially the brownie pudding). And they're out of the ordinary, so people don't expect them to be as delicious as they are.Why not just make a big pot of vegetarian chili and then everyone can enjoy it?  You get the added bonus of her not feeling singled out.My brother-in-law always makes my husband and I grilled veggies when he barbecues. His potato salad is amazing, so it helps round things out. He just makes plenty of vegetarian sides that everyone would like. One year he bought Quorn goat-cheese stuffed Chik'N patties. They were so delicious! Just the fact that he's made options specifically for us makes us happy. I don't like Portabellas, but all the sides always fill me up. Baked ham with a honey mustard glaze, Jamaican rice and peas, scalloped potatoes, fruit salad, rolls, spinach dip in a bread bowl, and deviled eggs. Possibly fried poutine poppers, depending on how overwhelmed I am. Other people are bringing desserts.We usually have a grilled leg of lamb and a Greek salad, toasted pita bread, tzatziki. We celebrate it as the equinox (understanding that the christians got the date wrong, but whatever) with this favorite barbarian feast from the dawn of civilization.2 skillets, with a nice white wine to deglaze the first one,  but scallops are crazy making until you connect with a real fish monger, who can direct your purchases.What about a smoked Mac and Cheese? Google "four cheese smoked mac and cheese (I am on mobile, I can't seem to be able to post links). That recipe blows everybody's mind every time I make it.whoaStuff a capsicum with a polenta, paprika, cheese mix. Smoke rather than bake? This also works well with a rice based stuffing.Steak is different. Firstly, steaks are often pretty sterile inside. This is how we can eat rare steak pretty safely. After all, the muscle in your body is pretty sterile. Ground beef is exposed to all sorts of bacteria which can be spread through the whole loaf.

Yeah science!I actually am very familiar with vegetarian cooking and in my experience, mushrooms aren't anywhere near substantial enough to be considered a main, since you would need an overwhelming amount of chess to have the same amount of fat. Like you said, it varies with the person, but I think it would be a better idea to prepare something more equivalent.There's a huge rage over cauliflower steaks right now! You can roast or grill them just like steaks, there's just a little different times i think for cooking. I haven't made it one before but they sound pretty good...Chicken breasts
Garlic
Turmeric
Ground mustard
Chicken broth
Salt and pepper

Rub the spices on the chicken, sear quickly in a hot pan, add the chicken to a crockpot, cover with broth and cook on low for 4 hours or on high for two hours. Super delicious, and I eat it at least once a week.[This](http://www.supercook.com/#/recipes/All%2520recipes)Crockpot egg scramble with bacon, cheese, hashbrowns.  cresent rolls, Breaded ham, and corn/peas, some type of dessert.Thank you! I made it and it turned out fantastic as always. The plus side of using the baking pan was that I was able to cook a lot of servings all at once, the original recipe was limiting on this.I live in friendship so I'm familiar. I'll have to give everyday noodles a shot. I was looking more for recipes to tryon my own thoughPeople are suggesting pasta, hummus, veggie burgers, quorn, etc., but to a vegetarian those things are either not at all special (hummus is basically the vegetarian's last option at a party) or very polarizing (some really don't like Morningstar-type products).

If you wanted to get "fancy" (like how steak is considered fancy) you could make something with an uncommon grain. Something like quinoa or amaranth. Or use some other "fancy" ingredient like avocados.That is not my experience.  A main needs to have as much fat as a meat dish to create satiety.  A smoked cheese supplies that fat element, but your experience with veg  and vegan cooking  may vary.dont crowd the pan. make sure scallops are nice and dry before searingKeep in mind that mushrooms aren't at all as filling as beef, so mushrooms can't really be a "main."I saw you were looking for book recommendations, I have a soup cookbook from the culinary institute of america, it has a run through on how to do everything in it. Soup is also a great way to start cooking. Good luck on learning to cook, and don't forget to keep your knives sharp.Dunlop is amazing. Though I preferred Land of Plenty over Every Grain of Rice. Dont have any of Yan-Kit So's books, but seeing as those books are responsible for getting Fuchsia into Chinese cooking, theres no doubt they're good.You froze it right away? Hell yeah, fire up the skillet!I don't think many vegetarians would like vegetables being actively smoked right next to meat.Edit: Or in a smoker that is used for meat in general.Unfortunately no books to recommend, I've never been big on cookbooks and learned from my mom / shows for the most part.

In terms of TV shows, if you look up Jacques Pepin, he had a TV series where he did just a wonderful job breaking down all sorts of basic kitchen skills and styles and it is awesome.Saving $10 by cooking old meat VS having to take a day or 2 off of work because your shitting uncontrolably is stupid. Even if you make minimum wage your risking a ton more money by eating the bad meat, and potentialy you could get sick enough to end up in the hospital which really isnt cost effective.


Theres no reasonable situation out side of starvation where you should take such a risk.We have lived vegetarian, pescatarian and vegan over the years.  It teaches you a lot about food, wich is good.  However, I enjoy as many species a day as possible now that I no longer have teen daughters in residence, LOL.so I'm not sure what part of the city you''re in, but if you head over to squirrell hill there are quite a few good traditional Chinese restaurants/dim sum places there.   I'd recommend everyday noodles personally.

Source:living in Bloomfield/Lawrenceville.Thinly sliced onions, dredged with flour into some oil.oh of course

its also a product of her time to boot, so she also never let me eat any meat that wasn't thoroughly extra cooked, never got to try anything cooked below double well done because for her growing up, anything less than that was possibly contaminated in some way (bacterial stuff)

I know she was just trying to be safe, I just meant that in the end, when it came to me being on my own I had the food knowledge of a 10 ear old suddenly having to feed themself with a zillion new things to figure out lol

though I had the internet teach me general knowledge so it worked out in the end. :)

just funny looking back, when it came to stuff like "you'll know when meat is actually spoiled" and me being like "well I hope I will at least"I really appreciate your username and wish I could buy you Reddit Gold with the money of your namesake!Yes!  I am no longer vegetarian, but I would have been very pleased with this when I was, and also now, when I eat several species a day.  I will do exactly this once my kitchen is equipped with a deep frying apparatus.He is going to hate you if you do it too often, but a commercial deep fryer is marvelous beyond words for great fried foods.  Those big ovens will let you make a ton of breads and cookies with no trouble.  Your Christmas list is now taken care of.  A flat top is the best place to make caramelized onions, which you can freeze in home use portions.  For sure make your stocks there, because it is no more trouble to make 5 gallons than 2 quarts with a commercial set up.How about a grain-based salad? Bulghur or quinoa, maybe, with some herbs and plums?

Is she a vegan? What about grilled halloumi cheese? Halloumi and figs skewered on rosemary branches is a favourite of mine :)

Dips and fluffy pita?
When beef is the main, I usually use portabellas as the veg alternative.  They cook more quickly than beef, but have a similar mouthfeel.  I would think about stuffing them with a smoked cheese mixture to track on the smoked tri tip.  Make sure to make enough so other folks can enjoy them too!Knock their socks off? Welll it's kinda like hunting squirrels... All you need is some nuts, and a boxing glove. NitrogenCoconut cake, made with fresh coconut, is the standard here.  Seven minute frosting and lots of holes poked to soak up fresh made coconut milk.  Press the fresh coconut shreds into the frosting.  If the crowd is big enough "real" aka, sweetened biscuit dough, strawberry shortcake is the alternative.Deep fry them but tell your guests they're roasted. You'll always be the guy that makes the crispiest roasted potatoes. And that doesn't say anything bad about your mom.  If I were in charge of cooking a meal for multiple people, especially my own children, I'd be a lot more cautious.  Now, if I'm cooking for myself on a budget.....different ballgame.This made me have a shower thought. How can we let a steak age in the cooler for a few days but not when its ground? Or am i missing something?Always ham with pineapple stuffing.
http://www.food.com/recipe/pineapple-stuffing-23732I love this as a side dish.  [Caluiflower with Saffron and Pasta](http://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/cauliflower-with-saffron-and-pasta)The way it was explained to me back when I was an apprentice meatcutter (from a guy who had been doing it since waaaay before I was born)....hamburger turns brown because like blood when it hits air it turns brown.

Usually the kind of ground beef you get in a grocery store comes in freshly stuffed into airtight chubs from the processors that are then reground at the store and put into packages like the one you have in the picture or are in "case ready"  low oxygen/carbon monoxide filled packages that lessen the air getting into them straight from the processors (very commonly used in Walmart type food stores).

The store I worked at had the chubs that came straight from the processors like the one you have above. Nothing is wrong with it as long as it was frozen before the use by date and thawed and cooked immediately when removed for use. Transferring the chicken thighs to a baking pan sounds like it'll work.  Maybe preheat the pan while you brown the chicken.  (Bonus: You'll have fond in the skillet to make a pan sauce while the chicken bakes.)This- a good, hot pan and a nice sear is the way to go. I also like to throw some garlic in the oil. Yumm. DON'T touch them while they are searing! Let that crust form. Also, if they are on the smaller side, check them sooner rather than later! The line between perfect and rubbery can be oh-so-fine if they are teeny ones.Yeah. I found a place nearby that'll do a 14x12x1/2" plate for $51, so I'm definitely doing steel.Local bbq place used to throw cabbages in the smoker and offer them as a side-dish, and they were *wonderful*.  I think a serving might have been 1/8 of a cabbage and they may have been cut that way before smoking.

I know cabbage isn't a whole meal (well, *I* could make it one), but if you're smoking stuff anyway, and will also have potato salad and fruit salad . . . might be plenty of variety.

edit: I see sweetpea122 above has said smoked veg in general.  I said cabbage, ... and ... how would smoked carrots be, I wonder?  How long would you smoke an ear of corn?  hmmm....As others have said, try out some inexpensive wines and get a feel for what you like. Trader Joe's tends to have an amazing selection for under $10, and you can usually ask someone to help you with recommendations in your budget. I usually cook with a $4-5 dry/crisp white wine (I dislike sweeter ones), I only rarely cook with red personally.

My favorite way to cook with white wine is to use it in a light pasta sauce, often to pair with a seafood main. White wine reduced with butter, fresh basil, lemon, with pasta and veggies of your choice, and some scallops or pan-seared fish to accompany it is one of my favoriiiiiite things.Upvote for your weird luck. I put a stick of unsalted butter in a baking dish and pop it in the oven while it preheats. Once melted I add seasoned salt, pepper, garlic, onion powder and a whole lot of parm (both the powdery and finely shredded). Add potatoes and mix around. Bake at 400 until fork tender (about an or more for my tastes). Let cool a minute to make sure some of that cheese gets a bit crispy. Ohhhhboy... Even leftovers are great reheatedThey are pretty great.  However, if you are just doing thin crust, a cast iron pizza pan will yield the same results for a fraction of the price.  If you are cooking for longer than, say, 5 minutes, steel is going to have more heat retention.  West Texas, can buy two 14oz ribeyes for about $16.Hummus - basically chickpeas/oil/spices in a food processor.  If you can, throw in roasted garlic and roasted peppers.

Buffalo style cauliflower.  I was skeptical but it's great.

Falafel - Just slightly more involved than hummus and you can fry it and make a pita.

Bobby Flay's greek orzo salad recipe is awesome just leave the shrimp out.

Roasted chickpeas.

If you can find the brand Quorn at your grocer they have the best fake products.  Their chicken cutlets and ground beef are as versatile as the real thing.Okay, maybe I'm dumb. How do you do the fried onion things from scratch. That sounds good. Roasted Brussels Sprouts finished with Honey, Walnuts and Blue Cheese.

Halve them toss them with Olive Oil and Salt and Pepper, roast at 400 till done. Toss with Honey, Blue Cheese and some toasted walnuts. I have never bought unsalted butter.If you took it home and froze it immediately, then later defrosted it and used it immediately, it's almost bound to be OK. Letting it sit in the fridge for several days is usually where the problem sets in, moreso if you use some from the sealed supermarket package and let the rest sit in the fridge for even a short time (mea culpa, though not anymore). I buy packages of ground beef from the "manager's special" rack in Kroger (i.e. about to expire) pretty regularly and chuck them straight into the freezer; never had a problem. I try to use them within a month, otherwise freezer-burn, although chilis and stews are pretty forgiving (and the dogs really don't care).That vinegar was for the wine recipes btw. I usually have [Barefoot](http://barefootwine.com/), an inexpensive wine that is readily available, in the house so that's what I usually use to cook. I almost always have a bottle of red, and sometimes white on hand. If I'm making a wine-centric dish where the quality of the booze is going to be front and center, like coq au vin, I'll splurge a little and buy a $20 bottle of red. But I never spend any more than that.

I also have sake, vermouth, and Chinese cooking wine (Shaoxing) in my cabinet. Vermouth makes a very tasty risotto; I have used it when I didn't have a bottle of regular white wine on hand. I have a bottle of port too, to use very rarely for recipes that require it. MOARillians
Dude. You don't have dim sum in Pittsburgh? You want to eat what Chinese people eat when they go out? It's dim sum. Edit: Sorry. Google says you really don't have it. Again, I'm sorry.Depending on the gas grill you might be able to actually use a wok for its intended purpose. No, it is still chili.Generally speaking, when you cook with wine, many of the nuances that you would find in an expensive wine get cooked away so there's little point in splurging on a pricy bottle just to throw in a sauce or a stew.

I think part of the reason to only use wines you'd drink is because most recipes call for maybe a cup or two of wine... and if you're cooking with wine you don't like then you're suddenly stuck with a bottle you won't finish.

Personally I have no problem drinking boxed wine myself so that's what I usually cook with. It's affordable, keeps for longer than bottles, and is perfectly acceptable for drinking (to my tastebuds anyway).  I may splurge on bottles if I'm feeling fancy or having friends over for dinner, but no point in upgrading just for cooking.
I have never used unsalted butter in my entire life.  Not once has anything ever turned out too salty.  My wife's chocolate chip cookies taste even better since she moved in with me since her mom only bought unsalted.#####&amp;#009;

Some sort of grillable veggie burger maybe? Or something pasta? You can grill up a veggie pizza maybe, or a grilled and seasoned cauliflower steak :)I didn't really love Chinese food until I tried the recipes from Nina Simonds' cookbooks [A Spoonful of Ginger](http://www.amazon.com/Spoonful-Ginger-Irresistible-Health-Giving-Kitchens/dp/0375712127) and [Asian Noodles](http://www.amazon.com/Asian-Noodles-Deliciously-Simple-Dishes/dp/0688131344/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427848127&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=asian+noodles). She is an American who studied traditional Chinese cuisine for several years, and is an expert on both cooking and traditional Chinese medicine. While these books mostly focus on Chinese, there's some other Asian cuisines in there as well--Japanese, Malay, Thai, and Korean. The majority of the recipes are quite simple, and few take longer than 45 minutes to cook--from prep to cleanup.

You need a few key ingredients: soy sauce, fish sauce, chili paste, shaoxing wine or sake, mirin, rice vinegar, sesame oil, peanut oil, douchi (fermented black soybeans), and some others--all are readily available at an Asian market, a well-stocked regular supermarket, or Amazon. From there, you can create an amazing array of flavors and make delicious Chinese dishes without the loads of fat and salt. I was just asking because it depends.

For example, I *absolutely* love grilled pineapple. Put them on kebabs and throw some cinnamon on? We've got a stew going (metaphorically). This is right. Cooking even slightly spoiled meat (eh, it's probably OK) actually seems to concentrate the rankness. The dogs will probably love it, OTOH, dogs will happily roll in rotted fish.It would seem so but only if you overdo it. On low heat the appropriate amount just dissipates resulting in a slightly pinker, much creamier sauce. It's kind of an Amatriciana cheat like cream is for carbonara. Ricetta is the word for recipe in Italian and with some conversions and other quick translations for it you can find all sorts of wonderful things on the Internet.
Oh I meant ones that aren't sweetHmm... I think that I'll go with stocks and sherry vinegar. Thank!What kind of ingredients are you working with first off? Secondly,what kind of cuisine does the place serve?Smoked veggies would be awesome. Baked beans sound perfect too. Can you get her a veggie burger? I think boca burgers are pretty good. Well ....I did when I didnt eat meat at least.

Also those morningstar farm corn dogs taste pretty much like the real deal to me. They just have less fat. Im not at all vegetarian now but I still buy them sometimes because less cals and same taste. My husband cant even telldepends on what protein. Same meat stock will do fine. Or even just water with some sherry vinegar for that tartness. or little lemon juice.I have, when much younger, been guilty of trying to stretch the meager food budget by trying to cook ground beef that smelled "just a little off." No. Don't do it. Regardless of color, if it smells like fresh ground beef, use it, if you catch just a little bit of...what, decay, sharpness? Hard to describe, but you'll know it, and you really can't save it. Better to throw it out now rather than waste time and effort to save it, because you can't.Just so you know -- and this is a pretty subtle one -- I think you meant
&gt;...**averse** to the smell...

Adverse also has a negative connotation, but it's used differently, e.g. "This bad meat is having an adverse effect on my digestion".[THIS](http://www.amazon.com/Frugal-Gourmet-Jeff-Smith/dp/0517203650) is the first cookbook I ever bought, and really got me into Chinese cooking.

Highly recommend.Freeze the breaded curds on parchment  and a tray to set them up. Then bake it from there. it probably won't have time to soggy them up that way.You'll make some amazing pizza. I haven't used mine for anything else but I like in the oven anyways just as an expensive heat sink.

Seriously though, you'll get a stone, it will do a great job, but this is the next level. I cooked vegetarian for 4 years when my ex was vegetarian.

I'm good at making whole vegetarian (and even vegan) meals, but a single dish for a single person, not so much.  I'm a fairly competent cook, so any technique is acceptable, though I would like something that will fit with the theme (bbq). /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt at [seriouseats.com](http://www.seriouseats.com/). Because Science!Consider going vegetarian or vegan for awhile. Screw diet or whatever other considerations: it forces you to learn new techniques and new ways to eat. It's sort of like that dude who tried to write a novel without the letter "i"; by making yourself forego what you rely on then you learn new stuff.

Regardless, are you going to be grilling or general cooking or what?I just kept an eye on them. As it turns out they were about an inch wide, and 5 minutes on each side was perfect. Could have used a bit more salt (I thought my homemade marinade would be enough), but otherwise good. Thanks. Really only horrible if you decide to try huffing on raw meat packaging. Which raises its own concerning questions. :P Learn cooking eggs for breakfast. It's everyday and there are many ways to prepare and cook them.

First sunny side up. Cook on medium heat until the whites on top are cooked through but the yolk is still runny.

Then scrambled eggs to various consistency. French to American country styles.

Then poached eggs.

Then over easy.

Then various omelettes.

Then start pairing sauce with the eggs which might be too much at this stage.

Also pair bacons or sausages along with your eggs and add a various starch prepared in various ways, bread, hash, muffins etc

That's about it.
Also most restaurants buy unsalted butter because salted butter is not available in bulk. (1# or 30# blocks)
So if you're a chef, all your recipes will call for unsalted butter because that's what you have on hand most often.AgreeTesco's ground almond is good, I've used it for baking before and the taste has definitely come through :)Soy, honey, and sesame oil orpad thai sauce are good optionsit took me a long time to learn that brown meat doesn't equal bad meat, once i moved out on my own.

mom never taught us how to cook, but I do know that she would not even consider meat once it was no longer red.

I never saw her do a smell test. brown meat? package goes in the trash.

so when I moved out, I really had no indicator for when meat was actually spoiled, just that I had known that my mom pretty much throw out meat that was still fine honestly.

so as i went through that first year there was a lot of uncertainty about how my meat smelled because while I didn't know what bad meat smelled like, I didn't even know what good meat smelled like, so at first I'd opened a thawed package after it had been in the fridge for a day or so and wonder if my meat was even supposed to have a smell at all.

it felt like a risky first year, and thankfully I never gave myself food poisoning xDNot true.  I have a shitty sense of smell.  Something to do with chronic nosebleeds as a kid.  My house could be on fire and I'd feel the heat before I'd smell the smoke.I hope so, because I've done that twice in two weeks..How big are the chunks? 2 inch thick chicken breast would probably need 20 minutes total with a flip in the middle on the top rack.

1 inch thick pieces with veggies will take shorter. say about 5 minutes on each side.

make sure to set it on the broil pan with slits so the juices can drain so you don't end up boiling the meat in own juices.

I'm just saying, I've never seen a recipe call out salted butter, but I've seen plenty call out unsalted. Really, every recipe should just specify either way, but that would make things too easy.Meh, if we're going to talk evolution, then we're going back almost 4 billion years and we're going to count single cell organisms. Serve with an herb butter? Its not much work but looks fancy.

I would do roasted garlic, thyme, rosemary It's fairly simple and quick, but takes practice to perfect it.  Here's the method off the top of my head: Cook the spaghetti.  While that cooks saut the bacon in a pan that is large enough to hold all of the ingredients, then remove from heat. Mix eggs, cheeses, salt and pepper together in a separate bowl.

When the spaghetti is done, use tongs to put spaghetti into the pan of bacon and fat. [Save some pasta water.]  Quickly coat the spaghetti in the fat and bacon. Temper the egg mixture with some hot pasta water, then immediately add to the hot spaghetti. Mix fairly quickly so that the egg and cheese mixture fully cooks and coats evenly.  It should be very smooth and creamy and steaming hot. And I can't emphasize enough that everything must be done very quickly.

I'm probably better at making it than explaining it.  Hopefully this helps though.

Couple notes: The pan should not be too hot or you may get scrambled eggs - that's why you remove it from the heat the second your bacon is starting to crisp.  All of this is done very quickly to ensure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs.  Also, this is a dish that should be served immediately.  It's still good left over, but the pasta soaks up the creaminess over time. Lastly, many people suggest adding other ingredients like garlic, or herbs, etc., but imho it's much better without the extra complexity of flavors.They work. Better than a stone, IMO.

Since it was going to be cooked for hours, it'd probably have been fine even if the meat was spoiled.First, if you like spicy, the Sichuan menu [here](http://www.yelp.com/biz/how-lee-chinese-food-pittsburgh) is well liked on yelp.

Read Serious Eat's articles on Chinese food, and see what looks appealing. I'm not sure how accessible some of the ingredients are in Pittsburgh, so I'm not so comfortable recommending anything in specific. But also keep in mind how *big* China is. You'll probably like the food from some regions more than others. Like, from what you've listed, I think you might like Sichuan food. Chinese muslim food is also very good, and probably nothing at all like what you think when you think Chinese food. Ya. That makes sense.Leg of lamb w/chorizo stuffing, grilled asparagus wrapped in prosciutto, and romesco potatoes.

So, salted butter is old

So, they put salt to hide the taste of old butter.

Unsalted butter in everything!I'm contributing Green bean casserole this year.  No canned soup, all from scratch, including onion strings.Two websites that may help: [Eating China](http://www.eatingchina.com/recipes.htm) and [Traditional Chinese recipes](http://traditionalchineserecipes.blogspot.com/) - let us know how things go!Here are some recommendations, I'd suggest just using google-fu to find some recipes that sound appealing to you. Like the other commenter said, you can learn from recipes, then adapt those recipes, then start making your own creations.

Soup is a great place to start - a few basic ingredients, lots of options for flavoring, and super healthy. Two simple soups would be a basic chicken soup and a pork and cabbage soup. My personal favorite combination for chicken soup is chicken thighs (boil with the bones for extra flavor), carrots, celery, potato, onion, garlic, spinach, and corn, with coriander, ginger, and thyme for flavorings.

Since you like noodles, stir fry is a great place to start. Look up some Thai or Chinese stir fry recipes. They can be very simple, and like soup require just a few ingredients cooked in a certain order to come out with really tasty results.

A final idea for learning would be pasta sauce. There are innumerable options and once you can make a good basic tomato sauce you've got tons of ways you can go. Even using can tomatoes you can do some awesome stuff, I love using things like onion, mushroom, garlic, artichoke hearts, spinach, and many others. You can mix and match and find where your taste buds kick off.

Hope that helps!&gt;My girlfriend has professed her hatred for all things that lived in water at some point, despite having never tried them. With the exception of tuna in a can, which she would eat every day.

If you're wanting to just not have the stuff around the house at all, then there are just flavors you're going to have to live without, but many sauces will be fine with a smaller quantity of vinegar in place of the wine, and nonalcoholic beer works fine for beer bread.This.  And I have yet to fins a recipe that doesn't work.You can also go to the Serious Eats website.  There is a lot on there too...I would go with  for politeness.I've had it before where I froze and then defrosted ground beef, and it turned out with a really gross taste, I ate it and didn't get sick, but I definitely will only eat beef the day I get it from now on.Whatever I can find. I got trays and pots and pans and everything like that. I got an assortment of knifes. We have just about everything but a cast iron pan. I like soups, noodle based food, and pizza. I've only tried actual cooking when I threw some noodles in boiling water with tomato sauce, some milk, butter and salt. I also was tired of reheating old chinese food so I threw that in a pan and let it simmer in soy sauce and some sugar.  Never tried making soup, but it looks fun to try.I'll certainly look into that. Thanks!I leave unfrozen chicken out for an hour all the time. And on purpose. So, especially since yours was still frozen, you'll be fine. Yay! Thank you! There's some great cookbooks out there that don't resemble American Chinese food at all. Try out Fuchsia Dunlop's *Every Grain of Rice: Simple Chinese Home Cooking*. Or books by Ken Hom or Yan-Kit So. Here's some basic stuff about wine types...

For a red wine Merlot is pretty medium, not too light not too heavy. For heavier get Cabernet Sauvignon, for lighter get Pinot noir.

For white wine, if you want more of a heavy oakey taste go with Chardonnay, if you want light/crisp go with Sauvignon blanc. If you want some sweetness get Riesling.

A good starter brand to start with that's real cheap but not bad tasting is Tisdale. They make a lot of different types too. Once you taste different types you can experiment with what you think would be good in which foods. I like sauv blanc in veggies like Brussel sprouts and Merlot in tomato sauce.

Edit- also, the people working at liquor stores know a lot, so if you have questions while you're shopping they can make some good recommendations. Sure thing! Can you give us a bit more background on the kinds of food you usually eat, what kind of kitchen / equipment you have available, what ingredients you can use? That'll give us a great place to start, but awesome to hear you're interested!In my experience, unless a recipe specifies unsalted butter, they are assuming salted butter.

ProfitYes, this. Also, a squeeze of fresh lemon just before serving is a nice touch. With good scallops, less is more.Most native speakers don't care when someone occasionally comes into their domain not speaking their language. People start getting upset when instead of occasional it becomes regularly.My line of thinking was: If it refers to the cut, it wouldn't be marinated.

I am probably as wrong as you are here.It could be personal preference, but when using store-bought, dried pasta for lasagna, I never boil it first. IMO it tastes better and has better texture, along with being easier and not having to worry about keeping wet noodles from tearing. YMMV

And as far as leaving it in the pan for a few hours, that shouldn't mess anything up. Since it's a hard thing to time and can be labor intensive (all that chopping and we grill the veggies and meats first) we'll make it the night before we plan on using it most times.I am by no means a chef, or half as educated on cooking as most of these awesome people in this sub, but I do enjoy cooking.

To me, if you can read and follow directions you can cook.

Pick up an easy cookbook (I started with stuff like Betty Crocker, better homes and gardens with ingredients I was comfortable and knowledgeable about) and go from there.

Once your a little more comfortable with cooking and flavors you can add things to your recipes to make them more unique.

Good luck! Glad to help! You can also put in eggplant, though the slices have to be very thin for it to get tender enough. Just be careful with vegetables in there, mushrooms, zucchini, and eggplant all have loads of water that is good to extract before baking, you want lasagna, not soup =) good luck!!!They'll go for some kind of japanese easter holidays and when they're back, we'll be off flooding some other part of reddit.You could be right, but in my experience most places sell kalbi as a cut (for hibachi) , not a dish. I eat at touristy places so I'm likely wrong. Thank you for the reply! I never thought to put zucchini in the lasagna, sounds delicious.Straightedge for personal (ie non-religious) reasons... Plus there may be addiction-risky genes, so I don't want to take a chance with that. This is all true, I wouldn't worry about an hour, as long as the outside of the meat hasn't started to go soft. If it has it might be a bit dodgy. If it were me, I'd just put it in the fridge and use within 3 days.

Generally speaking, defrosting in the fridge is best if you have the time as the meat never gets to room temp and can sit safely for 3 days. I think I read an FDA document once saying that you could safely re freeze after a fridge-defrost, although I might have been dreaming that. She's never tried any other fish. But I figure if she likes tuna from a can, it's possible she might like actual tunaPineapple Rumaki.

* Can of pineapple chunks
* 1 package of bacon
* Brown Sugar
* Vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 400. Soak some toothpicks in water so they do not burn. Cut the package of bacon into thirds.  Wrap each pineapple chunk with a section of bacon.  Secure with a toothpick.  Arrange on a baking sheet. Grab a handful of brown sugar like some kind of animal and crumble over top of the pineapple.  Bake until the bacon is cooked through.  When they come out drizzle the vanilla extract over the top and serve as an appetizer.  I used to not care about the kimchi smell, but my partner does (she's Korean as well though) so we usually place a layer of plastic wrap over the top of the jar and rubber band around the plastic wrap. Then lid goes on, and you can put the jar inside a gallon bag.

Be warned though, even with all that effort you will still smell kimchi.I really really hope it doesn't ruin it. The look don't touch approach that klowerk_ suggested seems like a great way to do it. Just appreciate and upvote I guess&gt;Sell by march 15

It's march 31 today. Toss it.

next time when you're near the expiration date, and if you don't have the time to use it, just freeze it. And thaw it out overnight in the fridgeIn my experience, no, it won't mess it up to sit in the oven a bit. HOWEVER, for my lasagna with everything made from scratch, I bake it for 15 minutes at 475 then another 20 to 30 minutes at 425 to get mozarella on the top nicely golden.

I don't think MSG is necessary for lasagna if your meat sauce is good. Here's my basics for lasagna in a 9x9 pan:

Pasta: I make a really simple basic pasta dough, slightly eggier than normal. Roll out, boil for maybe 30 seconds to 1 minute, transfer to cold water until the temperature drops, then off to the side. This way you can get al dente noodles despite the baking time (if you use box pasta I am unsure how long to boil, but I would assume you can do a similar process of 50% cooked then cold water then dry).

Sauce: if I have a lot of time I'll cook scratch, but typically I'll do this version. Brown one yellow onion (chopped), add about 1/2 pound ground pork (I prefer pork but any meat or sausage can work), brown up, add 5 to 10 cloves of garlic depending on size of cloves. Simmer that with 1 large can of plain canned tomatoes, 1 small can of tomato sauce. Add cumin, a little bit of pepper flakes, dried basil and thyme, lots of mushrooms. Salt and pepper every time something is going in and taste taste taste!

Layers: I go sauce, noodle, ricotta cheese (or if you want a lighter lasagna, sour cream is a fantastic layer), slices of zucchini (bake in low heat oven on a wire rack for 10 minutes or just sit on paper towels for a while), sliced mozzarella (cover about 50% of the area, the cheese will ooze around), use a large grater for parmesan, and then repeat to the top where you end with the cheeses.

I personally like lasagna as an all in one since it is such a hefty meal!If learning Japanese you may like the new subreddit /r/JapaneseInTheWild Your mom said to say I could have...just ONE peanut butter square. But not til they cool down. So the caption refers just to the cut of meat? The marinade seems to point to the Korean galbi...I've seen in the past Japanese kind of enjoy (at least don't mind) English posts in Japanese subreddits. Especially if preceded with an explanation, eg "sorry, I don't speak Japanese but am using Google translate"Do things like "awesome" and "cool!" translate well in Google translate? Not a bad idead! HahaThe method I use is pretty close, just a little less heat and no finishing in the oven.In Japan kalbi is just the cut of meat, not the Korean preparation If it was frozen at appropriate temperatures since you initially put it in the freezer and you cook it like you should cook ground beef, I don't think you will have problems.

If it smells funny, it's at your own discretion.Buns - i like kaiser rolls, toasted.

Patty - 80/20 beef, garlic and sweated onions

Cheese - Provologne is my go-to cheese for anything that goes inside/between-slices-of bread

Bacon - cooked crispy

Onion - big-ass white, one slice grilled.

Pickles/greens - either/both is fine, but if I can get my hands on kimchi...
Just curious, why do you not want to cook with alcohol?  Religious or medical reasons?  Some other reason?Yeah, garlic gets bitter when it's fried but how much is too much is a matter of taste. The longer you cook it at low temperature the milder and less pungent the taste gets, when its golden it will have a slight bitterness.2ch pissed off a large portion of their user base. Lots of people went looking for a new home, some of them went to reddit.  There was a hilarious thread when they found all the porn, and the number of people subscribed to /r/hentai Unfortunately not everyone will be that decent. By linking this sub to a large English speaking one, Op has possibly killed it off.So essentially pretend they're a steak? Strangly enough it imparts a certain flavor which really compliments the ham...hard to describe...but it's super moist and tasty!Just take the Cincinnati approach, cheese. This struck me last time my wife made stew: could I pre-roast my hard root veg before I add them in the stew?

Anybody tried it?

Oh, and if you have canned liver pate, use it. Think of it as curry paste, only richer and less fragrant. I use it in tandem with tomatoes as a knockout gravy for beef stews. If the chili is too sweet tasting, try adding a little apple cider vinegar or other acid. It will help counter the sweet taste.If you like that about it, why risk ruining it by crossposting to large English subs?It's beef soup/stew when beans are added.Interesting. What does the bag do?I was going to stick with one word comments lol. Oishii! Kirei! Hoshi! Well they are posting on what is pretty much an American site that mostly uses the English language. I mean, if we tried to make a little sub for ourselves on 2ch or baidu, we should absolutely expect friendly Japanese or Chinese to wander in and ask us questions in their language.

That does raise the question tho - why are they making their lil home on reddit? Japanese internet users are notorious for not going outside Japanese sites.


This is just star anise short of Filipinos' favorite bao filling: pork asado. Brown paper bag ham.


Rub ham with butter.  Place into plain brown paper bag (avoid bags with ink printing).  Put ham into bag.  Sprinkle bag with water.  Cook at about 275 for 8ish hours and baste a few times throughout the process with liquid from the baking dish.  Super tasty...first time I had it was at Thanksgiving and this will be the first time I make it.Cool, thank you. Braise oxtail in soy/rice wine. Add a little brown sugar or honey, and chilies and star anise. "Just look, don't touch."Absolutely agree with you! I don't have marmite in the US, but as weird as it sounds sometimes I will cook down kombu with my chiles when they are reconstituting, that way it gets that umami kick in there. And thanks for going over the process of simmer / puree, I realized I just said reconstitute without explaining!

Also the cumin is a good point, especially if you don't have good dry chiles on hand, it gives that smokiness that is usually missing.Tomato Sauce
Bacon (Bonus points for pancetta)
Heavy cream
Peas
Cavatappi or penne, your choice.

Chop half a pound of bacon.
Cook half a pound of bacon in a saucepan.
Drain most of the grease.
Throw in the peas now if they are frozen.
Add the tomato sauce. The whole jar.
Stir, heat it up.
When it's warm, start adding the heavy cream slowly.
It should be dark orange.

Put this on the cooked pasta.Depends on how large the chicken pieces are and how intense your broiler is.  Keep your eye on it while broiling for a few minutes until you see some charring...then flip them over and repeat.  You can pop off a piece of chicken to test when you think it is done.  If it is thigh meat you will be in much better shape in regards to cooking time...they don't dry out like breast meat.I think I'll try to communicate through emoticons lol. Those are universal right?I make something for my mom (not into nice red tuna) what I call grilled ceviche.  Butterfly the steaks down the middle, and marinate them in a highly acidic and flavorful liquid.  This will denature the fish to the point where it doesn't even need to be cooked.  Then grill them quickly at high temp on the outside for some char flavor, and enjoy!You ever removed a wishbone and trussed a chicken when you were high?

You ever had access to an uncooked game hen when you were high?

Me neither...

That being said - all in good fun.How long on each side do I broil?They're pretty easy.  My first time cooking them was over Christmas and they turned out great.

1.  Get them dry and to room temperature.
2.  Salt and pepper on both sides.
3.  Hot skillet (not quite what you would use for searing a steak).  You want to cook with an oil that won't smoke at a decently high heat.
4.  Sear for 1.5 minutes or so each side (1 in thick).
5.  Let em rest.
6.  Enjoy!I would broil to get the charred delicious bits...you won't get that from baking in that amount of time.I always use the cheapest dry wine I can find for cooking. White for white meat, red for dark meat. Made beef bourganigan (too lazy to look up correct spelling) with a really cheap red which came out delicous (I really can't imagine much of the nuance of a good wine still being tastable after hours of simmering and adding spices and other flavors). Pan sauces for chicken were the same deal. boxed wine works just fine (especially if you are young and on a tight budget). Maybe it's because I'm ignorant but the only wine I like is sweet white whine. I hate red wine, never drink the wine I cook with, yet I love red wine sauces

Read up on Anthony Bourdain's beef bourganian recipe and compare to others out there to get the jist of the recipe. His is pretty straight forward without too many ingredients and it comes out so delicous.* Potatos

In full disclosure, I have done chicken, fish and squash this way, not cheese curds.  Bread up one tonight and give it a bake tomorrow night to double check?   Haha, I'll concede the point. :)  Any recipe that starts with "To begin, bring your fridged or frozen chicken to room temperature" probably isn't going to satisfy a late-night craving.

To be fair, though, there really isn't a lot of work involved.  Removing the wishbone and trussing the chicken takes *maybe* two or three minutes.  Hardest part after that is waiting for the bird to become delicious.Lol, I was actually just looking at separate fridges, and I'm planning to get an extra fridge for kimchi when I can move into a house someday. In my apartment, the kitchen is not big enough to add an extra fridge without being too crowded so I'm looking for container options.I love this subreddit...

&gt;

&gt;__Vodka sauce__ is an [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) [sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce) [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] made from a smooth [tomato sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_sauce), [vodka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodka), typical Italian [herbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb) and heavy [cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream), which gives the sauce its distinctive pink coloration. It gained popularity in the 1970s, when a variation won a national recipe contest in Italy. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] It is a key ingredient in [penne alla vodka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penne_alla_vodka), although it may well have been a sauce before its popularization in the 1970s.

&gt;The vodka's function is, ostensibly, to release flavors in the [tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato) that are normally inaccessible; using [alcoholic beverages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage) for this purpose is common in Italian cooking, although usually accomplished with [wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine).  It is also an [emulsifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsifier), serving to keep the sauce stable, when normally the oil of the cream sauce would react with the acidic tomato sauce to separate from the water in both.

This is why bolognese recipes often contain red wine, or [vodka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodka_sauce). It releases the flavors and allows them to mingle with the rest of the dish.I like ganache with chocolate and sweetened condensed milkThis happened to me while I was in the kitchen assembling the next pizza.  I heard a popping sound and assumed that the shower caddy in the adjacent bathroom must have fallen off the wall or something.  The 2 halves are about half an inch apart.Definitely don't use wine you wouldn't drink. That being said, I wouldn't go dropping $50 bottles in your pans either.Well, I guess that I'm going to have to miss out on some foods =-(

Which kinds of alcohol soluble compounds/flavors are the most common?Start drinking wine on a regular basis until you find one that you really like.

Generally, you are looking for relatively dry wines for cooking. What does "Dry" mean? When you take a sip, you mouth should feel dry, like you just sucked on a paper towel, only less intense. A dry wine tends to be more a little more complex and less sweet than not-dry wine.

Then again, I'm pretty fucking far from a wine expert. These are just my own observations. My first thought was "weed, duh," but then I read the context. Going postal got this one!It should be more translucent than fried, right? I guess the crushing would sort of help to make it like that in the sense that it breaks down the garlic and allows the juices to flow.What is referred to in many comments about gasses being added to packaging is known in the industry as Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)

Relatively recently the FDA approved the use of a 3 gas mixture to aid in food preservation and presentation.  This mixture is 0.4 percent carbon monoxide (CO), 30 percent carbon dioxide (CO2) and 69.6 percent nitrogen (N2).  This gas has a stabilizing effect on meat color due to the formation of carboxymyoglobin.  But this isn't just to "trick" consumers into buying old meat, [studies have shown MAP meat has lower bacterial growth count over time](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18326178)

[Here is a Washington Post piece on that same subject](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052200380.html).  However, based on the the appearance of the packaging in your photo, it is likely just cling wrap of foam, i.e. not MAP. . . so all this is really irrelevant.  The most discerning sense for determining freshness is smell!  I can't smell it, but based on appearance it looks fine.

tl;dr  Smell your meat, if it doesn't smell rotten it is probably fine.
edit:  It was purchased ground **and**  then frozen, so this should go without saying, cook it through thoroughly! Also works with apple and cherry.  Add crushed pineapple to any of the others for even more variety.Thank you, sir.

So the bacteria can survive in freezing temperatures? Damn what little fuckers.

And am I correct that what you said would mean that refreezing would make the chicken kinda have that soggy/slimy feel to it, or at least more so than freezing the chicken a first time? Now that I think about it, I think this seems to happen.There are 2 reasons why alcohol is used in cooking.

* To provide flavor and body to a dish.

* To dissolve alcohol soluble compounds in food

For flavor and body, you can replace it. Often a nice strong beef stock and replace a lot of alcohols (use a little bit of acidity too when replacing wine)

For dissolving flavors, I'm afraid you don't have many other options. Ground beef is normally brown. When it's packaged, carbon dioxide is pumped into the package, turning the meat red on the outside to make it look more appealing.Probably putting cold things (like dough fresh out of the fridge) on a hot pizza stone or trying to lift a stone sheet by the edges. Or dropping it. I had a bunch of free cheap thin pizza stone years ago, was careless, and lost a few that way.

Also bear in mind that the grocery store by my house sells such a thin pizza stone that it's really better described as a baking tile.My version of Huevos Rancheros

- 1 corn tortilla topped with
- refried beans
- fried egg
- melted cheese
- hot sauce

I also bought one a few years ago and never used it. I finally pulled it out recently and used it twice and absolutely love it. Both dinners were the best ones I have ever made. And I used it when I was home on Sunday both times, and there were no electrical issues.Low and high don't necessarily have to mean different temperatures (on my slowcooker they do not). They often indicate only the speed of getting to desired temperature. As in - on high the heating element will have higher power output, but it will stop heating on exactly the same temperature as on low. Obviously that's not the case for *all* slowcookers and you need to consult service manual of yours.

Whether it's to high depends on what you actually measured. If it's temperature of significant amount of liquid within the pot then something is quite probably wrong as that's almost the boiling point of water. On the other hand if you measured it when it's almost empty then there's nothing to worry about.

You need to remember that slowcookers for most part do not have their temperature sensor within the pot itself, but in the housing. This means that to get the desired temperature of pot contents it has to stop at point significantly higher. This in turn means that temperature of inside will depend on things like how good is contact between housing and pot, how full it is or how well the lid fits. In the end if stuff you cook is not boiling and cooking properly then it's ok.Indian here; have been using pressure cookers with no problems all my life (except for when I overdo the water &amp; it gushes out over the lid a bit along with the released steam).

Have been wanting to try a slow cooker, lurking the slow cooker thread a while to get the hang of it before I buy one. May need to have it shipped from the West cos we can't even buy one out here - it's just not around! Alton Brown showed how to make it.  Skip ahead the the last minute of this video.http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R3JetOoEngsRead the manual. Understand why there is a fill line and never go above it. Have fun. But please, read the manual.Maybe we didn't want to sing living on the edge. Maybe we're rebels. Dry dressing mixes are no where to be found here. How much of the bottled stuff would you sub?Cool, thanks!If you have the probe in liquid then 211 is as high as you are going to get it. Any higher and you wouldn't have liquid. The temperature isn't the important thing about the high/low setting (they both go to the same temperature) the importent thing is the time it takes to get there. In my opinion, the newer crockpots get there too quick. My wife worked for a company that puts fda grade Teflon coatings on food manufacturing equipment like rollers and the interior of storage tanks. One of their customers treated hot dogs with liquid smoke and that shit ate the coating off the rollers a few times a year. We don't use liquid smoke now days.I've never used one so I don't know how good they are, but they make pressure cooker &amp; smoker combos that are apartment sized.From Wikipedia:


Liquid smoke is a substance produced from smoke passed through a tube from a combustion chamber filled with select wood chips to a condenser. In the condenser, the smoke cools and forms a liquid, **aided by the addition of water.**"Lectins are inactivated with cooking so fully cooked or canned kidney beans are safe to eat."

I put mine dried straight from the bag into the slow cooker. No problem. Just need to cook about 8 hours to soften fully.That sounds horrendous What's that in units of temperature?Absolutely, I have added too much many times. Cooking is  (an imprecise) science, and unless you've added half a bottle liquid smoke, there are ways to even it out. A few extra drops is easily remedied. Just ruined some homemade jerky this way. I feel your pain. I spilled it all over my kitchen once. Took over a month to get the smell out. Random notes from around the web

&gt;
Per Crock Pot Customer Service:

Thank you for contacting Crock-Pot, a brand of Jarden Consumer Solutions. Both the Low &amp; High settings cook at 215 degrees F., but they cycle differently. Therefore, the High setting will still cook the food in a shorter period of time than the Low setting will. Please remember that these are all approximate temperatures and they can vary depending on what you are cooking. It can also boil on High and Low. We do recommend that you always fill your slow cooker at least 1/2 - 3/4 of the way full with liquid or sauce, and you may also have to adjust your cook times accordingly. This will prevent the food from drying out and burning.

Also:
The warm setting is around 165

&gt; AND

I have a brand name Crock-Pot model SCV700 7 Qt. oval "crock pot" and decided to test the temperatures with a $17 digital food thermometer. So I put a thin sheet of aluminum foil on the bottom of the stoneware bowl and then a 1/2 oz. olive oil glass jar filled with cooking oil on top of that in towards the center away from the sides. After allowing it to heat for 1 hour at "warm" setting I took a reading and it was 152 degrees F.. After another hour at "low" setting I took a reading and it was 215. Another hour later at "high" setting I read 282. Another 1 1/2 hours later at same "high" setting I read 311 degrees and that concluded my test. Take these figures for whatever they're worth and keep in mind that there are manufacturing variances between different models and even the same model due to their acceptable variances from engineered specificationsCant find it in tesco eitherWhich most people don't have access to?Sounds like you are making a stock. If so, you probably want to break some of the bones and bring it above 212 (boiling point of water). Breaking the bones allows the marrow to enter the stock which adds more flavor to the stock. That's how I was taught to make a stock at least.

If you are actually cooking a lump of meat, you don't really want to get that close to boiling (especially on low) as you will likely overcook the meat.Slightly.  180-200 is pretty standard for Low.  High ranges around 210-250.  Rooftops, yoI worked in an institutional kitchen in college and someone knocked over a gallon jug of the stuff. That was about 15 years ago and I still can't stand the smell. It's a probe thermometer under the lid, not touching the bottom, and not inserted into any meat, it's just bones and veggie. The Question is "is the temperature in the "low"(211) setting too high? " As in max temp for that setting?Really? In tight urban (and some suburban) spaces it is the best option. Great control, HIGH heat when you need it, and comparable operating costs to real charcoal/briqs. If you are going full smoker, sure, gas is a pass, but for your average user gas is great Not entirely sure what your thermometer is connected to, so I won't make any assumptions. However IIRC, 140F is generally considered the killing point of most pathogens.It was mostly an old model that had seen a lot of use. Or somebody tried to open it while it still was under pressure.

Modern pressure cookers have safety locks that prevent that from happening. They don't explode and they cannot be opened until the pressure had come back to normal. Finally, a thread about Liquid Smoke.

I love it. It adds amazing tastes to 'soul food'. Especially ham hocks.

BUT. It makes me terribly sick. I've eaten food made with it several times and EVERY TIME I do I get sick. Coincidence? I don't think so.

Does this happen to anyone else?You could use [one of these](https://www.google.com/search?q=outlet+timer&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address&amp;ie=&amp;oe=&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=outlet+timer&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address&amp;tbm=shop), but I would be a tad paranoid about leaving stuff in it all night with it turned off. In my opinion it would be safer to set an alarm on your phone to remind you to fill it up and turn it on, and then use an outlet timer to shut it off. I got a package of two outlet timers at walmart a few years ago for my fishtank heater, they were very affordable, sold in the section where they have lightbulbs and such.

Edit: more detailHonestly, I'd pour in like 1/4 to 1/2 a tsp at a time and taste until you think it's good. Don't buy the Polish one next time :PA little, but once you've tasted overpowering Liquid Smoke, you'll never be able to taste a hint of it without mentally parsing it out from what you're eating. It's like the [Wilhelm Scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbYsoEasio), once you recognize it, so many things are ruined for you.And for the love of all that is holy or unholy, don't break a bottle of plasma smoke.  And leave the Bose-Einstein Condensate smoke in the fridge when not in use.[3 ingredient biscuits and gravy](http://groceryshrink.com/2013/06/3-ingredient-slow-cooker-biscuits-and-gravy.html)This is just me, but years ago, I heard and then saw the large hole in my aunt's kitchen ceiling after her pressure cooker blew it's lid and the entire contents (green beans she was canning) splattered everywhere.  /scared as hell of pressure cookers

Or maybe I'm still just mad I had to clean most of it up. :/Another great but not slow cooker use for liquid smoke; take your fav salsa fresca recipe, oil &amp; quickly char over high heat all of the veggies that will allow this treatment (peppers, tomatoes...), quick cool charred veggies in ice water, prepare salsa fresca as you normally do.  Cool in fridge.  Taste, adjust seasons, then add 1/4teaspoon at a time of liquid smoke, tasting after each addition. Particularly good with a cilantro - lime recipe. Only if you get Gaseous Smoke.  Liquid Smoke and Solid Smoke are all fine if there's no phase changes.4 cups!I've got some of this too, but I've got to be careful with it.  My girlfriend intensely dislikes it at the level that Burger King uses it.That's my go to pork recipe. Unless my husband is smoking it the proper way on the grill, we do this one. It's amazing!No problem.

These two articles might interest you as well. They are about sous vide, once again, but the information is good. The second one is specific to chicken.

http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/sous-vide-basics-low-temperature-chicken.html

Also, here is Rival's (makers of CrockPot brand slow cookers) information on crock pot cooking. In the food safety tab at the bottom they mention frozen foods.

http://www.crock-pot.com/service-and-support/product-support/product-faqs/food-safety/food-safety-faq.htmlI appreciate what you're trying to get across here. I think the best option would be posting a comment in the thread asking what can be used as a sub for certain ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!Now boys.Thanks for the detailed reply :)No.  You can use frozen chicken breast in a slow cooker. A lot of sites and people will say "OMG NO IT'S IN THE DAAAANNNGER ZONNNE ". This is a misunderstanding of microbial growth propagated by the USDA because it's safer to give simple guidelines rather than have people trying to figure out actual temps and timings. Don't get me wrong, it's better that people err on the side of safety especially with chicken, but it isn't the end-all-be-all truth of the matter.

Food safety from cooking is due to a function of temperature and time. [Here is a chart that gives a pretty decent idea of how those relate.](http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20100413-Sous-vide-chicken-chart.jpg)

You will also hear that "crock pots don't get hot enough to make food safe". That's just bullshit. Usually a crock pot will get to 160F low / 200F high... or they are supposed to... recent years companies have upped that number to avoid any possible law suits. So the crock pot is getting **plenty** hot (too hot in most cases with modern slow cookers).

Another variation is that they don't get hot enough *fast enough*. This is partially true. If you are only cooking for a short time, as in your 3 hour example, then cooking a frozen piece of chicken might not get up to temperature in that time. You will have to add time likely. But as long as you are maintaining a higher temperature for enough time without lapses, you are proceeding with the pasteurization or sterilization process.

Something you might benefit from watching would be [Douglas Baldwin's video about food safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH9V8Dg86Zw). He sums up the basics of this pretty well, and is a respected individual that has contributed greatly to the cooking and food safety community. The video is about sous vide cooking, but the concepts are universal and completely apply to the crock pot.

So I guess the TL;DR would be... yes... you can cook frozen food, it takes longer, and you should be careful that everything is done correctly. Making sure there is some liquid in the crock pot is a really good idea as well as it will help to transfer the heat more quickly into the food, but that's a general rule of thumb for the slow cooker anyway.

C.M.A. , I'm not a microbiologist or anything, but these are all things you can verify independently and some common sense goes a long way. If you aren't sure about the quality of your food, equipment, or skills then it's probably a bad idea to attempt cooking.It'll cut the bitterness a little, but it's really strong stuff. If you use too much, the flavor is likely to overpower everything else. Okay. So how much should I use?This video explains it in detail http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/You don't totally cook the meat, you just sear it. The concept is to trap the flavour of the meat juices inside the piece of meat.
Veggies are the same deal. If you don't sear them then the juices just leak out and make the other liquid tasty leaving the meat tasting kinda bland.

As for recipes that don't say to sear its usually due to the recipe being broth/liquid based. Soups, Stocks, Stews etc. That ways the flavour is transferred into the liquid. Recipes that get the meat to reabsorb the juices also do this (Think pulled pork).

Its alittle complex but if you don't really care then just follow slow cooker recipes. They have all the instructions you need.I found this really good video citing research studies. It turns out that normal use probably wouldn't even come close to the limit. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-liquid-smoke-flavoring-carcinogenic/What was the ratio you used?Yes, except less pot and more hickory.Just bought it today, they got smart and started selling plastic bottlesThat's kinda what I was talking about, but apparently forgot to specifically mention.Or in an apartment...Dat looks as shitty as u do tuffIt's all in good fun, I saw a good shot and I took it!Or we live in cities with no porches or yards in which to do it.I've never seen it in stores.(in Australia). I bought some alderwood smoked salt and it goes great with pulled pork etc. I like to add a couple of dashes to a pot of boiling potatoes for potato salad or mashed potatoes. Everything may or may not kill you.Yep. Substitutions fall on the cook, not the recipe writer. That's what Google is for.I use liquid smoke for my crockpot kahlua pork. Pork shoulder, liquid smoke, and sea salt. Put on low for 16 hours. Remove meat from juices and shred.  It's delish!  We eat it with lettuce wraps, brown rice and grilled pineapple.Unless you got a (American) specialty store near you online is going to be your best bet.So just take a regular recipe and add the word 'fuck' a few times.. That novelty wore off quickly I once catered a party when they wanted a Jamaican theme. Like you, I needed more side dishes to flush out the menu. Joy of cooking has a good section on Jamaican foods/history, and that's where I found my peas and rice recipe. From what I remember it shouldn't be too hard to convert the recipe to your slow cooker. I'm in the process of moving. I would get out my JOC if it weren't packed in a box somewhere.

Tried to edit for mobile/text gloves errors. Please forgive typos I missed. Write me back if anything needs clarifying. So it's essentially bong water? You're hungry ALL. THE.

I looove some white rice, but looooove quinoa.I always just put it in last and when it's done then turn it off and serve. It will soak up more water, but it's not like overlooking rice because you're not actively heating it. At least that's my experience...but I also tend to drink and cook...so yeah.Aerosmith, not Bon Jovi. Your comment should read "You can't help yourself from faaaaaalling..."I reread this in Sir David Attenborough's voice. Lovely.Also, if you can, definitely let the meat marinate for the full 6 hours.Flour and fat (or any emulsifier, I think)Saving this comment for reference later. Thank you!"Did"?Username relevant because that would kill a normal man. That had to be god awful. I have no idea where you live and what you have available. Your best bet would be to google the mystery ingredient and find your own local substitute.It's actually condensed smoke. No water is addedI just used Alton Brown's recipse to make beef jerky... It's incredible.

IMO skip the box fan/air filters and invest $36 on amazon for " Weston 07-0155-W 3-Tier Jerky Drying Rack"

Which actually means it *can* be somewhat unhealthy, particularly if you go over the top with it. It won't make you immediately sick, but it does increase risk of some cancers a little bit - probably not enough to worry about unless you decide to add it to literally everything you eat.Make me.I use it when i make beef jerky. Excellent stuffELI5 what is liquid smoke?I tell you hwhat,  I could show you great propane accessories that'll make that meat top notch. Usually it's [journalists fault](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=1623) sadly. If you ever cared to dig up to the actual study you'll pretty much always see stuff along the lines of "possible correlation found between A and B, needs more research". *If* there is any stronger conclusion it means that there were done a few different, independent studies on the topic. Sadly your average catchy headline seeker will not dare to say which case he is writing about.Take my hand and we'll make it I swear. Is that vegan/veggie? I see no fucking meat on their site.

There's your first mistake right there bro.I'm following that you're still not answering the question. Here, I'll demonstrate.

"Should I wear a belt or suspenders with my pants?"

"Why are you wearing pants?? Don't you know you should be wearing shorts today? You're doing your clothes wrong!!!"

"OK, but I'm still gonna wear pants for a lot of reasons I don't think I need to list. Belt or suspenders?"

**"NO! Wearing pants today is WRONG! You can't wear pants today!"**

"...but I'm going to wear pants. I'm already wearing pants. My pants are on, and I don't have shorts. I need to keep my pants on throughout the day without having them fall down. Shall I keep them up with a belt or suspenders?"

"You. Must. Wear. Shorts. How are you not understanding this?"

You see how that's not an answer to the question?

There's more than one way to cook pork tenderloin. There may be a better way and a worse way, but there is no such thing as a wrong way. Cooking doesn't have right and wrong. There are good practices and bad practices, and results will speak for themselves, but you have still not answered the question: leave it for 2 more hours, or turn it off and warm it back up? The answer cannot be "no," as it's not a yes or no question. Your *response* of "you're doing it wrong" still does not answer the question. Response  answer.

You're way too late to "save" op from his slow cooker. Why not help him make the best of it anyway?What happens?When the snow flies and I can't smoke ribs, I'll braise them in a steam bath of apple juice and liquid smoke.  Anyone know where you can buy it in the UK?I prefer smoking meat myself, the original slow cooking. But I was surprised when I first found out that liquid smoke is just that, liquefied/condensed smoke. Thanks! GrossI'm curious if you've ever tried browning the tenderloin in a pan first to create that beautiful Maillard Reaction sear.I've never had anything better in a slow cooker than pork tenderloin, granted I cook it for about 6 hours on low not 8, but it is so juicy and tender. http://youtu.be/R3JetOoEngs?t=9m5sNo need for the link.

Since this isn't r/smoking, I won't go into how awesome smoking pork butt is. However, if you have a grill it's very easy to smoke certain ingredients and adding them to your slow cooking recipe.  Smoking peppers for chili, or beans for soup. Really anything including water for ice in cocktails. It does take time though, and requires supervision.After a day spent defusing landmines, 30footfall doesn't want to tempt fate.It's actually just condensed smoke. The water is already in the smoke as vapor. You just have to cool the smoke and collect it. Alton Brown had a how-to once but I can't find a link. That's my favorite. I'm never doing a soda-based one again. Salt and smoke and meat is all that is needed!Sweet thank youSweet Thank youMy husband slices it like thick bacon sears it for a few minutes in a skillet and then puts it orange juice, orange pieces, sliced onions, and garlic on low. We eat it in fresh corn tortillas as tacos. &gt;Hmmmm, sweet yummy chemicals.

Liquid smoke is not synthetic. It's literally the result of burning wood, capturing the smoke, condensing it, then cooling it.

If you've ever eaten anything smoked, you've eaten the same thing.It is.Woooooahhhh we're half way there...Pretty much. If something is bad for you wait a couple weeks and it will be good again.The same as wood smoke.  That's what it is.Liquid Smoke makes everything taste like hot dogs to me.It's great in chili, too.I'm a big fan of smoking food, but I just can't use liquid smoke.  The idea of channeling smoke through water and using that water as a flavoring just puts me off.  Using that same smoke to flavor food is not a problem for me, so maybe I'm just weird.

Now, what I have been known to do is smoke a piece of meat for an hour and then finish it in the slowcooker.  That way you get the flavor and don't have to keep the fire going all day.  Plus, shredding slow cooked meat is the easiest thing to do in a kitchen.I did, it was delicious :)Do not break a bottle of it in your kitchen though. Especially if you are in a small 2nd floor apartment. I may or may not know from experience.Looks good, I'll try the sauce.  It's already pretty close to how I do my ribs.Hope you liked it!Yes! I made [this](http://www.pineappleandcoconut.com/recipes/hawaiian-style-slow-cooker-kalua-pork/) slow cooker Kalua Pig with just pork, Hawaiian sea salt, and liquid smoke. Best thing I've ever slow cooked!Hmmmm, sweet yummy chemicals. The recipe was courtesy of /u/Dill-Ag13Here ya go!!

Serves 8.
2 lbs of stew beef,
2 cans of cream of mushroom soup,
2-3 can of beef broth,
1 large onion dip (recommend HELVA brand),
 1 package of flat noodles (recommend Pennsylvania Dutch noodles),
1 can mushrooms (optional),
 season salt,
 Cook stew beef in crock pot for about 4 hours in 2 to 3 cans of beef broth - cook on high,
After 3 hours add all ingredients except for noodles-cook on high for half hour (stir as needed),
 Cook entire bag of noodles in separate pot of water for about 10 minutes or until done (follow directions on bag),Add cooked noodles to your stew beef and cook about another half hour on high...stir as needed,
Serve with peas or salad and red winehttp://www.chow.com/recipes/30796-easy-slow-cooker-bbq-beef-brisketClassic. Things should just be labeled "This product may cause or cure cancer"[Make this sauce](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/scott-hibbs-amazing-whisky-grilled-baby-back-ribs/)

Then thank me when it is amazing.Here's [one of my favs.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/mushroom-stroganoff-with-goat-cheese-recipe.html)  I added beef ( the way beef stroganoff should be ) and adapted it for slowcooker.  But the Goat cheese!  OMG makes it.  (Add it at the end).The Coffee bit is interesting considering [this article](http://www.sciencealert.com/coffee-consumption-linked-to-decrease-in-dna-breakage) came out last week.I was under the impression this stuff was highly carcinogenic. Drank a shot of that stuff once on a dare, would not recommend. It doesn't make a great beverage but it is pretty awesome for cooking.I usually heat the BBQ sauce and pour it on just before eating too, works better that way, doesn't burn.I do ketchup, brown sugar and liquid smoke. Boil then smother chicken with it. Amazing.Oh god its horrible.Agreed, but don't get it on your hands. You will smell like liquid smoke for days.Sure!I've never used Liquid Smoke, but holy shit, you've just shown me my new favorite recipe site.http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/cancer_biologists_find_dna_damaging_toxins_in_common_plant_based_foodsThe answer is op is doing it wrong.   How are you not following this?I'd give a more detailed recipe, but I never measure, just  more ketchup than molasses and add the liquid smoke a little at a time, it can be overpowering.if you use too much it will make your food really bitter, and awful.  i learned the hard way
Not the liquid - the "smoked salt"But OP asked a question and you did not answer it. Instead you told him to do it a completely different way. Its already in the slow cooker. The ship has sailed. Why don't we try helping it get to its destination instead of saying he should have taken a different ship?this seems to contradict everyone else here :p but I do thighs every week and leave them going 8 hours and they are perfect IMO. I have also left a whole chicken go for 8 and had no complaints. Christmas day duck was undercooked after 8 hours. Maybe I have an especially low wattage slow cooker.Yes, it makes me fart.Going to try this.  Thanks!i bet the broth would make a decent split pea soup
&gt; EVERYTHING is chemicals.

Yup, this is what those guys over at /r/soylent realized.that is not what liquid smoke is supposed to taste like.That sounds awesome :) Definitely gonna try that! Liv'in on the edge. I know this is a slow cooker sub, but I marinate chicken thighs in a liquid smoke and chicken stock combination over night when I am (gas) grilling. Gives them a delicious flavor.

Also Hickory is the best flavor!Ketchup, molasses and liquid smoke makes a great BBQ sauce.Ideally you want multiple types of liquid smoke.  Mesquite, hickory amd applewood all have much different flavors.  If I could only have one it would be mesquite though, it seems less prone to overpower dishes than hickory and goes better with beef.but OP is doing it wrong.   That is the best answer that can be provided.

by cooking a pork tenderloin in a slow cooker for 8-10 hours its just drying it out.  unless OP is shredding it for something, but it would still be dry and stringy.

the IT of pork loin or pork tenderloin is best served (IMO) at 150-155

i grill, sear/roast until an IT of 145 and carry over takes it up to med-well.

next time i will start with "NO!" to appropriately answer the query, then provide the rest of comment.

why ask a question if you are not prepared to hear answers you dont like.

get off you high horse there buttercup......
Thanks professor. I should have said that it is not some crazy synthetic chemical compound.

The wikipedia text you pasted seems to say that there are carcinogens in liquid smoke the amount of which depends on the source wood and the temperature that is is burned at. Smoking things causes carcinogens, no shit.
Are there any health effects to liquid smoke?I actually tried some a while ago.  I don't know if it's a bad batch, but it tasted like rancid blue cheese.I find it frustrating that so many people on here don't answer questions because they're too busy saying "why the hell would you do it like that??"

I asked a question a while ago about putting a beer in my slow cooked chili and I got a lot of "no you're doing it *all wrong,* you **have** to do it this way instead" or "well I don't know what the hell you're doing but here's my entire recipe for chili. Don't stray from it or your chili will be slop," and one guy say "it might be too liquidy if you do it like that, try this instead. If you really want to do that, here's a tip to cut down on how liquidy it is," which was actually helpful because it answered my question. Why can't people in this sub just reply with helpful answers? Stop judging other people's cooking habits and answer their questions. If he wants to slow cook it (which he's apparently done before and it has turned out well) he can. He just wants to know if the extra two hours will make a big difference in the food, or if he should just turn it off and reheat it. That was the question. Not "should I slow cook this?"

Seriously, if you don't have an answer to the question, why reply? Its not helpful.I agree with you, but as OP has pointed out, that ship has already sailed.I am always scared when I use it. I always use less than i should.I add liquid smoke to my chili. Hickory is good, but mesquite is better! So far I've gotten nothing but rave reviews.
&gt;It is not some crazy chemical combo.

EVERYTHING is chemicals.

While smoke condensates such as tar and ash are removed from the solution during production,[7] the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is investigating the safety of liquid smoke as a food flavoring.[8] One of the smoke flavorings being assessed, named Primary Product FF-B, raised concern. The EFSA Panel on food additives, flavorings, processing aids, and materials in contact with food (AFC) concluded that Primary Product FF-B can be regarded as weakly genotoxic in vivo (i.e. animal testing has shown it can damage DNA, the genetic material in cells). The Panel, therefore, could not establish its safety in use when added to food. However, no comparison was made against traditional smoked goods on the market.[9] Primary Product AM 1 was described as potentially toxic to humans by the EFSA on 8 January 2010.[10]

In a study by Guilln, Sopelana, and Partearroyo, it was discovered that different concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were present in different liquid smoke flavourings depending on the type of tree used to produce the liquid smoke. The types of trees listed from those generally producing the highest concentration of PAHs to those producing the lowest concentration is: poplar, vine shoot, oak, cherry tree and beech woods. Liquid smoke produced with poplar wood produced the greatest amount of carcinogenic PAHs at 0.78 g/kg); however, this is a small amount. The only PAH with an acceptable limit of 10 g/kg, fixed by FAO/WHO, is benzo[a]pyrene, because it is highly carcinogenic. This was also found to be present in poplar and beech liquid smoke; however, the concentrations are well below the acceptable limit. The researchers also discovered that, independent of wood type, the concentrations of carcinogenic PAHs were the lowest when the temperature used during the production of the liquid smoke was 530-559 C. This temperature range did not compromise the quality of the liquid smoke produced and is comparable to a previous research study that suggested 400-600 C to be the optimal temperature range for wood pyrolysis.[11]good god man.......what are you doing?

just sear the tenderloin and finish in oven until Internal Temp is at 145-150.......

this will probably take less than 20 minutes too cook correctly. Apartment living is not conducive to using a smoker anyway.  I want/need big flavor out of a small kitchen!If I can't use my smoker (like on vacation). I have no problem putting a little liquid smoke in if I have to resort to the crock pot. It is made by simply condensing smoke with a little water. It is not some crazy chemical combo. [This stuff]( http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B006DVQCJS) is a great way to add the flavor to smaller meals as well!I bet you like Miracle Whip too.  No man....no.  That kinda thinking will get you hurt.Well, that's a brined tenderloin. So yeah, it'll be a bit more forgiving.I had never heard of this until Thug Kitchen became a thing. [As they put it](http://www.thugkitchen.com/tucson_tempeh_salad), "1 teaspoon liquid smoke (It is near the BBQ sauce at the store I swear. You havent even looked yet so stop f***ing complaining.)"Omg. I'm going to make this with [beer bread!](http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/5-ingredient-beer-bread/) :D Beer everything! and then my place will smell delicious!Have to disagree with you. We do the Hormel always tender pork tenderloin and it is so juicy and tender after slow cooking for about 6 hours. Yeah I forgot about it because I put it in the butter box.I had to do something with it.I have a grocery store in my area with an enormous variety, but I've never bothered to try it. Now I'm interested.Does your slow cooker have a warm setting? I hate to say it, but I didn't even notice the bacon flavor.Yes! It's really tasty!  But you have to be really really really careful using it. It's so very easy to overdo itYou won't be disappointed. It's delicious. When I'm feeling super lazy I'll just quickly pull it apart and gorge on sweet sweet protein. I did fry it and it is so much better. I didn't put much effort into it or anything. I just put some coconut oil in a skillet and fried some of my pulled pork. Then added a spoon full of pico and a squirt of fresh lime juice and kept it in there a little longer. That recipe is exactly what we are cooking!Yeah but, it doesn't dry out in the slow cooker, does it?

I've left chicken breasts in the slow cooker all day until it was time to shred and it seemed quite tender and moist enough, albiet a tiny bit 'mushy'. Didn't taste quite like overcooked chicken, though.I use my slow cooker for pork tenderloin a lot. A lot of people on here don't like using tenderloin but I've never had any problems. TBH it usually cooks for that long when I start it and go to work. That being said I usually put plenty of liquid in it but, I've never had a problem.

FYI this is my [favorite recipe](http://addapinch.com/cooking/balsamic-pork-tenderloin-recipe/) for pork tenderloin. Thanks for the advice.

We've never tried a wellington before, that looks good!Chicken breasts do shred apart but I find that they're never as good as  leg and thigh meat. Plus breast meat doesn't really have much in the way of flavour, whereas dark meat does.

I'm just a big fan of cooking breast meat to temp (so like 155-160F).OK.  In that case, I'd monitor the tenderloin until it was done and immediately switch to "keep warm".

Not a slowcooker recipe, but have you ever tried Alton Brown's Pork Wellington?I understand, but we've had good luck with it in the past for healthier meals.

Of course I have a meat thermometer :)If you slow cook it, all the fat will render out and it will not be very pork belly-esque anymore.Lean meats like breasts and loins dry out quickly if you overcook them.Just my opinion, but pork tenderloin is not a good cut of meat for slowcooking. Too lean. It'll get dry.

Do you have a meat thermometer?That sounds fucking delicious, but pricey. Hot pizza dip! I've never done it in a crockpot (or little dipper) so YMMV but you mix cream cheese with italian seasoning, spread it in the bottom of the dish, add tomato sauce, a layer of mozzarella, more sauce and then mozzarella on top. You can add pizza toppings like diced onion, pepperoni, olives, green peppers, whatever you like.

Normally, you'd bake it until it all gets gooey and melty on top but the little dipper would probably be great for this.I think it gets tough. Lately, I've been using these organic, boneless, skinless chicken thighs from Costco in my crockpot and they are great. Flavorful and the meat seems to stay tender.I can never find pork belly. I'd want to make bacon though. you had me at baconThe recipe was done very on the fly, mostly measured by eye and by taste but I will give it a try.

****Pulled Chicken
* 10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
*  cup ketchup
*  cup honey
* 1/8 cup cup soy sauce
* Sriracha to taste (as much or little for your desired taste factor)
*  white onion, chopped
* 2 scotch bonnet peppers (this made the chicken nice and spicy, although it may be too much for some people)

Put everything in a slow cooker on low for 5-7 hours, pull then reheat in the
remaining sauce until the chicken soaks it up. I also let the chicken marinate
in the sauce for 24 hours, as this meal was made a day in advance.

****Mango Salsa
* 1 ripe mango, diced (make sure your mango is ripe  ours was not sweet enough due to under ripeness)
*  red bell pepper, diced
*  white onion, diced
* Cilantro, diced (use as much or little as you enjoy)
* 1 tbsp red wine vinegar (can be substituted for balsamic, white  adjust to your taste)
* Salt to taste
* Jalapeno Peppers :)

Thats pretty
much it! As I said this was done very much by eye and by taste. Loaded it all
into a Kaiser bun with melted Swiss cheese. Enjoy!

Sorry if the formatting is bad, this is from my phone, I will fix it up when I get home from work.

I did two whole chickens in two weeks. The first I followed a recipe that said 6 hours and it was way too dry, the second time I was going to leave it in for 5.5 hours and ended up taking it out and shredding it an hour early; it was much better. The chickens were about the same size as well. I would say between 4 and 5 hours would be best. famous last wordsOh, no. Sorry. Didn't know this was r/slowcooking. Whoops. Dont keep this to yourself man, share the recipe!

Sounds and looks great.    I was going to say what a waste of bacon but good on you for using it up if it was about to go bad.How does the chicken meat behave if its been overcooked in a slow cooker? I imagine it still pulls apart/feels tender, though?I did the same recipe recently with boneless/skinless breasts and six hours was too long.  It was still edible and just fine for bachelor fuel, but I'd be a bit bummed if I was planning to take it to a potluck or something.I made [slow cooker gumbo](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2wcdex/mardi_gras_gumbo_a_successful_followup_links/) for Mardi Gras. If you are looking for something a little easier than the other recipes, give it a try. It was very tasty and got a lot of positive feedback.

Basic recipe is embedded in the link. See my comment for how I changed the recipe. I think the only thing I forgot to say was that I made the roux with butter and not oil Chicken burritos with rice and beans. It's an incredibly easy recipe, and then leftovers all week.

http://www.number-2-pencil.com/2014/10/01/slow-cooker-chicken-burrito-bowl/15 hours? I wonder if I've been taking my pork butts out too quickly. I know the meat is definitely cooked but it doesn't all fall apart like it should. It still has tough pieces of fat in it. Maybe I haven't left it in long enough for the fat to coagulate (is that the right term?)?Glad you enjoyed it. one of my favorites. I think it depends how you cook it. For your instance it's too long it will dry outI'd put it on low, I'm not sure how your slow cooker is but my tends to burn/crisp the edge of the pot a bit on high.You can do it in the slowcooker. Just don't cook it for too long. Chicken breasts overcook very quickly.

Probably the best way to do it would be to put the sauce and breast in, watch it carefully the first time, and when it comes to a simmer set a timer for 30 minutes. Check and see if it's done at that point, as it likely will be completely cooked by then.

Once you do it a few times you can time it so it's done but not overcooked./r/shittyfoodporn Will the sauce be ok in the slow cooker for that long?I'm a poor college student who very rarely cooks outside of using my slow cooker(I bought it to avoid cooking! :D) so I'm hoping that it could work in a slow cooker.

I like to cook my meals overnight for breakfast/lunch/dinner the next day.in a slow cooker though?Anything past five total, including cooking time and time to allow the shredded to sit in the liquid is too many. Rice 7/10
Rice with left over broth 10/10My experience is that chicken breast is dry after like 4 hours but chicken thighs can be cooked a lot longer. I think in your case it would be doable with thighs but I wouldn't suggest doing it with breasts.Chicken parm, hello? I wouldn't slow cook that combo. I would butterfly the chicken, toss it in a pan and saute it with some oil (and garlic if you have it) for like 5 minutes, throw in the sauce bring it to a simmer for another 5 minutes. Serve over some spaghetti, top with bacon bits and parmesan.

Start the pasta water 10 minutes before you start cooking the chicken, throw the spaghetti in a few minutes after you start cooking the chicken.

Butterflying the chicken is important here, as it will take 10-15 minutes to cook if you don't.I'd leave the bacon bits and cheese out until the end to top it, and just cook the chicken breasts in the sauce for a few hours.I often do curried goat (mutton works if you cannot find goat) or oxtail stew in the slow cooker.

Oxtail stew:
1KG / 2 1/4lb Oxtail (trim excess fat)

Dark beer like Guinness (stouts are best)

Beef stock cube

carrots cut into small rounds

onion roughly chopped

2+ garlic cloves finely chopped

3 Scallions / Spring onions chopped

2 tomatoes diced

1 TSP Pimento seeds (allspice) or powdered all spice (use 1/2 TSP powdered)

Thyme

Hot pepper (scotch bonnet if you can) seeded (Be careful handling these!)

Brown the oxtail in small batches and transfer to the crockpot. Lightly fry the onions and garlic in the same pan to pick up the flavours then add to the crockpot. Add the Pimento, beer, stock cube, carrots chillie and thyme. Leave it on low for about 6 hours, add the scallions and tomatos and leave for another hour or so until the meat is falling off the bone.

I think my crockpot runs a little hot so it may take a bit more time to cook or maybe a bit less, you will know it is done when the meat is very tender.

Google some other recipes and adjust as you want, I make this many ways, without tomatoes, with potato, with star anise, with sweet peppers....

Serve with rice and peas for a great Jamaican meal.
I don't pay much attention to the voting anyway.  But seriously, this is one of the best dishes at Mr. B's (next to their BBQ Shrimp) and usually mentioned as one of the best gumbos in town.  Recipe is directly from the restaurant.

Edit: I'm a NOLA Native.Leave out the bacon bits unless they are the real bacon kind.had it tonight - can confirm it was amazing. Thanks for the recipe!I guess I'm out there looking for the perfect slow cooker gumbo recipe when all I really have to do is apply the BEST gumbo recipe to a slow cooker!

I had forgotten I've already done my Seafood Creole in a crockpot when I would usually do it on the stove. I know it's really the roux and spice profile that is going to give it the flavor.

I appreciate the response!I don't think I would use almond flour. But you could try cornstarch which is used as a thickener instead sometimes. The point of the flour/butter is you want to make a roux that you add the broth to.

It's really not that much flour to be honest. And you want to let the butter/flour mixture cook a little bit to turn a nice golden brown color before you add more stuff to it. Figured at least the potatoe had to be carb, but like you say, you only need a little. Is there any thickener that is not carb-y? Could you use a little gelatine? I luuv my carbs, so just curious. I'm from south Louisiana. Although I've never had Brennan's gumbo this recipe looks spot on. The only difference from the way my family makes gumbo, is we use oil instead of butter for the roux.

Edit: not sure why your getting downvoted. This looks damn good. Cook *everything* in it! Vegetables! Potatoes! Pasta!Those are carbs too.

Anyway, you don't need a lot of it, so it's low-carb :PI use one of [these](http://www.johnlewis.com/oxo-good-grips-gravy-separator/p639297) to separate fat and juices.  The grid on top removes the big bits, most of the little bits get left behind with the fat.  If you're really anal you can strain through muslin/cheesecloth before using broth.  Best gravy ever.I think the flour mainly works as a thickener. Could you use maizena or potatoflour? You only need a table spoon, so it shoudn't mess up your diet too much, I think? Oh wow that sounds awesome. Thank you very much for the idea! You sound like a piece of shitYou are the only one complaining. I'm sorry I don't own a camera.Why post at all if the photo is that badA roux is a base made of butter and flour. Just throw some butter into a pan and toss some flour in with it to make like a paste consistency. It's to help thicken up whatever you're making. I use a roux when I melt cheese to make mac and cheese. You can use it to thicken gravy up as well.You could put the ceramic insert in the fridge and then just put it in and turn it on in the morning. Avoids the timer and the whole bacteria thing. I've seen a few recipes where you put frozen chicken breasts straight into a crock pot. Are those bad? Also what's even the point of a slow cooker if you have to cook your meat and vegetables before putting them in? Doesn't that kind of take away the whole point of it being easy meals? Jw cause I've only really done soups where I added frozen/raw meat and veggies and they've turned out fine. I just read in another thread that in order for it to really be carnitas that you have to fry/broil the pork and otherwise it's just pork tacos. Did you do that? Cause I'd love a recipe! "You eat with your eyes before your stomach"Thanks! It is super tasty and ingredients were not hard to find, that website has great stew recipes with alternate slowcooker options. I feel like you're breaking a fundamental rule of this subreddit by not posting the recipe.

POST IT!Alright that's what I figured. If I twist the lid it stays flush and closed but I just didn't know for sureMine does. Lid straight on bobbles as steam escapes. Twist it CW or CCW and steam escapes without noise.My super-easy-but-not-very-authentic version... Yes, I'm a single male :-P

* A large can of diced tomatoes... 28 oz I think?
* half a normal can of chicken broth.  I don't know the size, but they're like 50 cents.
* 1 bell pepper, de-seeded and diced small
* 3-5 celery stalks, diced.  If you aren't a huge celery fan, dice it smaller and it'll absorb the flavors more.
* 1 large yellow onion, diced
* 1 package of andoille sausage, sliced.  14 oz if I remember right.
* 1 tablespoon of cajun seasoning
* a tiny bit of extra thyme (stuff is strong, doesn't take much)
* A couple jalapeos, seeded and diced, or some extra cayenne.  I like spicy, so this is to give it a bit more kick.

Throw that all in the crockpot on high for like 3.5 hours.  I usually add the spices after a couple hours rather than at the start, but it works either way.

* some good rice, like thai jasmine rice
* 1 rotisserie chicken like from costco
* Some frozen, cooked, deveined, peeled, de-tailed shrimp

Start rice cooker (mine super-awesome one takes almost an hour, but cheap ones are faster)
Pull meat from chicken and throw it in.
Throw in some shrimp... like a pound

Let it cook for another half hour or 45 minutes so the shrimp can heat up and the chicken can mix in.  Serve a scoop or two over rice.

---

It's stupid easy and it freezes well before you mix it with rice.  I tend to freeze like 6 serving size containers, then just cook a bit of rice and nuke the gumbo in the microwave.  Makes for super-easy meals.

Also, very limited dishes... The meat is all pre-cooked, and the veggies soften up just fine without cooking them down first.  So it's a super-low-effort meal.

FWIW, this is the best rice cooker when you're cooking for one

http://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/nslac

It's expensive for a rice cooker, but damn, it makes mighty fine rice... I'm a rice snob.Doesn't the rice get mushy though?Oh God.  You just made my rice amazing.What is a roux? Does it make a sort of sloppy Joe mix?Oh okay! I will have to try that because I haven't had rice in my soupawesome!!Sorry it's with my phone. I don't actually own a camera.definitely take better pictures? but the idea reads tastyThis is from Alton Brown's Good Eats S10E15 Bowl o' Bayou Gumbo episode. I HIGHLY recommend it, as it is the easiest way to make a no-fail roux.

you people...Just put rice *in* the soup! (Quinoa is better in soup, though.)Do the above with a roux and the juice, then mix it with some vinegar, tomato paste, a l'il bit o' sugar, and spices, and a pound of (browned) ground beef. Boom, Bolognese/or-just-pasta sauce.Don't be so culturally insensitive!

https://clutchvictory.wordpress.com/2009/08/28/eating-out-of-a-toilet/This gumbo is one of the best in New Orleans.  Mr. B's is a Brennan family restaurant.

**Mr. B's Gumbo Ya Ya**

Making a roux is tricky business. Some pointers to keep in mind: cook your roux over moderately low heat because too high heat will cause the roux to speckle and if that happens youll have to throw it away and start over; add the flour gradually to the butter or oil; you must stir the roux constantly with a wooden spoon, your arm will get a workout; and never, but never leave your roux unattended.

This recipe makes a lot of gumbo, 6 quarts, so youll have enough for a big party or you can freeze some for later.

Ingredients

1 lb (4 sticks) unsalted butter

3 cups all-purpose flour

2 red bell peppers, in medium dice

2 green bell peppers, in medium dice

2 medium onions, in medium dice

2 celery stalks, in medium dice

1 1/4 gallon (20 cups) chicken stock

2 Tbs Creole seasoning (see below)

1 tsp ground black pepper

1 tsp dried hot red pepper flakes

1 tsp chili powder

1 tsp dried thyme

1 Tbs chopped garlic

2 bay leaves

2 Tbs kosher salt

1 lb andouille sausage, cut into 1/4 inch-thick slices

3 1/2 lb chicken, roasted and boned

hot sauce to taste

boiled rice as accompaniment

CREOLE SEASONING

1 1/2 cups paprika


3/4 cup ground black pepper

1/2 cup kosher salt

1/3 cup granulated garlic

1/3 cup dried thyme

1/3 cup dried oregano

1/3 cup dried basil

1/4 cup granulated onion

1/4 cup cayenne


1. In a 12-quart stockpot melt butter over moderately low heat. Gradually add a third of the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds. Add a third more flour and stir constantly 30 seconds. Add remaining third of flour and stir constantly 30 seconds. Continue to cook roux, stirring constantly, until it is the color of dark mahogany, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

2. Add bell peppers and stir constantly 30 seconds. Add onions and celery and stir constantly 30 seconds. Add the stock to roux, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Add all remaining ingredients except chicken, rice, and hot sauce and bring to a boil. Simmer gumbo, uncovered, 45 minutes, skimming off any fat and stirring occasionally. Add chicken and simmer 15 minutes. Adjust seasoning with hot sauce. Serve over rice.

Yield: 6 quartsThat looks delicious! Care to share the recipe?This was a big hit ! I'll use Mojo Criollo often, thanks.  By the way, I used a dry rub and the Mojo as a cooking liquid.  When it was done I strained and reduced about 1/2 of the liquid then added back to the pulled pork. Deeelish!Chicken recipe?! Looks super tasty - except my tastebuds like reject the flavor of mango salsa, although love pretty much all other forms. Really, I think ill do that instead of the soup. my answer to leftover broth is always "cook rice in it"!Hmmm I'll have to try that next time. Thanks!Whenever I do pulled pork in the crock pot, I pull it and then put it under the broiler for a few minutes. Caramelizes it, like giving it a sear would. Considering that it is my second roast ever I thought the same. But it is kinda hard to make a roast taste bad.Yep. I used it to make a spicy pork soup when I was sick. It was very good.that's true, I have picked out the big chunks of fat after other butts i've cooked, just never had as much fat as this oneif the wires look fine and it's just a little dusty it should be good to goI'm no expert, but usually the big slab of fat on a butt just comes off in one piece when I'm done cooking. I'd leave it.Huh. Good simple tip, thank you. You might call this "pork broth?"RIP OPGood call! Lol thanksThe thumbnail picture looks like a pile of dead humans. Nice roast though!Make a taco salad without chips.  I freeze almost everything in 1-2 cup containers.  Thawing and re-freezing food isn't good for it, so I keep my portions on the smaller side.  I generally freeze stock in whatever container fits it all, because I always use up all of my stock at once.  If you want smaller portions, you can always freeze it in an I've cube tray which allows you to break off what you need.

Defrosting is generally better in the microwave, as it allows your food to heat up quicker, which reduces the number of bacteria that form.  That said, I am guilty of throwing my containers in the sink for an hour while I do stuff around the house.

If you do burritos, I would wrap in waxed paper plus foil.  This will reduce freezer burn.  Also, they are easy to microwave once you remove the foil, and that way you don't have to find a container to heat them in.Can't do tacos cause of the tortillas. Beans are no go too. :(OK.  I saved this hoping for some new recipes.  None forthcoming, though, so here you go:

Chicken Tacos

8 frozen Chicken Breasts
1 jar salsa

Let it cook.  Top how you like your tacos.

Lil Smokies
1 package lil smokies mini hot dogs or cut up larger ones
1 bottle bbq sauce
1/2 cup honey
1/3 cup minced garlic

Let it cook.Pretty sure your boss was an alcoholic.  Real food poisoning is not something you get every 2 weeks, it is fucking crippling. I have found the more simple the better. I use the meat in many different dishes; carnitas, BBQ, Chinese food. So I keep it basic and season when I use the meat for its intended meal.


Chop an onion into chunks. Arrange loosley on the bottom of the slow cooker.


Peel a few garlic cloves and throw those in.


Rinse the pork butt or shoulder with cool water and pat dry.


Coat with Salt and pepper.


Place the butt in the crock pot 'meat' side down on the onions. The fatty top part should be looking you in the face. So the fat drips down while cooking.



Low for 6-8 hours depending on size.



Pull out shoulder meat and put on plate. Use forks to separate meat from fat. Bam.



Now this part is important. I just found this out recently and its awesome. Strain all the juice out of the stuff you have left into a mason jar. Put it into the fridge. The fat will separate. Throw that white top part out. The brown gelatinesque stuff left you can cook with anytime you want good pork flavoring. Cheers.

Do you know why it would say not to? Like does it ruin the crock pot or something? Good luck! Let us know how it turns out.Interesting toppings... Bet that was delicious!I have a 2.5 qt crock pot brand.  It cost me like $12.  You may also want to skim the fat off the broth and strain out the little bits.  Makes a smoother gravy.  I predict you will be fine but please let us know!You can always get some canned air and blast it in any holes you are worried about. I havent seen an unsealed slow cooker though... so im not quiet sure if there is actually anything to worry about, as long as it hasnt been damaged.HAHA get a thermometer dude. Undercooked meat kills people. Not me, but you know, people. My gut is a tank. I freeze all of my lunches for the week in Tupperware. I moved up to glass versions of the plastic ones mainly due to my inability of keeping the plastic ones usable. I usually package about 7 portions and toss them in the freezer. Ive had some frozen for as long as 1.5 weeks to 2weeks and they were just fine.Please come back with the results soon, OP!lol great. i don't have a thermometer, but i'm eating right now anyway. we'll see how this turns out, i guessThank you! I'll try that next time.The thing is I'm not really into potatoes and gravy (call me crazy, I know). I'm thinking about making a small beef stew.Are you "prone" to food poisoning? Honest question. I had a boss that got "food poisoning" like every 2 weeks. I myself have never experienced the unhappiness. Sometimes...there are ...jesus...unpleasant bathroom trips after sketchy eating. But never like he experienced.

I'd check the temperature of the meat. Over 160 you should be fine. I'm saying I'd eat it if it temped right. Not that you should! Good luck. Melt some butter in a pan, add some flour, stir it. Add salt, pepper, and the broth, whisk everything together. [Here's](http://www.foodgeeks.com/recipes/easy-chicken-gravy-19219) a recipe I found. :)I usually just wing it via smell/an idea. Chili is always a great starting place. Mexican style dishes are also super good to start with as well. Im on roughy the same diet and slow cook all of my lunches. It was my first time in a long time using it, so I set it before I went to bed and I completely forgot about it and just went to work. It's been sitting on the "warm" setting all day. Just got home. Kinda hungry. 4 chicken breasts... eat 'em or toss 'em?Would you mind explaining how to make a gravy? I never know what to do with the leftover juices. I'm currently 6 hours into slow cooking this.  The smell is incredible.  Followed your recipe exactly with the exception of the Chipotle sauce - added in some Sriracha instead.  Thanks for posting this!Why did you do this?  If you left it out for 9 hours before cooking, I would absolutely throw it away.  You can cook out bacteria, but they leave behind toxins and stuff that can't be killed with heat.  If you Cooked it for the 8 hours, and it's been sitting in the crockpot on warm... you might be able to eat it. Maybe.  If your crockpot doesn't automatically turn to warm and the food has been sitting at room temperature for 9 hours, it's garbage. I know people say you can set and forget a crockpot, but they don't mean for a full day.You could make a gravy with the broth.May I suggest this: http://www.chow.com/recipes/30356-easy-slow-cooker-pulled-pork

Best I've ever had. You could leave the tbsp of sugar out as mentioned.It was fantastic!
No, honestly I just had 3 slices that were going to go bad if not used within that week. the bacon just got mixed in and didn't add much flavor.I loved the hesitation in asking this.So do you think the bacon actually added anything or could you not really tell it was in there?EDIT: I actually have had gumbo once before at a place called The Boiling Crab in San Jose. There's was very liquid-y. I've never had Louisiana gumbo..

 I actually did make an attempt at roux, but forgot to write it in my description, but there is a pic of it. I would definitely do jarred roux next time as it took too long to make, great idea.

I think my gumbo tasted great. Maybe a bit salty, but great nonetheless. It was fun to make, except the roux stirring for 30 freakin' minutes.Yours looks better that the recipe. Cooked for about 8 hoursHas... Has it been cooking for 17 hours?That looks deliciousI use to walk around with the same stack of 10 or so papers when I wanted to go BS with coworkers and no one ever raised a brow. Looking back at it, I'm sure my supervisor knew.And even if there was a short of some kind the circuit breaker should trip before anything bad happened. Assuming your house wiring is good.Yeah I thought that too. When it soaked it it made the meat sooo juicy. Literally dripped from the sides of my mouth.I'm not gonna lie, the shots of just the brothy water looked a little gross to me (reminded me of dirty toilet water). But I love the shots of it on the plate. Looks juicy :)There are a *lot* of stories of stolen appliances in this thread. BRB going to chain all of my small appliances to the wall.Yeah I'm not detracting from your meal/recipe, I just noticed that Ray's is a go to sauce, but then people mix stuff with it that would just be over powered by the Ray's.Leroy meats. I usually don't like commercial products, but have enjoyed this one. They also have good prices on meat compared to Madison. I have the same red one! This looks great! Its like I can feel the healthy just looking at the pics!I got the same one at Costco too! Pulled chicken, pulled pork, pork chops, ribs, chili, etcThe only way I could imagine it going up in flames would be some sort of an electrical malfunction.

Same could happen for your fridge, TV, or anything you have plugged in at home. If you're worried just use it when you can attend to it for the full cooking time for the first time. As long as there are no problems, you're probably good to leave it unattended after that.Okay, then throw some bacon in that shit.I'm afraid that everything I'm finding has at least a couple of T. of brown sugar, but you could potentially leave that out.

Some guy on reddit proved it. With Scales of 1-10. Wtf I understand but my question is how safe it is after I haven't used it in over a year.They are very cheap, my local grocery store has them for $4 for a pack of 6.I did this with a pork roast I made, It was great.Yeah, isn't that the point....You bring up a good point I should have mentioned. Definitely prep ahead but don't leave the food sitting out. Only bring it out of the refrigerator when you are about to turn it on.I dont care about fat. Im skinny enough that some fat will do me some goodNot if you're trying to lose weight. I think the average diet for someone trying to lose weight is between 1500-1800 calories a day with exercise. The beans and rice are protein so you get some muscle bulk, especially if you're exercising regularly, but any calories you don't burn through the day are going to be turned into fat overnight.But the thing with my "new" crockpot is that it's been collecting dust in the garage for over a year so I'm not sure if there would be any electric problemsWhere in Horicon did you get it?! I live right outside of Slinger!I do it all the time. Not sure if its safe but I haven't heard anyone having any issues with it.I would not know, then, as I've not bought a nicer slowcooker and just have the knobby kind.I don't have a knob though, mine has a digital display and buttons. I don't know if it is safe, but it is time tested and mother approved.  Shouldn't be a problem. The longest I've run mine (a newish Crock Pot) is 5 days. No issues to speak of. I think you'll find many people who use slow cookers routinely leave them unattended.Well, you turn the knob to low or high, and set those to the time you want the outlet to send power to the slowcooker.  How do those push the start button for me? Ooh yes! We grow TONS of tomatoes here (Michigan) in the summer. I am going to make tons of slow cooker sauce to stock in the freezer :)Used my tiny one for keeping hot sauteed mushrooms (made on the stove with added goodness of wine and spices) mixed with smoked Gouda cheese.  Used as a topping for hamburgers for a summer BBQ.  Cheesy mushroomy deliciousness all hot and melty (thanks tiny slowcooker) on top of a delicious hamburger.  Mmm.  My g/f and I have 6 slow cookers!  Made spaghetti sauce couple days ago.  Can't wait for summer to come again to the Northwest and we can use 3 or 5 at the same time and have our summer slow cooker backyard parties! Did no-one say "Brady Bunch"?That little baby one is the star of the show on Super Bowl Sunday. Little queso dip, little tortilla chips. It's his time to shine. Diri Kole (Haitian Rice-n-Beans)

Serves 4-5 people as a side dish (If you want more, double the rice,water, Rapunzel, coconut milk, and cloves)

2 + tbsp olive oil.
1 tbsp coconut oil.
3 (or more) scallions (onions can be substituted).
3 cloves garlic.
2-3 cubes Rapunze Bouillon.
1 - 14 oz can of beans (black or kidney work best) can do 2 cans for more bean:rice.
2 cups of rice.
2 cup water.
14 oz can of coconut milk.
5 whole cloves.
0.5 tsp salt (to taste).

Opt: you can substitute chicken/veggie stock for water.

Dice the garlic and the white part of the scallions (you can also use the green part of the scallion - the Haitians don't, but I do). Saute (High) this in 3 tbsp oil, add the coconut milk and allow it to simmer. Add the rice and mix in then add whole can of beans (with liquid), water, cloves and diced up Rapunzel cube(s). I've been measuring the coconut milk, bean water, and water to exactly the 2-to-1 water/rice ratio. Bring to boil, mix, and then turn down to a simmer. When done and all the liquid is absorbed, fluff with a fork and mix the beans in with the rice.
IF you have a pressure cooker, I saute the onions, garlic, oil then add coconut for 1 minute. Then add everything else and set your cooker. When done try to remove the cloves (they will rise to the top with the beans) before fluffing &amp; mixing beans in with rice.I was thinking more on a "per person" basis. I know the amount would definitely want different amounts, but again, "rule of thumb".I liked the recipe a lot. I didn't think anything was destroyed or ruined, and it was a simple meal to make which was why it was so appealing. You may of course change whatever you like or not try it at all, that's what recipes are all about. :)NICE! You could prepare food for a month in just one day with that collection.sounds like some mighty fine incense   :)go on...I have no idea but it looks like that model comes in 4 and 6 quart. Same thing happened when I got married.  I had two, she had two, and we got another as a gift.  You could certainly do a layered dip.I understand being tired of okra, if you decide you want to try it use creole canned okra, it doesn't require cutting and is less slimy.

As to cooking with peppers, I only use them when appropriate. They're necessary for all southern Louisiana cuisine, but they don't go in everything I cook by any means. Well you could certainly try it out, but I would stick to items like veggies and sauce that really only need to be warmed. I don't think it will do much for cooking.

When I did tomato soup, I used crushed tomatoes, a little tomato paste, some cream, basil, salt, pepper, then an immersion blender once it looked warm and tasted right.

I could see veggie soup, or minestrone working in there, but just knows the temp just gets to warm-ish (it is hot, but not cooking through meat hot). Ok, since I'm thinking of doing this, and I don't have a smaller crock pot.  What size is the one you're thinking is perfect?I don't know... At my old work, there were women who were actually caught *plotting* to steal a small 3 mini crock pot stand. The owner swore to never bring it again because they were serious.

There's people like that out there. :/http://www.food.com/recipe/slow-cooker-chicken-noodle-soup-198707 here you go. I subbed the noodles for Brown rice and it was quite tastyGonna need dat recipe. Haha! Well, I actually gave one away last night, so I took the picture before I broke up the family. Guy I was giving it to thought I was straight up bonkers. Haha, I definitely did a small pork roast or two in one of the little ones. The whole dorm floor smelled so damn good.I think I am going to try that next time. Variety is the spice of life. Tabasco is the spice for everything else. I cook with celery and onions a lot for soups and stuff but I need to add in the peppers too. It was damn good.

SO and I arent huge fans of okra. We picked a couple hundred pounds of it one time and haven't been able to use it since.To be honest, I'm not much of a cook either. It's not all that hard, really the only thing you have to do is not let the roux burn.

We' browned the chicken &amp; sausage in a different pan.Thanks! I appreciate all compliments, but especially those from LA. I wish I could have gone down to Louisiana but I am but a poor recent graduate.

I've never made it before but I've definitely had it before. I've been to NO once when I was in middle school. My dad was splitting his time between CA and LA and we spent a spring break there. Plus my family has always had a love for New Orleans. In fact every person in my immediate family made either gumbo or etoufee! And we love to eat at [Palace Grill](http://palacegrill.com/) which claims to be the best cajun food outside of Louisiana, and I believe it. awwww, I was really hoping I could make soup for one or some sides. thanks anyways for the reply.&gt; Someone nabbed it at a party.

Holy Shit. You need Liam Neeson.haha, okay, now I don't feel so bad owning 3.Why was this downvoted? just keep pouring cups into it until you reach the fill line. Or an empty 500ml bottle.To play Devil's Advocate for a bit, it was probably someone who was planning on bringing their identical one to the party but had to change plans at the last minute (or they simply forgot to grab it on the way to the party). They still had it in their mind they brought theirs so when they left they simply grabbed the one that looked just like theirs and left.

Once they got home and noticed they "stole" someone's crockpot they were too embarrassed to return it.#####&amp;#009;

There is this one too: http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-IP-DUO60-Programmable-Generation/dp/B00FLYWNYQ

I've never used it, but it lists all sorts of functions: "7-in-1 Multi-Functional Cooker--Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Saute/Browning, Yogurt Maker, Steamer &amp; Warmer".

Looks overly complicated to me, but hey if it floats your boat.I'd be surprised if it got hot enough to cook much of anything in. It's pretty much designed to keep dips hot. Apparently you can make oatmeal, though.I've never seen a cast iron crock pot insert, but someone on here was talking about a cooker they got that can sear meat then change to slow cooking when ready. I'll see if I can dig up the link.

Edit: looks like this is the one I was thinking of, but it is not cast iron. http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-IP-DUO60-Programmable-Generation/dp/B00FLYWNYQ
I used mine for cheese and chocolate fondue. It really only gets to temps that I would consider warming.

I've done tomato soup too, but that really only needs to warmed as well.Potato bake! Thinly sliced potatoes, layered with cheese, bacon and onion. Once the crock is almost full,  pour over some cream mixed with a half pack or so of dry onion soup mix. Cook on low until soft and delicious.I use a Hamilton Beach on sale at Wal-Mart for 40bucks. Super happy. Seconding /u/UESC_Durandal's good advice. A slow cooker sounds ideal for your situation. It can't do everything, but we frequently put dinner together in the removable crock the night before, put it in the refrigerator, then move it to the cooker in the morning (I don't want to chop onions at 5 a.m.). It's a great tool if you're going to be away from home for a long day.Exactly why Best Buy has a Loss Prevention dude in front.Awesome! I want to make this now, too!

I'm probably buying a slow cooker today, and I have zero experience with them. What program should I use? There's Buckwheat, Pilaf, Milk porridge, Cake, Stew and Steam. The one I want to buy doesn't have a heat level setting.Both links are dead nowALL THE LAMB SHANKS!!I'd suggest investing in a microwave rice cooker.  I got a Viking brand one for $8, I can make jasmine rice in about 17 minutes and it's maybe one degree worse than my giant $70 rice cooker.  It's easier to make small quantities of rice than freezing it and ruining the flavors.I think a lot of people may have brought dishes with them and it was easy for someone carrying one out to blend in. It could have even been an accident.You know, I do have a tendency to ignore product directions (you're not the boss of me!), so I think this might be the most likely explanation!  I really am my own worst enemy sometimes.Man, and to think I was pissed about the time someone took what was left of my bag of chips home with them.. Sorry for your lossNice post Kathryn! Look for Moroccan tagine recipes. While many have meat, some don't, and there's so often many veggies in a given recipe, you can simply omit the meat. Some of my faves involve [butternut squash, apricots, and chickpeas](http://mongoliankitchen.com/vegetable-moroccan-tagine/).

Thanks.cheese dips, my favorite last week was chilli and cheeseOh my god that looks amazing.i like to stretch my leftover slowcooker meals with rice as well.  works great.The little one is amazing for hot lunches Understood.  I recently had some deep fried pickles that were over seasoned and it *almost* ruined them for me.  But, you know.  Deep fried.

The soup looks great and reminds me of a recipe my friend used to make but couldn't remember the recipe when I recently asked him.  Once I give this a shot I'll be sending it his way for old time's sake.

As a token of my appreciation, let me share [this recipe](http://www.instructables.com/id/Slow-Cooker-Kalbi-Ribs/) with you.  I substitute the ribs for boneless, skinless chicken thighs (mainly because they're easier to find than short ribs).  I've never used a tomato before and I use half a bulb of garlic, not 12 cloves as the recipe says.  I use my garlic press for that.  I'll also add a tablespoon or so of mirin to the mixture.  Four hours on low ought to do the trick.  I serve with white rice and top with sesame seeds, green onion and sambal.  Add a scoop of mac/potato salad and a King's Hawaiian roll and you've got yourself a plate lunch.  One of my favorites.blending onions also makes them taste terrible. it's a really really bitter taste that comes out when you blend them. makes stuff inedible. Brisket?I didn't notice what sub this was posted in and my first thought from the thumbnail was that those were all urns.I am stuck in a hotel because of a recent ice storm right now,but as soon as I make it home will post some. I know what I'm having this slow cooker Saturday!!! Thank you so much!!Awesome, that's what I was thinking, but I wanted to be sure before I started investing.  Thanks a bunch!You are welcome! I would say if you do make it watch how much seasoning you add, mine were a little too strong in this regard. The soup though was on point. https://media.giphy.com/media/M4qniv1El5q6Y/giphy.gifYou had me at "dredged".  Thank you!I have the set on the left-- just used the small one for a Valentine's day chocolate fondue :)Sliced the zucchini thin, the thinner the better as they will be crispier. I only used one zucchini so I used one egg, 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs then added varying amounts of garlic powder, basil, black pepper and red pepper flakes. I think you can really season it with whatever you want. So I then dipped the slices into the whipped egg, then dredged (Correct use of cooking terminology?) that through the bread crumb-seasoning mix to get it nice and evenly coated. I put these on a foil that was lightly coated with oil. Baked on 475 for 7 minutes, flipped and then baked again for 10-12 minutes until nice and crispy.

Based of this as well as comment suggestions: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-zucchini-chips/awwww the baby crock pot is so cuteThis looks yummy.  What did you do to make the zucchini chips?Controlling portion size and not being the entire meal. I eat it with cheese, sour cream, and occasionally guacamole or fritos. Beans are also very filling - I don't need much.1. Take rice cooker as if it is yours - pack it up without hurry, etc.
2. Walk out of party.
3. No one notices, because they're there to party, not to be the rice cooker police.

If you don't look suspicious, if it appears that what you're doing is commonplace, nobody will ever question you. It's true at all levels and in all settings, whether it's with your rice cooker at a party or in a controlled-access secure building. If you don't look out of place - if you look and act as if you're supposed to be in the place you are, and you are supposed to be doing whatever you are doing - people will likely ignore you. Particularly vigilant people might furrow their eyebrows, but not say anything out of fear of social repercussions for being wrong.

This is a serious issue in security. Given some secure location with supposedly controlled access that does not have a dedicated entry control security guard, anyone can probably get in with sufficient preparation - simply dress like everyone else, have a pass or badge that looks like everyone else's, and walk with purpose, and someone will hold the door for you and wish you a good day. Even if they're supposed to challenge you.Party at OP's house! 1. Short answer: yes. Long answer: It depends. Some things can take forever to cook. Some things can easily over cook. It's fine, and in fact common to throw uncooked meats in with veggies and cook them. As you learn to use the tool you will find that some things are best pre seared (like meats, for browning aka flavor) and some things are best added at the end of cooking (like noodles).

2. You will get different answers from different people. I will say that I have personally done this without issue. Since the slow cooker, if used properly, pasteurizes food and is sealed due to the moisture barrier created around the lid, the food should be safe if unopened. If you were to say have it on warm, open the lid, serve a bunch of food with a potentially contaminated spoon, allow it access to the air, then replace the lid... all bets are off.

I would suggest that you read a few recipes, get a good book or even just start hitting up the internet for recipes and follow those. Do the first few batches when you're home so you can get a feel for it. Once you've kind of gotten your head around the device, doing things like putting on chili or pot roast for dinner right before you leave the house isn't uncommon way to use a crock pot. Just make sure it's left in a safe area it isn't going to be messed with or against something potentially flammable and it's fine.

The slow cooker is a great tool, but it is still just a kitchen tool. So you can achieve some really cool things from it, but it still takes some learning to get the most out of it. Good luck. :)[Right??](https://38.media.tumblr.com/bd6b726eec91134adb3c2f4628c1cb39/tumblr_n96kx9ETUT1twkr8eo1_400.gif)1 liter = 7 meals? How!?The soup tasted really good and made about 8 portions.

Yup 2,500 year old pure good slow cooked human fleshalcohol, everyone is outside when you leave, you nab it before you even leave the party and then come back in, but mostly you would have to be broke and not a friend or have a problem stealing... but most likely your best bet would be to start with whomever is the most broke. because unless you have a problem, a rice cooker is like 15 bucks and not worth the loss of friends if caught. so a broke person who's not your friend. I have one and use it for dips and sauces. Last time was for a sundae buffet at work. It kept the caramel sauce nice and warm.

I've also used it for chocolate dip and at Christmas when I made chocolate dipped cookies it always keeps the chocolate at the right temperature.oh, sorry. A container. like they have for ketchup. Thumbnail looked like an egyptian mummy. Which wouldn't be so bad except that I saw it was in the slowcooker subreddit which made me a bit afraid.I have a little one, and it definitely cooks. I'm a university student cooking just for me and any more and I'd be thoroughly sick of whatever I was cooking, but this size (about a liter, but I bought it in the states so it's probably a quart) is perfect. I have an awesome baked pinto bean recipe, and one batch in my little one will last me seven meals.I love mine, too. I got it at a garage sale unsure that I'd really use it but it's great for dips and sauces.I just got a mini one that came with a large big one (thank you Costco) I'm looking forward to using it to make overnight steel cut oats. I've always wondered what to do with the tiny one. Any good recipes?You are absolutely correct.  I misspokeShred a pork shoulder. I had a 3 lb one and it made 2 dinners and one lunch for two people. I made carnitas tacos last night, Qdoba tonight and bbq pork for lunch today.Single portion...yes.  Anything more than that and there is not enough room.  I have one...works great for like buffalo chicken dip, spinach dip, etc.Especially the bone in shoulder roasts. That thick fat layer just soaks down into the meat. Yum! RIP slowcookerIt's awesome stuff! I tried the off-brand once and it was awful. Some things you just have to buy the name brand, ya know? How the devil does someone walk  out of your house with a rice cooker, and no one notices?I've used Pork loin a few times and it has come out well, even if it is a more lean type of meat.

I've tried [this recipe](http://addapinch.com/cooking/balsamic-pork-tenderloin-recipe/) a few times it it's pretty good, I just would recommend you not let it sit on low while at work because especially with a loin you want to err on the side of undercooked.The only thing i cook on high is a soup recipe I use. Everything else goes for 8-10 hours. And it all turns out damned good.Ah why buy the crock when you get the stew for freeIt happened to me. People cleaning up after a wake sent mine home with the wrong persons husband who had no idea. Never got it back and didn't want to make a fuss. I love multi-race families.Rice cooker!  Someone stole my rice cooker at a thanksgiving dinner I hosted! Those basterds!

EDIT: Thanks for all the explanations guys.  /u/HugsAllCats much like what a lot of people said.  Wife and I were already drunk and exhausted.  Football was playing.  But more importantly, THE ENTIRE KITCHEN was covered in dirty dishes, pots, pans and various appliances.  It wasn't until tomorrow when we cleaned the kitchen we noticed "we had a theif in our midst".  We have a suspicion who it was but we decided to let it go. Omg why have I never thought of this?!  I have a very small slow cooker that would work perfectly.  Nickelback this.

http://m.imgur.com/a/uklTRI've got the big guy on the left. It's awesome.The best way would probably be roast, pull, then sauce and reduce on stove top. Or a Dutch Oven on the stove top after searing the outsides.

Don't get me wrong, I use a crock pot, I am lazy sometimes. Yeah, that's my problem. I loved my slow cooker when I was a student because my days were irregular, so I'd use it when I either left late or knew I'd be home early. But now I leave for work at 8am and often don't get home until 6pm so the thing runs too long, even on the low setting.

I've just ordered a pressure cooker, I'm hoping to start using that instead with ingredients prepared over the weekend because the slow cooker just isn't working for me any more.I was under the impression that those ones don't cook they just warm..like melting cheese or chocolate. I have one but I have not used it yet.That's crazy like they had to have a backpack or large purse with them to smuggle it out... maybe that narrows it down?I like my slow cooker because i can make large quantities of pretty good food with minimal effort. I'm not going to delude myself into thinking it's top notch food, but there's certainly nothing wrong with the stuff I make in it. It's really convenient. Please give further detail as I have never heard of oven made roux...intrigued. Thx.You can bet I will be on the look out for it. Weren't too many people at the party, so maybe I will find it. How do you translate this to work in the slow cooker?&gt; *"Brown if you must, but there is no real difference in the outcome..."*

&amp;nbsp;

anybody out there found this to be true?  false?If you hate slowcookers, then why the fuck do you look at this sub?I made that NC BBQ recipe that was posted here recently. I left it in for 7.5 hours, not 6 like the recipe said, and it still came out great. Pork can take a fair amount of abuse.Who steals a crock pot, honestly?This is completely false. At least my slow cooker makes something good that I like.If you want to defrost things quickly, just put stuff in a waterproof bag (ziploc works just fine IMO) and submerge it in cold water, defrosts much faster than letting it sit in the fridge. has anyone ever used the little tiny ones for cooking a single portion of meat?  the directions for mine specifically said not to but, c'*moooon*... how can you resist?!Agreed. Maybe he was cooking on high or for one. When cooking a 3-4lb pork butt, it's anywhere from 8-10 hours on low. I've never cooked on high. Always low and slow for my purposes.Brown before crocking. Reduce juices after in a separate pan. How would you make pulled pork?

I'm interested because it might be better. I know! Sucks, right? Went to pick it up at the end of the night and it was just gone. Thought maybe someone had stuck it in the kitchen but nada. It was pretty new, too. :( You should get little party hats for them all and snap a picture like that.  Celebration time!I stand by my statement. Browning is too good to pass up.

Yes pulled meat in the crock pot will be easier, but between being able to brown the meat and being able to better reduce the juices at the end the stove top would make a superior pulled meat too.I'm sorry for telling you that something you like is kind of lame, but that's the way life is sometimes.No problem. I forgot that you should shred the chicken as well if you go that route.LIESHey, I noticed these are all things you cook a long time at a low temperature.Who... *does* that?!Oops didn't really notice that typo, I had bone-in. The original recipe copied  had boneless. 4 hours is the max time in the danger zone, going by food guidelines. Danger zone is above 40*F or below 140*F. The issue isn't necessarily with the bacteria themselves, but that the bacteria are eating and excreting in that time. The bacteria will die, but certain strains excrete nastiness that will make you very likely to get sick. The restaurant I worked in had a 2 hour time for themselves and anything over that you tossed it. And this was at an *Applebees,* so not exactly anywhere good. I, personally, wouldn't trust it. Maybe if it's beef or a vegetarian meal.Lol k.Pot Roast, Sloppy Joe's, Corned Beef and Cabbage, Kielbasa and Sauerkraut?That is hilarious, I use the Lipton Onion Soup mix all the time! I use it in my pot roast, meatballs, and my roast chicken (the gravy comes out incredible, yo!).

I don't know, though, mine still falls apart in the normal cooking time. 6-8 on low or 3-4 on high gives me meat I can barely pick up to get out of the pot. If I want to shred it I just sort of need to touch it. My gods, these sound absolutely amazing. Also, I did not know that you could get boneless ribs. My mouth is now watering at the possibilities!No photos of prep, but otherwise they go

1: immediately after start

2: 4 hours

3: Extra carrots and red potatoes, covered in salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and a healthy dose of olive oil. Put in an oven preheated for 400F for 30-40 minutes, stirring halfway through

4: 6 1/2 hours in

5: platedPulled pork?

Pulled beef?


Recipe from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2jkexx/sriracha_countrystyle_pork_ribs/) reddit post 4 months ago with a few minor changes:

1 1/2 lbs. boneless country-style pork ribs x2

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/2 bottle of Sriracha extra hot chili sauce

2 cups Barbeque sauce of your choice

1/3 cup balsamic vinegar

3 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce

2 Tbsp. mustard

2 Anaheim chiles, deseeded and membranes taken out

2 sliced onion

2 cloves garlic, stuffed in pork

2 large carrots

2-3 mushrooms

Put a layer of sliced onions, carrots, mushrooms on the bottom of the cooker to help keep the meat from sticking or burning. Then mix all remaining ingredients except the ribs. Dip the ribs and lay them in the cooker. Pour sauce over the ribs until it's about 1/4 of the way up the ribs. Cut the chiles in half and lay on top, pour rest of sauce on top until it is about 1/2 way up ribs

That's awesome. I love the baby cookers for dips and sauces. I recently lost mine. Someone nabbed it at a party. Gonna have to get a new one. Is that really a good standard to judge food by? I could have as quick a meal by grabbing a hunk of cheese, a piece of fruit, and a jar of peanut butter.

I do think slow cookers have their place, but I cannot think of a dish that wouldn't come out better done on the stove top.Yeah. I've been doing chili overnight or on weekends. I sleep roughly 6 hours &amp; that seems to work great.Looks like you're all set for the housewarming.How much BBQ is a "thing of?"Looks damn good for a non Louisiana native. I personally like mine super dark and thick but I'd happily partake in this one as well.

Good job!I actually like to cook my pork roasts for almost 24 hours in the crock pot!  I start it Saturday night and by Sunday night it is juicy, tender, pull-apart yumminess!   I've been cooking pork roasts this way for years and I've got friends addicted to it. Some of them will troll the juices at the bottom of the pot, looking for any last bits of meat. Ha.ha...

(Shoulder roast, lots of fat, two packages of Lipton Onion Soup mix poured on top - BAM! So good!) Sous vide is basically as easy as slow cooking, but with more control and vastly better results.While I did read to the end, I still do not get how his food ended up like mush. You would have to put it on HIGH for 8 to 10 hours instead of the LOW setting that every slowcooker recipe recommends.SeperateIf it was indeed brand new, instructions on mine told me to power on the crock pot and let it warm up once before use.  House smelled of burning plastic or whatever for about 45 minutes and after a quick scrubbing of the pot, I was off and running!

This is all to say: if you pulled it right out of the box and got right down to cooking, maybe the cause of the strange flavor is from first-time usage or whatever (burning off all those trace chemicals from production--or something).Try making your roux in the oven if you find yourself burning it. Looks awesome, I am going to have to try this out for tomorrow night.Well, I like my croc kpot when convenient or for certain dishes, but for the most part something you can cook in a crock pot will always come out better on the stove top. For once someone made REAL gumbo in a slow cooker. If there's no roux it ain't gumbo. If there's no trinity (celery, onions, and peppers) it ain't gumbo.

Personally I like okra in mine, but this is the first time I've seen a gumbo on this sub that hasn't made me want to slap the OP.Could easily get rid of the Ray's and use tomato paste/sauce.

I don't get why people are so content to toss Ray's on food then proceed to season the food with things that get destroyed by the flavor of the sweet bbq?I started the article a bit insulted, and then warmed up to the author by the end.

He has different expectations of the food that comes out of the slow cooker. While I accept the (so very minor) imperfections in a meal that's been left too long in a slow cooker, he wants a perfect meal any time he uses it.This looks amazing, and I'm going to give it a shot, but I'm not much of a cook at all.  Do you brown the chicken and sausage in the same saucepan as the roux, or do you keep them separate?I've never heard anyone speak ill of the slowcooker before.

well no, i lie.  a woman at work cursed her slow cooker out because she used it to keep meatballs warm at a potluck, and the cord died.Sure, but the point of a slow cooker is ease of use.  Most stuff could be made quicker and more easily in the oven or pressure cooker or sous vide, but the point of slow cookers is you throw all that shit in a pot and go about your day.  Though I've never cooked with a pressure cooker or sous vide, so I'm not sure how difficult those methods are.  They don't seem particularly hard, but just require different hardware.no need to brag...I don't, I have a few of my own. But... wait for the caveat....

I will admit that anything you can do in a slow cooker would be better if prepared by either pressure cooking or SV.I also feel like theres an urge to make every recipe work in the slow cooker and thats just dumb.  I get the whole idea of slow cookers being convenient so people like to use them, but I mean a microwave is more convienient than boiling a pot of water for pasta, but that doesnt mean im microwaving my pasta, right?

A slow cooker is a tool.  It is not a all purpose cooking solution.  Looks like I'm doing gumbo this weekend. Thanks!  :)I really enjoyed the article!  I just used that quote because it was so golden.  Funny how many people didn't bother to read it.lolz.  I wrote this at 6:30 in the morning on my way to work. As soon as I posted it I noticed all the errors.  I may have let out an evil chuckle thinking about inevitable posts like yours.Make frozen burritos. You can make a chicken salsa, pulled meat, a whole chicken you can shred, etc., and put it in the burrito or over rice.Dear god, does this mean I like Nickelback?

This is my first time contemplating suicide.I start most of my meals on my lunch. But I understand most people don't have the luxury of going home for lunch. Sometimes I think, shit this only cooked for 4 hours, turns out chicken doesn't need much more time than that.For every one of us, there's probably a dozen people with a crock pot in their kitchen that's never been used.Heating up may kill bacteria, but some foodborne illness is caused by bacteria toxins, not an active infection, and those aren't destroyed by heat. That being said, I'm sure plenty of recipes are fine to be left at room temperature for a little while, I'd look up food safety guidelines for the ingredients before trying it.i love going out on errands or what have you for an afternoon and coming home to a chili house or w/e delicious concoction ive thrown in there&gt;"Slowercookers are like Nickleback, they sell like crazy and a lot of people hate them.

1) When does the quote end? WHEN DOES IT END? Is the rest of my existence part of this quote? HAS THIS ALL BEEN SAID BEFORE?

2) Slowercookers...slower than your average slow cooker?

When I looked at the pictures you posted, I actually assumed you dropped in during the festivities and had some of our local fare.

That's a damn fine looking Gumbo you've made.

Have you had it before this?I frequent your subreddit and I hate slowcookers.  I even own one and use it periodically.  Actually, what I really hate is all of you, but I hate the slow cooker too.

You basically force ingredients into these things that result in just the most disgusting versions of the dish imaginable.  A lot of you have this perverse impulse to try to make ANYTHING in the slow cooker.

The reality is that only a very small subset of dishes you make are going to be decent in a slow cooker.  I understand that you mostly believe you are saving time and that you acknowledge the lesser product slow cooking produces from a lot of recipes, but you're often not saving time, you're just unfamiliar with the alternative or your kitchen skills could use some improvement. You gain some minor flexibility with your preparation and cook times, and sacrifice more quality than you even realize.  Of course, there's a a tipping point where a different method would simply be too involved and if you want a reasonable approximation of the dish a slow cooker is a good option, but that's not the bulk of what you guys are doing with these things and you know it.  I just have to google "chicken slow cooker reddit" and I can pull a massive list of examples.

Obviously, to each his own.  I don't really "hate" you guys, but I do find you exasperating a lot of the time, and you're very much untrustworthy when it comes to recipes and reviews of recipes.

I'm 34, if I were having my friends over for a dinner party and mentioned I made something in the slow cooker they'd say "really?" with their noses a bit turned up.  Or they'd be curious how I managed to make something delicious for them in one (because they know I would try not to feed them trash).  Hell, my parents would react the same way.  And they're not finicky or snobby about food, it's just not the sort of stuff you should be serving to company unless it's a really limited subset of dishes that are conducive to slow cooking.

edit: I'm not exactly expecting to be upvoted here, but remember your reddiquette please.
just the 1 cup of water. The only mistake you can make is opening the lid to peak too much and letting the humidity out (which can dry out meat)


I made a couple pot roasts for my first attempts and I was too excited the second time and kept sniffing it. It was dry-ish on the inside D:Are you really risking a foodborne illness if it's only going to be sitting around for like 4 hours (likely still cool due to it all packed together in a pretty insulated container) and if it heats up enough to kill any bacteria anyways? Well, there's the fact that I'm still alive over a year later. But thanks for looking out for my health!Yup. Definitely. A pound makes about 30 wraps the way I make them.
this is where I got it from http://www.food.com/recipe/hawaiian-crock-pot-chicken-467722 and the recipe underneath it cooks on high for 4 hours.  The most important thing is to make sure it's not undercooked.I was soooo waiting for this!  LOL!If it gave off a taste, I'm assuming the toxin would be there, too.  It is NOT A TUUUUUUMORThis one is a biweekly favorite.

Vegetarian Chili

assuming toxin was releasedSorry to hijack, would you cook this on 'HI'? I always thaw my chicken first because ZOMG GERMS, but it's a royal pain to remember to pull the chicken out of the freezer two days before I plan to eat it.My two biggest problems aside from not being active enough in the winter are

* Snacking. Easy to fix, stop buying snacks.
* Portion control. Something like this seems like it would be much easier to measure portions for.Some parts are. At the same time over the last few years I feel like I have seen a huge rise in restaurants offering different styles of slow cooked beef and pork. At least here in Sweden. Slow cooking is very trendy, and even the fanciest restaurants will have some of it on their menu - especially the ones which are also big on craft beers and/or "high quality produce".

Now, maybe many of them don't use a slow cooker, but neither do I, just wack the oven on a low heat and use a solid cast iron pan. Bing bang boom, delicious pulled pork or whatever you are up to.#####&amp;#009;

A lot of people hate slowcookers.  And by 'a lot', the author means people that sleep 12 hours, work 12 hours, and have no way to acquire a crock pot with a timer or even a $5 wall socket lighting timer.Unfair comparison... Slow cookers are actually good.Even on low that's just too long! And with a timer, you're still risking foodbourne illness until it kicks on just to get it to come out right.

I feel like slow cookers are the best for a lazy Sunday, or that Tuesday in the middle of the week where you're not really doing anything but you do have some errands to run. Really appreciate the comment. I promise to give them a try.Yup.  It's actually one of the things my doctor recommended when I was pregnant, because I was having trouble with anemia. Thanks.I hear [these](http://www.amazon.com/Woods-50006-Indoor-24-Hour-Mechanical/dp/B006LYHED0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424293746&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=outlet+timer) work great for people who work long hours.  It allows for a delayed start.The time is exactly why you use it.  Heck, I'm seriously considering buying a smaller slowcooker and putting stuff in it the night before work.  Then, bringing it in and using the 4 hours until lunch to cook a fresh lunch.  Late to the party here, I was planning on making this. Question, and I'm not trying to be that guy. "Oh, you have never had a Lousiana gumbo? You're from California?"

But have you had a Louisiana gumbo? This recipe seems to be in the correct direction. Just curious so I could "gauge" the taste of the end result.

Also I saw below where you omitted the roux. You can buy jarred roux which I have used in a pinch. Standing at the stove for 30 minutes constantly stirring defeats the purpose of an "easy" meal. Honestly, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between a jar and fresh. It's oil and flour, not much you can do to change the flavor profile of that!! Truth be told I planned on using the jarred this time since I don't want to worry about it this time.

Thanks in advance!! "All the News That's Fit to Print."  Go fuck yourself New York Times. Ooh, this looks delicious. I was just trying some cajun recipes in my slow cooker over the weekend. I think this has to be next in the list!Yup. I work 10 to 12 hours a day &amp; can't seem to get it to come out right.It actually isn't a bad article. I wouldn't bash on it if you haven't read the whole thing. The author also presents some nice recipes you can try in your cooker -- I doubt he'd do that if he was really hating on the slow cooker. And the fact that it can make your house smell fantastic all day long.A lot of people, mostly foodies, but obviously you won't find them on /r/slowcooking. Anything you can do in a slow cooker you can do in a Dutch oven with probably [marginally] better results, mostly just because you have more control. But who cares. If you cook with a slow cooker and it tastes good to you, that's what matters.a "nobody goes there anymore it's too crowded" articleWell you're not gonna find anyone on this sub that does... the new ones with the mandatory food safety settings (at least 4 hr high, 6 hr low) annoy me though. They should trust us to use meat thermometers and determine when our own damn meat is cooked.And the meals (like the songs) are all the same.

(Just joking)Hells yes.  Skinless does cost more.  On the other hand, you'll lose quite a bit of weight from skin and fat.  If you do decide to deskin and defat (not hard, just time consuming and a bit slimy), make sure to buy more poundage than you are expecting to eat.  About a quarter to a half pound of tissue will be lost, on average.Just set a timer for it to start cooking 3 hours after you leave. If the ingredients are frozen or even just cold when you leave for work, there shouldn't be an issue.where's the liquid in this recipe?  I used beef brothAgreed 100%. I bought an enameled Dutch oven recently and my slow cooker has been collecting dust. What comes out of my Dutch oven is ten folds better than my slow cooker. Plus it's much more versatile. I can deep fry in it and make one pot pasta meals. I believe you!  I think I overcooked mine.  I will give it a whirl.  Thanks so much for responding :)Oh yes, definitely. I don't think there's a meal out there that can *only* be done in a slow cooker. If I have time I'll cook dinner like you described. If I'm away from home for most of the day and still want that nice hearty meal I'll throw the stuff in the slow cooker and go out, do my stuff, and come home to a meal that's ready to eat the minute I step in the door. It's really just about convenience and preference.  It won't turn out good in my crockpot, that's for sure.So I use this recipe http://www.polishthestars.com/2011/11/slow-cooker-chicken-dumplings.html

The only difference I do is I add vegetables and the biscuits in the last two hours of cooking.  (It says 30 minutes for the biscuits, but they don't get done enough) I also do not shred the chicken. When everything is done, I find that the chicken will fall apart and be super tender with only the barest of pressure with a spoon or a fork.  I also used frozen chicken (although I learned today that may have been a bad thing to do) in the crock pot.

It's so good and so easy.  I know it sounds weird to put pieces of uncooked biscuit in the crockpot, but it turns out really, really well.This sounds awful.

Before you give up hope try out some slowcooker recipes. The two most famous recipes on this sub is Dr. Pepper pulled pork and Salsa chicken.

For Dr. Pepper Pulled Pork:

* 3-4 lbs of Pork Shoulder Butt
* 1 Can of Dr. Pepper (NOT DIET)
* Optional: I like to add sea salt and black pepper
* Cook on low for 8-10 hours
* Remove from it's juices and shred with two forks (should be very tender)
* Sweet Baby Ray's (Mix with the shredded meat as needed)

Salsa Chicken

* 3lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 1 jar of your favorite salsa (12-16oz)
* 1 packet of taco seasoning
* 6 hours on low

You can serve the salsa chicken over rice and beans, or throw it on top of tortillas with onions and cilantro for quick tacos, burritos, or burrito bowls. The pulled pork, I'd pair it with some hoagie rolls and coleslaw.Haha I know the owners of omaha steaks (I think its them or a similar brand) and I buy all my shit from his house because they get all the dankest shit. Pretty awesome.Maybe it's just...slow cooking.

I'll show myself out.Peas and riceGreetings r/Slowcooking! Last week I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2vns9j/slow_cooker_gumbo/) about slow cooker gumbo for Mardi Gras. I am happy to say it was a success! The Washington D.C. area was blessed by the gods of debauchery and butter with a Mardi Gras snow day. I didn't have to do any cooking the night before and the results were awesome.

Here's the basic [recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/slow-cooker-chicken-sausage-gumbo-455574?ic1=obinsite) that I used. I added in extra chicken and had "Louisiana Spicy Link Sausage" instead of andouille because my costco was out. I also added in more water for more of soup gumbo. And I added in a pinch of gumbo file at the end.

All in all: it was great! Laissez les bon temps roulez! Ok, so can I have your chicken and dumplings recipe?  The one time I tried this, it SUCKED.  I would like for it to note suck, because it sounds delicious.I think the general wisdom is that that is true for big hunks of meat, but shit like chicken pieces thaw quickly enough not to cause problems.

I should note that I cook exclusively by throwing frozen hunks of meat into the slowcooker, and I've never had any problems.  Anecdote, sure.  But I imagine it's anecdotal evidence corroborated by a lot of folks on here.As an example, [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/2wbakd/is_crock_pot_chili_better_than_stove_top_chili_or/) from /r/AskCulinary showed up on my front page right next to this post.  Skim through the comments for some slow examples of people that aren't slowcooker fans.Oh shit! It is? I didn't know. Well, poop. All I knew was that when I was done the chicken was falling apart and was very, very tender.  Same with meatballs. Bleagh. Well TIL.So easier to just buy skinless?Isn't slowcooking frozen food considered dangerous? Like, it spends too much time in the 'bacterial danger zone' so it can breed botulism? I don't think anyone hates them, they just aren't a particularly gourmet tool. I love what it allows me to do with very little direct intervention. At the same time, I'll happily acknowledge that almost anything I make with a slow cooker I can make better without it - if I have the time. It's just about convenience. Anything that cooks in a slow cooker can be done on the stove or in the oven for equal or less time. One of the biggest benefits to slow cooking is being able to shift when you do the prep work and being able to cook "hands off."Actually, yes. You can cook ANY dish that's for a slowcooker another way. Slowcooking is just another option for people. I for one love slowcooking because I'm lazy (when it comes to cooking) and it gives me a chance to have a delicious meal without working that hard for my food.  I make chicken and dumplings in the slowcooker and if I were to  make it another way, I would never have them because I do not want to go through all that work. Slowcooking is a way to shortcut meals I usually would never make the other way.Yeah, that's how I usually use it, too, but I find that any more than around 6 hours and it does get that slow cooker taste/texture. RABBLE RABBLE RABBLEQuite new to this, but couldn't you make that meal in about 20 minutes in a wok?

Chop up chicken to bite size pieces. flash fry. add bbq sauce and heat. add pineapple and heat. I've never had a roast taste like "paste" and I cook mine for 10 hours!
this article is terrible. [First dish I ever made.](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=1858828) Took about an hour of prep (I'm not the quickest chopper nor do I have shortcut tools in the kitchen) and maaaaan was it good. I doubled the recipe except for the vegetable broth. Using the amount specified will most likely result in soupy chili. Use half. Good luck.Same way I always use it, typically for soups.I can't remember the exact recipes that I used, but I think one was for chicken cacciatore, so just chicken, canned tomatoes, peppers, onions, garlic and spices. I think the common points are tomatoes and onions, so I'll have to experiment with other types of food to see what the common ingredient is.

Thanks!I accidentally left my slowcooker on about 8 hours longer than I should have, on low (forgot to pull the plug after a night of drinking). Still turned out great.Hmm, growing up I  always was taught that you WANTED to slowcook while you were at work. Of coarse, you turn it to low (instead of medium, and thus a longer cooking time) when you do that. That way when you came home, you had a wonderful dinner waiting. Oops.Great advice!  Thanks a lot.Except that when I tasted the broth before it had cooked for a length of time, it didn't have the weird taste. It was only after cooking for a longer period of time that the weird taste crept in. And I've never tasted this when using canned tomatoes on the stove top, cooked or not.He is saying that his main issue is leaving it on while at work or while sleeping, which gives an 8+ hour cooking time. I do agree that that is SERIOUSLY unnecessary and will probably result in mushiness. But, still, better than grabbing McDonalds four nights a week.If this is a pork tenderloin, I wouldn't cook it in the slow cooker.  It invariably dries out and ruins the tenderloin.  I -think- a standard pork loin will suffer some of this as well, but I'm faltering a bit on whether I've used that particular cut of pork before.  Regardless, this may be why you're having issues, as loins tend to handle a higher heat and faster cook better.All canned tomatoes have a metallic taste that must be cooked out of them.  I simmer tomato sauce for an hour and that flavor is gone.I used the crock-pot back in the US; however, I only cook with bottled water down here. I'm not even sure that I used water out of the tap for any of these recipes, so I think it might have been the onions like another posted indicated.I, also, have never heard a single soul badmouth crock pots....and even then it's really hard to mess it up. Let's say you want to make pineapple chicken. Just throw four or five FROZEN chicken breasts in the cooker, a thing of BBQ sauce (any flavor), and a can of pineapple chunks.  Bam! Three ingredients and you get a delicious homecooked meal in about five to six hours.Canned tomatoes have a tinny taste that must be cooked out of them.You don't get a quicker meal than walking in the door from work, opening the lid of what amounts to an electric cauldron and ladling food into a bowl.The actual crock pot that the food sits in is ceramic (or should be), so it can't be the crock it self if you're getting metallic tastes. You said you bought it new so it isn't anything someone else might have done to it before you got a hold of it. That really only leaves the ingredients you're using to cook with. There must be something that's common in most of your recipes that's causing it. Do you have hard water? Without a list of stuff you've cooked that's really the only thing I can think of that would cause that. Nobody. This article is pointless. If you leave any kind of meat (including chicken) cooking in it for too long, it will happen. Right? I feel like the only time you get overcooked mush is when you first buy it and don't really know what you're doing. Or pre-cook/sweat the onions (and brown the meat) first.

A slowcooker is practically foolproof. I say practically because apparently, this guy is the only guy in the universe that messes up a  dish in the slowcooker. How is that even possible?Check your local thrift store. I got my 4.5 quart Crock-pot brand slowcooker for $10 and I've seen rice cookers there for about the same price.Agreed,  especially if you're in Mexico. I don't hate mine, I just almost never use it any more since getting a nice stainless steel pot and dutch oven. Who hates slowcookers?What do you mean... Too cheesy?! : )

Thanks for the review- I can't make this all the time but I might try this recipe at a potluck coming up.  I'm always a little skeptical of cooking pasta in the slowcooker, but it's so easy to transport the cooker and keep the food warm at the destination (like a potluck or work party..).

Be sure to try some slow-cooked meat and stew in your new-to-you slowcooker. It'll be delicious! I love making broth and stock in mine, for soups. wow thanks so much for thisDrive slow, homie.Awesome. Going to try this today.totally went over my head thxi like these southwestern bowls.  plus any leftovers, or if you double the recipe, are perfect rolled in tortillas for burritos later.

Why would you want a cast iron slow cooker?If it was botulism, OP would be dead.   The vinegar, oil, dressing mix and worcestershire completely even it out. I don't like sauces that are too sweet either!Does this not need some sort of liquid to go in with everything else?[This](http://spicysouthernkitchen.com/crock-pot-cauliflower-cheese/) is one of my favorites. ...who hates slowcookers? They are universally loved by my circle of friends &amp; family.I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say "crock pot" taste is fairly common and caused by overcooking.  A lot of people don't mind it, look at these recipes. Cooking chicken breasts over 4 hours is gonna destroy it, but people like that.

I say try again, but use better recipes.  Start with America's Test Kitchen Slow Cooker Revolution recipes and go from there.  They have all the science worked out when it comes to flavor.  Check out [myth #6 here](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/10/the-food-labs-top-6-food-myths.html).Looks like he'd also prefer to use a pressure cooker for a lot of the same things./threadI'd invest in a nice dutch oven, like a Le Creuset instead. One of the most useful pots in my kitchen.Yep! The salsa/tomato sauce/broth replaces the water which you'd normally use to cook rice, and it makes the rice a lot tastier. We don't really follow a recipe but this is the general idea:

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/easy-authentic-mexican-rice-2/Them's fightin' wordsI got that taste recently when making a stew on the stove. It was the same taste thats led me to not use the crock pot as much. I'm pretty sure it was from the canned tomatoes.It can and it would probably be easier. I just wanted to make something simple for my first time since I didn't know what to expect from the crock pot. I wanted to share with people who can actually appreciate easy recipes like this. There's nothing wrong with posting these kind of recipes. That sounds nasty.

One, for the flavor of plastic. Two, for avoiding to heat any type of plastic where food or drink is involved since plastics start to off-gas after 50 degrees C or 122 degrees F. And despite there being inconclusive evidence about the extreme harms of the off gassing of plastics, I have learned enough reasons to be wary and avoid heating plastics when possible.

Edit: just read one of the product descriptions:

**Liner is safe for direct food contact at elevated temperatures (400_F / 203_C )**

However, I will still continue to avoid heated plastics.Honestly, I don't get recipes like this in this sub. Just as easily can be prepared in a traditional pot. This sounds way too sweet with the sauce, brown sugar, and honey.Thank you very much. I love the fact that our culture has exploded in terms of people being into craft beer and nuanced cooking techniques. Home cooks are able to watch cooking shows on the Food Network and replicate (at home!) some of the more advanced techniques and flavor profiles that modern chefs are using in restaurants. It's a fantastic time to be into food and drink.

Comparatively speaking, the slow cooker is a remnant of a bygone era. Using a slow cooker is in many ways the opposite of the techniques of the exploding cooking trend. Modern cuisine is dedicated to the idea of quick meals, modern techniques, and flavor/texture combinations. A slow cooker doesn't do any of this.

So it's not a surprise to me that people in general don't like the concept of a slow cooker. It's an entirely different way of thinking about food or cooking. Personally, I love my slow cooker. I use it every other week or so - I really love the results I've gotten out of it. But because it's SO different from modern cooking, I'm not surprised in the least that there's a degree of disdain for it.Totally! It took me a while to realize it, and I seem to be the only one I know who can taste it, but it ruins the dish for meJust add a cast iron pot and you're all set. [Link to crowdfunding page](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/paragon-induction-cooktop)I think it was more likely a brain tumor. could be botulism.  how did you prep your tomatoes.Quality post. Good job OP! I find that slowcooker works best with ground up meat/meat you will shred, and at that it's better if it's a bit fattier. So for example, in the slow cooker you'll be able to make a hella chilli/bolognese sauce etc, but a chicken breast is going to taste like crap. (For chicken, I recommend using thighs).Not sure if you'll be able to find them in Mexico, but they make plastic liners for crockpots that might help (also makes clean up a breeze). I love this combination. This version puts the skillet cooking at the end, which works better for my schedule. I also add some coconut milk at the end to make it richer. When I do want meat, I throw some chicken breasts and half a lemon into a separate crock pot and shred it.

http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/slow-cooker-sweet-potato-and-lentil-soup-recipe.htmlI came in her to say exactly what /u/bannana said.  Probably minerals in your water.  Did you use a lot of tap water in your cooking?  How does your tap water taste?  Try using bottled water next time.  The actual crocks where the cooking takes place are ceramic so I really can't see it being the crock itself.I realize this is probably not helpful for your current situation (unless you have a well-stocked public library at your disposal), but for future reference and for anyone else who hasn't tried it out, there are some great recipes in The Vegetarian Slow Cooker as well as some helpful references for things like basic beans and lentils.http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017227-christina-tosis-crockpot-cakeI want the recipe of whatever cake that they have on the photo.I make curry once a week guaranteed, sometimes I'll make it several days running so I go through garam masala rather quickly but I see your point. No point in going nuts with spices if you're only going to use them sporadically.I made a pretty good imitation of green tomatoes smokey rice and beans. Rice, pinto beans, a few cans of diced tomatoes, liquid smoke and brown sugar. We got two of these when we had our wedding recently lolHope you like it!Idiotnoted. thanks for the clarification :)Hmmm, I do like to cook with onions. I'll definitely keep this in mind.

Thanks!I was vegetarian in highschool and I'd make hobo stirfry often.

Ramen noodle noodles - boiled
cabbage, broccoli, bean sprouts, water chestnuts, carrots, green onion, or wahtever veggies floats your boat.
Egg
Soy sauce

Fry up your veggies a little, then add the noodles and soy sauce to the mix. Add egg. Add garlic and ginger to taste.

It's pretty good and now that I'm not vegetarian I add chicken in there. Mmmmm. Well, since this was over a year ago, the bun in my oven must be a dud.I'm eating right now a superb sweet potato and lentil dish.

1. In a slow cooker, put 3 peeled, cut in chunks sweet potatoes. Carrots and 2 cups of lentils.
2. In a small skillet, heat oil, put some chopped onions. Add some spices: curry, cumin, salt, pepper, ginger root, garlic. Mix. Add 2 cups of chicken broth, stir for a minute and pour everything into the slow cooker.
3. Put on low heat for 6 hours.
4. If you have green beans, add them now, let it cook for another hour.

The recipe is based on that [one](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-curried-sweet-potato-and-lentil-stew/841c60f3-3a01-4dec-bc31-c3e0c964a677), I just added more lentils and I prefer to saute onions before adding them to the cooker.

How it [looked](http://imgur.com/a/K3oU9)I'm pretty sure I did use canned tomatoes. However, I've never experienced this issue when cooking on the stove top with canned tomatoes, so I assumed it was an issue with the crockpot.Did any or most of your recipes used canned tomatoes?  Any time I cook with diced, canned tomatoes I get the same metallic taste, presumably from the metal cans (as little sense as that makes).  We've been trying to avoid buying them canned for that reason.Maybe. I remember doing some searches at the time for 'weird taste crock-pot,' and I think issues with tomatoes came up. But obviously everyone cooks tomatoes with no problem in a crockpot, so I think it must have been some other issue with the crockpot or my cooking.I don't think so, but that's definitely something to keep in mind.

Thanks!I didn't test the temp, and that's not something that I ever would have thought about. I'll definitely keep that in mind if I buy a new one.

Thanks!Some bacteria's can have a metallic taste.  Did you ever test the temp of the crock pot to ensure food was getting to proper temp to kill off any bugs?Any chance its your water giving it a funny taste?You might be thinking of not putting tomatoes in cast iron.The other responses were right on but didn't really address weight loss. It's easy enough to portion out for counting calories, but rice is a very calorie-dense food, so if you're the kind of person who wants a lot of bulk to feel full it might not be awesome. Try it though! You could also try substituting something like steamed cauliflower that you cut up very small.No, no pesto or pine nuts. I remember trying to make some sort of chicken and tomato stew, and don't really remember what else because it's been a while. I think it must have been some fluke. Maybe there was a coating on the pot that made things taste weird after cooking. I'll try again if I can find a crockpot in Mexico!It was brand new, and I think I only hand washed it. I'm living in Mexico right now, and dishwashers are only a lovely memory. I'll be heading out to Walmart today, and I'm not even sure if they sell crock-pots here, but if they do, I think I'll pick another one up.

Thanks!The pork butt [recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017230-vaguely-vietnamese-slow-cooker-pork-tacos) featured in the article looks tasty
It sounds like it would be easier to just skip the crockpot altogether in that case. I'd melt the cheeses with the milk on the stove while cooking the pasta and then just combine them and toss it in the oven. You'd still get the creaminess and richness from the different cheeses, crispy bits from the oven and without the extra wait for it to cook in the crockpot. any of the food you cooked have pesto or pine nuts in it?Was it a new crock pot? If it was used, it could've been used for lots of stuff, including making soap, which might leave a taste of the fragrance oil behind. I've also had issues with a crock and certain types of dishwasher soaps that would leave a film and make food taste soapy. I learned to handwash my crock, even if I run it through the dishwasher first. Salt does toughen up the skins on pintos. I wait until the inside is entirely soft before adding salt.Unless you're using a TON of spices, you really shouldn't buy huge packages of it. I typically buy spices at a bulk food store and just get what I can reasonably use in 1-2 months (for ground spices) and ~6 months for whole spices. Keilbasa is smoked and cured, you don't need to cook it.I got it. Thanks.What I'm saying is it can't be tomatoes because we all use tomatoes. Oh shit Lol. I thought this was /r/gainitPork butt releases so much liquid when slow cooking, I never understood why people added so much liquid to it. Just enough to keep the bottom of the crock wet until the meat releases liquids is sufficient. And why add the seasoning to the liquid and not onto the meat itself, especially if you're draining the liquid? I think you are on point. I will look into some slowcooker recipes then.That's what I've always thought, but I may try it sometime with half-cooked pasta instead of fully cooking it before throwing it in the crock pot. I'd also likely not leave it for the full 4 hours suggested... And I'd want to finish it in the oven for crispy bits.Almost everything I made in the crockpot had tomatoes in it, and I thought I read something somewhere about it. I think it might just have been the crockpot. I cooked in it about 5 times, and each time, the same weird taste. I threw out so much food!That's exactly correct. Not that OP's recipe doesn't sound delicious, but it's essentially just taco-flavored pulled pork, not carnitas.I've never had this problem. That isn't something that is supposed to happen. As far as avoiding certain foods, if we avoid tomatoes, how else are we supposed to have chili?Looks like you aren't making recipes for the slowcooker but expecting recipes that work on the stove to work in the slowcooker. First off, you probably aren't using enough seasoning. Two, if you use beef or pork, really anything but chicken, for the most part, it needs to be browned (seared) before cooking. Three, vegetables like potatoes and carrots actually like to cook for 8 hours with a pot roast. Four, your liquids are now going to be things like broths.\**braaaains**I don't know, do you? Different people have different goals when it comes to nutrition. It would probably be pretty easy to make rice and beans a higher calorie food because you can add so many different things to it, like meat and cheese.Hate to be this guy, because I'm sure what you made was delicious, but carnitas are cooked confit and then fried after.

Yes it is a lot of extra fat, and i'd eat your pork tacos in a heartbeat, but saying your method is carnitas would be like someone saying they have a fried chicken recipe and it is just boiled chicken. Thanks. So you've tried reducing the cooking time by an hour and everything turned out okay? That's helpful, thank you!I generally don't broil mine and it isn't soggy really but it is nicer when you take the time to broil it on a sheet and crisp up the ends. That said, I do sear mine before the crockpot so that adds something.I take the casing off, turn the slowcooker on high and mash it with a potato masher.  Once it starts to stick to the bottom I add the other ingredients, scrape that brown goodness off the bottom and put it back on low for the rest of the cooking.

You're likely going to be looking for an electric stove-top that does that as I don't think anyone makes cast-iron inserts for slow-cooking.

I'd be happy to be shown otherwise, but can I just ask what the appeal of the cast iron slow cooker would be?TIL, only learned about it about a year ago had it for breakfast with black beans (in law's are Mexican).

Thanks.I do. It depends on what you are looking for from your meat. I like to bake it in the oven to dry it out and crisp it up some. That's not a side step. He said he doesn't want to wait 8 hours for something, indicating that he has no recipes for a crock pot because who cares. [Salsa Linzano](http://www.amazon.com/Lizano-Salsa-23-7-Costa-Sauce/dp/B005TBURAI) is amazing with beans and rice.  Once the beans are almost done I add this, chopped veggies (usually carrots, onion, bell peppers, and chilies) and let it simmer a bit.  [More info here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_Lizano).Most slow cooker cook books include a section on converting regular recipes, as well as general tips on how to use it. You can find several recipes online you can use (in the wiki in the sidebar here, or just through google) as well.


You should use like 3/4s as much liquid as normal generally, since it doesn't evaporate during cooking.


Saute vegetables and meat before putting it into the slow cooker. Don't use frozen meat/veggies in it, thaw it first. Fresh herbs don't do well with such long cooking times, so either add them during the last hour or use dried ones. Mac n cheese can be prepared in an array of richness, from light mac n cheese to heart stoppingly rich mac n cheese. This recipe has a TON of cheese, butter and "cheese food product" which all contribute to richness. For a lighter mac n cheese outcome you would want to use a recipe with a bechamel base, which is a thickened milk sauce which then uses cheese to get the cheesy goodness.Congrats on getting a slow cooker! I love using mine but I cringe at the thought of making macaroni and cheese in it. Especially with pre-cooked pasta. I cannot stand eating overcooked pasta and 3-4 hours in the slow cooker after boiling it seems too much for me. Same recipes we normaly use on a stove, throw the ingredients in the slowcooker and turn it on. I'm not sure how to explain the taste. It's like they are not well done. Vegetables taste sour. Meat seems dry.

Thx. for the reply. I'm mostly sure it's our way of doing it, but I don't know what it is. Are there any books on "techniques"?Good question. We are using normal recipes I guess. The liquid is one problem, because we prep multiple meals, freeze them, and cook one each day. But all that ice turns into liquid that would not evaporate...
What does caramelize vegetables mean?

Thanks for your comment.What is it about them that doesn't taste good?  What recipes are you using?  A slowcooker is never going to outperform an oven/stove, but it shouldn't taste bad if you're using good ingredients and techniques.Are you using slow cooker recipes or the regular ones? You need to reduce the liquid if you cook them in a slowcooker. Also, you should still sear meat and caramelize vegetables before putting them into the cooker.

It's a bit hard to know what you're doing wrong without more details. Favourite R&amp;B recipe...Here's **Jamaican Jerk Chicken** from the book: *Slow Cooker Classics from Around the World*.

----

*Jerking is a method of seasoning and cooking meat that dates back to the Carib-Arawak Indians who inhabited Jamaica. Meat is marinated in a spicy pastelike sauce and then cooked slowly. Originally cooks would puncture the meat with a sharp object and stuff the holes with a variety of spices. The meat would then be cooked in a deep pit lined with stones over burning pimento (allspice) wood, which gave it a unique smoky flavor.*

----

#Ingredients

* 1 cup chopped sweet onions, like Vidalia
*  cup chopped scallions
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 teaspoons fresh thyme
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground allspice
*  teaspoon ground nutmeg
*  teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 whole jalapeo peppers, sliced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 4 pounds cut-up chicken pieces, skin removed

#One day ahead

Place all ingredients except chicken in the bowl of a food processor. Puree, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times, until mixture is smooth. Place chicken in a large freezer-weight zipper bag. Pour marinade mixture into bag. Close bag and massage chicken so that all pieces are well coated with marinade. Refrigerate chicken in bag overnight.

#To cook

Remove chicken from marinade and place in a 4-quart slow cooker. Discard marinade. Cook on low setting for 3 hours, until chicken has cooked through but is not falling off the bone.

Preheat a gas grill to medium-hot, about 450F. Sear chicken for 2 minutes per side.

#To serve

Serve with steamed white rice or boiled fingerling potatoes.

----

*Jerk chicken usually calls for Scotch bonnet pepper, or the similar habanero. These are the hottest peppers in the capsicum family. I have lightened the spice in this recipe by using jalapeos, which are much milder. If you want to authenticate this recipe and love hot, hot, hot, substitute one scotch bonnet pepper for the jalapeos.*i would not say that I have a formula but more some info ... so not machines warm cycle is a warm cycle some actually are hot enough to cook each machine is different (warm is simply what it should be no it)

I cook almost everything on low ... and on most recipes 6 hr and above that i have tied but warm cycle seam to leave them over done in the end I have reduced by one hour cooking and its been fine ... and yes the end temperature is safe and everything is cooked ... I am pritry sure most of this has to do with the fact that i am not starting out with it on warm but its already hot and insulated and heat is still being mildly added to the mix. I would never try to cook something on warm but i am not putting the food in a bowl to eat and cool so it continues to cook though the active cooking cycle is over

i hope i made sense without to much rambling its past my bed timeIn a pinch, smegma is a suitable substitute for bacon grease.I make beans and rice for my weeks lunches. I'm not able to heat food at work so I heat up my serving in the morning and use a thermos food jar, it's still steaming come lunch time. As for nutrition, remember that beans and rice forms a complete protein, also, I use brown rice for the extra fibre and goodness. I like this recipe with a bean variety, but it would go great with any single bean too.

3 cups dried beans- soak for 12 hours

I use a mix of garbanzo, black, red, Lima, and fava beans

1 onion
1/2 head of garlic
1 green bell pepper
1 tomato

2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon coriander
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cardamom
1/4 teaspoon cloves
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3 bay leaves

Cover with water in the slow cooker and cook on high for 6 hours

After cooking is done add 1 teaspoon salt

If you like it spicy add a jalapeo (or two or three) to the mix

Eat with rice.

Nom nom nomWould love that recipe ! Thanks!But don't i want high calories?Nope.  I drained it and it was perfectly tenderThis isn't with a slow cooker put just a sauce pan. It is a super yummy recipe from theb thug kitchen book book
Coconut lime rice with mango &amp; red beans

INGREDIENTS:

2 cups short-grain brown rice

It's not slow cooking I know.. But it is an amazing recipe!!! guess I will never buy one of his slow cookers if he has any...I just wanted to comment and say that I tried this last weekend, and it came out absolutely phenomenal! The brine really adds something that I wasn't expecting.

It will be going in my recipe book to be used again!Boiling is just fast soaking them. Boil ten or soak two hours. You cook them after soaking anyway. Slow and low is the way to go for reducing gas. Also adding cumin helps some. You might like Texas caviarI make pressure cooker RB&amp;Rice.  Let me know if you want that recipe.He said "canned", so no soak.That looks delicious and easy. I love your cooker, very pretty.That sounds like a great basis to just throw whatever you want in with it. I think I'll try it out tomorrow.I just ate them (with rice and cream of mushroom) and they weren't bad for my first time cooking with dry beans - texture was a little off but not completely hard. I'm just worried about this whole "kidney beans toxic at certain temperatures thing." It's been like an hour and a half now and I'm still alive, that's good, right?Black beans, rice, eggs... Best breakfast ever.What is caster sugar? Could I just use regular granulated sugar? This is a basic Cajun Dish!  Redbeans and rice!  Most of us use canned Blue Runner brand beans, but dry Camellia brand beans are a close second.  This dish is, without a doubt, best with smoked cajun sausage like you can find [HERE](http://www.cajungrocer.com/search/index/index/q/sausage.html).  Savoie's (Sahv - wahs) brand is my favorite, but if you get the hot... expect it to be HOT!

Also... Celery.  Trust me.

Oh and bonus secret ingredient?   Bacon Grease!  Seriously.  It is amazing.Is that true?All these comments and not one Jamaican rice and peas suggestion

I thought higher of you slowcookingI'm really confused why there's random Kanye west lyrics hereMost of the carnitas recipes that I have seen require you to broil the meat until crispy.  Did you find your meat soggy?I pretty much just play it by ear! I normally can handle 2 teaspoons of Cayenne in all of that, and about half as much garlic powder.when this came out, i knew it as  Twista's song. I only in the last few years found out Kanye was in it.Maybe he was surprised by some rogue smegma.Filling? Absolutely!
Nutritious? Beans and veggies, absolutely! Low calorie, lots of protein. The only problem is if you're trying to cut out carbs rice is not a great choice.
Rice and beans transports and reheats well, and making a week's worth at a time would be very reasonable. I'm not 100% sure on this, but you could probably even portion it out and freeze it if you wanted to keep it for even longer.Not sure but when I am making pork shoulder and it doesn't pretty much fall off the bone I cook it for another 2-3 hours or put it on high and it'll finish off nicely.

Do you have an example of a recipe you've tried?I've never personally made it, but this recipe looks simple enough!

http://www.food.com/recipe/chana-masala-in-the-slow-cooker-516746This looks awesome.During my uni days, my diet usually consisted of rice + lentil curry made in Srilankan style. Cook the lentils in coconut milk base with turmeric. Then fry some onions, chilli flakes and mustard seeds in a little oil and mix it together.

The spices could be expensive depending on your location but they last a while and you use a little so its pretty much a one time cost. You can cook other legumes (aka beans) with the same recipe but you might have to soak the beans in water for a few hours first.Get rid of? Throw a party. Serve burgers.Did Smegma_free just die of a coronary mid-sentence?
If they turned out good, then maybe I'm just wrong. But I've ended up with hard beans before and that's what my more knowledgeable friend said was my mistake.Damn you price zombie!  Stop chasing me!I LOVE moro.  Here is recipe. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1Ug8PKEI2Y  #####&amp;#009;

It's basically like [this](http://smile.amazon.com/Crock-Pot-38501-W-5-Quart-Smart-Pot-Cooker/dp/B00008I8NS/ref=sr_1_16?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424230259&amp;sr=1-16&amp;keywords=Crock-Pot+5-Quart+Round+Programmable+Slow+Cooker), but dayumn, I got a pretty patterned one for $27.88 and now it's $90?  No freaking WAY would I pay that much for it again.  Eesh.Brilliant.  Hard water confirmed.  They never turn out "crunchy," but I'm going to try this baking soda thing and see if I notice a difference.Shit. I just made kidney beans and apparently I fucked up.Bone in, yes.  But I would deskin and defat the chicken.  Otherwise you will end up with a greasy mess.Thanks!Also I have the same size crock pot as you so I will be cutting it in half as well!meh. like i really care what a bunch of random people on the internet think of a basic fact. Entire countries don't boil their beans for 10 minutes before simmering them for hours on end to get the flavor right. and yet, they're apparently all wrong, and a bunch of americans are right about how to cook them.

Kinda annoying, but whatevs. Chili?Thanks! The original recipe says to cook it for 4 hrs mixing it every hour at low temperature. I left it only 3 hours because I couldn't wait. :) How long did you cook for and low or high? Looks awesome!Me either bro...I get some gas but isnt that a given eating beans...I wonder if the downvotes are from peoples experience or just following the status quo....heard its frowned upon if you cut the tag on a mattresses tooImma just get one more `MURICA in here for `MURICA sake.I do my rice 'n (black) beans with a bag of frozen veggies and sometimes teriyaki sauce. The beans don't really do it for me protein wise, so I'll add an envelope of tuna or some chicken.

Truth is, /u/Hard_Time_EXTREME and his red beans and rice sounds awesome. Do that.I use canned beans most of the time too out of sheer lazinessstroganoffHow does that work? The meat absorbs the liquid again?Only liquid is tomato sauce/ the diced tomato juicesYes. I'm aware of that. Thought I was pointing out that regionally "chorizo" could refer to a specific style or flavor of sausage.

(Here, I'll save you some time: 'MURICA.) INGREDIENTS:
16 ounces macaroni pasta
16 ounces Monterrey Jack cheese, cubed
16 ounces Colby cheese, cubed
16 ounces Velveeta (cubed)
1 stick of butter, cut into slices
16 ounces milk
salt &amp; pepper, to tasteThis kind of started as a joke, but I've been keeping track of my bean recipes here: [http://whatsforbeans.tumblr.com/](http://whatsforbeans.tumblr.com/)Yeah, never once have I seen my mom soak or pre-boil her red beans, and they are phenomenal. I have only cooked dried Limas myself, but I never soak or pre-boil them either. I just cook them for a very long time.Yeah, so, `Murica. Your chorizo is specifically [Mexican Chorizo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorizo#Mexican_chorizo)... but Chorizo anywhere else is [Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorizo#Spanish_chorizo) sausage. Perfect, thank you! :)Ahh, gotcha, thanks!Butter beans! [Here is a picture made from the recipe below](http://i.imgur.com/ihbHIlP.png).

1 package dried baby Lima beans (also called white or butter beans)

1 onion, diced

Chunks of ham to your preference. (I use about a pound. There's a brand called Chisesi's that I like to use but I don't know if that's a regional thing. They sell packages of "seasoned ham" that's good to just chuck into a pot of beans and that's what I do.)

Chicken bouillon cubes (about 3 or 4)

Butter

Some people say soak or flash cook beans like these, but if you cook them long enough you really shouldn't worry bout it.

So! Put the diced onion and dried beans in your slow cooker. Add more water than you think you should. The beans should be covered, and then add some more water. They will soak it all up. I make sure my slow cooker is 3/4ths full of water for this.

Cook on low over night and all day, or on high for 8 - 12 hours all day. You want to add your seasonings and ham sometime in the middle of cooking, because the salt that's in the bouillon can toughen the beans if you put it in too early, and you don't want that. Also add a bit of butter, a couple tablespoons or so. They are butter beans, after all.

If it lacks something when you try it, add Cajun seasoning (I like Zatarain's seafood boil mix as a spice) or a dash of cayenne pepper.

For best results, mash the beans. You will have a rich, velvety mess of beans. Serve over rice. Jalapeo peppers are good served on top.The reason I ask is that sometimes you actually need to cook it longer. Try cooking pork shoulder next time for about 10 hours minimum.Do you just throw it all in the cooker and let it go for a few hours, or is there more prep to do?Okay so pork shoulder say 4-5 lbs on low for about 8-10 hours?I live in Arizona and regionally "chorizo" specifically refers to sausage flavored with traditional Mexican seasonings. Yeah I figured, I just wanted to know if it's below boiling. Boiling food for 10 hours ruins it for me. My crock, even on low, will be boiling when I get home, so I never use it.I find bacon grease an excellent supplement to the rii searched all my thrift stores and salvation arms and good wills and junk stores. found lots of broken units. sit down and did the math and found out i can buy a new one for less than the cost of buying 3 and hoping I had enough broken parts to put a whole one togather.the Hillshire Farms brand is not raw. It is safe to eat out of the package, so I just throw it in with everything else. So you take white rice, in a frying pan with oil? Then add salsa while it's on the stove? Cuban-style black beans! Can confirm, these are great over rice, with picadillo, in a quesadilla, or pretty much any way you could eat black beans. Yum.What liquid do you use, water or stock/broth?Throw in some cheap protein in there, like smoked turkey necks or hamhocks, to add some flavor and nutrition.Pasta?  I used some frozen burgers last week to make a quasi cheeseburger mac n cheese type dish.  Took about 20 min tops because i cooked the mac n cheese portion kinda like risotto instead of just boiling the noodles and adding the cheese sauce.

When i'm really lazy, i'll break up the hamburgers a bit, slice some potatoes and make a type of cheeseburger and potato casserole.  Just cook the broken up hamburger, set aside.  Fry the sliced potatoes in the same pan.  When the potatoes are done, just layer the potatoes, hamburger, and some cheese and then toss the pan in the oven under the broiler.     In terms of cook time, I follow recipes. Pretty much any meat will dry up my slow cooker. Even something like pork shoulder.Also don't put any salt in the boiling water or they won't soften up.Thats not adobo, that's sofrito. Just make sure it's green if you get the Goya brand. (Recaito) adobo is the spice in the big container with either a green, blue or red top. Red is the way to go :) Kielbasa is smoked, so it doesn't need to be cooked first.  You can even eat it cold.to make the red beans and rice creamier, get a big spoon or a potato masher and smush a portion of the beans about halfway through cooking.Replace rice with a pack of tortillas (or make some!), add cheese and enjoy some quesadillas!This is delicious. I like to add a good squeeze of lime and chopped cilantro to the rice.I like your recipe. How much cayenne powder, garlic and water do you use?U can get a new one for $20-$30 bucksJust look up about the kidney beans for yourself. Just because governments don't know the science behind global climate change doesn't mean that 99% of scientists are wrong on the subject. The same goes for kidney beans and needing to be boiled. Some people have a built up immunity to the toxins as well as the gassy effects of beans, doesn't mean everyone should take stupid risks because some idiots on the Internet said they never had a problem.

The other advice here is all great! Rice, beans, green pepper, cubed steak, diced tomato, onion. Variations of it. Sometimes, I'll use LENTILS instead of pinto beans.&gt; I get stomach issues, but not many.

Lol ok. Do it at your own gastric risk.  It may depend on the slow cooker: "low" &amp; "high" are anything but precise &amp; universal.  I'd rather play it safe, myself.Do you cook the kielbasa first or put it straight in the crockpot?Damn that sucks friend..cilantro is one of my fav things in the worldGoogle Whole Bowl Recipe. Ahh hell here you go:

http://www.improbablefarmer.com/2011/04/whole-bowl-tali-sauce-recipe-for.html?m=1

EDIT I know it's not exactly a slow cooker recipe but it is just as simple. Make the tali sauce and rice &amp; beans at the beginning of the week and you're good to go! [Why not both?](http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-mexican-and-spanish-chorizo-word-of-mouth-207326)


Add in some powdered coconut milk to your rice, and cook the beans to a soupy consistency, separate from the rice. Makes it a different texture and flavor. Will it work with bone in, skin on chicken thighs? Wrong. Ate them many many times in Belize and various other central American countries. Soak overnight, then slow cook. Still do it to this day. I get stomach issues, but not many, and not from the beans. Do you ever do lentils instead of beans? They're all legumes, but peas and lentils tend to be higher in fiber.
[African Peanut Lentils](http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2008/10/african-inspired-crockpot-soup-with.html); [Red Lentil Soup](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-red-lentil-soup-recipes-from-the-kitchn-212392); [Yellow Split Pea and barley soup](http://www.food.com/recipe/yellow-split-pea-and-barley-soup-367469)

For anything that doesn't include rice, you can just make some and load the soup up on top of it!

Edit: The red lentil soup can be made in the slow cooker by using a bit less water. The lentils cook fast, mine are done in 2 hours on high. and Changed a recipe more appropriate for the sub.Slow. Slow, Cooker. Let me run you till the mornin' comes. When I got tired of R&amp;B I subbed red beans for black beans and instead of tomatoes (basically Rotel) I started using cheap cheese and a shit ton of lime juice. You don't have to use fresh, the little containers do just fine. I would make the R&amp;B in the slowcooker, then add the cheese and lime juice on top when I portioned it out. The lime really makes it pop, and if you're looking for green stuff, parsley could work instead of cilantro (or epazote if you're feeling REAL fancy)Guess we have stomachs of steel or the beans are getting pasturized in the cookerThis may work but I am really not sure the cost.  I had all this stuff lying around today and made a delicious potato soup.  I'd call it more of a baked potato soup, if only it had bacon.

Bunch of cubed red potatoes - I used too much in hindsight

An onion cut up

Garlic

Salt

Pepper

Chicken broth

Celery

Sour cream

Cream cheese

2 cups of milk mixed w/ 2 tsp flour, whisked

Half bag of Mexican blend cheese

I put all that in crock pot minus the sour cream/cream cheese/milk and flour mixture.  Let cook on high for 4 hours or so.  Mash it up.  Add the other stuff.  Let cook for 30 more minutes then BAM you're done.  It was amazing to eat today.

I'm sorry I don't have exact measurements, just use as much as you want of cream cheese/sour cream.  The more you use the more it will taste like either.  I used about 1/3 of a cream cheese bar and maybe 4oz of sour cream.

Made WAY more than I imagined and is outstanding.
Look for culantro. Different herb and slightly different taste but no soap. Coriander is the seed of the cilantro plant so give that a try. Still different taste, but you get my idea.This isn't a slow cooker recipe, but I'm sure you could modify it for the crock pot. I also add good spices like Tumeric, cumin, cayenne pepper etc if you have those on hand. You can also use sour cream instead of Greek yogurt since it's cheaper.

This whole thread is amazing. I have some questions if you'll pardon me.

Obvious benefits:

* Cost
* Convenience, specifically easy to make, and more importantly, you don't have to think about what you have every day.

Questions:

* Filling? Looks like it.
* Nutritious? Would this be a good thing to consider for weight loss? Considering it's simple ingredients and it looks like it would be very easy to portion out.
* How well does something like this transport and then reheat in the office microwave?
* Is this something you could make a week's worth of or does it not necessarily keep that long?If you want to go asian style, do something with like corn, peas, edamame, onions, bell peppers etc. I usually do it on the stovetop, so I wouldn't know how to recommend adding the soy, fish sauce/oyster sauce, and rice vinegar if you are set on the crockpot aspect.I do this too but with some ginger as well kidney beans. One of my favs

Not as an everyday car, there are some imports but GM is mainly holden over here.I haven't worked out my favorite cajun version, but for Indian, Dads Rajmah, from Anupy Singla's "The Indian Slow Cooker" is my go to:

https://indiancooker.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/dads-rajmah/
Tough call really. I just made this for myself and it was a 6lber. I'll get about 4 big and healthy meals out of it because I don't eat it with sides or bread. I just toss it up with my favorite sauces by itself. I figure I could get double that, maybe 8 meals, by myself with bread and/or sides on 6lbs. So shoot for 6lbs, but don't hesitate to go a little more if you can. There is some fat/bone that comes off so take that into account. I cooked mine 10 hours on low. Good luck!you can make hamburgersBoyz II MenIf you can spring for some sausage (packaged italian sausage is fine) make yourself a bean stew.

I used this recipe as a base: http://www.eat-drink-smile.com/2013/02/one-skillet-white-bean-and-sausage-stew.html

I substituted kale and chicken sausage because I had it though and used a little less broth.

Took all of 20 minutes to cook on the stove, but could do it in the slow cooker if you had to for some reason. "Spanish... Mexican...same thing."

Cook all that in the slow cooker and bam you got some chili esque stuff


Dump that over rice so it is not liquidy. Consume. I literally am eating it right now.

Sorry I don't have real measurements. I just add random amounts based on what I have/what is on sale/ how I feel that day. I also occasionally add meat. I freeze the chili and just make some rice to put it on.


Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile at the moment.[I think I have the answer.](http://i.imgur.com/M76dMxT.jpg)I have a recipe for chicken cacciatore that I think works pretty well.

[Here's a link to my version of it.](https://imgur.com/a/2RRGF)  Please forgive the typo in the title.  I didn't realize it was there until it was too late to edit the album.

My mom used to make chicken cacciatore in a pressure cooker when I was a kid with legs and thighs (bone in).  This version tastes a lot like I remember hers tasting.[Here is one from the FDA](http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm071092.htm). My understanding is that some (older) slow cookers get to a higher temperature so don't have that problem. Adding mexican green salsa is easy AND fantastic!!!  I still cook it up with onions and garlic and dried chiles (along with salt to taste) - then add in a few tablespoons of green salsa per serving, delicious.

I'll also confess/add that I often cook up beans in a pressure cooker - that's probably some kind of grave violation mentioning that here...[Slow-Cooker Indian-Spiced Lentils!](http://ourbestbites.com/2012/11/slow-cooker-indian-lentils/)

You're going to have to make an initial investment in a few spices, but once you have those on hand this recipe is super cheap, healthy (vegan, if you sub veggie broth for chicken broth) and absolutely delicious.

Serve with rice and/or naan bread (or soft flour tortillas, or pita) and top with any combination of mango chutney, Sriracha or another hot sauce.I have found that my kitchen and living room smell pretty strongly of anything I cook.Some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita, some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie RippertonDo you have a source for this?  I've never heard this and I eat dry kidney beans all the time from the slow cooker.No need for liquid, the drumsticks themselves should have enoughBlack beans is now what you need to switch things up.

Sorry I don't follow a recipe but after cooking the raw beans (or after being lazy and opening the can):

* cumin (start with 1 tsp ground, more if you like)
* white vinegar; this is a key ingredient (start with 1 tsp; I use more like a Tbsp for a large can of beans)
* salt and pepper
* some fried onions, garlic, and peppers if you like; I often leave these out when I'm lazy
* secret technique: when all is nice and cooked, they should have a little broth left in them. partially smash the beans with a spoon or a potato masher; don't grind them up, but give it 5-10 good mashes. This thickens things up, and gets the beans more friendly with each other.

Eat repeatedly for the rest of your life. I never get tired of black beans.Black beans, rice, red onion, and a fried banana.  LOVE it.  I have been eating this at least once a week for over 20 years.Well if nothing bad ever happened to you it must be safe! I get so sick of restaurants not listing cilantro as one of the ingredients. It's an awful surprise and then I get to spend 10 minutes picking it out of my food.I wish there was a food safety page that had a list of unexpected information like this, instead of the same old spiel about heating meat to 160 degrees and watching for cross-contamination.You and I have the exact same diet regime. You'd think it gets tiresome but its really super awesome, everyday!I LOVE my cast iron skillet. I cook everything on it! Used it everyday up until recently, temporarily switched over to a deeper cast iron pan. Its so healthy to cook with cast iron because you get a small dose of iron with every meal.This is going to be so much better than pulled pork from a Crock Pot. The new year's meal is absolutely amazing, regardless of what kind of beans you use!I like how there's ice less than an inch from the smoker, stubbornly holding on, knowing that the smoker will go out in just a little while.Sazzon + Adobo (Tomato's,cilantro,garlic and onions blended and simmered)(or buy it any place that sells goya products) + pigeon peas = Puerto Rican Rice. Its outstanding and is very easy to make.
No, I appreciate it. I'd never made meatballs in there before. Thank you!Grab a hamhock and throw it in.  Affordable and awesome source of flavor.

Big fan of cumin, coriander, and bay leaf in beans also. Maybe they are new? They do not yet know our secrets.The original low &amp; slow!Not the case with kidney beans (specifically).  If you can't get them up to a boil, you are prettymuch guaranteed an upset stomach, extreme gas, and/or a gnarly case of the shits.  What type of meats are drying out and what settings/timeframe are you using for these dishes?

It may be the cooker's fault but it might be your fault as well.Plus it's cheap if you have an Asian food shop nearby, I can get a kilogram of the stuff for under 5 in one compared to 30g for 1 in the standard supermarket.How does chorizo come out in the slowcooker? I'm a huge chorizo fan, nice cheap and tasty. Do you just add a roll at the beginning and it comes out fine, or cook it seperately and add it at the end?It's not slowcooker-specific, but I did just come across this interesting combo of African-style dishes: [rice &amp; beans](http://africanbites.com/?p=8263) served with [beef stew](http://africanbites.com/?p=6939). The most expensive ingredient in this pair of recipes is the beef.

As long as you soak um overnight your gravy. Ive never boiled any kind of dry beans and haven't endured any ill effects.  Unless you consider gas and poop an ill effect. Some recipes will leave a fairly strong smell in the house. Also - make sure to leave a note asking people to kindly not remove the lid during your cook because every time you do so will add another 30 minutes or so to the cook time.Agreed. It's currently my favorite Indian dish. Our home-made version isn't as good as at our favorite Indian restaurant, but maybe some day I'll get it right.So sad! Fuck yeah smoking.Channa masala is DELICIOUS, and I'm not even a vegetarian. Not exactly what you're asking, but I've found switching the rice for Quinoa makes it a little more "sturdy" for things like making wraps that I then freeze for later. I've found the rice gets soggy and after freezing the consistency is off and it mutes the flavor.

I normally make a whole bunch of quinoa, peppers and onions with cumin, chili pepper, salt, pepper and then get a whole stack of wraps. To mix it up I put different toppings in each one: chicken and salsa, ham cubes and cheese, pulled pork from the slow cooker, etc. It ups the cost a bit up adds a lot of variety for a lower marginal cost.I'm one of those poor bastards where cilantro tastes like soap for some reason.

I'm repeatedly assured that it is delicious though.That is a very good step to know hahahaCilantro! Coconut rice with thyme and pigeon peas (guandu)

Replace the water you would normally use for canned coconut milk, and use water to fill the remainder if you don't have enough, mix in a can of pigeon peas and season with thyme and salt to taste. Super yummy!  Just make sure you boil the beans for 10 minutes first. Kidney beans need to be cooked at a higher temperature before going into the slow cooker, or else they are toxic. Canned ones have already had that step done.

edit: apparently the [FDA recommends](http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm071092.htm) soaking for 5 hours, pouring off the water, then boiling.Garam Masala is a good spice mix. I used it when I was eating lentils and rice. Toss it in when the lentils are cooking.Pssst, get a crockpot. In addition, if you soak and cook the beans and they still taste crunchy, you may just have hard water. Adding about a half tsp of baking soda to the soaking beans has helped me tremendously.
ALso, avoid adding acid (tomato, vinegar) to cooking beans until after they soften. Yeah, I am firmly in the slowcookers are easy, not cuisine, boat. It's really going to make cheap meat taste pretty good with enough spices and sauce. It isn't going to make a delicacy. You also may be using a pork cut that isn't good for slow cooking. Personally I would bake a pork loin, because they are rather expensive. I've been looking into this too. Especially with chicken, cooking for more than 4 hours (on low) melts the entire bird and most bones into soup. I've heard that some of it is due to the high saline content in most meats, or that slow cookers are just too high heat. But i'm also looking at a new cooker with an "auto-off" function. I mean.. obviously I use my cast iron skillet more- to fry up a chicken breast or some sausages or steak- but are you asking because your budget only allows for you to buy one of the two? Because they're not really substitutes for each other by any means, but if your on a budget I would suggest the slow cooker as it allows for large super affordable batches of healthy delicious foods like stews and soups.That's so weird... Don't you also have Chevys there?* Burrito bowl: First, make Mexican-style rice. There are tons of recipes online, but we usually fry up dry rice in some oil, then add some blended tomatoes or salsa. Top it off with vegetable broth if you need more liquid, and add whatever spices you like (cumin, cayenne, etc.). Then mix with refried beans, cheese, corn, and additional salsa if desired. So freaking good. I could eat this every night.
* Channa masala: Chickpeas, tomatoes/onions, spices. Serve with rice. If you buy dry chickpeas they are practically free! It helps to have a pressure cooker though.
* New Year's Meal: Mix 1 can of black-eyed peas with 1 can of stewed tomatoes. Serve with rice. I know it sounds plain but it's really good.
* Indian-style daal (lentils) with rice is really good too.

Sorry I don't have go-to recipes for any of this stuff. I'm still experimenting to figure out what recipes I like best, but experimenting is half the fun, right? :) Great thread--I'm vegetarian so rice &amp; beans are the basis of most of my meals. Best food ever!The wife: "Fuck this shit, I can't believe he put the slow cooker in shotgun"[Gallo Pinto](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/05/dinner-tonight-gallo-pinto.html) is a bit more flavorful take on rice and beans.  Basically it's rice and black beans, mixed with a bunch of diced peppers and onions with garlic and Worcestershire. I added a jalapeno and an extra green bell pepper.  Also, most recipes call for it to be mixed into plain white rice, but I prefer to serve on top and mix in as I eat.  Ate this for lunch last week. Cheap as hell, and pretty tasty. Goes great with eggs as well.You're a dinkSure, but most of my attempts have ended up overcooked - especially anything with tomato. So I feel like there has to be a compromise in there somewhere.Warm doesn't actually cook anything. It keeps it at a safe temperature to stave off bacteria from growing prior to consumption. Just soak your beans overnight in warm water then add them to the slow cooker.  It will turn out fine.

On a side note, you can substitute Chorizo for the Kielbasa, I tend to like the Mexican flavors better.

I have not tried dried beans, I have never cooked with them in any recipe. I do not know enough about how to cook with them.

I'm sure it could be done though. That sounds great! I'll be trying it soon

Have you ever tried getting dried kidney beans, would that effect the recipe?

( I ask, because I love how cheap dried beans are.)Red Beans and Rice is amazing:

3 cans of Kidney or red beans

2 cups of long grain white rice

1/2 TSP cumin

1 TSP salt

1/4 TSP black pepper

1 green bell pepper chopped

1 onion chopped

1 cup water

1 Kielbasa (optional) Hillshire Farms has a great turkey Kielbasa for ~$2 at my local store

Instructions:

Cook onion and peppers in oil for ~5 minutes, until transparent.

Rinse beans in cold water and add to slow cooker.

Combine and mix all ingredients (except rice) into slow cooker and cook on low for 5-6 hours.

Serve over hot rice, I also use hot sauce to taste. I prefer Goya brand, but that is up to you. I usually add some biscuits (like Great Grands) as a side.

*EDIT: Forgot to mention that I throw a cup of water in too so it has more liquid. It's one of those things I just do, but isn't written in the recipe. my bad!This may help you.
http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/party_planning.htmlThrilled to hear it! My wife is already asking me to make these again.This makes sense. Actually contemplating buying a pressure cooker-slow cooker combo.I think they mean set it on timer to be ready for the following evening. Won't kill you if your veggie, but definitely not going to be a good idea for meat.I don't think that's gonna fix you, dude. I just used that model Crock Pot to cook a pork loin last night.  It obliterated it. I added only 3 tbsp of olive oil for the liquid (along with several other spices, shallots, etc). At the end of cooking there was at least 2.5 -3 cups of liquid (that used to be inside the pork) in the bowl. The result, as always, was tough, dry meat.

I'm always amazed when people talk about how slow cookers help 'retain the moisture' of meat. In my experience they don't. They make bone dry, bland meat, which sits in a tub of liquid that used to be inside it.You are gonna want extra, just go a pound per person (pre-cooked weight).[Here's the link.](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/the-secrets-to-peeling-hard-boiled-eggs.html)Are you counting the glass lid?I've had this problem with all meatballs in the slowcooker, I've decided its way easier to just bake them at 350 for 20 minutes or so, then simmer in the sauce. Probably not the answer you're looking for but my crockpot meatballs are always so much worse than oven ones.And the fat shield on the shoulder. That's actually incredibly awesome looking. ThanksWill have to check it out, thanks!Mine arrived yesterday! Already have a pork joint cooking while I'm at work... Makes me salivate just thinking about it... It was gilded too...Not sure what the ratio is, but meat shrinks during cooking.  Likely going to need a bit more!ooo that sounds goodawesome. my buddy has a 03 tb. we call it the battlecruiser. it is falling apart on the inside, but it runs strong at 170k miles. :PThe vehicle is mint. It's an 06 but everything looks literally brand newMy local thrift store had 2 to choose from for less than 5 bucks. It depends how much sauce you need?  Like 3-4 cups of a gravy probably needs 2 tbsp of butter and flour and the liquid from the cooked meat. I wouldn't make the sauce first and cook meat in that. I would use the liquid rendered from meat plus additional water if needed to make the gravy. Also I wouldn't make too much at a time but rather make it as needed in amounts you can finish within 2-4 days. That's what I would do anyway so don't take this as gospel, just my own preferences.I may have to trade mine in, my sister and I have taken to calling it the burnanator.You can probably get around 4-6 oz. of pork on a single Hawaiian roll. Let's just assume it will be 5 oz. per sandwich... 5oz. x 20 people = 100 oz. or 6.25 lbs. If it were me I'd buy at least 8 lbs because there's nothing wrong with leftover pork. those seats look new, didnt they stop making trailblazers years ago?Don't underestimate a leadfoot.Who doesn't like croc stew!?

It's what took me so long to subscribe here. I went to the top posts and saw nothing but pictures of people buying crock pots and figured there wouldn't be anything worth subbing for. I missed out on a lot of good recipes because of that.Does your car not have a boot/trunk? :PHm, might be tempted to try that. As a rule of thumb, how much butter/flour should I use? I've read it's equal amounts of both, but exactly how much I'm not sure on. Can I make the roux and sauce first and cook the meat in that, or cook the meat first and use the liquid second? (I've also heard roux itself stays fresh forever, but I don't want to take that risk and make a huge batch to use as and when I need it)You're right, I withdraw my downvote, commited the cardinal sin of not reading the sidebar.Thanks, I shall give it a go :)Not really, considering this is a subreddit dedicated to the product in the post.

&gt; keep warm

I've read similar concerns on Amazon. It looks like the more recent Crock Pot brand slow cookers have their keep warm settings pushed up for "FDA regulations."

On a similar note, I've read the Hamilton Beach's keep warm function hasn't been messed with, yet.Keeps the pot warm at lower temp so your meal doesn't overcook.  Comes in handy when I misjudge the cooking time of something I've just thrown together and cook time is done a bit early for dinner.  Keeps meal warm/hot until meal time.Can confirm, have driven the '15 Chevy SS.I just got the same model last Christmas and I love it too,  and use  it often with delicious results.Got this from one of the "6 Ingredients or Less" threads.  It's essentially yellow curry if you can get the seasoning right.  Can also be a stew if not.

* 2 - 3 lbs. cubed chicken
* Half an onion, sliced
* Three new potatoes, cubed
* 1 cup baby carrots, halved
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup
* 1/2 cup chicken stock (or broth or water)

Throw it all in the pot on low for 8 - 9 hours.  You might try different proteins -- my chicken tends to come out a little dry.  You can also add beans, as well as a lot of different veggies.  Corn, peas, and/or peppers would all work well.  You can try for the yellow curry if you get curry powder/paste.  Other seasonings could include garlic (minced or powdered), salt &amp; pepper, chili powder, cumin, mustard.just watch the video of the finished product and hide your erection. done.

I just always chuckle.I don't know about any of the stuff you just said but I think we need you on the Mars mission.I hope you got the one with Wi-Fi.Good man. House of Boost Procharger kit, Texas speed LS6 heads, lunati voodoo mild blower cam, and an RPM lvl 7 transmission, you're looking at about 600 at the wheels on 6lbs of boost. crank it up to ten and you're over 700 easy. Just gotta be careful, because the T-case can't handle much past 750.

oh, and because it's an LS motor, it'll be reliable as fuck until the day you die.

They look amazing tooYou should check out [Chinese Tea Eggs](http://steamykitchen.com/2147-chinese-tea-eggs-recipe.html). you have the... third or fourth best SS ever made, depending on who you talk to. 2wd or awd?
Just ordered it, thanks!I use my cast iron skillet near daily. I eat eggs in some manner nearly every day, and a rice and bean burrito a few days a well(I fry/grill the tortilla).

I love my slowcooker but currently I'm only using it about once a week. Is that a vessel for cooking crocodiles? One of my neighbors has a Pontiac VXR G8 with Holden badges throughout. It's such a supremely sexy car. Came to check out the crock pot, left learning a hell of lot about transmissions.Ohh Clutch change is involved , but still WAY WAY WAY cheaper then a Auto , also MUCH simpler and you can have a  cheap mechanic do it or yourself .

now if you don't burn up the clutch early and are easy on it , you shouldn't have to change the clutch till close to 120k , sometimes longer
+50 on the manual transmission. Old school gearbox is so much simpler and more reliable than even simple automatics.

Never owned one though, and  always wondered what a clutch change is like.  I feel you. When I was growing up, we were broke. Every car well over a hundred thousand miles when we got them. My old man subscribed to the don't touch the transmission school, and he lost transmissions. I subscribed to the fluid and filter on schedule, and I lost transmissions.

Sometimes when they're gonna go, they're gonna go. And often times people turn to the fluid changes when they start having trouble, and then blame the failure on the change.

But in the last few years I've had a couple transmission issues crop up that definitely benefited from drop, drain, filter, refill.

For example, a 1994 grand marquis developed the infamous wash boarding so common to Panther cars of that generation. Changed out the twenty year old fluid and filter twice, and it cleared right up.

1998 suburban with the infamous 4L60e that was replaced in 2005. Sure enough, seven years later if started slipping badly shifting from first to second, and down shifting to climb hills on the highway. Fluid and filter change and no more issue.

We all have anecdotes, but as long as I want to take my cars to very high miles, I'm going to stick to the fluid and filter change on me maintenance schedule, or even more often to prevent crap from building up.

Now I just have to figure out what to do about transmissions without fill tubes or changeable filters.  If you're using a lot of onion in the recipe, then you'll smell it. Haven't had much of a smell with anything else.Because it's an older Toyota, it's just a cheap weekend swap away lol. If only I could afford cheap.Thanks this is great. I will try it this weekend. 4-5 on low. I'm not sure about the high setting because I don't cook on high. Maybe 3 hours on high. Ohhhh , ok :) just another reason to get a manual !!!Hitler Approved.&gt; Depends, if you water a soda down to about half it's original strength, would you say it's too sweet?

Warm &amp; flat, absolutely.I won't blame the recipe as it didn't indicate anything more than the ingredients, so I looked up the appropriate amount of time and came across that figure. Would you recommend that (4-5 hours max) for the low setting, and even shorter if set to high?No I meant the manual gets that much better, and is that much quicker lol.A damn good decision. Mankind was created to invent, distribute, and use the crockpot.

Give them an inch, they wanted a mile.My first instinct is to give your Father-in-law a can of ravioli and tell him to make his own damned dinner.I second this recipe. It's not really "honey baked" but I think this makes the best ham. Also, listen to the advice about what type of ham to buy as that makes a huge difference.Honey Ham is a Meat Food item produced in a Crock Pot by combining Meats with a total Meat value of 2.0 or more and 1 Honey.I made this monkey bread: http://www.crazyforcrust.com/2014/11/slow-cooker-cinnamon-roll-monkey-bread/ for Christmas this year.

I feel like it's one of those things that's always been on the shelf.I think I saw a version of this recipe on Fried Green Tomatoes.I love this recipe.

That seems unlikely. My father-in-law didn't die as a result of being slow-cooked in a honey-mustard glaze.

It doesn't carve into slices, but it is absolutely delicious.Well, this looks delicious!  And you've inspired me to riff on this and make a chicken &amp; broccoli cordon bleu casserole tonight.  Hope mine turns out as good as this looks!"father in law likes to find fault"

go to costco and get the spiral ham

and dont worry, i mess shit up with the father in law's food all the time (its even worse because hes a food sales guy!)

Honestly, I would just retort "Of course it's not perfect. Nothing ever will be." and let him know that you don't really give a shit about his opinion of your meal.Part of knowing a lot about something is also knowing when not to use it Seems to me like he's gonna complain no matter how good the food is.  Do what you want.Well really the sub is slow cook*ing*, which can also be done in ovens, grills, smokers, and on the stove top. Just gotta know your limits. Apple cider vinegar is hard to find?  I have been buying my own groceries for over 25 years and have never had trouble finding it, even in convenience stores.Protip: next time you make bacon and scrambled eggs, fry the bacon first, get it nice and crispy, then remove the bacon and deglaze the pan with apple vinegar. Dump the eggs right into the pan, vinegar and sucs and all, and cook them.You should probably update your original post with this info because most of your suggestions appear to revolve around using an oven instead of your slow cookerMy mother-in-law is a picky eater and said she wouldn't come over for St Paddy's Day because she "didn't like corned beef." My wife and I knew she really had no idea what it was and was making a decision based on the sound of it.  The next weekend, I made another one and called it pot roast. She are the hell out of it.

And she wonders why she doesn't get invited over more for dinner...  In laws can suck. Are you trying to replicate a ham you would get at HoneyBaked? Because there's nothing special about their hams. They are exactly like the ones you get at the grocery store that are pre-sliced and pre-cooked.

The glaze at HoneyBaked is just white sugar that's melted with an industrial propane blow torch. Right as the sugar has dripped all around the ham, the torch guy shakes a teeny tiny bit of mixed seasoning powder on it so that it looks and tastes like more than just caramelized sugar. As far as I know, theres no honey in the process. Then the hams (butt and shank pieces) are separated on a table and workers scrape the faces so theyre pretty. Then they get folded in that branded foil and get a 250% mark-up over the grocery store hams.

Edit: I used to work there during Christmas and Easter breaks during college. It was gruelling, but you could rack up tons of hours. They liked to fire you as soon as you hit 40 hours, but you could go gray when it was busy and get over 60. It was not uncommon to come in at 7:30 am and leave at 2:30 am. I actually worked a 30 hour shift once. My ankles never hurt so bad.

We would get the occasional customer who would insist, "I always get the glaze on the side!" We would look at each other and think, "but that's impossible?" The girl behind the counter (it was typically girls in the front, guys in the back) would smile and say, "sorry, sir, but it's against our policy to sell the glaze on the side anymore."ok ok ok ok ok... So I have a problem...How about a big electric frying pan with a lid?

Absolutely! When he is in your house, eating your food, benefiting from your hospitality, he best mind your rules.

I hope that your husband supports you completely, and recognizes the grace that you handle his ill- mannered father. Shame on him if he doesn't. I've read it in various places (I just bought a slow cooker and haven't used it yet, but before buying it I was reading up on them a bunch). For example, [this recipe says](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-and-shred-a-pork-shoulder-for-pulled-pork-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-79485) "Bone-in shoulders take a little longer to cook, but can make the meat more flavorful and succulent."Yeah, the slowcooker is really my only option for big meat. The oven I have is too small for a roasting pan (think old, atypical-sized oven from way-back-when). A 9x13 baking dish doesn't even fit.

I'll look into a smoker after I get a house, for sure! But indoors isn't quite ideal for smoking, eh? ;-)&gt; conversation is a virtue, but manners are a must.

Stealing this! Maybe I should make it into a nice little sign to hang in my house, like "house rules" :-PAfter he complains (because he will complain about something - there just is no placating that type of personality), remind him with a full, warm loving smile about what Ann Landers and Heloise both said about dinner guests: conversation is a virtue, but manners are a must. "This slow cooker sub is obsessed with slow cooking!!!" *shakes fist angrily*

"And you just know those /r/knifeclub people are constantly talking about knives!!" *loud voices*apple cider vinegar is just delicious with pig. Even with the Dr. P, the BBQ turned out a bit too tart. It was still edible though. I'll use more Dr. P next time, or find a different brand of sauce. Funny thing is, I don't remember it being that tart the last time I made pulled pork with just Carolina Treet. But then again, that was a few years back, and I was a smoker then.Sorry Digitalabia, [someone already won the great counter award.](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/311lj4/one_ingredient_pulled_pork/cpyd9hq)A butcher friend boiled his hams in Cook bags with some veg and such. He says this keeps the juices concentrated. Then after it's cooled in the bag you can glaze it in the oven. I had great success with a Jack Daniels and molasses glaze I found online. Apple cider vinegar is now the hero of a dozen fad diets and home remedies, so if your (non-Korean) grocery store is anything like mine you will not have any trouble finding it. I went from having to hunt it down to having a whole endcap of brands to choose from. So much this. I've tried ham so many times in the slow cooker and its always slightly disappointing. Use it for something else, like stuffing or potatoes.Cook it how you feel, if he complains suggest he cook next time.  then fire back.This subreddit is absolutely obsessed with making everything in a slow cooker, even things that really really shouldn't be made in one. I'd bet it's more work and a tougher cleanup to make a lot of the stuff people post here.

I'll stick with stews, roasts, etcOk,

I'm going to leave this recipe here. It's always a MASSIVE hit. I have catered events for 60 people with this, and make it every single Christmas for ours and other families. People literally hug me for making it, people I don't even know....

It's ridiculously good.

http://www.lifestylefood.com.au/recipes/214/peter-evans-baked-christmas-ham

You need to use an in oven meat thermometer to know when it's done. Oh and I guess it's off topic since you bake it in the oven.

Edit:

I'd also like to add that this recipe has a decent amount of liquid at the bottom of the baking dish, a good inch and half. This later is reduced to a sauce while the ham is removed to rest. I say this because I think it would translate well to a slow cooker. Can you get a temp probe into the meat inside the slow cooker? Shoot for an internal temperature of 140F at the thickest part, near, but not touching the bone.
8 hours on low is a safe bet if you dont have access to a thermometer or dont want to be constantly checking your pork.sweet baby rays... my fave...What he says!
Don't put it in the slow cooker.Tell him to bring his own ham or fuck off and go eat easter dinner some place else. I've always had excellent results with this recipe.  I don't add cloves:  http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/95400/honey-butter-yule-ham/?page=0Those who always like to find faults, will. It could be the best ham that has ever graced this earth, and someone will hate it, or argue that it wasn't ham-like enough. So just make it for the sake of making ham to feed your family, enjoy your company, enjoy the cooking aspect of it.

That being said, I like to use honey, pineapple, and brown sugar on my ham. Never made one in a slow cooker, but the oven instead.

Edit: I forgot how to English.Here's all you need to know...don't use a slow cooker. Put it in the oven with all the trimmings and cook an awesome piece of ham.

Not everything needs or should be made in a slow cooker.

That or buy a smoker and smoke that thing. Where did you read that? I'd always read/thought that the bone was a heat conductor and thus decreased the cooking time.

That said, I agree with Guegs that with a pork butt just cook it and when time's up go ahead and try to pull it a bit.I needed that laugh. I'm heading for my own dose of my father in law. Only it's two weeks (42 home cooked meals and I'm not an experienced cook). Kill me now.(I actually squealed)[It's a lot more than one ingredient](http://jackdanielsmeats.com/products/PulledPork/information.html)Watch your mouth, boy. I'm definitely trying this. Or a slight variation.

Thanks!The first step is to prepare a marinade. I suggest starting with honey mustard diluted with a ton of apple cider vinegar (you can usually find it at Korean grocers, if you can't get it from a mainstream places), then stirred until it's more or less even. You should get two distinct zings off your tongue when it's mixed right, one immediately (off the mustard), and one a split second later (vinegar), but with an overarching sweetness that cuts the effect considerably.

Then you'll want to marinade your father-in-law for at least two days. You may find him easier to marinade if you kill him first, but I've found some success hogtying mine and just letting them squirm...Cool  i'll give that a shot. Thanks!To the tune of [Shots?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNtTEibFvlQ&amp;t=1m18s)OP, consider x-poating this to /r/thewaywewere Well you have it on low, so that is your first problem. The spaghetti is probably wayy undercooked by the time 5 hours goes by. I wouldn't worry about it too much. If I were you, I'd cook it for the stated time, then try pulling it. If it pulls easily enough, it is done. If it doesn't, leave it for another hour and a half.Should I be shot on sight if I actually enjoy this stuff? Because I like to get drunk and eat an entire package of it after a particularly frustrating week.Hey Legofalcon,

LMAO!A RECIPE WOULD BE NICE!?!?! [Uhh...](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BXN_EgJCUAAea--.jpg:large)Wait, what?It would honestly take me just as long to go to my nearest Jack in the Box, order those egg rolls, and drive back as it would for me to make anything in my slow cooker. The closest one to me is over 300 miles away...Further instructions unclear. Microwave and slowcooker are now on my BBQ.Instructions unclear; I opened the slow cooker and instead of pulled pork there was a PT CruiserI got a huge piece of paper in the crock pot box it came it, stating "WARNING: Do not cook while the lid is locked". Yeah, I made the same mistake too. Posted earlier today with a serious question about what type of sauce to use with the Dr. P recipe, since all the ones I see just say "BBQ sauce" and got no response after hours went by. Then I actually went on the subreddit page and saw what's up. Just my luck. I really shouldn't go on the internet on April 1st.You know, I noticed that, after I posted. I went to the subreddit itself (I posted from the main page) and saw all the pulled pork shenanigans. Slowcooking is going to Jack in the Box at 3am and ordering the egg rolls that they have to fry up fresh. Five minutes for *fast food*, WTF?!&lt;3Pretzel rolls are the best kind of roll Dr~~.~~ Pepper Dr~~.~~ Pepper Dr~~.~~ Pepper Dr~~.~~ Pepper Dr~~.~~ Pepper Dr~~.~~ Pepper Dr~~.~~ Pepper Dr~~.~~ Pepper Dr~~.~~ PepperYou have my wordSomething something animal farm. http://i.imgur.com/YOBWxFs.jpgWth, take a quick survey before the recipe?

It wasn't too watery but not thick like stew. When you first put the ingredients in it will seem too watery but the added quinoa and brown rice and it soaks up most but not all the water.

And I would prefer to use ground beef but I am trying to eat healthier meat :)Wow is there a /r/shitty for everything?haha, i think its because everyone is joking about pulled pork.. so they are probably not reading your post.

as for your question, I am not sure.. I haven't tried the Dr.Pepper one. But i just picked up some local Texas BBQ sauce and it was delicious. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2qgx83/slow_cooker_chicken_cordon_bleu_rolls/) is the original link that I followed, except I added 1/4 cup more milk and 1/4th more white wine to double the recipe. (didn't really see the end where he/she adjusts the ratio until later).

Warning: I quickly changed the "high" to "low" setting after 15 minutes or so after I realized it was the wrong setting. Well, I didn't hear back from anyone. The pig is bathing in 20 ounces of Dr. Pepper at the moment. I'm gonna let it cook for a while just in that then add the Carolina Treet in later. Updates to follow. I highly doubt it will screw up the taste. I've done it with just the Treet before, no DP, and it turned out great.^^^\(no, ^^^but ^^^don't ^^^tell ^^^anyone ^^^- ^^^that ^^^might ^^^ruin ^^^the ^^^joke!)Nah, he won med school so hard they let him decide how to write DrYou are correct!

There's no . in Dr PepperYeah I don't understand how no one can see that this is obviously photoshopped. Absolutely everything is in the same position.That's awesome! I'm glad you tried it and I'm glad it turned out! Good luck in your future slow cooking endeavors! Yeah fuck the pretzel rolls! It couldn't have been the fact that you ate, you know, five of them. this sounds like /r/ShittyAskCooking Try replacing ground turkey with two tins of Hereford or any make really, of corned beef. Just cube it and chuck it in half way through cooking. You'll be pleasantly surprised. Well, the short answer is "cook it till it's done."

At the very least, the roast needs to be 145F (63C) in the center, use a meat thermometer.

If it's fully cooked and is easily shreddable, then you're good to go.

If it's not easy to shred, let it cook for another 30 or 60 minutes and try again.PULLED PORK?It's done. Your advice is too late. And it's delicious. I'll remember it for next time though. Minimum cook time on Low? I'd say check it after 6 hours but it should be good to cook for 8-10. I never cook on high so I might not be the best person to ask but based on other recipes I've seen, I'd say 4-6 hours.

Another thing I just thought of: if your meat has a slab of fat on one side, put that side up so as the fat melts off it goes over/through the meat. You don't have to flip/rotate your meat in a slow cooker but I sometimes do when cooking in liquid just because it makes me feel good. Don't flip it if it has that fat side though, keep that baby facing the sky.Ok, ok, I know it's a joke and all, but did you actually make this?Named Petrograd in 1914, Leningrad in 1924 after Lenin's death, and it wasn't named St. Petersburg until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Love that Google!I actually had this stuff not too long ago. It wasn't that bad!

I'd have preferred something better but we'd been hit with a snow storm and everything was closed/closing. It worked ok in a pinch.Mr. Peter no hereIt it a good idea to pre-soak the hamburger rolls in Dr. Pepper before dumping it down the drain?You're right I think that would be really funny. 1) Go to the store and purchase pork-shoulder, bbq sauce and Dr.Pepper

2) Mix the pork and bbq in your slow cooker and let sit for 8 hours on low

3) While cooking, set the Dr.Pepper on a table and stare at it menacingly

4) After 8-hours eat your pulled pork; make the Dr.Pepper watch longingly

5) Finally, pour the Dr.Pepper down the sink like the dirty whore it isI am :( my sister is coming to visit with 3 kids and her husband and they won't be here till late, it'd be the best thing to feed them all.

Once I get more money to blow on specialty ingredients I'll have to check this out.No, it was renamed a few years before - after WWI broke out.  Made the city sound more Russian and less European/German.Can the advertising get any more obvious?I don't understand: when do you add the Dr. Pepper?I don't know why but that's the funniest thing I've read all day today.

Seriously I can't stop laughing! Seriously. HelpAre you serious? I just told you that a moment ago. Oh, okay. How long? Like 6 or 7 days or so?I find it hilarious. Today is my son's birthday and his favorite meal is the Dr Pepper pork. So I was already making it when I got on reddit today and saw all this. no use your microwave as a slow cooker, since the pulled pork is already pulled and porkedDid you turn the temperature dial the other way? Looks like it was cooked in reverse. It's actually my birthday so i think i can do what i want. ..lolWasn't it St. Petersburg then?Looks like Old Major is getting tired of Mr. Jones. Come on all together let's sing "Bests of Enaland."...Pulled pork?You let the vegetarian cook, I can tell.  The color is all off.  Ok this is a pretty simple recipe, but it is super delicious.

Ingredients:

-Ice cream

Directions:

1. Add ice cream to slow cooker

2. EatRecipe please!  It's the same photo from the packet... :/I love the way coke smells! That's why I sniff it so much!I prefer coke. Dr. Pepper leaves a weird taste and smell. Oh damnit. Now I want pretzel rolls..&gt;  Dish tastes like smoked cardboard.

To be fair, that was likely going to be the case no matter how you prepared it.[Like this.](http://i.imgur.com/6GOyw3f.jpg)/r/shittyfoodporn is this way --&gt; [;)](/r/shittyfoodporn)Thanks for setting me straight. I had no idea!The Jack Daniels pulled pork is good, it's just a bit too sweet. I love sweet bbq too, but it's a bit much.OR, you could look at your calender and realize what day it is.Instructions unclear; microwave does not fit in slow cooker.# #STEPUPYOHASHTAGGAMESON

 #booyahkashaAdd more Dr. Pepper. Because it's not pork. No, no it was definitely Dr Pepper when I put it in. IDK what happened.It feeds 6-8!  I'm assuming 6-8 infants because it's quiet a small portion but who knows!  I'm not so sure Jenna's a woman anymore...Not pulled pork *gasp*.  Well played OP, but where's the Dr. Pepper?Omg no! Throw that out everyone knows it you don't soak Pepsi overnight it can be dangerous!  *gasp* not pulled pork oh the humanity *faints*Actually, and this is no april fools, I've had it at football games in the midwest.  It's a completely different taste than when cold and carbonated, but it's good.No period.

Upvote.I mean, it has a ridiculous amount of ingredients... You just don't add them yourself...

No thanks. Could just buy any other pre-prepared meal and do the same.27 dollars? Great googly moogly.You posted a non pulled pork recipe on April 1st? Are you mad? Also, this looks like a great one and I will definitely try it.Instructions unclear:  still trying to understandJust to go against the grain I have had this before and if you are in a hurry it really isn't that bad i have had far worse instant meals.You're *both* right!^(hot Dr. Pep with a bit of lemon is pretty good, check it out)Mkay. So I got a ~5 pound pork roast for some pulled pork. What's the minimum time I should keep it in there? Here's the recipe I used
http://allrecipes.com/recipe/all-day-apple-butter/detail.aspxI told you folks yesterday there's no punctuation in Dr Pepper and got downpepsi'ed into oblivion. Now look what's happened.Although on a slightly more serious note, apparently artificial sweeteners take on a real bitter flavor when cooked for extended periods.No. Pepsi is never ok. Just pitch it.So how come I never see pulled beef in the sub?The silicon dioxide ties it all together.It looks like your problem here is that you used pepsi max instead of dr. pepper.  It should still be safe to eat, but definitely won't taste the same.  Ain't nobody got time for that!!Try [this one](http://m.thelcn.com/news/pulled-pork-ice-cream-finds-fans-at-tom-wahl-s/article_aa60e7d3-0807-515d-aea8-4964f24ba1c4.html?mode=jqm)Yeah, anytime I'm in the kitchen the fuzzball is at my feet. Dropped food rarely makes contact with the floor, it is captured mid-air to prevent me from being able to reclaim it. I dropped a slice of jalapeno one time - she grabbed it in mid air, looked puzzled and offended, then spit it out; but as soon as I reached down to pick it up, she darted back in and ate it. She didn't want it, but it was more important to not give it back :)Hey if someone didn't want to accept your pig as tender, take it up with them.Do you think it's still safe to eat?Here's the recipe I used:
&gt; Recipe: 1 sweet onions chopped up and put on the bottom, threw in 2 cloves of chopped, then 2.5 pounds of pork butt with ~24oz of Dr. Pepper on top. I added some chili powder, cayenne pepper, and salt to the pot and then left it on high for ~5 hours. Then I pulled out the pork and pulled it apart. I poured out most of the liquid from the pot, and put the pulled pork back in. Then I added bbq sauce and left it on high for about 45 min, and ate it because I couldn't resist any longer. I got a pork you can pull (  )Because it's nowhere near as good as hot Mountain Dew Code Red.

#shrekt #getonmylevelFunny? How is this funny?

Seriously, bro. Don't knock it till you try it.ha, that's some awesome aprils day fools joke? YAY!You have to beat the resistance out of the animal before butchering. That tenderizes it. I woke up on the wrong side of the bed for April Fools Day.The funny thing is Dr. Pepper did try to get people to drink hot Dr. Pepper as a substitute for coffee at one point.**Ingredients**

boneless pork injected with water, salt, phosphate, rubbed with (black pepper, salt, brown sugar, garlic, onion), bbq sauce (dark brown sugar, sugar, water, onion, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce [water, wheat, soybean, salt] tomato paste, vinegar, molasses [molasses, wheat starch, soy flour, calcium stearate, soy lechitine] corn syrup, corn starch, vegetable oil, garlic, salt, seasonings, Tennessee whiskey, lemon juice, caramel color, cayanne pepper, black pepper, worchestershire sauce and silicon dioxide.
Contains soy and wheat products.

So, we should count those as one? Ooo maybe next year! No, no, no lemon pledge.Why did I read the entire title... also chanted it in my head.I'd pull her pork.Noo-o-o-ooooI made some yesterday too but assembled it in taco form (since ground beef makes me sick). Best decision I've ever made.This isn't pulled pork!!  *gasp*I JUST WOKE UP DON'T TELL ME WHAT I DON'T HAVE TIME FORBut why male models? I'm not sure, but I think it might be shredded pork, he was kind of vague with his description.quoiYou must not have dogs If it's good enough for the Hoff it's good enough for me!About two minutes. Happy April 1st.When I make corned beef, I pour in one bottle of dark beer - usually Guinness but I am actually making a corned beef tonight as well and only had Negra Modelo in the house so in it went. I kind of judge after that, but I put in water after that until about 3/4 up the sides.

I would highly suggest waiting until the last two hours or so to add your root veg. Cut them into 2-3 inch chunks and then add near-ish the end. The veg will be cooked but not mushy. I'd also suggest quartering a large white onion if you have one and adding that to your mix. :)

EDIT - this is in a tight crock as well. Don't leave much room at all. Your meat will get smaller as it cooks and you'll have room for the veg at the end.For maximum tenderness, put microwave on the lowest setting possible and slow cook it.

:DPickled red onions as well? That's a fantastic idea, and a great alternative for people who don't like slaw.I know! It really brings out the umami quality of the anchovy extract!The heat really brings out the flavors of the Dr Pepper. When it's just below boiling point you really taste all 23. Ooooo! I'd be up for interesting orders at different restaurants. Like off-menu burgers or something. Mmmm. That happens and it freaks a lot of first timers out, but it's a completely normal part of the process. You need to leave it in there for another 6 hours for the juices to reabsorb.How long did you put your dr pepper in there?

I tried putting the can in for 6 hours but it just leaked everywhere...\\\_()_/Yes I understand that, but is it Pulled Pork?Cheeseburgers, meatloaf, tacos, or a whole slew of dishes could be made with hamburger. Soup? Not even once.Shimmer is a floor wax!

It's a dessert topping!We need more lemon pledge.Canadian bbq is amazing!  We do it in - 40 degree weather!  Jenna said what?Got this once. Seemed they forgot to add the pork, mine was all fat.Recipe unclear.  Plastic wrap melted to inside of slow cooker.  Dish tastes like smoked cardboard.A+ would read againAfter enough Tennessee whisky, you become very friendly with the floor. Eating food off them adds a little je ne sais quoi.Yeah I think the beer was good, the whiskey not so much. Plus I clearly put in too much whiskey, or didn't have enough meat.

Either way, it tasted *ok* but was a bit strong. I plan to get a second opinion tonight and offer it to my friends as "beef that will get you drunk"Pfft. I hate that guy.

**EDIT** Hooray! My first April Fools Day downvote!Alton Brown recommends Murphy's Oil Soap.I put beer in almost all my recipes, it adds so much to the meal.  Whiskey not so much but I have used tequila for many Mexican dishes, it adds a little something for sure. Probably due to tomatoes having flavor compounds that are alcohol soluble, vodka may have given the same results.How long did it take to slow heat?Hardwood floors? You know the lemon pledge makes for a second ingredient, right?"Pork'n pull"

Heh heh.I feel like this sub missed the opportunity to post only fast food pictures and recipes today. Maybe next year? Most people don't know this, but as a culinary chef I learned in chef school that hardwood floors add a musty flavor to the pulled pork. I'm glad OP recognises this and has shared. People never believe me. NO

IT'S PULLED PORKIs it minced?Refreshing on a hot dayCostco sells a pulled chicken version of this that is DELICIOUS on their pretzel rolls.This is slowcooking Inception. Mind blown. # Ingredients


* 1 package of pulled pork


# Procedure

1. The package told me to heat it in my microwave or oven (pulled pork in the *microwave*?!? really Mr. Daniels?).
1. The instructions that came with my slow cooker warned not to use it to reheat food.
1. I ignored both of them (it cancels out, right?). I just tossed the whole thing my slow cooker and let 'er rip.

Totally legit. Don't believe me? Chow.com even [reviewed](http://www.chow.com/food-news/74897/pulled-pork-thats-more-sugar-than-pork/) this stuff:

&gt;  ...the packaging of Jack Daniel's Pulled Pork says "vintage Harley-Davidson," the flavor says "PT Cruiser."

PT Cruiser indeed. Mmmm.I like buns, buns are nice!  I think it's been eaten once alreadyAs an Australian I was super confused about this post until your comment. If you eat that you'll be making hamburger soup.It's working! It's working! I blasted it on high for a further two hours and after that I pulled the joint out and its just crumbled.

I guess you just got to cook it long enough at the right temp, depending on the size of the joint you are cooking (I've always had better luck with smaller joints)

Shall invest in one of the probe thermometer and may the slow cooking Gods guide my way.But it promises a "legacy experience" - are you questioning the immaculate heritage of prepackaged Canadian barbeque?-Chilli con carne

-shredded salsa chicken

- pulled pork

In no particular orderthis looks absolutely repulsive to me, sorry lolCheck your date, sir.Second this. I make ratatouille in the slow cooker with pesto and it is amazing. Serve with couscous or a grain to enjoy the broth!actually it's not, just ground meat ;)

You'd think the word derives from "ham" but [it comes from the city of hamburg actually.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger#Etymology)Too much bun, not enough pulled pork

amiright?Is this an advertisement?
I strongly doubt that.Try adding some canned tomatoes  (diced, sauce or paste) for flavor and body.  I also use a can of diced tomatoes and chilis for some heat.Right.  This is turkeyburger soup, not hamburger soup.  Though it's a pretty unimportant point for me to argue about.  Ground meat soup is ground meat soup :)It could be a turkeyburger o:That's what I have. It's awesome. &gt;Hamburger Soup

Recipe calls for ground turkey.  While it does sound tasty, hamburger is, by definition, ground beef.i made one similar and it was sort of like vegetable soup - chunks of meat and veg, but thinner base - all depending on how much rice or quinoa you put in, right?  If you want it thinner, add more broth or put in less rice. Don't skimp on your spices or F/O/Soup Mix, add seasonings and garlic for sure because the meat is bland without it. i've cooked my meat beforehand (mostly), and while it's cooking I add the spices to make the meat more flavourful. just my 2 cents! :)I just bought one with a temp. probe. It's a real beauty. It can cook for X hours then switch to warm, cook until probe reaches X degrees then switch to warm, or run manually until I turn it off or it burns the place down. (shuts down automatically after 14 hours on) - [image](http://i.imgur.com/A4aJOsz.jpg)This is a little tricky since different countries, and even locales use different names for cuts.

In beef, a "lean" cut with little connective tissue would be topside, so I assume top round as well. What you want for slow cooking is beef shanks, sometimes marketed as Osso bucco, or chuck (stewing) steak, also brisket.That is correct. I left it simmer on low heat, uncovered for about 30-40 minutes. It had a pretty steady stream of bubbles and steam rising off of it during that time. I do think that the corn starch helped things come together, but I'd imagine that without it you'd perhaps just have to simmer longer?Im not really an expert bc Im home to check so here are my "tips" and all times are approximate and not frozen. I would add 2 more hours if froen on breasts.

* chicken breasts 3 hrs high and 5 on low. Longer if they are bone in
* beef roasts can cook for 8 hours no issue. I think they dry out if they stay on too long
* chicken thighs with bones in can cook for a long time too. I think you could push 8 hours. Especially if there is sauce
* beef stew, yeah that only improves but ten hours is the max I think
* crockpot Pho cook it forever it only improves. Not literally of courseAny rules I can follow? Just worried about eating undercooked food, but I am sad about sacrificing flavor =(.Yes! I love this soup. Sometimes I throw in a can or two of Pork and Beans to make it a little bit heartier.Thanks for sharingI would lower the time, especially with chicken breasts.Any time I make this it comes out watery and bland.  What kind of thickness does this recipe have?Pretty good actually. Had the top off evaporating for 2 hours. Alcohol was definitely present but good. Only had two bites so far- SO is taking test so I drained and added bbq sauce until she's done since it was also a little dry. Will report back!Examples from experience? All my store carries on a steady basis is top round. How did this turn out, OP?!I think both China and Italy do indeed have farm animals. In fact I think you'll have to pay extra if you *don't* want Chinese meat.The link is in the original post found on /r/tonightsdinner. The slow cooker calls for 1 to 1.25 hours. I'm thinking, with the cut of beef, something in the 6-8 hours (low setting) and this would be just fine.

Basically a pot roast but a variable on the sauce. Any thoughts? I like the idea of the mustard and fresh herbs w/ the porter beer of course!From my experience, 8 hours on high is either barely enough, or not enough. In general, you cook things on low for roughly twice the time that you'd cook them on high. I've put a pork roast on for 14 hrs on high and it's come out really well.Looks good.  Definitely giving this a shot.The downvotes simply came from someone whose idea of slow cooking is limited to bbqs and roasts - it's not our fault that they're limiting their options :)Didn't realize the typo "so salt" but glad you figured it outOR we're after an alternative result with a more complex flavour than fat and desire a vegetable stock to achieve that result. Pretty narrow minded stance you've taken.That looks good.  I will have to give this a try.We need way more info about the cut you're using, the cooking time, etc. My guess is the cut, though. Fattier cuts are way, way better for slow-cooking. A lean cut should be cooked hot and quick.- One pound ground turkey
- One pound gold potatoes, diced
- One pound mixed vegetables
- 16 ounces beef broth
- One packet of French onion soup mix
- Steak seasoning and garlic (eyeballed it)
- a sprinkling of quinoa and brown rice
- a squirt of ketchup and mustard
- Water until covered

Cook on low for eight hours. I am thinking of making drop biscuits to go with it. totally possible, but regardless touching any part of the pot would be direct heat.  I will freely admit, I may be doing this for no good reason.  But it just always made sense to me.  Im sure the pork touches the sides during the cooking process, but I try to avoid it.  Awesome! thanks!What type/cut of meat does not contain enough moisture on its own?  I haven't had that problem yet, but I'm curious for future experiments.  Honestly, OP is just thinking about it too much and you probably are too. There's not a whole lot of ways to screw up a slow cooker meal, especially that pulled pork recipe.

I would say, as a beginner, find a recipe that you like the way it is and try it out exactly as it says. Once you've cooked a few dishes you'll start to understand the "why" behind some steps and you'll be able to adjust recipes yourself. I also recommend watching Good Eats. It's pretty much the best cooking show ever and it's incredibly informative. He doesn't just tell you he's searing meat, he tells you why he's searing meat and exactly what difference that makes.

As for some general slow cooking tips:

* The slower the better
* Don't be afraid to take the lid off and check on things, just don't go overboard. You don't need to be checking on it if you know it's not done so keep it closed for the first few hours
* Liquid is NOT needed in a slow cooker. It's a common misconception but since you're retaining most/all of the steam you shouldn't need liquid for  most things;
* Experiment! Maybe try a recipe you already know and cook and just throw it in the slow cooker instead. I use it for chili and soups so they have lots of simmer time for the flavors to combine. That might not be helpful if you're totally new to cooking though.

Don't be intimidated. Worst case, you're out maybe $10-$15. Don't go to the movies the next time you want to and you're even. Or some other equivalent activity if you're not into movies like me. If you're in the market for good temp taking gear check out ThermoWorks. All of us in /r/BBQ and /r/smoking swear by them.If you like Old Bay, add 1/4 cup of that with 4 cups of water. You could also use lemon pepper seasoning instead of Old Bay; adds a twang to BBQ chicken sandwiches.Skim the fat off. Use the stock for chili, tacos, [cheese dip](http://modernistcuisine.com/recipes/melty-queso-dip/), etc.I got a russel-hobbs crockpot on amazon for 28 (=$30)

I've only used it three times, but so far I'm satisfied

-e- I'm actually trying the dr pepper-pulled pork from the sidebar with it right now, only I use cherry coke (and some other minor differences

Only had it for a month, but I love it alreadyYa, I've never done this. And it's pretty intimidating. There's a lot of cooking shows out there and some are better than others but Good Eats is about as good as it gets. SO much to be learned from that show!Definitely don't use water. Ew!

You're better off using no liquid than using water. The liquid part isn't important, it's the sugar and flavors. Your meat should be juicy enough to not dry out so don't worry about it. I also like using root beer or beer. I'm not sure I would care for pulled pork cooked in chicken broth.I saw someone on here mention the other day that they took a slow cooker apart and the heating element was actually a ring around the pot about halfway up, rather than at the bottom.Too late on this, but I actually cooked a pork butt in my slow cooker last week, and yes, I seared it in a skillet for ~5 minutes on both sides (after seasoning liberally with sea salt, black pepper, and garlic powder). Eight hours on low, later, and the meat was as tender as could be.I see your point. I mean, I tend to cook chops and tenderloin in the oven or on the grill, and throw shoulders in the crockpot. I'm basically Hitler. You cook it until it falls apart. I've never had a trouble. Every time I cook a whole chicken it falls apart when I take it out.I like cooking my meats on High for more than five hours. Might be over kill. But I never had that issue of tough meats that you are having.Slow and low. That's really it. And why that ring is the hardest part to scrub off when cleaning!I've definitely seen that advice as well. I wouldn't consider it cheating. :)#####&amp;#009;

Coincidentally, six hours is about the time that I start having some serious fire management issues (I use a cheap-o Weber-knock off kettle which has shitty air flow control).  So this is when I cheat and get lazy by putting the meat in a dutch oven and stick it in a 200-210 degree oven to finish.it's possible your cut of meat didn't have enough connective tissue/fat If you wrap it in foil once it hits the stall temp it will get through that stage much faster. Plus, I think it helps it stay moist. We always save the liquid that is in the foil and then mix it back in once the meat is pulled.Awesome! Thanks for the post!

I'm thinking, if anything, I might give it some time between coming home and dinner (an hour or two) to sit with the top off to evaporate some of the alcohol.

I guess I'll also drain it, though I'm not sure what to eat it with since I used stew meat. I made a lot of questionable choices this morning.I read it as a joke. We're havin' fun here, no?Huh, interesting. I actually didn't use very much whiskey. Just a splash, if memory serves. Perhaps there is a slight difference in the cookers?It's not something I've ever cared about, but i googled and found this article which might alleviate some of your fears.

http://terminalverbosity.com/soapbox/environment/the-skinny-on-lead-in-crock-pots-it-may-surprise-you/Beer is my go-to liquid of choice when slow cooking, mostly because I always have lots of it. The only beers I would avoid are particularly hoppy IPA's or anything too expensive - you're not going to get a lot of nuance, beer is mostly water anyway. Yuengling is probably the perfect beer to use since it's cheap, tasty and readily available. Buy a case, cook with some, drink the rest.

I like to use dark stouts and porters with beef and lighter beers with pork and chicken.

As for whiskey, I use that too. The alcohol flavor does not burn off like it would in an open pan, but sometimes you want that alcohol flavor. If not, a tablespoon or two will add whiskey flavor without the burn. One of my favorite recipes is equal parts ketchup, brown sugar and bourbon with cocktail weenies. Always a hit.

As for your question: I think it'll be great. Let us know!I figured it would be clear I was making a joke. I apologize for the miscommunication.

To answer your question, sticky fingers are usually the result of a combination of the sauce and the gelatin.Um, ok. You went from scientist to douche in one comment.   Great science from the top commenter.

My experience is that it generally just depends on the fat content of the meat and how long slash at what temp setting you are slow cooking.

Pork loin, for example, is going to be tougher, much more so than shoulder.

Another tip I've heard on hear that I've tried once and will be trying a few more times is chicken thighs instead of breasts.No, you get sticky fingers because your table manners are atrocious. Use a napkin, maybe a moist towelette.Is this why I get sticky fingers from eating roasted pork sandwiches?buy a beef SHOULDER. the cut makes a huge difference.Slow cooking meat makes it fall apart.

You can braise, or slow cook your meat before you throw it in you chili to get better results. You probably don't want to cook your chili as long as the meat. It will turn to mush.

You can use a slow cooker or braise in a pan that can go in the oven. You shouldn't need more than 2.5 hours if your meat is cut into chunks the size of your fist.

I'm not a huge slow cooker person, but love braising, its easy too. I use a cast iron to sear the sides of the meat (remember, fist size chunks, seasoned). Then add liquid, I have used wine, beer, water, broth, spices all with good results. Put in enough liquid to cover the meat, but leave 1/2 sticking out of the top. Cover the pan, at least with foil, and cook in a 350F oven for 1.5-2 hrs. I've done this with the cheapest pork loin at the megamart, and it come out amazing.

Then add this to your chili and enjoy!

I always use beer along with some type of other liquid when slow-cooking pork and have never had that problem.  Maybe you used too much whiskey?I'd also like to point out that too MUCH liquid can keep your meat too tough, taking much longer to break down. I try to keep mine about half to two-thirds up the side of the chunk of meat at most.Ah, The Stall. I feel your pain, brother.Fuck. I forgot about the slow cooking elitists. All true, except in my experience, the magic temp for pulled pork is 190.  I love smoking pork shoulder, but the damn thing always stalls at 160/165 for a few hours before finally making the enchanted trip 190-ville.Just cook it longer.  Its damn near impossible to overcook a pork shoulder in a slow cooker.  It's not though. A cut of meat that you intend to slow cook should have enough fat to create its own juices and shred up perfectly. If you have to add liquid you're using the wrong cut. Water imparts exactly zero flavor. Chicken broth is a great alternative, or beer. Low heat for 8 hours and anything becomes fall-apart tender.Sounds like a plan. It's not a bad idea to compare various styles to get a better sense of what kind of flavors the different techniques bring. Plus, pre-searing adds a series of additional steps and creates more mess, although (I think) it's worth it.

For the pinto beans I just pre-soak beans overnight and cover them in the crock pot with the pulled pork broth &amp; leftover fat and cook. Super simple, super tasty!You actually want your liquid to be a lot lower temperature than the boiling point. You will find that temperatures around 190 will give you better results than a rolling boil. This will appear to be simmering. New slow cookers are inferior to old ones that will cook at lower temperatures due to food safety Nazis.

I would hesitate to go by internal temperature alone when looking for tenderness. Breakdown of collagen is time plus temperature. I remember an article in cooks illustrated a while ago saying that an internal temp of about 190 for at least an hour resulted in fall apart meat with a pork shoulder. What is being described is called braising, which is slow, moist heat cooking for long periods of time.  This breaks down the connective tissue, and is used for cuts of meat that are tougher.  They are very flavorful after being cooked in this way.Can't say. I've never tried it.Right, as in "don't sweat making sure you have plenty of liquid in the crock pot"For Beef and Pork, Low and Slow overnight. Yes, lean cuts tend to respond better to quick cooking methods such as pan frying or roasting.

http://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/ultimate-steak-guide-how-to-cook-a-steakIf I throw a packet of unflavored gelatin in with the broth/stock, would that have any effect on the tenderness of a leaner cut of meat?The amount of water vapour released by the smouldering wood is incredibly small by comparison. The water already contained in the meat is where the water comes from.

Beef is approximately 75% water, whereas wood used in smokers is a maximum of 25-35% water and that is released as a high temperature gas over a long period. Only a very small volume of this gas, which is now at 0.06% of the density of the liquid water in the meat, is absorbed on the outer layers of the meat. The liquid water inside the meat is always in contact with the internal collagen layers during the cooking process, until such time as the meat is significantly dehydrated.enjoy your future yummy soups! I usually store up 3 rounds of juices in the freezer before making soup. My husbands favorite was a pumpkin soup I made in a pumpkin with the lamb and turkey stock I had in the freezer.Thanks for the info! I shall look into getting a meat thermometer, and possibly going for meat with a bit more fat laced through it, it was quite a lean cut. Assuming that helps!Put it in on low at 9pm last night, switched it off and tried pulling it apart at 7am before work! So... Good 10 hours!Cool, I'll definitely give it a shot  thanks!juices that come off the meat and mix with the fluid of choice when slow cooking is a stock/base you can use in soups. I will cut up carrots, celery, potatoes, and some left over chicken or even a turkey carcass or leftover ham bone from easter to add to the soup.

Get yourself a nice fine strainer you can pour your crockpot juices into so you can get a very pretty base and keep it in a Tupperware in the freezer. Look up any soup recipe that calls for stock or broth of some sort. Use your crock pot juices instead :) Using red wine for beef roasts in a crockpot is some of my favorite things to use later in soup!

I usually don't water down my soups unless I don't have enough broth stored in the freezer to cover all my veggies and anything else I want in my soup. I like my soups to have lots and lots of flavor without having to add salt laterWorst case scenario is it is going to taste like whiskey, which isn't such a bad thing at all. It will definitely be edible, but if the flavor is too overwhelming, try adding complimentary flavors to the whiskey, sweet and spicy.Alcohol doesn't boil away in a slow cooker, since it keeps all moisture. I know this because I flavored chilli with whiskey once and then got a headache when I was eating it for lunch the next day. Cooking it for a bit in an open saucepan fixed it, but it did dry the whole thing out.

So yeah, don't flavor slow cooker recipes with alcohol.I was a bit concerned about that as well. Is there a likely worst case scenario? I doubt there's enough in there for anyone to get sick.

And as long as it tastes good...

I'm not sure if it'll be edible when it's done or if I'll need to strain it and cook it in anything else for a bit, like bbq sauceYup.  20-hour pork shoulder is always the same wonderfully tender consistency and I never add liquid.This.  It seems counterintuitive, but if a pork shoulder or a chuck roast is too tough, it means the meat hasn't reached collagen melting temperature.I prob would have stuck with one or the other but I am sure it will still be deliciousDon't know why you got downvoted. It's seriously as simple as liquid + time. Lmao seriously. I actually get angry because the meat falls apart too much and I have to ladle it out.

Cook your meat for longer dude! It's not rocket science. This is the right answer. It may seem counterintuitive if you want moist meat, but you have to go beyond what the "done" temperature for your meat in order to break it down and get tender, fall-apart meat. It shouldn't dry out though, especially in a slow cooker where you have a lot of wet heat (the moisture isn't going to escape the slow cooker). Let the meat rest after you've cooked it and it will reabsorb its juices. yuengling and a shot or two's worth of Jack DanielsWhat kind of beer and whiskey did you use? After you mentioned that I was curious so I looked it up  I guess it used to have a period but then at some point in the 1950s they dropped it for some reason.I will *definitely* give this a shot!Well, in the case of smoking meat, the water vapor released by the smoldering wood is plenty, so I wouldn't sweat it too much as long as you're cooking a good fatty chunk of meat.Got it, thanks!For me, any time meat has turned out too tough, another hour or 2 of cooking has taken care of the problem.Thanks! I think it helped that I've been watching episodes of Good Eats (and have had to deal with plumbing problems) and when I tried making something really simple that he did (vanilla ice cream), it wasn't 'til I was actually in the middle of doing it that I realized there were certain things he didn't specifically mention. (Actually it also happened when I tried making the [breakfast tacos on the Sin City dvd extras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt0ZIMTzqJI))

So when I read through the pulled pork recipe in the sidebar I actually pictured myself doing it and when I'd get to certain steps I'd be like, "wait, the recipe isn't totally clear here." But at the same time when I looked at my questions I realized that they might be things that someone who's been cooking for a while might take for granted and only a noob might be wondering about.I'd like to add that the chemical reactions for the breakdown of collagen only occur in the presence of water (moisture).

So it's also important to maintain a low temperature to reduce the rate of evaporation, or add liquid. Often however the moisture contained in the meat will be enough, but not always.  Catching a couple of episodes of Good Eats is *exactly* why I thought I might give cooking a try. My first foray into cooking was after I saw his ice cream episode  I bought an ice cream maker, a box of kosher salt (not specifically just for the ice cream), and some vanilla beans and was hooked!The cut of meat is very important here.

The cuts used for slow cooking should contain lots of connective tissue which will break down over time to gelatine as other posts outline.

Lean cuts with little connective tissue will dry out irrespective of how long you cook them for.

Nice!Hmmn, good point on the bbq sauce having enough salt already  I hadn't thought of that.Ooooh, foil cup  I like that idea!I figured I'd do at least one or two rounds without searing before trying the searing thing just so I can compare the two. And I'll have to look up that pinto bean thing  sounds tasty!Since I'm new to cooking I have to ask  how do you use the juices for soup? As in do you mix it with water or chicken broth or something? And if so, are you doing it one to one or more like one part juices to two parts water or something along those lines?Good tip  thanks!I've seen a few recipes that do the searing thing  I figured I'd give that a shot after I've done the non-seared version at least once so I'll have something to compare it to.Pepperoncini Beef:
1 Chuck Roast
1 16oz Can Sliced Pepperoncinis

BBQ Sauce Pulled Pork:
1 Pork Shoulder
1 Bottle BBQ Sauce

Pot Roast:
1 Chuck Roast
Potatoes, Onion, Carrots rough chopped placed in slow cooker below Chuck Roast
Braising Liquid such as water or wine or beer.6 hours+ and a reasonable amount of stock/water/liquid is usually what makes any meat I put in mine either fall apart or shredScientifically speaking, what causes tough cuts of meat to turn into tender, falling apart goodness is the breakdown of collagen. Cook collagen too quickly and it gets tough. Cook it to too low an internal temperature and it never breaks down.

So, how slow do we need to cook the meat? Conventionally, your slow cooker should cook at about 215 degrees Fahrenheit, just above the boiling point of water at sea level.  This is why your liquid simmers in a lovely way creating that awesome sauce down at the bottom of the pot.  This is slow enough to keep the collagen from cooking too quickly. If you ever try your hand at smoking meat, this is about the temperature you should shoot for.

Collagen begins to break down at an internal temp of 160 degrees Fahrenheit and the process works even better when the meat reaches an internal temperature of 180F. I have left pork shoulder in my smoker until it reached an internal temp of 200F and it pulled beautifully and was not dry at all.

 TL;DR Cook your meat until it reads at least 180F at the thickest part. Don't worry if it goes over that temp, collagen gives you a lot of great flavor and juiciness in the meat as long as you let it do its work.

**EDIT** If you are wondering how best to monitor the internal temperature of your meats, I recommend a probe thermometer. A good model will have a wire running from the probe to a digital display thermometer, like [this] (http://www.amazon.com/Kuissential-Digital-Thermometer-Timer-Cooking/dp/B00MMT3VGW/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427810991&amp;sr=8-15&amp;keywords=instant+probe+thermometer).  Insert the probe into the thickest part of the meat before cooking and use it to monitor your meat's internal temperature throughout the entire cooking process. This will also help you learn to estimate about how long certain sizes and cuts need to cook before reaching the desired internal temp.You need a good amount of fat on your meat in my experience. You can pick it out/skim it off later but for that tender fall apart meat the fat is a must. No. The right cut, the right amount of acid, the right temp, the right time.

Know you your equipment so you know what "low and slow" means for you. Sorry to be so vague, but there are a lot of variables in play here, but it's important to start with the right meat. I find that pork is pretty fool proof in a slow cooker with liquid. Time?  How long did you cook it for?  Just to add about the time it takes to cook. On high for shorter amount of time will create meat that is cooked but still firmly holds together. On low for longer will create meats that fall apart. Sometimes you want one, sometimes the other. Enjoy!I don't think Chinese or Italian meat is legal.Do not look up beer cheese in the urban dictionary. I put mine in the pot with no extra liquid. Makes plenty on it's own, and turns out great. &gt; 6. When draining the juices, what do people do if they have old pipes and don't want to pour them down the drain because they're worried that the fat will congeal and cause a clog? Do you put it in a jar in the fridge and then dump it in the trash when/if it hardens?

Nooo! Don't throw it out! I put mine in a container, wait to cool a bit, then fridge for at least 1 night (2 max). I then use it to make pulled pork ramen noodle!

* Scrape the fat layer off the top, discard.
* Find your favorite ramen recipe (even instant stove packs work wonders).
* Substitute out equal water for your Dr Pepper Pork Gooey Gelatinous Glob.
* Throw in some left over pork (if there is any).
* Enjoy

I've done this 3 times now, and its got to the point where my wife and I crave this as much as the pork itself.If I don't want to use Dr. Pepper, can I just use water instead?Can't get those in the UK :( but I'm not good with spicy food anyway! Might see if I can get something similar and try it out though :DIts amazing. If you like spicy put in half a can of chipotles in adobo too, it'll make you sweat.Holy crap I need to try this.Maybe that is what I should start doing, dump it on the road/lawn/neighbours lawn ;)I just think the slow cooker is about indirect heat.  So touching surfaces is not ideal in my mind.  Im sure if it makes a difference, its minimal.  I like the onions as a barrierI just wanted to say, for a total noob, these were great questions.  Not stupid at all.I dump it in the planters hahaInteresting.  I figured the toilet was able to handle it.  I do have a jar for grease but Dr.P PP is too much liquid to jar.Of course. But no matter what chunk of meat you're cooking, it's not going to be done in that first 3-4 hours. It takes that long for everything to get up to temp. Best just leave it all alone. Hello friend.  Is there a particular reason why we don't want the pig to touch the pot? Same advice here.  Most spices will burn if you put them in a searing pan (except salt- that won't burn).  There is plenty of time to absorb the flavor of the spices in the slow cooker.

7 - nothing (even if you cook on a regular basis) goes right the first time ... what's most important is you keep on cooking and refining the recipes and make them your own ... keep on cooking ;) and ... dont be afraid to experiment / try recipes you're not familiar with )Not op, but I will rub some canola oil on whatever roast I am cooking, get a big cast iron pan super hot and then sear all the sides as well as I can. Then after the meat is cooked and pulled I spread it out on some aluminum foil on a baking sheet, sprinkle some reserved spice blend over it and finally broil it in the oven for 10 min or so to crisp it up. Not much extra work and totally worth it. If you use a long-handled meat fork, you can open the lid just enough to fit the for through. Try to twist the meat. If it does not fall apart easily, it is not ready. Take the fork back out. You will not lose as much heat as you would if you totally remove the lid.

Some day, you may want to cook meat and NOT shred it. In that case, you may need to remove the lid to use an instant-read thermometer, but by then, you will probably be experienced enough to gauge the cooking time needed for a hunk of meat.After rubbing the meat with the spices and stabbing wholes in it to insert little pieces of garlic I put a little bit of oil in a hot cast iron pan on high heat and cook each side for about 1 minute. Be careful not to breath in the spice fumes as those can really irritate your nose and throat. Once all sides are seared I put it in the crock and pour all the drippings from the pan in with it.Dude didn't even get his degree.What's your searing process?The only thing I'd add is when it comes to taking the top off, don't do it early on in the process.  Like the first 2 or 3 hours, there really no point to even check it.  It's fine.  Let it cook.

It seems to me the longer it's cooked the less it hurts to take the top off.  As the meat itself will be a much higher temp.

Also I like the bed of onions technique.  I never let meat touch the crock pot it I can avoid it.  I like it to hover, like an angel.

Sorry. I really like to just pan fry the already pulled pork right before I eat it. You may already be aware, but in case you aren't, its worth mentioning that you should not be using table salt to season. Make sure you are using kosher salt or sea salt. Alton Brown gives a good explanation in the first season of Good Eats (first episode I believe) which I would reccomend If you are learning how to cook. The show begins with him explaining how to cook all the necessary fundamentals and he explains some of the science behind it all. Good stuff.It serves as a broth thickener. It's a primary distinguisher between a soup vs. a stew. Tip for the juices. If you fly frequently, take the airsick bag from your seat pocket. It's water proof. You can dump it in there, seal it and toss it. My "seatmates" look oddly at me when I ask them if they are going to use their airsick bag, then I ask if I can have it.

After they  sheepishly hand it over I tell them why. I get the 'eureka" look followed by, what a great idea!Lots of great responses here, but just want to give one other option for the juices.  I usually shove some paper towels into a bowl, pour the juices onto that, and then discard in trash.  Works well and doesn't require waiting or work.- Make a list.
- Write down the list-making process.
- Cross out the first three points in your list.
- Take a nap as a reward for your hard work.I would like to add, that if it dosent pull apart right away, wait like five minuets for the meat to rest a bit then it shreads easier, then toss it all back into the pot.Sear it afterwards in a skillet or in the broiler.&gt;  a couple hours

yeah, i had to order pizza, beacouse i got too hungry. but had delicious potatoes for night snacks. For 6),  I make a foil cup, shaped around a bottle, put it in my sink drain, pour the fat into that, and then throw it away when it's cooled. Re: 6), the pipes in your toilet still go to the same place, your main sewer line, and it can still be clogged by congealed grease.

Honestly you don't even need to follow this to closely. Cook your meat, set aside. Cook your veggies and add meat and sauce. Throw over rice. Once you toss it all together you're just heating it up. As far as the veggies go you cook to your palette. Me and my son like a good crunch when we bite in so I only "heat" them. My wife, she likes her's soft so I cook her's longer.

Also, each of us like different veggies so I end up cooking three different batches. Meat is all cooked the same.

As far as the sauces? To your liking. I will even get a bottled one in a pinch.good luck. Haha same here, hence the apprehension. And we do! It is so freaking good. The only thing that has me worried, is that someone pointed out the beans may begin fermenting if left in the liquid. But the rice soaked up all the liquid, so...I don't know. Think I'm gonna risk it though, it's just too tasty. Thank you for the reply! For your list of ingredients, you can make them a list like this:

Leave an entire blank line between the start and end of your list.

\- Placing a dash, space, then text will produce a bullet.
\- Bullets can be on consecutive lines.

It'll look like this:

- Placing a dash, space, then text will produce a bullet.
- Bullets can be on consecutive lines.I always apply the rub then sear the roast before putting it in the crock pot, it will taste better that way.
1) I rub em onto the pork

2) I use a good few twists of pepper, so salt.  BBQ sauce has enough

3) I do low for 8, shred, high for one

4) Poke it when nearing the end to see if done

5) Above

6) I dump it down the toilet so it won't clog it.  Keep some of the liquid though.Another suggestion: I haven't done the specific Dr Pepper recipe you mentioned, but I have done several pulled pork rounds in the slow cooker with great results, and one thing that makes a huge difference is rubbing the meat with spices and then searing hard in a skillet until dark on all sides before placing meat in the slow cooker. This adds much better depth of flavor and a slight roasted taste you can't get out of simply slow cooking raw meat. And don't forget to deglaze the pan with some Dr P or chicken broth to get the rest of the flavorful crispy goodness!

Also, the leftover juice is packed full of rich, spicy meat flavor, and its a shame to just dump it down the drain! If I have enough broth juice leftover (2 cups or more) I'll cool and freeze for slow cooker pinto beans later. You can also look up recipes on how to reduce the liquid into a BBQ sauce, but I've never bothered doing that because there's some fantastic local BBQ sauce around where I live that I just buy instead.I am a personal fan of rubbing down pork and searing it for at least a minute on all sides. It adds yummy seared bits to the pulled pork recipe.

Also low and slow is a more successful way to do it. The few times I have tried to rush it, I feel the fat isn't rendered as well and it doesn't shred as nice.

If you taste the juices and they are yummy, save them in a Tupperware and freeze it. Make soups later. I've not been a fan of the soda recipes so I dump in the trash

good luck!Personally, I would think it would be fine. Give it the ole smell test and make sure it doesn't smell spoiled or anything, but the situation you described would not stop me from enjoying.

As you mentioned, there really isn't much to go bad. No dairy products or anything like that. The kielbasa is pre-cooked and the beans were canned. I think you would be fine.*

*DISCLAIMER: I am far from an expert on food safety, but I really hope you enjoy the recipe.Hey, I know this is random (sorry), I just have a quick question. Made this last night and it's DELICIOUS. Left it out overnight because it was too hot to put in the refrigerator, but it was only out for about 6 hours and was still lukewarm when we woke up. My SO then forgot to put in the fridge before leaving, and it will now be out at room temperature for a minimum of 18 hours total.
Is all hope lost? There's nothing super perishable in it (I did add a can of Rotel, but that was the only deviation), so I wouldn't think so...? You may have no idea. Sorry for the weird post, just really hoping we didn't just throw away $20, like 6 lbs of food and what was going to be my lunch for this week. :("Dr Pepper" does not contain any punctuation marks.I tried making this recipe a few days ago and it turned out really well! However, I did not have any corn starch handy and the sauce did not get very thick after simmering for 30-40 minutes. Did you let it simmer on low heat during this time? I'm still fairly inexperienced at cooking and wanted to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. Overall it still turned out very well and I really enjoyed it. Thank you!The salt thing is important. And remember some of the spices you may use can add a salty taste as well. Not so much in this recipe but in others.The Hamilton Beach programmable crock is the way to go. Good to know  thanks!That's a good enough answer for me, but I want to add to the question about taking the lid off to check. It's going to take a good while to cook your meat. In the first few (3-4) hours, don't even bother opening it. It will be temping, but let that heat stay in there. You don't want to let a bunch of heat out before the meat even warms up or it'll take forever to cook. When it's done, it should fall apart at the touch of your fork. Thanks! That was really helpful! Find one that says "Crock pot" pick a size you like.

if it's just you i'd recommend a smaller one like this. http://c.shld.net/rpx/i/s/i/spin/image/spin_prod_1130251712?hei=333&amp;wid=333&amp;op_sharpen=1

If you live with people you want to feed then go bigger.

If you want a bigger one that's cool too just decide what size and shape you want. Some people like the roundy ones, some people like the oval ones depending on how much counter space they have and what they think looks cool. From a practical level the shape is not too important.

One last variable is do you want to put a timer on it? some people want to be able to set it for say, 4 hours on high then drop down to the "keep warm" setting.  some people don't want/need that. your call. I have two and they are both round but one has a timer and the other doesn't.  They are both great. Slow cooker probably uses 70 watts on low and 250 watts on high, so somewhere between a bright incandescent and a halogen floodlight.Awesome! Thanks for the reply!/thread1) Just dump it all in. No need to worry about rubbing the pork or anything. All the flavors will still be in the pork/juices

2) I would estimate between a pinch and a teaspoon. You can always add more but you can't take it out, remember that.

3) I always choose low if I have the time. but high produces great results as well.

4) It's fine to take thew top off to check. Just don't leave it off for minutes at a time. A look and a fork poke every so often isn't going to ruin anything.

5) I don't think high/low really matters in this step. This is to allow the juices to soak nicely into the shredded pork. So either is fine

6) You got it. I would use a jar/discarded tin canIt will thicken the resulting sauceThought so, my mum was worried about me using a pressure cooker becuae she had seen one blow up in the 60s.  I've never seen a slow cooker that generates any sort of pressure.Season the shoulder 24 hours before putting it in the slow cooker.

Don't sear it. You'll still get the delicious brown crusty bits in the slow cooker alone.

You'll get more flavour from the shoulder being seasoned for 24 hours than you ever would from searing it. Ya know, as soon as I posted the comment I sat here wondering if I was thinking of pressure cookers. I think I was. Not %100 sure, but I the reason they say to cook it so long is to make sure they aren't liable if you get sick.I got 8 medium-sized burritos from this recipe.I personally just tossed them in whole, though chopping probably would have been the better move to avoid having chile-chunks down the road :)I have found that they reheat without much issue as long as you reduce the sauce first. I found it is almost the thickness of BBQ sauce or something like that by the time all is said and done.Go with curry, you can find paste for cheap at asian markets. That or an onion free tajine.
Listen to /u/baxterfp , I've done the same as he and then some. And to add to what he said, salt is the only pre-sear seasoning. Everything else is after the sear.If you like corned beef, it's really easy. I just did this as one of my first recipes in my new crock pot. Keep in mind, this is more of a recommendation than a recipe. This is how I did it, and I liked how it turned out, but the awesome thing about slow cooking is how versatile it is. You can put whatever you like into it, and it will still come out great.

1. 4 lb piece of corned beef ($2.37/lb)

2. 1 Onion

3. Cabbage. Add some other veggies as well, whatever you like.

4. Allspice (2 to 4 balls), 1 bay leaf, garlic powder, onion powder, and whatever other seasonings you like with your beef. DO NOT add salt! Very important!

Chop the onion into bite sized pieces. Cook in another pot until turning clear. You can use beer to cook them in a little. It goes well with this recipe, and the original recipe called for it anyways. Again, your choice.

Put the onions down first, then add a cup or so of water. Add the seasoning packet from the beef, if you like. Add the rest of the seasonings and stir around.

Put the beef on top of onions, put the other veggies around the beef, and put the cabbage on top. This order can change, nothing is set in stone, but this is how I did it.

Once everything is in, set it on high for 6 hours. I actually cooked mine for a total of about 10 hours, but 6 will cook it through. The longer you cook it, the more tender and flavorful it will be.

I liked this, and it was so cheap. We'll be eating this for a few days and the total meal came out to less than $20.00.Try AdBlock?Thrift store for the win.

It was the first slow cooker with timed delayed start of its kind, in the 40s/50s.

My model was "deluxe" though because my cabinet has the clock on the front door, itself.  I keep herbs on top of it, in the well where your cooker goes!I've made carnitas lots of time in a crock pot. No need to sear. Just add your cumin etc. right off the bat. Smaller pieces of meat == more surface area for your spices.  I think the former. No, it's really fucked up.I disagree - sear the carnitas in butter first. I'm talking fast and hot. Next, throw carnitas into slow cooker. I've done both methods multiple times, and the flavor/texture with a pre-sear is incredible. I'm pretty sure it's really fucked up. Trying to tell if this is really fucked up or there's a crockpot I'm missing.Nope, just to brown it as the rest of the cooking is done in the slowcooker, but the browning make it taste better!This looks so good!!Slow cooked onions. Soooo good. I always make a batch to put into the freezer in single servings. The convenience of just letting the sugars in the onions break down without worrying about any burning is awesome.

My first ever slow cooker meal was the beef stew. Super easy and delicious, it also gives you a boost of confidence for any future recipes you want to tackle.

And last of all, the traditional pulled pork. Made mini sliders for a road trip and they were a resounding success.

Good luck!Not sure really, since I dont use it everyday. The rice cooker on the other hand is filled up everyday to feed 6 people and that doesn't seem to make a big difference in the power bill. Hope that somewhat answers your question.You're welcome, hope they turn out delicious!I use a vodka bottle for a rolling pin!I didn't think about that. I'd basically be double searing it wouldn't I? I may just skip it like you said. Thanks!I wouldn't sear carnitas before slow cooking it, the whole point of carnitas is broiling them after they are cooked tender. But if you're really set on trying it, add all the spice before searing. They did that for the warranty. If it had a handle you could not get in home warranty service, you had to take it in.Are you thinking of pressure cookers?Bachelorette here (well, I live alone at the moment anyway) and I just got a programmable slow cooker as a birthday present. I work 9-6, so I'm not always home to turn it off. With a programmable one, it'll switch from low or high to keep warm. That way when you get home, your meal is cooked but also still warm and ready to eat.

As for the energy consumption, I can't tell yet. I just used it to make a pot roast last Monday. But I should have my electric bill come in about two weeks, so we'll see.When I do it I drain the canned corn :)That is what I thought too. Most households in my area have a Nesco or two. Rummage and church sales are lousy with the vintage ones but you can buy new too!But you got some tender meat amirite?&gt;  Pan fry in a skillet with vegetable oil.

New to this stuff. Cooked all the way through?
Another question. Have you found that a slow cooker has increased your power bill noticably? Most of the time for the meat you want to do this. (use almond flour if on KETO or paleo diets etc.)

Take your meat and some flour. use your hand to pick up some flour and rub it on the meat. We aren't trying to cake anything on just to get that baby power look on the meat. When that is done set the meat aside.

Get a fry pan with some hot oil, just enough oil to cover the pan. A drop of water should skid and jump around the pan when you drop it in. if it doesn't it isn't hot enough yet.

Place the meat on the pan (be careful of oil hitting you.) What you are trying to do is give it about thirty seconds, just enough to sear the meat. Then flip the meat over and do it on another portion.

Shoulder cuts etc are not often nicely shaped so you have to move it around. (it will be hot, I use over gloves, but you can use tongs etc.

Once the meat is seared add it to the crock pot. Normally you want the harder items on the bottom, like carrots, potatoes (if not on keto) etc. Then the meat and the rest.I could be wrong, but I seem to remember that old slow cookers were prone to exploding.I have a slowcooker that doesn't have one and I'm finding that having the automatic timer would've made my life way easier especially if I'm busy doing something else and can't get to the slowcooker straight away. No rush going back to your food!horno asidor!NSFW tag? Kerosene? I'm pretty sure you have to put burning coals in it.My mom has this same one. It's old, and the latch doesn't always work-but it's awesome at cooking things on holidays. Yes, queso is an obvious one.

The basics:

- big block of velvet a
- can of Rotel (or generic roasted chilies and tomatoes)

Optional additions:

- 1/2 can of chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, minced. (Only include as much adobo sauce as clings to the chilies when you take them out of the can. Otherwise it can overpower everything.)
- 1/4 or 1/2 or 1 can of retried beans. The more you add the closer you get to a cheesy bean dip, which is good in its own right. But the added consistency and flavor depth from even just a quarter cup is very nice.
- 1/2 - 1 lb of chorizo or ground beef+taco seasoning. Fry this up separately and dump it and all the juices into the cooker with the basics. As with the refried beans, the more you add the more it starts becoming about the meat.


Whatever you do, just throw it all in the slow cooker on high, stirring occasionally, until heated through (about an hour).  Then pop it down to the Keep Warm setting and enjoy!Thank you! I saw the picture and thought "That's not a slow-cooker, that's a Nesco roaster!" You could do the turkey or ham or whatever and still have the oven free for all the sides and dessert. My stepmother still uses hers for holiday meals.Thank you for the clarification. Awesome to know what it is exactly. Does it still work ? The latch was the first thing I noticed. I was like "Is that for a padlock?"[Vintage 1940s Nesco Automatic Electric Roaster With Timer Manual Pan Rack Rare](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Vintage-1940s-Nesco-Automatic-Electric-Roaster-With-Timer-Manual-Pan-Rack-Rare-/291385829776)Yes! I thought that immediately. That is one cool slowcooker. Honestly I don't even know what auto mode is or what it does. Mine has high and low and off.Seems a bit much for only 4 serves. /r/EarthPorn

It may not be what you're assuming.../r/vintagekitchentoys would like this :)Traditional beef stew

Chili con carne

Pulled porkwatIt has a timer. The one I bought LAST YEAR didn't even have a timer. What has 60 years of progress accomplished at the cost of a timer? Nope. Just ignorant.So what are you going to cook in that thing.. that is the question!/r/slowcookerpornIndiana Jones would survive a nuclear explosion in that for sure!We used to have a "portable" TV in the 70s that was just a normal CRT TV, probably a 15-ish inch screen (so the whole thing was at least 20 inches across), with a handle on the top. That's what made it "portable". Yes, it came from the factory like that. So you never know. :DIt looks like a radio from Fallout 3. I bet it would survive the apocalypse as well.It does have a 50s lookI just lifted it real quick to see. It was close. Thing was solid. Awesome. I made this tonight for tacos, but with a few tweaks.

I used 2.5 lb of pork butt instead of 3.5 lb chuck.

I used [this recipe for enchilada sauce](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/easy-enchilada-sauce-recipe.html), rather than canned. I used half the broth to help with the liquid issue. It was super fucking strong because of all the chile powder, though every recipe I saw had a similar amount. I ended up adding about a quarter of how much you said and added a 10 oz can of tomato sauce to not be so strong. That helped and the sauce at the end was a bit thinner than i wanted, so I left the lid off for about 20 mins on high, though I doubt it was as thin as yours.

I also used 1 can of black and 1 can of black beans since I like beans.

When i shredded the pork I didn't add it back to the sauce in case that was still too strong, so it was just the pork and then the sauce on the side that I spooned on to my tacos. I think it would have been good if I mixed the pork back in with just some of the sauce, but not all of it.

Overall it was pretty darn tasty, will be saving this recipe. Thanks.For someone that does not really get nostalgic this is incredibly cool. Where do you pour in the kerosene?Could we get a link, Johnny?Holy crap, if I had to wager a guess I'd think maybe 1952.Yeah made me think of Thanksgiving too!I don't think that thing is going to be doing much traveling. It looks like it weighs 50lbs.Could just be a travel latch like some crock pots have. Red kidney beans need 10 minutes of boiling. True.

But they'll at worst give you the shits. Dang, now that is old school!Cool! This looks like one my grandma had, that is now my mother's. Ours is a pressure cooker, and we use it for the turkey every Thanksgiving. I wonder if this is similar because of the lid latch thing? (I obviously know nothing scientific about the terms or conditions haha.)Can't go wrong with classic beef stew.

Get stew meat and coat it with a mix of flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika. Pan fry in a skillet with vegetable oil. Place meat in crock pot.

Add chopped up potatoes, carrots, and celery to crock pot.

Add a can of stewed tomatoes, whole kernel corn (drained), and beef broth. The liquid should just barely cover the solid ingredients.

Turn crock pot on low and cook eight hours. Serve with French bread and butter. I bet that thing is just amazing at its purpose. The phrase they don't build them like they used to really applies here.Just be mindful of the beans.  Some can actually kill you if you slow cook them from a dry state.  Can I have?Awesome! Thanks. Sup gangsta? I'm in a similar situation as you. I'm 20, started my third year of university in September and bought a slow cooker. I got a 5 quart Crockpot for around $45 at Walmart. It hasn't failed me so far. I've used it to cook chili, salsa chicken, pulled pork, bread pudding, oatmeal, stew, etc.
I love the auto on mine... but I feel like I'm there 100% of the time when the timer runs out so I could totally survive without it. This guy gets itGet a meat thermometer.

Everything took on the brown tinge of the beef broth, kind of like when you add too much soy sauce. I wonder if using stock cubes + water will solve this problem?
Things also looked overcooked, and I had this happen a couple of times prior. I suspect my crockpot actually operates too hot... I'm going to start cutting a couple of hours off the recipe's cooking time and see how that goes.Calling me a "humourless dolt" because I didn't recognize an obscure copypasta from a subreddit a quarter of the size of this subreddit is the epitome of "insider cool kids" bullshit.

Your comment was not only worthless informationally-wise but a waste of our subscribers time to read./r/JohnCena Auto just means it will switch to "warm" after the timer you set expires. So if you set it to cook on low for 6 hours, it will switch to "warm" after 6 hours. This way if you are gone for 8 hours it will not overcook.

edit: I may have misunderstood what auto mode was. I was describing a "programmable" slow cooker.Its copypasta you humourless dolt On mine auto is an option where the temperature gets progressively higher, not at all like the warm option.

I've never used it though...So auto and warm mode seems to be the same? I've read differently from a site but it would make sense if they're the same thing.

Thanks for the answer. This is not a grilled cheese. This is a jaffle.So simple but so genius. Will eat this tonight.Thanks! It was! Perfect Saturday morning breakfast!That looks amazing as does the grilled cheese. I need me some BBQ pulled pork. i also love coconut milkOh my god that looks amazing! Why did I never think of this?!Sounds like it all worked out for you! Future reference, you could put that whole pot (I would call it a Dutch oven, but there is probably a better name for it) in your oven on  like 250 degrees for a makeshift slow cooker.  You probably couldn't leave the house since the oven is on, but it could work for a day off or when it's way to much food to fit in your crock.

I use mine often to bake whole chickens or turkeys.  In the oven covered for 3 or 4 hours at 350 a yummy dinner does make.  :)&gt; The fact that this subreddit is called "grilledcheese" is nothing short of utter blasphemy.

Huh? This is /r/slowcooking.There is no such thing as leftover pork. The only two known states of pork are *we have pork* and *we are out of pork*.THANKS!
I had some pulled pork left over in the fridge and you inspired my lunch.  I added BBQ sauce as well.  Good eatsI have a local BBQ joint near my home that uses American Velveeta cheese and calls it the Pig Melt. 10 of 10 clean platesDone! Thanks for the idea! So delicious!!  http://imgur.com/31w2Gjd

Done!  So effing delicious! http://imgur.com/NdDi2IIThere's no way that a grilled cheese forum is a scary place. WTF is leftover pulled pork?Yep, Reddit Logic^^TM !Like /r/trees and /r/marijuanaenthusiasts ?hmm yeah, when you say swiss or provolone it makes much more sense!  Certainly worth trying!It would probably be good with beef! You could always do a lighter cheese like Swiss or provolone if the flavor combo seems odd, but I thought the cheddar and BBQ went great together!No problem! It was a first for me and I will definitely be adding it to the regular dinner rotation :) it would also be great with Swiss instead of cheddar!That sounds delicious! I might try that now!In the world of Reddit logic, the grilled cheese purists should start a sub called r/melts, exclusively for grilled cheese.Are you away from home longer than the recipes call for? If so you may want a model that switches to "warm" mode. If not, a manual one will work fine.A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of "melts". Almost every "grilled cheese" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called "grilledcheese" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled "melts" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples "grilled cheeses" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.
You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt.I don't eat pork, but that seems like an odd combo to me?  I guess I just think about if it was bbq pulled beef, and then you put in in a grilled cheese?

It looks amazing though!I am hungover right now and need this in my face.For those wondering: [here is guidance from USDA, Food Safety and Inspection Service, on how to best prepare, store, and reheat food leftovers](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/leftovers-and-food-safety/ct_index).There could have been a total massacre during the bbq party, and the uneaten bbq was confiscated as evidence when the cops showed up, and then the guys down at the precinct had to act fast to prevent an additional crime. Thank goodness for the boys in blue.Broth: chicken or beef. You can let the pot simmer for 8-12 hours totally unattended. Otherwise you'd have to watch the pot and be home all day.

Carnitas. Again, used to be an all day affair. With a crockpot just dump in a pork shoulder cut into big chunks, some salt, lime and orange juice. Come home 8hrs later and crisp some up under the broiler or in a skillet.

Beans and legumes. Better and cheaper than dried and no soaking required. Or my personal favorite, Cuban sandwiches. Mmmm. But I just noticed this is BBQ pulled pork, IMO a Cuban just doesn't taste right with BBQ pulled pork :(I'm making pulled pork tomorrow! Thanks for the idea, I'm looking forward to those leftovers.

Be careful reheating pork...I never knew you could have leftover pulled pork. *urp*I ended up taking it off after about 5 hours and letting the rest of the flavors come together in the fridge overnight.

[Spicy cucumbers](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-spicy-korean-cucumber-salad-oi-muchim-recipes-from-the-kitchn-173293) and kim chi. Sounds like a lot of work but it will probably turn out fine. As long as the chicken reaches a certain temperature and stays there or over for a long enough time, the meat will cook as usual. Is it really a good idea to leave it on overnight? I don't really see why not but for some reason that sounds like a bad idea to me. Be careful!Oh god, I always manage to forget about cheddar and bbq sauce, and how they were made for each other...

I need to make some pulled pork.It's a meltThat's so funny. I posted a sandwich I made there with some leftover steak. Someone made a throwaway account just to tell me it was a melt. Those guys are more serious about sandwiches than most people are about politics. Such an underrated show. Mandy Patinkin was spot on as Rube, as he is in just about everything.great show, better scene.Also relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYCTVlxVx0I

And, just in case I actually have to do this, Dead Like Me follows a team of grim reapers. Mandy Patinkin plays Rube, the team leader. The other cook recently died and his soul isn't ready to move on into his lights. Regular people can't see the souls, so it looks like Rube is talking to thin air.I know what I'm eating tomorrow...ITS A MELT!!!Nah, it's like my favorite food hahahaIt's no problem, I'll probably still end up making it no matter hahaha. Just seeing if I'm making something else too.Oh geez! That was the longest grilled cheese rant I've ever read.  Thanks for that.  I definitely won't xpost there! I'd either dump the extra liquid before cooking (if I was willing to risk it again), or just take a look at the ingredients and take a swing at recreating it yourself - that way, you can control the marinade time.

Overnight should be more than enough, IMO - you could probably skip that step altogether and treat it like a Chuck *Coq au Vin* or Beef Burgandy.Whoa there. Don't go posting this in /r/grilledcheese.

https://www.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/comments/2or1p3/you_people_make_me_sick/Yes, it comes in a bag with marinade included. That's very possible that it overtenderized!I bought a 2 quart sized crock pot brand cooker at target today. 12 bucks and its perfect for me due to the size! I can fit a surprising amount in it too. Does it come in a marinade, and you dump everything in? It may have overtenderized from the wine - I'm always leery about mixing slowcooking and tenderizing agents, as my end goal isn't baby food.

I thought this was an interesting idea and it came out delicious.  Thanks for letting me share! Ahh! Sorry!

BBQ Pulled pork -

Added a pork roast, diced onion, garlic, and bell pepper to crock pot.  Seasoned with Salt, pepper, cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin.  Generally I'm really heavy on seasonings but I like flavor! Cooked on low for 7 ish hours. Drained liquid and pulled apart.  Added BBQ sauce (Saundus Sauce - it's local and delicious!) and let cook for about 30 more minutes.

I ate that on sandwiches last night. For the grilled cheese I just put two slices of bread in a pan with butter and added shredded cheddar cheese and hot pork. Toasted until crunchy! Thanks! One of the sub requirements is a recipe for each pictured post.

Simple, but looks delicious.Since this is /r/Slowcooking, we would ask that you include your BBQ pulled pork recipe, as generic as it may be.

From the sidebar:
&gt; This subreddit is for "Crock-Pot"-type recipes only

and

&gt;When you post a pic of the meal, please include the recipe. If you do not include the recipe your picture will be removed until the recipe is provided
My wife recommends a $20 one.  As far as I can tell you really can't go wrong with them.I just melted butter in a pan, added shredded cheddar cheese and hot BBQ pulled pork (I just used a generic BBQ pulled pork recipe) to two pieces of wheat bread and toasted sandwich until crunchy!

Edit: This was the first time I've tried this and it was delicious.  I had to make sure to microwave the pork before toasting it or it would have stayed cold.  I also put cheese on the top and bottom so the sandwich  would stay together.  Swiss cheese instead of cheddar would have also tasted delicious!Can we get a recipe too?

I love grilled cheese and I love pulled pork. Instructions on how to make this would be excellent!I put a whole thawed chicken  in, coated  with olive oil and seasonings, the.

I would recommend cutting down on the sugar because making the recipe exactly the way it says to yields a rather sweet relish. It is good to eat on toasted bread, on sandwiches of all kinds, and frankly even just off a spoon. Serve it with some salted crackers or toast points and it will disappear very quickly.Buffalo chicken dip.

Put it all in on high until it's creamy.  Once it's all melted together stick it on low and enjoy!That's one thing I noticed when I started cooking.  I realized how much fat/sugar it takes to make something good.  You don't realize what your eating when you're eating "good" food at restaurants.  There are many nice looking meals there. The ones I found to be gf were not gallbladder diet friendly/vice versa. I have been looking online and in this subreddit for a couple of weeks. I was asking here because maybe someone else had experience with either of the diet restrictions I mentioned in my query. Thank you.I do love browsing /r/smoking though. I'd love to get a smoker eventually. A day of smoking and home brewing sounds like a good day in my book.If you dont, broiling meat after it comes out is delish too Just notices that. Too much, but it is for 3lbs of chicken, so many servings.That's not really a good comparison. It's like drinking fruit juice instead of sugar. Fruit has, in comparison, fiber and a higher vitamin count. Fructose is just a structurally different carbohydrate that is processed in only a moderately different manner than sucrose. I also have an apiary.Agreed.  I use my slowcooker for two things mainly 1) basically put dinner in there in the morning and come back to a nicely cooked chunk of meat with veggies and potatoes or what have you  2)BBQ, definitely don't get the texture and flavor of smoking a butt or brisket all day, but I just rarely have day I can commit to tending to a smoker and drinking beer all day...I really really wish I did. Still a fine alternative though.

Slowcooking is just a great alternative as long as you can save time and not sacrifice too much flavor/texture.Printable PDF of recipe on original title link.

If you're interested in seeing the original, unaltered recipe at: http://www.southernplate.com/
I made a few changes: I doubled the rice, cream of chicken, and corn. I also halved the onion; but we use white onion, not the sweet in the original recipe. I (obviously) like my way better, but wanted to give a link to the original blog!

Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/2 large onion, chopped
2 (8 oz.) boxes Zatarains Yellow Rice, cooked according to package directions
1 C. cheddar cheese
2 (10.5 oz.) cans cream of chicken soup
2 (15 oz.) cans whole kernel corn, drained

Directions:
1) Place chicken in bottom of slow cooker. Scatter chopped onions over top. Spoon cream soup on top of that.
2) Cover and cook on low 7-8 hours or on high 3-4 hours.
3) Remove chicken; shred. (You may have to let it cool slightly).
4) Return chicken to cooker. Add rice, corn, and cheese. Stir to combine.
5) Let heat 15-20 min. on low heat until everything hot throughout. I have as well. If you don't have the equipment I can see using a crockpot. It's just so easy to whip up a stir fry and the chicken turns out so much better. You can appy almost any recipe to a slowcooker. Doesn't mean you should!!!jesus, a CUP OF SUGARI've seen a couple different posts on cake. I know it's possible, but I haven't tried it myself.

As far as cinnamon buns go, cooking breads in a slowcooker does seem a bit tricky. Here's a post on a recipe a while back that comes close to cinnamon buns, but it a more slowcooker-friendly format: https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2lfqb3/crock_pot_cinnamon_roll_casserole/

(I also have not tried that one, but I might have to!)What's the best way to reheat these without becoming all soggy?  I can't staaaand soggy tortilla... Agreed. This sub is crazy. I'm surprised you have so many upvotes because when I post similar things on these types of posts I get downvoted to hell. Also just noticed your user name. Jimmy Buffett, been to 20 or so of his concerts honestly any recipe you'd get from Chinese takeout. I've made many but it more about the technique then the ingredients. I'm on mobile now but I will get you a link and some of my favorites when I get to a machineI can't find them in any grocery stores in my area :( Super upsetting/slowcooking is basically not 'cooking' at all. for the most part it's either reheat something cooked, pulled meat with baby rays or shitty blog recipes that are just blindly posted.  Oh and don't get me started with 'healthy'. The only thing you can make healthy in a slow cooker is water. All the 'healthy' recipes are just to get fatties to pretend to eat well. Bah.Do you have a recipe that you recommend for stove top?I do a chili powder, salt, and brown sugar rub on my slow cooker pork buts and use cider vinegar as the fluid. Onions are a lovely addition as well

Also I sear the heck out of it on every inch before putting it in the slow cooker.I think I'm done with this sub.  The word "healthy" gets thrown around a lot where it doesn't belong and people cook shit in slow cookers that doesn't even make sense.  I've seen several pizza submissions.  Why the fuck would you ever do that?OP is doing the Lord's work with that link right below the picture. I sear most things before putting it in the slow cooker, really helps in my opinion.

As for rubs, most of them really don't do much unless you give them time to work, a few hours at least, overnight if you can.Just so you know, a sodium heavy meal now and then isn't really that bad for you as long as you're drinking plenty of water! Derp, you're right. You're right, the recipe was adjusted with the proper chicken source about 20 minutes ago. 38 is roughly correct probably off by a bit for 5.3 ounces.

KMyFitnessPal and cross checked with other calculators.Out of curiosity, what tool are you using to make that?I was jokingSorry, but if you're going to tell me a third of a chicken breast has 45g of protein, you gotta tell me what breasts you're getting.Congrats you saved a total of 544mg of sodium by using the low sodium soy sauce. It is still over 2000mg of sodium for one serving and nearly all the calories come from the sugar. Lowered the Sesame seeds for you to 2tbs for the whole recipe and dropped the calories a bit.

Again it's still loaded with *sugar &amp; sodium*.

This is a bad recipe for slow cooking anyway. [Here is how to make sesame chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlqlfebEV_Y).I see that it says that, but I doubt it...I really doubt 1/3 of a chicken breast has 45g of protein. Honey is fructose, not sucrose, so it is metabolized totally different. It's like eating fruit instead of sugar cubes. I have bees and we use honey in place of sugar as much as we can, especially when baking. Makes great sweetener for coffee, too. My point is that "sugars" aren't all the same. Check r/Slowcooking's [The 5 'Best of Month' recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/wiki/index#wiki_best_of_slowcooking) in the wiki. Lots of good stuff there.I know this is slow-cooking, I subscribe, but you can do the same thing on the stove in the time it takes to cook the rice. It also yields a much better end product. High heat and quick is how this type of food is supposed to be cooked.

I'm not saying don't do it but if you've got the 20/30 minutes to spare a stove is the preferred way.The nutritional info says per serving Hah! Let me know when you find that.But the nutrition facts are listed by "amount per serving"I'll look for low sugar honey to make it even more healthy!Not to mention, I made this using low sodium soy sauce and used no where even close to a whole cup of sesame seeds. We just sprinkled them on lightly and used maybe 1/2 tsp per serving.Serves 6 people, so divide everything by 6, unless you plan on eating 2 chicken breasts + rice by yourself.La Costea or La Preferida. All that sugar and sodium though... Might want to reevaluate that healthy comment and that's before rice.

Old incorrect - http://i.imgur.com/bM0HsZo.png


#EDIT: Figured out the super high sodium issue stupid calculators were using processed precooked chicken.

#Here is the corrected version - Still high as hell in sugar and 700mg of salt for a single meal is still bleh to my standards of a "healthy" meal.

Interesting! Thanks for the information. I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2z8ho4/so_i_tried_doing_some_korean_beef_last_night/) which made me think about asian dishes in a slow cooker for the first time. I am an absolutely huge fan of Chinese brown sauce which was what i searched for when i found the above. Any recommendations on a tasty slow cooker recipe with brown sauce?Hope it works for you! Also experiment with how much water you use. Too much can kill your flavor, spice-wise.This is something I may have to try. I notice that sometimes if you cook a recipe for too long, the flavor just gets cooked right out of it! Yeah I'd cook the rice separately, then add it to your recipes. Rice and pasta alike don't do well in crock pots for cooking. Not necessarily. If there's a good amount of liquid the chicken is cooked in, it generally tends to be fine. Also if you're alright with shredded chicken, cook in in the slow cooker, because it falls apart when cooked in a slow cooker. OP, Chinese cooking generally is quick on high heat, so converting a recipe like that to a slow cooker generally won't work well. You can probably Google "slow cooker Chinese recipes" I'm sure someone came up with something and posted it on the Internet! That's what I was thinking. Those recipes I have are wack.Pretty sure the recipes say lowProbably because it's a U.S. company and the stuff they make is made in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.I don't use any liquid at all for pork.  The pork will render a ton of liquid on its own as it cooks The slow cooker bags are made of nylon plastic.  Much more durable then PVC but I still wouldn't use it with corrosives.  I think it's a bad idea in general.  I would just cook the rice separately and add it towards the end.  I don't know about converting recipes, but I do know that generally chicken breasts don't do well in the slow cooker.  They will dry out very quickly.  Or it would be just great if we could all agree that your preferences are, in fact, your own. Always makes me a little happy to see a Louisianian sharing recipesdude thanks im making this now!*Straight from the Vegan Slow Cooker* is  my favorite crockpot cookbook. There's a recipe in it for slow cooker enchiladas, which was delicious. And they had a good curry recipe, but that probably falls in your "soup" categoryI'm definitely going to try that next time, thanks for the tip!You'd be doing yourself a favor by toasting the sesame seeds in a dry skillet or under a broiler until they're golden brown. Get some flavor from those puppies!!I'll typically put in about half of the spice the recipe requires to sit for the whole cook time, then put in the rest around 30 mins before it's done. Been working well for me so far!Thanks! I have looked at those but I was also curious to see what recopies didn't make the cut! Depending on just how flavorful it is, you could use some of it in place of water when cooking rice. Or Drain your pasta a minute or two before it's really done and add the broth and veggies for a final cook.Well, healthier than a Chinese restaurant, at least!

[Here's the recipe.](http://slowcookd.com/recipe/healthy-homemade-sesame-chicken/)http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-chicken-tortilla-soup/ - this is one of several excellent recipes for chicken tortilla soup. Just about any one of them on Google or Pinterest will be delicious. I add a can of black beans (drained and rinsed first), and top with stuff like plain greek yogurt, a little avocado if I have the spare calories, and store-bought tortilla strips (I was frying my own but daaaaaaaang the oil was making them crazy high in cals)


http://www.foodiecrush.com/2013/10/slow-cooker-thai-chicken-soup/ - thai chicken soup. I leave out the peas, just because I don't love them in the soup. I also throw in a stick of lemongrass, a hot chili, and a couple of star anise, and remove before serving. Awesome with pretty much any type of rice you've got on hand.Cooking on high or low? That might make the difference. Having said that, I've never made a slow cooker recipe that used rice in the slow cooker...so I'm not sure.Looks delicious. About how many burritos did this make?

Also, I would suggest throwing in more dry spices. Always salt the beef, and a little black pepper never hurt anyone. If you want more heat you can always add some red pepper flakes, chili powder, or cayenne pepper, but be careful it can easily get unbearable. If you don't have these available, you can switch out a can of green chilies for Hot Rotel and get plenty of heat. For burritos, and other Mexican-style dishes, I would always suggest some ground cumin, but that's just a personal preference.

Enjoy your lunches, and thanks for posting![Here is the USDA guidance on serving prepared food](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/basics-for-handling-food-safely/#6). They recommend the temperature be held above 140F. You should use a thermometer to be sure, but I would not describe 140F as luke warm.

The recommendations also include that food should not be left out more than 2 hours at room temperature, or 1 hour when the temperature is above 90F.

I adopt the practice of, 'when in doubt, throw it out.' I'd also caution you to carefully consider any other advice you get online that could impact your health.

I've been tossing them in most slowcook dishes I make now.  Usually I just use half a can and save it for the next week's dish.  OP's recipe is basically the exact recipe I've been using for a while as well.  It's solid.  Nice work. Did you chop the chipotles or just throw them in whole?

Another tip, did you heat up or fry those tortillas in any way? A quick trip in the frying pan with oil (I use olive for the quick fry) will multiply the taste profile. Med - high heat until lightly browned, flip once.Goya is for,  "It's a weekday,  I gotta work.   I need to throw something in the crock for dinner tonight." dat marbling!!

are you stupid? Then drain the rice, then use the sauce as a drizzle in on your taco salads. goat curry,goat jerkNice cookingYou should slow cook it.Ah, okay. Perfect, thanks!Yeah. I didn't like having to drag my stove and all that into this since crockpot meals are usually meant to be easy, one dish sort of things, but I didn't want to leave the sauce as it was, and reducing in the crockpot would have taken far too long.

I think the main argument for waiting until after is that you can reduce the liquid based on what the meat sweated out while cooking (which I think was a fair amount of what I boiled off in my case), where if you did it before you might accidentally have the sauce get too thin and need to reduce anyway.

Otherwise I totally agree. It is a lot easier to do something like that the night before.Drain which? I drain and wash the black beans but the rest of it does not require draining. The rice soaks up the liquid Do you drain those additions?Check the chicken and salsa post on this sub.  I add hot sauce,  black beans, onion, corn,  whatever you want.

Add 1-1.5 cups of rice.

On the burrito I put cheddar, refried beans, salsa chicken mixture.

Delicious, freezes well, not the worst thing for you, filling. Huh. That simple?  Can you give me rough quantities?Ooh, if it works out, you can save the broth from whatever you make in the slow cooker and make the rice with that.Ah, I love stuff like this.  Generic Mexican-ish "stuffing" is great, because you can wrap it in a burrito, throw it with cheese on nachos, use it for a smaller quesadilla, throw it in tupperware by itself and just heat &amp; eat, and I bet it'd be good on buttered, toasted sourdough with lots of cheese.

I made something along the same lines here, and was happy with the results: http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2meo9e/my_hangover_demands_nachos/I had some roasted carrots and potatoes leftover, and I threw them into the slow cooker the next day for stew.  They were definitely overcooked and mushy on the inside, but they had a nice flavour so it was all good.  They probably would have been better if I'd cooked them for a shorter time.I do this with the chicken and salsa recipe.  Add rice for the last hour and it makes great burritos I discovered *chipotle chiles in adobo sauce*  about 2 years ago, this stuff makes everything good (unless you used too much and then everyone is coughing from the heat)

It's just a really bliss flavor in a lot of dishes, so I approve.Hmm I'm gonna try this. Maybe with chicken. Also gonna add some rice to the burrito. Without a doubt! I guess it's easy to smash with a knife but I feel this brings out more flavor, and it's satisfyingi make chilis and whatnot all the time, but this definitely inspired me to make something i can bring into work and stuff in a pita! love it. Thanks for the recipe! Looks delicious, can't wait to try it out!* 3-4 chicken breasts
* One box of stuffing mix
* 1 cup sour cream mixed with one can of cream of chicken soup
* 1 cup of water

Click "source" under my comment to see how you do it.I like this. Creative yet simple, versatile, freezable, easy to use. Everything good from a slow cooker recipe. I'll be making my own version!If you want to use dried beans, you just need to soak them in a bowl of water overnight.

I think I would have made the sauce ahead of time on the stove to get a good reduction since the crock pot is useless for that, but it probably turns out about the same either way.That's what I was wondering, haha.  And I need the peppers slightly mushy anyway since they are getting turned into a sauce, and if the onions are disappeared it'll be even better, since my boyfriend isn't the biggest fan- as long as the flavors are there I'm a-okay.  Thank you!You won't get much of the maillard type flavors out of a slow cooker. It sure isn't going to put a char on anything unless something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

You can absolutely roast the veggies before tossing them in. One thing to keep in mind though, depending on how cooked they are, and when you add them in, it is possible they'll be "overcooked". For onions, garlic and peppers I don't think that would bother me much.Okay thank you for explaining! I will try it next time!Whoops, misread that.You need:
3-4 chicken breasts
One box of stuffing mix
1 cup sour cream mixed with one can of cream of chicken soup
1 cup of water

Put the chicken breasts on the bottom of the crockpot, throw the stuffing mix in, add the sour cream/soup mix, and top with the water. Cook on low 6-7 hours. Half way through cooking you can fluff the stuffing around with a fork to let the water and soup mix really incorporate into the stuffing mix.

The original recipe I used had two boxes of stuffing and a bag of frozen green beans and it was really dry and the green beans were crunchy. I picked literally every one of them out, do not recommend.

[You can find all the past selections on the wiki.](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/wiki/index#wiki_best_of_slowcooking)Chuck roast is beef, but I would definitely call it a chiliI would call that ~~pork~~ beef enchilada or ~~pork~~ beef chili.

Edit: Maybe I should go to bed.This is a recipe I came up with. I wanted something I could put into burritos that could be frozen for a quick grab-and-go lunch during the week, so I didn't want the stuffing to be "liquid-y" and soak through the tortilla, and so I was careful to try to avoid adding too much liquid to this recipe.

Flavor was also an issue, as I didn't want to have to add a bunch of other things to the burrito just to have it be tasty. I'm a fan of spicy foods, especially a subtle, peppery spice, so I chose my ingredients accordingly.

**Ingredients:**

1x 16 oz can of black beans (I started with 2 cans but didn't end up using them all, see below), rinsed and drained

2x 4.5 oz can of chopped green chiles, "drained" (See below)

2x 10 oz can of red (spicy) enchilada sauce

1x can of chipotle chiles in adobo sauce

~3.5 lb chuck roast

**Extra:**

Tortillas, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, etc.

**Recipe:**

Put the chuck roast into the crockpot and pour the enchilada sauce over the meat.

Drain and rinse the black beans. Around this point I discovered that 2 cans of beans was actually too much, and opted to use about half of my total, or ~1 can. Pour them over the beef.

"Drain" the green chiles. Basically all I did was quickly upend them to get excess liquid out, but it isn't a big deal. Pour on top of the roast.

Pour the chipotle chiles and adobo sauce in.

Cover and let cook for ~7-8 hours on low, or until the meat can be shredded.

At the end, the sauce will likely still be very thin. Remove the meat from the sauce and shred. Meanwhile, pour everything else (sauce, beans, chiles, and all) into a large pot and let simmer until it is roughly the consistency of a thick chili. I tossed in a few pinches of corn starch to help the thickening along. If I pushed my spoon through the sauce it would take a few moments to fill in behind it. The liquid level dropped ~1/2" in the pot during this process. This took ~30-40 mins. By the end, the sauce transformed from the bright red of the enchilada sauce to a dark reddish-brown color.

Return the meat to the crockpot and pour the sauce over it*. Toss to coat and let sit on high for about 10 minutes to heat through. At this point the sauce should be pretty well 'stuck' to the meat, and shouldn't be sloshing much. Scoop into tortillas with desired toppings (I used cheese, lettuce, and sour cream), roll, and enjoy. I ate mine with a side of sliced pineapple.

\* let the sauce cool a bit first, especially if you turned the crockpot off while it was empty. Suddenly shocking the crockpot may crack it.

If you want to freeze your leftovers, this should freeze pretty well. Just be mindful of your toppings as to what will freeze well and what will not. I just used the beef/beans and cheese. Lettuce doesn't freeze well, and I didn't want to risk the sour cream. If you want to add those the day of, they are pretty easy to put into a small container.

Makes ~8 burritos.Slow cooking makes it tender. Brining makes it juicy. It *is* possible to have one without the other...Usually you don't want to use broth with a bunch of fat floating on top. It just isn't that appetizing. I'll edit my post for clarity.You start this out with "First, separate out the liquid from the fat." Just for clarity is your entire write up a sequence of steps?I have the exact same one from a thrift store!  :fist bump:
I tried a few others, even pricey ones, but this is the best design.I see you had a leek chopped up in your pictures but I don't see it in the recipe.

I did skim the fat off the top for leftovers.  Helped a bit.Just de shell it as you would regularly. Shock the eggs in cold water after they are done cooking though.Let's not frighten new subscribers away from this subreddit with your "Assuming" advice.

The simplest, easiest thing to do is put all raw meat in your slow cooker then close the lid. Turn your slow cooker to either 4 High or 8 Low. Walk away. Come back later to some mighty fine yumminess.Dunno who keeps downvoting you, thanks for the info.  Made this because I  saw Chef Chang eating ramen in Japan.  Do you have a technique for de-shellling?For me, the searing is about texture and locking in flavor and moisture.

If you throw a non-seared cut into the slow cooker, it often will turn to mush.  The sear gives some texture to the meat and separates it from the dish, while still adding the fat and savory flavors.  It will also keep some moisture within the cut, similar reasoning to why you heat oil in a frying pan before throwing stuff in.Okay thank you!!6.5 seems like youll get firm yolks. I usually do 4.5 for soups and maybe 5 if im eating it for breakfast. I'm new here, can anyone explain the importance of searing everything first? I have yet to do it and don't understand why it's necessary? 1) You misunderstood what I meant. If he puts all the chicken in at once or staggers it, it will all be overcooked in 6-8 hours. So it might as well go in all at once.

2) I'm going to need some sources for how putting raw meat into a cooking dish part way through is dangerous. Assuming that the entire food mass is heated to a safe enough temperature to kill pathogens, the time inside the cooking vessel doesn't matter, nor does it matter what was in there to begin with.  If this were the case, dishes that required preparing a cooking sauce/stock before adding things like fish or chicken to poach would be widely regarded as dangerous, and they are not.When its raw you poke the hole in it, it gets rid of the air bubble at the bottom of it and I believe it is at a low boil for the 6min 11 seconds. Its a technique used by various Japanese restaurants.I just did this 10 minutes ago and you're right. The cold water colander method is the way to go, then add broth. This rule doesn't apply to japanese ramenDon't forget lava snakes in the toilet 12 hours after eating.&gt; If you are cooking the lot for 6-8 hours it wont matter if you stagger putting the chicken in

My apologies, brilliantjoe, but this is bad advice.

Introducing raw chicken into an already cooking slow cooker is not only unsafe but ill-advised as well.

The mods of r/Slowcooking are working on a 'Food Safety' part of the wiki (I'm a mod here). It should be up and running within a few days. Once it's completed, we'll put a link to it in the sidebar.

Please don't put raw chicken into your slow cooker ('Crock-Pot') halfway through, or at anytime after the beginning of, your slow cooking process.More fun searing tricks: if you're lazy and want a good sear without a lot of work, pat-dry your meat and coat it with corn starch. If you're up for a little more work, a mixture with some baking soda makes the surface if the meat alkaline and helps kick start the Maillard reaction. America's Test Kitchen?So I added the rice and frozen veggies with about an hour &amp; a half left and they did come out a bit mushy, but not horrible.  My only concern was there was some oil and maybe fat from the chicken that may have been absorbed or disguised since everything was close to the same reddish color as the marinade and there wasn't any marinade left so the edges kinda were brownish-burnt, but still not that bad.  It just clumped up the rice &amp; veggies near the sides.  Al-in-all, it is/was good, I'll just add the rice/veggies in a bit later next time.When I shock ramen, I normally cook until 1-2 minutes until finished, pour into colander, and then run cold water over it instead of sitting in the water. Then if I want to save the noodles for later I toss them in a little oil :) I make to-go ramen all the time, it's delicious https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bz73uOzCMAAd5bq.jpgTook a pic early in the sear, definitely seared all sides, and the part that's showing more.  My fire alarms went off and scared the shit out of my dog so this was the pick I got.Poke a small hole in when it's raw or let it cook/seal the outer white for a sec?  Exactly 6 minutes 11 seconds?  Stocks will have different temps, how so exact?As soon as your slow cooker comes to a simmer, chicken parts will be overcooked in less than an hour. Breasts (unless they are monster breasts) will be overcooked in less than 30 minutes. If you are cooking the lot for 6-8 hours it wont matter if you stagger putting the chicken in, it's all going to overcook.You should x-post this to /r/ramen. They would love it. I always thought shocking was only bad for pastas because of how the sauce sticks to the noodle. Not sure why it would be frowned upon for soup.this show got me on a big ramen kick too. Although it looks like you took it further and created your own. Thanks for the recipe. Yeah, having food part cooked is a life saver in professional cooking but it doesn't make the food better (especially if you don't finish it off before serving).I don't know if your pan needs to be hotter or you need to leave your meat in longer. Either way, that is one of the weakest, most domestic, apartment complex-looking sears I've ever seen. Blast your pan on med-high, put oil in (it should start to smoke a little) and let her sit on each side long enough to get fully dressed. Dark brown with flecks of almost-burnt.

Source: I love meatWhen a world renowned chef shocks his noodles to stop the cooking, I think it's safe to say that it isn't "bad."

I see a lot of hate for the noodle shocking thing, and I really don't get it. It takes out the guessing game of "well, I think the noodles will be done in two minutes, so I'll strain them now and hope for the best!"That looks very delicious, going to have to try it.

Thanks for sharing. Add both breasts and thighs at the same time.I just pour it all in a pan and reduce it without adding anything.Is there a reason not to/is that an incorrect way to do it?you have -4. Why? How can this go wrong (Havnt tried this myself)I'm not 100% sure. It was less than $15 though.Oh man that sounds so good. You could even cook in the slow cooker and then finish on the grill so it's crispy.Why does everyone think chicken noodle soup helps a cold?????????Yes.  Because it will cook. Slowly.  Welcome to slowcooking ,That is a serious bowl. I know this is /r/slowcooking,  but  what I like to do is buy that corn beef, throw it in the freezer for a few months,  and then cook it mid summer on the grill.

Not traditional slow cooking, but possibly fits a larger more ambiguous definition. : )&gt;  I thought the noodles were pretty solid though.

Should have cooked them for longer then if they're that solid!Yeah, I used some beef soup bones.  Cooked all on low for ~8  hours, took the pork out and put on high for another hour.  The soup bones definitely added some nice flavor, I should probably take out the (optional).I did about 8 hours on low, took the pork out and set on high for around an hour to get the soup bones nice and rendered.Thanks for that.  I have chickens but I'm surprisingly bad and boiling eggs. I'm more of a *throw a bunch of things together and add as needed* and bad at following instructions.  I'm a pretty terrible baker.So I saw it on The Mind of a Chef when Chang was in Japan, which is what got me craving ramen.  Is there a negative effect on the noodles if you ice bath it?  First time I cooked this, definitely will change a few things.  I thought the noodles were pretty solid though.Nah fk that just steam them it's fasterAre you just looking to avoid gluten?

You could use the liquid for soup in place of broth. If you really want to make gravy just without flour, you can still do that.

I'll provide instructions for two alternate ways of thickening. Before thickening, you'll want to separate the flavorful liquid from the fat. The fat floats on top. There are two relatively easy ways of separating them.

* You can stick the broth/fat mixture in the fridge and let it cool. If you leave it long enough, the fat will turn solid and opaque. Scrape it off with a spoon.
* If you have access to a [fat separator](http://i.imgur.com/P9rnGZN.jpg), you can pour the mixture into this device. The fat will be on the top, and the stuff you want will be on the bottom. It is easy to pour the stuff you want out from the bottom, because that is where the spout starts. Stop pouring when mostly fat is left.

# Gravy Making Method 1
Cornstarch works great for thickening stock into gravy.

1. Put your liquid in a large sauce pan over medium heat.
1. In a separate container (I use an old coffee mug), mix 1 Tbsp of corn starch per cup of liquid you are thickening.
1. Add an equal amount of cold water to this mug and mix it into a slurry with a fork. There shouldn't be any chunks, but it will be opaque.
1. Slowly add the slurry to your simmering liquid on the stove, whisking so no lumps form.
1. Simmer this for 5 minutes or so to thicken, whisking occasionally.

# Gravy Making Method 2
If you want to get exotic, pick up some xanthan gum and a kitchen balance and give it a go.

1. Put a container for your liquid on a the kitchen balance. Zero the balance.
1. Add the liquid you want to thicken and note the mass.
1. Use math to figure out how much xanthan gum powder you need to add. For gravy, it should be 0.3% to 0.5% by weight.*^see ^footnote
1. Weigh out the appropriate amount of xanthan gum powder.
1. Mix the powder into the liquid, cold or hot, and it'll quickly thicken.

# Mathy Footnote
\* For example, if you are working with around 3 cups of liquid, you'd weigh that (it'll be close to 700 grams):

    700 g liquid * 0.003 = 2.1 g xanthan gum powder
    700 g liquid * 0.005 = 3.5 g xanthan gum powder

So you would weigh out 2.1 to 3.5 g of xanthan gum powder in step 4. More powder will make it thicker. Don't use too much or you'll make pork boogers, not gravy.We use an egg genie because we're lazy. I also read you can oven bake your eggs if you're carefulThat was the first thing I thought.I don't think you can get the rolling boil you need for tonkotsu in a crock pot. It'll probably be good broth in its own right, but not the same.I have not tested with pork but I often cook chicken (bone in or whole) with no liquid at all, not even a little. It comes out fall-off-the-bone tender and is actually my favorite way to cook it. I would think pork would be the same. If you are worried about sticking you could always put a couple pieces of carrot, onion or celery at the bottom but I have never had sticking issues with my crockpot. I'm sat at work dribbling.

For the slow cooker, i usually use pork shoulder, or butt :) Pork loin is so lovely and tender on its own, it does better in the oven for less time. Invest in a meat thermometer if you end up trying it in the oven - takes out the guesswork. Depends on what you're cooking. I made chicken drumsticks yesterday, and added some chicken broth, but not covering the chicken or anything. It ended up being awesome, and not at all dry, even though the skin got crispy in all that moisture (something I don't understand because...science). Why can't you use liquid, anyway?Ratatouille:

Chickpea curry is also good and there's so many variations


Tip for OP: for the perfect soft boiled eggs, try this: use a pot of water with a lid and bring to the boil only half an inch of water. Put the eggs in &amp; boil/steam them that way for 6.5 mins with the lid on. You can also do many eggs at the same time with this technique &amp; not worry about them being underdone :)I've eaten it with Fritos. And it's not as thick as pulled pork. Think nacho cheese dip but chunkier. Nice. Reminds me of the ramen Naruto eats.I spend all Sunday every Sunday cooking for the week as it is. Is there some way to get the delicious flavor of tonkotsu broth without personally boiling the bones for hours? Even the highest setting of my slow cooker doesn't get high enough to get the broth that milky, dissolved bone consistency like they have in legit ramen shops.shocking is when you place noodles (typically a pasta term) into an ice batch to stop the cooking process.

usually, this is done in say a restaurant setting where you take a 10 minute pasta and cook it for 8 minutes, shock it. and then when orders come in, you throw it back into the pasta cooker (a machine with small baskets with handles and boiling water) for 2 minutes + a few sec to get it to al dente or whatever consistency is desired.Why not? I've never heard of "shocking noodles" in the first place. What is it supposed to do and why shouldn't you do it?The ice is a bit overkill. You can just rice them with cold tap water. The cook is the best..Never shock your noodles in an ice bath you barbarian Next time try cooking the egg in the stock, poke a small hole in the bottom with a pin needle then cook it for exactly 6 mins and 11 seconds.Recipe for spinach and avocado dip please!It looks delicious. How long do you have to put it in the slow cooker for?Did you use soup bones? They add so much texture, flavor and umami.all of hamburg?Do you just do one layer of each ingredient?Saw ramen on a cooking show and really wanted to try it. Found a few recipes and combined all the stuff that sounded good.

**Ingredients**:

	3 lbs. pork loin or similar

	Package of ramen  we went with some nicer ramen, but any will work

	6 oz shitake mushrooms

	 yellow onion

	5 green onions

	2 inches of ginger

	3 cloves garlic

	Juice of lime

	Tbsp black bean paste

	2 Tbsp sriracha

	 cup brown sugar

	 cup rice wine

	64 fl oz stock, I used chicken

	A few cups of extra water

	Soup bones (optional)

	Garnish with green onion, lime, soft boiled egg, carrot, whatever else you need

Brown the pork, dice the mushrooms to garlic, juice the lime, throw it all in the slow cooker.  I boiled the ramen and put it in an ice bath to stop the cooking.  This keeps the nice texture when you add the broth back on.  Garnish with what you like and enjoy!This also explains why caramelized onions burn at the edges and not the bottom/center.I use this recipe but substitute the ranch with blue cheese and blue cheese crumbles  http://www.crockpotgirls.com/buffalo-chicken-dip/   But, like,  why bother sharing this picture at all? Care to share the recipe? I've been looking for a good buffalo chicken dip lately.I made some vegan enchiladas with spinach and cheese that turned out pretty good. I also have made vegan lasagna too.

If you are interested I can see if I have the recipes around, or at worst guess what did ;)I'd recommend running a test batch first, if you have the time/supplies for it.Does it need to be a main dish? Can it be a dip? dessert?Just started this for dinner! Thanks for the idea, I'm so excited.Haha, tears for flavor!This is the most useful piece of information i've seen today. Thank you.Take one lb carrots, place for in slow cooker, wait 3 hours, cry.4-5 hours on slow or high?
(thanks for recipe)I know...


They're just so typical for vegan dishes. I wanted something with a wow factor.I've disassembled a broken crockpot (for science) and found that the heat source (in my model) was a metal band around the 'equator' of the pot, as opposed to a heat source at the bottom.

May explain why it heats more uniformly.&gt; * tomatoes
&gt; * onion
&gt; * ginger, grated
&gt; * garlic, crushed
&gt; * coriander
&gt; * cumin
&gt; * cream (45%)

This is the base for about 100 indian dishes lol. Though I usually go yogurt over cream. I feel like American restaurants especially really load up on cream and butter more than traditional indian cooks.&gt; I'd prefer it to not be stew, chili, or soup

Heh not giving us much to work with here.I've made a tortellini dish with cream cheese and have had no problems with it burning.If you can get quesa fresco (or whatever it's called) I hear it's similar enough to work in a pinch. Paneer is also a plastic!Thanks!I've done this with my spinach and avocado dip.  Put it on warm/low so it goes slowly and you should be fine! I wouldn't actually mind if people posted recipes that had beef in them. I've done some really great substitutes that throw off even the best meat eaters out there. It's cooking with butter, milk, and cheese that makes it hard for a vegan dish to be mind blowingly awesome. (I do eat meat, I just like including those who can't always partake in potlucks while taking carnivores on interesting food trips).Best vegan dish is always beef, because beef is the most vegan of all animals :-)That title made me so hungryPretty much Kimchi. Always KimchiI think it's more to do with lamb-slaughtering traditionally happening in the spring, so there was a lot of lamb available at Easter-time.I've made buffalo chicken cheese dip with cream cheese and had no issues with burning.I'm game. I've got a lot of garam masala just hanging out in my cupboard, needing to be used. Let's do it :)

EDIT: Have you considered filming instructional videos for Youtube, showing people how to do these things? You may not get a million followers, but it'd be a really great resource for people trying to learn.I teach cooking classes for a living and have one on how to make saag. If youre up for it, I'd love to offer some more spices to add to this that will make it even better when you do it!Maybe it's this one?


http://allrecipes.com/recipe/jalapeno-popper-dip/No , I mean a regular oven...  Many recipes will have you cook the roast for 15 to 30 minutes at 500 degrees then turn off the oven to let it finish cooking..  just google cooking a roast to medium rare...  don't add in a crockpot because it can't be done in a crockpot...  sorrySounds more like they used an immersion/stick blender while it was all still in the crockpot, though transferring to a traditional blender would work, as well.  Food processor would probably work ok, but i doubt its dry enough for a food processor to be as effective as the others.lol noNice! Thanks for the follow-up. I was equally surprised of how good it came out. It was probably the only thing I ate for a week just trying it with different things. I made this.  It's good.

I put it on a tortilla and added sour cream, green salsa, great northern beans, and cheddar cheese. Mmmmmm.Can you even read?

&gt;after eating my batch (and all the paneer)

He ate all of the paneer and this is all he had left for his wife.
Definitely making this with rice on the side, can't wait. What else could I serve or buy to make a complete Korean meal for guests? I don't know much about Korean cuisine.This is one of my favorite dishes... Thank you! Next time try adding corn flour into the end mixture to thicken it up a little, also more spinach next time for sure, and probably some chili peppers.Jesus Christ AKA "The Lamb Of God." You're symbolically eating baby Jesus to celebrate his death.

OK. So I did some research and this actually seems to be a thing - eating Lamb on Easter. Just one more reason I don't get religion, I guess.

*Walks away, shaking head in disbelief.*For canned vegetables at room temperature - half an hour. For frozen vegetables - one hour.How much was the sales price? So you put everything in a food processor, you mean?  Or just stirred it?
It's a brick until it cooks. I did Mutter Paneer this past weekend and I was surprised at how much effort it took to cut.Paneer is super easy to make at home. Give it a try: http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-paneer-cheese-in-30-minutes-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-57008sounds like a weird taste combo! i'm used to indian paneer. i can't imagine cheese that melts/goes stringy with curry. you ever had paneer? I've yet to find a decent recipe for dal curry, much less one that I can slow cook while I'm at work. Do you have a recipe I can try? I'm still pretty new to lentils so I'm not comfortable winging it.I was wondering about the colour, so dark. Have to try this. Inspired!I'm saving this for later. Sounds great!go to any Indian store and look in the refrigerated section. Brand really does not matter. In the US, I found 3,4 brands everywhere. Making it yourself sounds cool but its a pain in the butt. Plus, you cant make it very dense like they come in the stores, which means they break apart in to bits when you try to cook. If you look up Aarti on the Food Network  - she introduced me to making paneer and her recipe is more or less what u/hygienex outlines but with more detail.

http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/aarti-sequeira/paneer-homemade-indian-cheese-recipe.html

I like making my paneer, but pressing it is important, or else it crumbles.  Lately I've been going to my nearby indian market - their paneer is VERY firm.And here is the finished product! http://imgur.com/hrzUXZW,VhX2K0d,BXJ9n0Z#0Thanks! I had no idea it was so straightforward.Love Palak Paneer! i...is that brie?

:|I feel like this should be a dark green colour like my mum makes it. You usually buy pander from Indian grocers, and cut it into cubes before frying it and adding it to the curryI'm not sure, I haven't tried. I'd be curious as to what substitutions you could use though.

I have used regular and low fat. I never noticed a taste difference.I have the same question. I would love to make recipes using paneer but have no idea where to find it or which brands to look for.This sounds delish! I don't see paneer in the recipe? I'm actually most curious where you get yours. I've had this and tikka masala pander at restaraunts but it seems daunting to make Can you use something other than cream cheese?Awesome I have a ton of garam masala! And thanks for the tip, I'll look into dal! Oh you're right. I thought that was the material. I swear I've seen foil ones before, but I have never used them so not sure how they fit. Sorry about that! :-)This is my favorite dish, thank you so much!! How close to the end would you say?It surprisingly wasn't. I kept checking on it to make sure and it held up really well. I think it's because I cooked it on high for only a few hours. I took it out and gave it a taste and I thin that it's delicious. It's not too mushy and not too crunchy. I think it may be because I cooked it on high for a few hours instead of on low for several hours, but I could just be wrong.Haha my bad! I'll remember that next time.Can you turn it on to warm after the cooking period, rather than delaying the cooking period?

It's best not to take safety advice from the internet (not sure if it's against the rules on this sub, but it is on most cooking subs). Also bear in mind that for beef, lamb, and pork, bigger cuts of meat are totally fine for 10-12 hours. Thanks, I've been looking for some slow cooker Indian food! I'll give this a try!Looks great. I've made this [Asian Slow Cooker Rib](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/3762844557/slow-cooker-korean-grass-fed-short-ribs)s using chuck steak. Lower cost, more meat, same great result. Might be a good idea to freeze the liquids - broth, water, beer, etc. Then mix them in on the morning of. That should give you considerable extra time. You could even test how long the ice lasts before committing to this plan.Isn't that cabbage going to be grey mush after slow cooking? Not hating, just curious.Came here to say the same Just put the uncooked rice in the slow cooker 20-40 minutes before everything is done, and be willing to eat over- or undercooked rice.

Phew. http://paddynotpatty.com/Are you religious?! As in Christian? Because this seems to me to be probably the most sacrilegious thing someone could do. Not trying to be mean, I'm truly interested in finding out.Came here to say this. PADDY PLEASE. :-)Slow cooker manufacturers routinely recommend that you do not use their products to store food. Their warning is a mixture of common sense + liability legalese.In the interest of safety, I wouldn't chance leaving raw ingredients out of the refrigerator for longer than the USDA guidelines recommend. People are quick to say "it's big deal" or "I've never had a problem", but it's absolutely not worth the risk, if you ask me.

  If you can control it with your phone, why not just start it before you leave and then shut it off when it's done? Maybe switch it to warm for a bit and then just cut it off? It's not ideal, but it beats leaving out raw food.This year was pretty rough because of the high beef prices. I ended up getting mine for $3.49/lb, compared to $1.69/lb in previous years.This is a galbi-jjim, which is typically prepared and eaten on Chuseok, or the Festival of the Harvest Moon.

This kind of galbi is probably my favorite Korean dishI am a big fan of roasting or searing after a slow cook, love the crispy!

I'll have to give it a shot.   I completely agree with the shortrib,  can't do the thin ones with the cooker.
I
You gave me a great idea though,  smoked short rib Popsicles!

Edit:  split the ribs a bit,  peel and wrap around end,  marinate,  slow cook,  roast, profit. Corned beef never goes on sale here, it makes me super sad.cabbage needs to be in there for like an hour max. its gonna have the consistency of jelloI personally prefer to rinse off the spices that come with the corned beef before cooking (or, if they're in a separate envelope, I just throw them away). I find them to be overwhelming when you're eating the finished product.Ahh the beauty of a slow cooker, where you can watch all of the mitosis phases[You should meet this guy... He needs you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3077i9/sooo_i_forgot_i_had_potatoes/)It's hard to really get a picture of the internal texture. The meat was so tender that the moment I put a fork or knife to it, the whole thing fell apart. Super tender and mouthwatering texture.Sure. Like most vegetables, though, you'll want to add them near the end of the cooking cycle as they merely need to be heated up and not cooked.I think the Filipino dish chicken adobo uses a vinegar-based marinade, then takes the meat out for grilling while simmering the marinade/sauce down by half.  I've done a variation on it with leftover wine: no poisonings yet!  But in future, I'll take /u/nurseangela's advice (thank you!) &amp; make sure it reaches a good rolling boil.The only appropriate response in this situation. I love corned beef, one of these days I'll make it for real in a slow cooker with more traditional trimmings.

Also, Patty = Patricia.  Paddy = Patrick.  Ireland is very picky about its nicknames, haha.Does... That taste good?   It looks like jerky.  Apologies if It is good,  but damn! Really? They had me at "crock pot placenta".I don't think they are. Reynold's full brand name is Reynold's Metals. Those definitely look like the plastic ones. (I'm not even sure how metal would work since every crock is different?)Yeah I totally get that. I was going for the softer cabbage when I made mine.I'll be posting some tomorrow morning. I usually do my cabbage separate from the slow cookers; I think it gets too soft. I like my cabbage a bit crispy.Any after pictures?The last picture in that album made me want to vomit :(Why do you need a way around adding a liquid to your slow cooker?Seriously you can a get new one at walmart for like 20 too.Yes. Generally this is used in gravy.

Recently, I've used the left over liquid from my last 2 pulled ports to make ramen noodles.

I save the liquid, let it cool in a container, fridged it for a day, scrapped of the fat layer that settles, boiled it with some extra water, added noodles and some left over meat... man just typing this is making me hungry. It tastes soooo goood!I don't cook by "USDA standards" in my kitchen... Just common sense and what fits my lifestyle. I think that should be totally fine. There's no need to over-complicate our lives...you obviously have a busy life and starting the crock pot at 9am, after it's been refrigerated all night will not kill you. Good luck! I want a crock pot that fancy! Yea, cleaning one pot is time consuming. It takes all of what... a mintue?You folks aren't supporting my laziness...lol.  I'm trying to reduce the number of pots to clean!  I've done this before in a pan (both successfully and unsuccessfully) but I'm somewhat new to slowcooking world.  Saw a few articles that say to add it in the last 2 or so hours with a little water as necessary, depending on the volume of liquid in it already.  Gonna chance it and add in frozen veggies and rice.  I'll report back.  Thanks everyone, though.These are foil/metal but I do understand. :)Gotta do Dublin Dr Pepper!Please follow these guidelines. Above 40 degrees F, bacteria that produce harmful toxins rapidly reproduce. They reproduce in an exponential fashion, i.e., they double, then double again, and again. Although the bacteria all die when you fully cook the food, the toxins they've produced are still there and can make you and your family very sick.

I can promise you'll get people here commenting that it is fine to leave food out. They'll tell you they do this all the time and nothing bad has ever happened. They will critize and downvote the sound advice from /u/ReverendEarthwormJim, above. Their experience is a single datapoint. You may get lucky and nothing bad may happen, but why risk your health?

Here are the [CDC stats](http://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/) regarding foodborne illness in the United States:

* Every year 48,000,000 people get sick,
* Every year 128,000 are hospitalized, and
* Every year 3,000 die of foodborne diseases.This is very solid advice. I see lots in the kitchen section of thrift stores, goodwill, etc. I saw your post yesterday, stopped at the grocery store on the way home from work and cooked this overnight!   Woke up to the wonderful smell of beef stew this morning.

I had this for lunch and although I would like the liquid to be thicker it wasn't soup thin, so I am good.

Thanks for posting this yesterday! Can't wait to get home from work and have some for dinner, wish I had bought biscuits!I'd second this. Cook the rice in a pot in the stove. Serve your food over the top of it. Pour over a little of that broth/sauce for extra flavor!This isn't entirely accurate. The high setting will get your food up to the the desired temperature faster, but it does use more energy and pump out more heat to do that.

The actual temperatures will depend the temperature of the room it is in, what food/liquid you have in the crock, size and brand of slow cooker, and so on.Get rid of the fat by putting the pot in the refrigerator. The fat will float to the top after 12-25 hours and become solid. Easy to take it off at that point. Not sure what counteracts bitter -- heat? And salt, if you don't use too much. Check op shops for used crock pots.  We get tons of them for sale at thrift shops here (in Canada).  Even if the electrical parts are sketchy, if the insert fits yours, you're set.

Firing blanksAlso known in some parts as butterfly fries (in case you're aimlessly wandering from food cart to food cart looking for these for some reason) and they're SO GOOD.That depends on how long you dry it. The trick is to stop drying when it's still bendy but dry enough not to mold up. Too long and it will go stiff and breakable rather than leathery, still tasty though.English is my second language.

You're doing good work.I got mine at the dollar store. You're not "asking a question" like you claim - you're being a judgmental ass hole who assumes that people who would enjoy this wouldn't also enjoy fresh fruit.

Olives? You really are the devil.

Oops jalapeos. My bad. As I sit here wondering what is for breakfast, I can't help but think 3 or 4 of those tortillas would make a great plate of Migas.You could put the parm on when you take it out. It'll melt. Reward before performance?Looks like a dog's ass skid mark on the plate.There is hardly any meat in the picture, in fact that melt has more veggies than meat on it. So other than standing on some silly high horse (or maybe it should be high cabbage?) why even bring this up?

You can also enjoy eating meat while also enjoy eating fresh produce and veggies. The two aren't mutually exclusive.Like I need more practice.They may have been fried properly and then sat in the holding cabinet for hours.

Had a few while I was there. They're much more generous with drink size than in London. You want me to *care* for $7.25/hr?

Pffft, dude, let's be realistic for a moment....

Minimum work for minimum pay.Americans telling Italians they're serving pasta wrong?&gt;Do you blend the cabbage in your cabbage soup?

Nah, cut it into small squares and stir-fry it slightly first... before adding it to the soup... to prevent that boiled cabbage taste.

&gt;I've never heard of cabbage soup before?

It's also called tofu soup, however tofu is the least flavorsome ingredient.

It's a profoundly healthy recipe that I make at least once a month... with (vegan) veg or chicken stock, mushrooms, soya-sauce, lime or lemon juice, white pepper, tofu cubes and green onions. I've PM'd you the recipe.

It's cheap, easy and takes about 5 mins to make *(I cut the veg while the water boils)*!

I also PM'd you a long soup recipe which is as quick and easy to make, but features garlic, lemongrass, ginger, chilli and green onion as the main spices... really nice with broccoli, thinly sliced carrots and thin rice noodles!Neither.  It's a baked custard.  Time to move on. Nothing else to see here.I'm moving back to the Southwest Soon almost entirely for this reason. I miss Tacos so much. Because this is home made Do you blend the cabbage in your cabbage soup?

Preheat oven to 350
On a baking sheet place plain bagel in oven for 2-3 mins to lightly toast the tops. Remove from oven.

Add all the toppings as if you were making a pizza.

Bake at 350 for another 6-8 mins or until it looks awesome. Keep an eye on it.

Finish with a dash of oregano, cracked black pepper and parmesan. thisDid you get that at the restaurant in the Lisboa Mall?air dried cod, imported from the northern atlantic, made in 365 different ways. God i love it.

That's some really sad raw fish. Doesn't look fresh at all.maybe its the photography ...
This looks closer to a stuffed pizza without the top crust, which l'll admit is an interesting idea.

The important question is, how did it taste?My question related to a slight alteration to this "small sandwich" recipe.

No need to call me a cunt just for asking a question... also, I came bearing recipes... that's worth something, no?So true! Was there in September. Any thing with nasi entered my stomach without a second thought. Looks great.  What is it? Interesting..They specifically call them "baked cheese sticks" in the commercial. I assumed they were not fried but microwaved when heated&gt;I had a pulled a huge pork and cheese sandwich last night and I never yawned once.

Feeling fatigued after heavy meals is relatively normal for humans.

They seem delicious!Tkmaxx retail stores in the uk sell them for around 3.99. They're nothing special. Homemade tortillas are a significant improvement to any Mexican meal.  A million times better than store bought.  They're incredibly easy to make, though flour take a little bit more effort than corn.  I made close to five dozen smaller, taco sized corn tortillas in about an hour.  Mix up the masa with water, knead and then cover for a bit.  Break off chunks and weigh for uniform weight and then roll into round balls.  Press out using a tortilla press with two pieces of cut up ziploc bag.  Toss on a cast iron griddle.  Press out another ball, flip first tortilla to other side of griddle, toss on second tortilla.  Repeat.  I often make 4-5 dozen and lightly vacuum seal and freeze them.  They freeze very well.  Meat has been marinating for a while.  Tacos en route.  Looks delicous! Next time though take then photo from an inch or two further away, it might look a little clearer!
Sincere question: I've been a vegan for 25 years and the thought of chewing on slugs of meat disgusts me *(yes, I can feel the down-votes coming)*. Can a meat-eater honestly claim that this meal wouldn't be improved if the meat was replaced with a garlic and basil focaccia style bread?

Wouldn't you feel fresher and cleaner and better after eating that, rather than needing a nap just to digest this mass of animal fats and proteins?

*(personally, I'd prefer to go for a run and then enjoy a light vegetable stir-fry with soya-sauce, garlic, ginger, chilli and cashews... or cabbage and tofu soup (ask for recipes if you're interested) and then feel energized and fresh and clean and awesome... but that's just me)*

Edit: Yes, I'm about to dig my own grave and I'm receiving abuse: but how long has it been since you guys have eaten a simple seasonal apple that hasn't been transported in storage or "preserved" by your local supermarket chain *(i.e. direct from a tree or farmer)*? Can you remember how crisp and tasty and delicious something so basic can be and will your children ever know the true taste of an apple? *(end of lecture, you may proceed with the complaining and the down-vote carnage)*&gt; I know that older cookbooks talk about keeping live clams in the fridge in water and feeding them cornmeal for a day or so to clean out their digestive tract of any sand.

UNLVThe thumb looked promising, but it didn't deliver. That's some sloppy-ass cuts right there on that Nigiri. It's funny you should say that. I thought very little of Mcdonalds food, but when I started working there I actually thought more highly of it.

Hell, it's still crappy fast food, it's bad for you and you can get far better stuff for a better price yourself. But it's not shit on a plate.There's a timer.

Either someone has put them in the vat and not set the timer so they've been left in too long or the timer went off and nobody bothered to pick it up in time. More likely the former because the latter is a damn annoying alarm sound.You are both right and wrong.

The shells would still be recognisable at that point. Mcdonalds fryers do indeed have programmed settings for specific items. But somebody still needs to pick the basket out of the vat. iirc Mozzarella sticks have a fry time of around 2 minutes and 15 seconds at 180 degrees Centigrade (that's the normal temperature for all of our vats)Man, parents just dont understand. Now where are the updates?Exactly this, work at a Mcdonalds.  They were fried for far too long. They've exploded.

That vat will be hell to clean tonight. I should know, I also did the cleaning during nights for a while.Love me some good Banh Mi. Sydney has some great Banh Mi due to high amount of Viets here. If anyone is in town, it's always worth trying it.You have no idea how happy it makes me that these are in Denver!That's the first amount of sushi that I've seen in which I actually wasn't sure if I could eat.

But I could eat that much sushi, it might take me all day during breakfast lunch and dinner, but the point is I **would** eat that much sushi all day...

... oh, wait, look at all those chopsticks, that's not for one person, it's for a banquet!

Well, I'll just see myself out.No disrespect, but it appears you made a bread bowl with chili inside of it. Well, it is not about how much something costs, I just love to prepare myself night snacks :DYeah, that looks really nice :) I would like to try it :)What I meant is that these guys were hypercritical even though it looks really delicious. You can jump on the critical bandwagon but calling it "shit" is just too much.

And considering this post has 4000+ upvotes, I think it might help you realize it's really not so bad.It's "wasabi", actually horseradish with dye and like 3% wasabi... :( can't the proper thing hereSuggesting Anton's is offensive.

Fuck that place. Are these two posts related? http://imgur.com/wFCcxqDHa there is loads! Come and get it!!I'm in th UK! Im sure it exist here as I have heard of but just not tried it before! I might have to hunt some down as it sounds amazing!I bet if he got paid more he would put in more of an effort.  Well to be fair, cheddar usually to the Europeans. Not deep fried Africa A foreign country that doesn't have marinara?
Pizza and pasta are pretty common.
I think this is a different planet.  exactlyI'm just going to assume the Chef is **really** into his food.Ingredients were fresh, and very good ! Display can be a bit off thoughWell not until **you** mentioned it!not if you're 4 years oldI hate to say this but they don't look very fresh. The color is a bit off. Maybe it is the camera. I am sure they taste better than they look. I think you did pretty well in the time you had. Homemade sushi generally isn't great looking, but if you enjoyed the product and you're satisfied, that's more than sufficient.none takenindeed, and I could have done with some octopus tooNevermind, I will console myself with bacon.  It will cure what ails me.
Does it bother anyone else that there are a bunch off penis's on the plate?we did, thanks !I broke that board soon after... goodbye board, you were a good friend...
Looks like an E6 circa 2011. However, it also looks a lot like the E71 from 2007/8ish :P
Serious score there.This is genius ! Thank you sir !
ZaZa's Restaurant in Florence is one of the best restaurant's I've been to, good value too!Yum!NICE!

And frankly, I don't know why even a troll would vote you down. Jesus.Reddit is fickle. Well I wouldn't call it shit, but yes, they were non traditional. One can try new things, can't he ? I want to put your meat in me sir!Get in me now!Hello heartburn. Would still eat.Oh man, there's just so many good flavors.

There's the "guilty pleasures." Basically non-healthy fattening sushi but its too good to pass up when you feel like indulging.

My favorites: Shrimp Crunch roll topped drizzled with spicy mayo. Philly roll: salmon on outside and cream cheese on the inside, to be dipped in soy sauce. Tuna tempura roll. A spicy tuna roll cooked all the way (the flavor of just that part is amazing) and coated in tempura. Dipped in teriyaki sauce - oh. my. god.

I'm too tired to keep going but the world of real, authentic, flavorful sushi is a whole other novel. But I just want to say that outside of the california roll, there's so much out there to dive into it. Takes a high level of stupid to mess up cheese sticks
Ham cheese and blueberry jam That looks and sounds excellent! Can't wait for the after pics.Hi lasagne, I'm dad.I hate seeing this comment. This all comes down to cultural values. In Japan and Asia in general, legacy, skill, accomplishment and honor is held in higher regard than the Western, wishy-washy hippy values of freedom and individual happiness. Jiro secured permanent success for his sons and lineage. Jiro didn't tear his family apart; he ensured it's success and legacy.Here is our epic meat food adventure from this evening. (no skills required)
It contains:


* Triple smoked ham

* Chorizo

* Hot Hungarian salami

* Mild Danish Salami

* Silverside (Last nights dinner)

* Slow cooked chicken

* Bacon

* 2 year + Vintage Cheddar

* Double Brie

* Minced Garlic

* 6 Eggs (Caged, just kidding)

* Cream

* Sun dried Tomatos

* Kalamata Olives


Will edit with more after retrieval from oven.The problem is, this sushi is not even close to Jiro's sushi.
If Jiro's sushi was 95/100, this would be a 2/100. I believe that sushi is one of those foods I will never be able to eat homemade, because the difference is really astronomical.
This picture made me want to puke, and I'm not even being elitist.Fuck pepsi.Yes. Why does it being your SO matter? You're basically arguing for being starry-eyed about things because they were done by a certain person. Oh shit, she's my SO, better chow down this burnt dry chicken.

Even worse for your comment, my SO (supervising officer right? acronyms are so formal) should not be cooking me shit mass quantity style if they can do better.

Maybe I'm just an asshole who thinks that if you do something, do it right. Otherwise do something else. I actually have standards for myself. I wouldn't try a beef wellington capriciously and then get mad when I fuck it up and people don't want to eat it. Can you stop moving the goalposts? He spoke to your statement and satisfied its parameters. Do you not keep track of your own thoughts? Your comment right now has NOTHING to do with the comment you made earlier, much less eulertotientquotient's. No its not. There's no way the "shells" would be recognizable at that point. As far as I know McDonald's fryers have programmed settings for specific items so there's a very small window for error.You're funny. "His effort" like you already know it's shit but you'll go "yay...you tried." Why give muxorious shit about opting out and going elsewhere...Cut by my relative, hunter and notorious carnivorous rawmeat eaterThanks.  Didn't even occur to me I was being trolled, LOL.

I really love going to Asian markets, the fish is always incredibly fresh, and when it comes to produce there are so many exotic fresh ingredients.
 That was my first thought too.OP was sleeping :) Yes they are simple kiddie sushis.Pretty sure it was rice originally.I'm afraid except for Kikkoman and store-brand soy sauce, you don't have much choice in France. Had no time to order through Amazon, but I'll definitely follow your advice !&gt;A lot of sushi critics in this damn sub.

True, but their comments have some validity and particular points being made (which you fail to match or address).

&gt; Not everyone can get sushi made by Jiro.

Now you're being ridiculous and your comment has no validity. Nobody was calling for this.

Sorry, but can we stop making grandstanding comments like yours? This would be a much better place without them.

"I DECLARE, THAT WHAT YOU CALL NOT GREAT, IS GREAT. UPVOTE ME BECAUSE I AM BEING POSITIVE DESPITE NOT OFFERING ANYTHING BEYOND 'BUT I LIKE IT'"

Your comments are even worse off in a subreddit about creation. It's more destructive than anything in the end. the rice quantity is ok, but there's too much fish.Its a Nokia, and it's 2-3 years old only... Homemade, so 70, maybe 80 euros tops.Bah, I don't mind the criticism, they were far from perfect. I was just proud to pull something like that in the small amount of time I had (2-3 hours)LOVE it with salmon. It just makes sense with the whole lox and bagel combination too. But somehow soy sauce + cream cheese = flavor bomb. My god sushi cat would flip Ahhhh, no unagi this time... Don't know what it surf clam, but there were some sushis with scallop.Generally steak tartare would be minced by the chef just prior to serving. It's really delicious... I would really recommend it.You have been light on tomatoes...hey good guess ! Yes, they are magrets and orange ones

http://chezbonnefemme.com/how-to-cook-magret-de-canard/4 kids aged 3 to 6 years old, they loved it, they loved the ones with smoked salmon too.Kiddie ones with processed cheese , ham and ketchup.It is delicious, and you should try cooked pressed cheese like comt, emmental or basque cheese with cherry preserve. Blue cheese go wonderfully with pear.That's a bit like restaurants that put a bottle of ketchup on the table when they serve a nice steak.  Too much too much!The Widow MakerHello there ! I'm OP and I'm impressed at how this blew up overnight ! New to Reddit, I'll try to answer some questions :

1) Yes they're homemade, of course, that explain why the salmon and tuna are a bit screwed up : we made these on a sunday morning in 2-3 hours for a lunch party that suddendly got many more guests than planned. My wife's cousin is a bit of a butcher so the fish cutting are a bit thick, but I'm not surprised. He's a good orthopedic surgeon otherwise. Budget was around 70 euros.

2) Those funny-shaped ones are the the ones for the kids and they loved it ! They're made of rice, ham and cheese slice, with a bit of ketchup. French slices are made of cheese, real cheese, no funny stuff.

3) You have some weird ones that I wanted to try : Duck magret with orange slice, and Comt, walnut and apple. They were delicious, but definitely not traditional. Formal Apologies to Japan Cuisine.

4) The ones at the bottom are tamagoyaki, a japanese layered omelette

5) NO the phone is not a blackberry. It's a Nokia 302. My wife doesn't like touchscreen to write her texts, but as it was faulty, and as she keeps stealing mine to play Candy Crush, she just got a new one a couple of days ago.

EDIT : words (english not ze first language)Yep, you do indeed. It's called beef sashimi.This is a beef sashimi, the name would depend on the type of cow, but it's made to be eaten raw.

Many meats don't need to be cooked if it's served fresh - Poultry is the main concern.I swear there are almost  no natural ingredients. You should be fineIt was progressive.  The bottom layer was lightly fried, almost like an oiled scalloped potato, to a genuine crisp, then topped with the crispiest f'n chip known to man. All topped with carne asada, cheese, and jalapeos.What the fuck do you expect The Ivy?Next seen in r/fps. (fat people stories)I mean, they look delicious.. SmhDibs on the bottom right slice Oh my Jesus, I'm from Texas living in Vegas and I cannot find any! Tell me where please!We were kids who wanted to wander. What interesting reasoning could we possibly have?Looks like the whole cast of Finding Nemo. #fishies Tell me about it, I just came from the gym and i'm hungry... so much for my workout.That stuff looks far from authentic but delicious. BTW, they do bacon sushi in Japan, it looks something like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/Rfw9N.jpg) With nigiri sushi the rice shouldn't be touching the soy sauce, the fish should. aaaaand I'm hungry.Is that cider?I don't know what this is, but i want it!Oh man- almost exactly a year since I left Ubud; this brings it all back!Maybe you should keep your fetishes to yourself from now on...YumWhere!?!?!Like, you really should have actually provided some reasoning for going to PX. What you wrote is basically 50 shades of short.no double tortilla?

2/10 would not eat2.7kg of pork belly and loin cured in salt, sugar, and honey for 7 days. Rinsed and dried and left for 24 hours in refrigerator and then smoked (red gum) on a gas grill for four hours until internal temperature reached 65C.

First attempt at this and it is AMAZING!My two favorite things! Pizza and Satanic rituals!
I think it's mainly related to being consumed entirely - notice the people getting eaten never get masticated or mutilated, they're swallod down whole like some sort of extreme fisting.Hey man looks great, ignore the troll posts. I would eat the hell outta that. Vietnamese guy here btw, looks like one of our dishes that we eat too.Out of interest are you from the UK?

Because as a brit I've never even heard anyone refer to this dish as toad in the hole and I kind of assumed toad in the hole was just a British thing.I'm so glad the McDonald's in my town has competent night-shift staff, since it's one of only 4 or so food places that are open during my work shift.I'm calling [troll](http://tineye.com/search/90d06705fd19f4db52b5f8d3073f94f1f6ed0026/)May the odds ever be in your favor.Seems like Hamburger University needs a continuing education program. If I knew how I would.......have been dead from diabetes. Amazing. I love sushi so much but my girlfriend doesn't like it. The closest place I can get real sushi is an hour away and it's really expensive. I wish I didn't like sushi :(Judging by the cell phone you need to go back to 2008.$0.99/taco...$0.99/lime slice. Fucking cartels, man.Maybe you should come make those at my house :) Isn't disappointment the standard for McD's?I need this in my life.
Yes! It was edible too. Booooooooo!Did you recently start a job as an Administrative Assistant?
http://i.imgur.com/wFCcxqD.jpgLooks good but your missing the pt.The ice cream in florence was the best I had, but I don't remember the name of the shop. Il Santo Bevitore had the best food I ate.Just taking your subtle advice...Your dessert came with a hashtag?I fucking hope you're kidding!!!Too much rice on the nigiriI don't know.... I still think a little more bacon could improve that pizza.Oh I have heard of that but was never inclined to try it. I think you'd want really high quality beef mince when the reality is that store bought beef mince is usually the opposite.
that's a lot of caviar or flying fish eggs or whatever they areThey look as bad at Target's chicken strips.But fried mozzarella sticks are delicious.Why no Yamasa soy sauce?Holy hell. and what is that a Blackberry?You definitely can, though I never have and don't intend to. Steak tartare (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak_tartare) is an example. That being said, I have no clue if this is served raw. I think it may just be plated to show off the marbling. And the amount of warm needed to remove some frost wouldn't be enough to partially thaw food. Florence is an amazing city...Neversympathy upvote c:And the oceans were scraped clean for all this sushiOur life goal is to own and operate our own microbrewery.  Problem is that we lack the funds.

It's expensive in Allegheny County to start.This picture gives me so much anxiety.... Im so jealous. There are many kinds of tofu. That's like trying one beer and saying you don't like beer. This stuff is from CostCo and I imagine it would be good for people that aren't really into tofu. It's very creamy. I want that shit in and all around my mouth!They don't stop working, silly. Periodically, warm air is blown through them to thaw and evaporate the frost that accumulates. This warm air also partially thaws the product in the freezer. That product then refreezes. Haven't you ever bought an item, like ice cream, that showed signs of this process?I know the green squeeze bottle! It's Daifu - that's fermented tuna roe paste. So delicious. Lived in Sendai for 4 years and oh man...miss that soo much!Hell's yeah! That's how its done man. Good looking pics too. 10/10 would grub!OH. MY. GLOB.all that rice would feed whole africa for a yearCucumber isn't pickled. Just carrots and radish. Try marinating the pork in fish sauce, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and sugar instead of cooking it low and slow. And either broil or grill over flames. Do Americans really eat this for breakfast?In Mexico, there's a [restaurant](http://www.sushifactory.mx) that serves all kind of weird sushi. Even one with bacon or you can switch the fish for cooked beef or chicken. So in Mexico some eat that kind of sushi.I don't think so.  If you look closely under the screen they have a circle pad and not a trackpad/ball.  That's amazing! I'm only going to one at a time, why do I need a chain?
as if they would ever pay one of their cooks $12/hr.I need this.There was a post of a guy that would try peanut butter or some other ingredient with anything requested on the comments. He would rate the requested food alone and with the ingredient and rate it like that: 9/10 How the hell did you know? Thanks for making me aware of this awesome subreddit!

Constant thawing refreezing will make food go bad. And also no store freezers do that. If a store's freezers stop working they have to throw everything out. I don't even eat Mozza sticks anymore. Something so delicious shouldn't be so expensive, and it shouldn't come in such little portions.You are an idioth for expecting anything better.Wow. OP, where are you from?
I was about to leave the same comment. Hahah. Every brand was always the same name. Even though the shapes are strange and the sushi techniques aren't there, it looks like some fun dishes for party. It's an interesting mix between Japanese food culture with other culture. As long as the family and the children in the party love the food and have a great time, it's good sushi from my perspective. bravely ran away awayTry pressing between two cutting boards wrapped in plastic. The way it's served makes me think that's the case, but surely you can't eat beef raw...?Definitely looking forward to the chana masala, palak paneer and veg korma.  If you know a good recipe for muttar paneer, would love to see it.don't personally like large orders like that. Fish is sitting around too long and i doubt the sushi guy loved every roll/nigiri/sashimi.Man I would fucking wreck that platter! Damn that shit makes me drool looking at it.Fill them up with the sauce.I spent 2 weeks in Bali back in July, and ate this pretty much daily. For a first attempt it came out pretty good!The person cooking them should notice. The fryer oil sound like it's going to explode when the cheese starts to come out. But then again, you're at MacdonaldsI've seen this joke a few times tonight but haven't been on enough lately to get the reference. Can you enlighten me?Very, very welcome. Check my post history for lots more recipes :-D Can i get a list of what's in those beauties?A) Thanks for the gold!!

B) Hoping to cover butter chicken, dal makhani, chana masala, palak paneer, vegetable korma, and tarka dal in the near future, alongside a couple of varieties of parathas. Missing anything you'd like to see? :-) **I ENVY YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW**Oh-ho-ho-ho. I would never fall for those, McDonald's. After that fucking nasty "pizza" you and Burger King tried to come out with in the early 90s, I know better than to trust you to do anything remotely like this.Seared mackrel with cilantro/green onion/soy/Chile dressing,
bok choy saute,
and vegetable stir fry (lotus root, shitake mushroom, maitake mushroom, snow peas, carrot, mung bean sprout, green onion, chopped coriander leaf)  garnished with fresh alfalfa sprouts.

I LOVE the fish market at my local Asian mart! The mackrel was incredibly fresh!That's the most brilliant idea I've heard all week.Did you take these photos with an HTC one phone?

Are you taking requests?Save some for me, where ever you are im coming to get someIf it is frozen once, and only thawed for preparation to eat, then yes. However, the frozen food cases in the supermarkets go through periodic defrost cycles.

Ever met a government employee?I saw many recipes calling for you to carve the steak before serving. I did find it very counterintuitive to carve it up like that haha. Each to their own I suppose. This is not a thing in America AT ALL as far as I know. Yes! It tastes like tofu. RECIPE THE FUCK OUT OF ME!

My wife would go insane if I made these for her :-)

Unless of course you just got them out of a box...i can't even tell what's going on in this picture...

and i hope to god you didn't slice a porterhouse into little strips.  you keep that shit whole and cut off bites...The appeal to me is that its a nice mild slightly fishy taste. Its sort of chewy, but its like kids with roast beef, you can't chew it too much or it become very unappealing.
To each their own though. It's not like taste is anyone's choice.Recipe?It smells like that while frozen. Also I always heard frozen is best because it preserves the freshness. It came free with the fill up!They are great. You can get them at Costco in Australia. Definitely an occasional treat though.Why, thankyou very much!Hahahaha, they are so so so misled!

I will get the first post for this series done in a week, stay tuned.Dude.Whats the recipe?  Fuck yea, tacos! S'morffins   ? something is fishy with this post...Thank you for not calling it a grilled cheese! Probably by putting everything in the title between two pieces of buttered bread and heating until cheese meltsR.I.P. your toiletYou didn't know? Cheese is extra!S'mores muffins sound so amazing right now..Scones are buttery but sweet. Biscuits are salty.Fantastic stuff!  I've been brewing since I was 18.  My best friend and I have gotten fairly good.  Him more so than me.  He did win 2 first place medals in the annual Pittsburgh beer competition this year.  We are shooting for a National placement this year.&gt;What's that sudden sushi mania from half a decade?

I don't quite understand what you're trying to say here but there doesn't seem to be that much of a surge in sushi related content i'm not seeing the hype.

All i see is someone has posted something tasty and a lot of people being snobbish because the rice/meat ratio isn't to their liking or they think sushi is overrated, this isn't /r/foodporn it's /r/foodBetter eat that quick...Is that a Mayan artifact at the top left of the table?I don't believe it does, just highlighting that it's not "generic ordered food" and that his comment was unwarranted, but all types of food are acceptable i believe.There's lots better than Togos.Might be for a child seeing as the sushi are in shapes. My son loves sushi but he doesn't like the seaweed or certain fillings.Yessssss!honestly this "sushi" looks disgusting. i'd probably still eat it tho bc its like pizza. even when its bad its goodINDONESIAN FOODAs an avid beer enjoyer, I would be pleased with this trade!think of it like duck breast prosciutto.Oh my gawd.. I just ate but you made me so hungryI actually do care how my meat is prepared. Maybe I'm being a pretentious ass, but I like knowing if my fish is going to be pan roasted or braised in sauce, but then again I can be shallow and pedantic. In Merica we call that an appetizer. I want your job OP! Had grade 10 wagyu beef last night in New Zealand.Hirozen or Sushi Gen are the best in LA. Looks like cheap sushi.That sounds amazingly delicious! I'm so trying this recipe, thanks OP! BTW, did you ever try feta cheese with the spinach? I make puff pastries with that combo and the they really complement each other. freezing and thawing is what creates the fishy smell....buy fresh.Nope. Tender cuts of meat aren't meant to be sous vide either.  Maybe its more that part of being a "food snob" is being a pretentious douche, acting like you're better than the food in question, while not providing real criticism. Not to say that you'd be wrong when criticizing McDonald's. Pretty sure a mcdouble+junior chicken+mcfish(or w.e its called, i forgot) is actually a "land, air and sea burger"OP wdgidamn travestyIf only you lived in Pittsburgh.  I'd bring some Penn Brewery beers and we could feast!

Penn Gold goes best with pork.I would kill for some tomago right now...I see grilled meat in this picture.

I approve of this picture.Eww, lol. Sand is one thing what I was wondering about. I had some gritty mussels before. Can't they be cleaned?The way that fish is cut is unappetizing How about sticking with the standard hamburgers, fries, shake, apple pies (maybe nuggets) and dont try any of the other freaky stuff. You better have made enough to share!Looks like kobe/wagyu beef. Its a kinda beef almost only available in japan of what i heardI... Just... Can't... Even....Probably no other fast food places! At least not where I live I work at a Mc'D. You should of gone back and asked for new ones. Also people, soon there will be some new fish burgers and shrips are making a comeback. But you didn't get that from me.Sure, I have leftovers :DI used to say, "the best mexican joints are the ones with graffiti on the tables and a beat up sign" then I heard anthony bordain explain why much better, "if they are going to have poorp presentation,  they better have good food. Or, they'd be out of business.
Doesn't seem to work with asian food though, or anything other than mexican from my personal experience! One anecdote does not even make anecdata. Much less real statistical data.Yeah many answers!I actually like this.  Where else can you get a "some what " healthy turkey sandwich?WHERE IS THE UNI Thank you for these constructive, insightful comments! I will definitely take them into consideration! Yes, you eat the entire animal (except the shell of course).  I know that older cookbooks talk about keeping live clams in the fridge in water and feeding them cornmeal for a day or so to clean out their digestive tract of any sand.  I certainly have never done that; I buy clams/oysters/mussells from my fish monger and I eat them, and I don't recall finding any objectionable amount of sand or grit.

So yes, when you eat bivalves you're probably also eating bivalve poop.I need dis.Why did they bring out 5 plates and 5 sets of chop sticks when there is only enough food and elbow room for two people?Amazing meat.NAO.jpg&gt; It's tasty food especially when it's done right what's there not to like?

Thousands of other dishes are tasty when done right.

What's that sudden sushi mania from half a decade?Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa WHOA god damnit!   You didn't invent homemade snickers? Yes ;)Huh.  Never really understood the appeal of surf clam.  It looks cool, to be sure, but it just kinda tastes...chewy.

Eel's the shit though.Well you are on /r/food. Of course people are going to have opinions about the food.

I'm guessing this is from one of dem foreign countries Can I have some?  Please?This is lovely effort on someone's part. Sushi is delicious, and I think it's awesome how people are getting to experience other cultural foods (40 short years ago this was not the case). However,  I'm disappointed that none of the top comments are addressing the amount of food (fish) here and the very real and growing threat of overfishing.
The Earth's population has continued to grow, and therefore more mouths to feed. We need to feed these mouths sustainably.I know, I was highly disappointed that there were no recipes. They look yummy anyway.Wow. Not a recipe in sight. That's a damn shameI can't eat at Freebirds much anymore because guacamole plays a big game in my burritos and theirs is shitty, pre-made guacamole now.

At least at the ones near me.I agree - calamari is very good.  I'm not used to seeing it on the menu at sushi restaurants. nope.jpgwhat kind of meat is it?
I hate to sound snobby, but this looks pretty weak. Maybe you should come to LA and get some top notch sushi. It is the best in the country and it isn't close.White Castle/Krystal (name depends on your region) serves mozzarella sticks that are far superior. Always perfectly shaped, always hot, well seasoned and always super stringy!I could go to basically anywhere in LA and get better sushi than 99.9% of the US and certainly far better than that weak looking spread. The best place I have been to in the United States is Katsuya in Encino. All the other locations are sub par besides the Studio City one so you can't just go to one of their other LA locations by the same name because they are not the same. No place compares. Probably have to go to Japan to get better sushi.If you truly believe and you're heart is pure,

Anything can happen!!awsome but a downvote for the use of quinoa. or exist at all.I hope they gave you cab fare. Ambulances are expensive.I'm surprised they don't have any episodes of The Big Gulp with Griffin McElroy./r/shittyfoodporn Well done! I love that breakfast. The key is lots of butter.11 hours later, OP hasn't responded.

OP is in a food coma. RIP IN PIECEquantity over quality.Do the rules even say it has to be home made?That's just someone's lame blog. Don't spam it here.
Aside from like, nearly every restaurant in the United States? I don't personally believe that all adult males need 2,500 calories a day but if they're getting an 800 calorie burrito I don't see what the issue is. Chipotle is known for making huge burritos. Its their thing. You can save the rest for later, which I often see my friends do. The calorie counts of most meals at most restaurants are pretty appalling. I never assumed that Chipotle was a low calorie option if you plan to eat the whole meal in one sitting and I don't understand why anyone else did either. Where are you? I want to come over. :)Exactly.What all-you-can-eat place puts that much out at once? What if you eat like 1 and can't finish the rest?Complains about "Americanized sushi"

Posts pictures of cream cheese rolls topped with tempura and eel sauce.You got robbed.By that logic, you didn't come up with pro-GMO talking points yourself. They were fed to you by Monsanto in order to make you support their business. I guess nobody thinks for themselves.

But seriously man, come back when you learn to provide an argument without making it into a conspiracy. Actually I wasn't implying that you should try cilantro. If you don't like it then please don't force it. I was saying that the dislike comes from the smell, and if you hold your nose you wouldn't dislike it. But that's no way to eat guacamole at a party.Springfield, USA. Enchiladas:
 I took pulled pork which I had previously made in a slow cooker using roughly this recipe: http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/139603/slow-cooker-carnitas/
I used roughly 1lb of pulled pork.
1 small onion, diced
I small can of whole chiles, diced.
1/4 cup taco season, I buy in bulk. You could always use one packet.
2/3 cups water.
1 can enchilada sauce
Tortillas. I used a smaller size.
Mexican cheese to taste, I used a hand full.

Cook onions in a sauce pan on medium until almost translucent. Add pork &amp;amp; chilies, cook until heated. Add taco season and hot water. Cook for roughly 5 minutes on medium.
In a oiled or lined 9x9 fill 4 shells up and wrap them up and fill the pan. Cover with enchilada sauce, too with cheese and cover with foil. In a preheated 325 degree oven cook for 25 minutes.

Cilantro lime rice:
In the mean time cook 2 cups rice. I used my rice cooker.
3 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 bunch chopped cilantro
3/4 lime
Salt to taste
After rice is cooked mix all together.

http://i.imgur.com/rDAJmX1.jpgGreat grilled cheese!&gt; We're complaining that Chipotle doesn't skimp us? Really?

I don't understand what you're not understanding.  Giving every customer 30-60% more than what a reasonable standard serving is *for an adult male* is definitely a strange situation you don't see anywhere else(or, you know, you can try to prove me wrong and give me some examples).I enjoy using it for injecting or marinating meats. MSG is a great way to highlight the flavor of protein heavy foods. I have learned to be careful with how much I add though, not because I think it is bad, I just don't want to be able to taste the MSG. You don't have to. I just like that I can get a meal with lots of stuff inexpensively. You don't HAVE to eat all of what you order at a restaurant. It's up to you to determine when you've had enough. We're complaining that Chipotle doesn't skimp us? Really?That seems like a bold commitment. I love those!I need this right now!&gt; Not necessarily. I get the kid's taco kit

You serious?  I know it's not a big deal, but I shouldn't have to order from the kids menu to get a normal serving.Oh really? Where abouts do you live?That, sir, looks delicious. Come to Reno it's always all you can eat and usually about 20$ and it's good tooShare? dude it's a single order of mozzarella sticks at a single mcdonaldsBucaramanga, so a bit of a bus ride for you,  but if you're travelling Colombia its definitely worth a look, nice city, friendly people, great foodAhhhhhh I see. Well we certainly didn't eat off the cutting board. This chicken was sliced and added to pasta and red sauce. is that b/c its not glowing with radiation from Fukishima?

Not on the sushi :) I love me some Salt and Pepper CalamariMy sides, the euphoria is intensifying. wooden plank alertLooks awesome, I want to make this one day. Thank you so much. I've been really wanting to make a foray into Indian cuisine, and all the thought you put into this is amazing. The budgeting, especially: usually that's something that ends with me running around the local Asian market, convinced I'm forgetting at least four or five items (which, of course, I always am).Actually was at 212. Livingsocial had a deal :)Oh, wow.  That's too cool.  Never seen one before, would make my Mr. Chicken Pot Pie guy very happy.  Thanks for sharing.Calamari on sushi?   Where do you live? Not seeing a lot of sushi. There's evidence of 'gasm all over the plate though. Looks like porn to me....*foams at mouth*that looks delicious and expensiveUuuuhmm.. Wasn't even aware that there is more than one?Beef and beer.Had them in New Zealand. Mexican-Korean fusion, had me raise my eyebrows at first but it smelled great. Not his fault. His dad is just so damn good he made a brand of himself, and inevitably as his son he's gonna be compared to his father. It's like if his dad made Coke and he made a cola that's even better than Coke, people are still going to look at Coke as the standard because that's *the* cola. People are used to what's familiar, and if they've gone their whole life thinking Jiro's sushi is incredible because of the reputation, tried it out once and thought it deserved that reputation, they are going to pass along the message that he's hands down the best. They likely won't compare his son's sushi to his because it's not worthy of asking the question in their minds. It's a sort of self fulfilling prophecy. It is really great when people still think that McDonalds does something stupid like add sugar to salad. Its --the dressing-- that has the sugar in it not the actual lettuce my god. They even team up with "healthier" brands like newman's own but most dressing in general is going to be pretty unhealthy this isn't unique to mcdonalds in any way.

"The buns have sugar" um yeah they do so what? What do you think goes on there? You think they sit around adding more just to be dicks? A large majority of American white bread has way too much salt and sugar in it as a standard, mcdonalds didn't invent that they just sell white bread.


OPs situation sucks because I bet you anything that the person who cooked that was either really new and didn't pull it fast enough or they didn't have enough people in the grill area and nobody had a free hand right away to grab it.Many thanksBacon garlic onions chopped green olives eggs topped with Parmesan and basil :)OP just threw shit on top of rice and called it sushi. I'm no snob but this is honestly the worst looking spread I have ever seen. The fact that this is so upvoted shows this sub only cares about photography quality.

Rice is beyond overcooked. Completely mushy with no grains.

Everything is like 75% rice. No seasoning so it's basically just bland and filling.

Some of the fish cuts have so much tendon that you will be forced to spit it out. I only say this because he just randomly cut up a bunch of fish and puts it out like sashimi.

Those flavor combinations... plain boiled shrimp on plain rice, tuna and mayo, smoked meat and orange over rice

Tamago is burnt. Even with too much sugar or soy sauce it would not be that color unless excessive overcooking.Here's the [source](http://www.deviantart.com/art/Czech-potato-soup-340489401).When you write something as simple as a reddit comment it should have proper syntax "...go back at flipping burgers..."

But yeah I say who cares yum! Moar wasabiiiiiiAhh that ever so great taste of imitation crab meat stuffed in sushi rolls!!! Gotta love it!I heard recently about a whole cult following that Negroni has. What is your experience with this drink?I did not know Alabama had food this good!No one really knows, it's the Great Australian Mystery.Neat.Thank you! Recipe and instructions please.Thank you. My SO and I are going out to sushi after I showed him this. Saved me from cooking! This is NOT one of the promo photos lol. A photographer took those. This is just part of the set up.You better start eating fast before it goes bad!Simple, elegant, and it looks delicious. I will be making this.

I've had them *with* the mozzarella (again, curiosity). I imagine our experiences were close. The skin inside my mouth peeled off just from opening those pictures.I'm guessing it's for their 3-4 year old. The rest of the spread looks good enough to trust these people not to serve slices of lunch meat on rice to their adult counterparts. This looks spectacular.  Very jealous!Because there's all this weird shit that no normal Japanese person would put on sushi.It's probably for a very small child. Sushi is my favorite food on earth and this hurts my soul to look at but not be able to eat.

RIP my soul 2/20/2015How many people would it take to eat all that? This makes me sad. My wife never buys enough sushi. I always have to subtly contort my schedule to be the one that buys it because I don't want to hurt her feelings after the initial effort of going to get it, nor do I want to have to sneak in some extra snacks after tea.I haven't eaten sardines in years and this post has craving them. Cool idea.I want this... IN AND AROUND MY MOUTH!Disappointment?I'll take two What about the dirty cups in the background? You need to crop those out.Tips for carrots:  (1) Loose, preferably sandy soil.  (2) Don't use a lot of nitrogen. (3) You need to plant the seeds in rows and thin the seedlings to at least an inch apart.  (4) Make sure there are no stones or other impeding objects in the soil. All those little forks in the taproot (the carrot) were probably caused by some kind of little pebbles or bits of wood or something.

That should solve your carrot woes.This is part of an eight piece block set (plus six stamped steak knives) that I got a little more than two years ago. With average maintenance and care I've had no problems. They're certainly not a set of Wusthof knives but they suit me just fine and I've been using them daily!No, they still will be incompetent. Just paid more. Being in L.A., I'm underwhelmed. I opened this, and had a physical reaction. Like if I had just seen a wonderful friend I had lost. Breathed heavier for a second.

I need more sushi in my life. My college town doesn't have a sushi place though. :(Cow pie?
EDIT: I seriously don't know what's in there.  Is it a joke about cow pies?I look at this and all I can think is *iodine poisoning*.[Me right now.](http://i.imgur.com/AwkiJGL.jpg)Then why load them with ketchup? Let them taters shine. I will take the tray in the middle.  Please and Thank you.Man I hate those fucking plates. They chip and break so easily and if you ever put them in the microwave and try to pull them out with your bare hands you will burn yourself because they get hotter than the surface of the god damn sun. I replaced mine with some corelle and could not be happier. That said, the squarish mugs that come in the same set as those plates are pretty awesome.

That looks like great spaghetti!Thanks! I'd love to see photos of yours!Reminds me of that game Sushi Cat. I think I just wet myself. This is homemade sushi in mass quantity, if your SO put this in front of you instead of telling you to make your own dinner, would you still complain about too much rice?Also, see the end note "just to clarify...." (Sorry, my phone won't copy and paste right now).

Wynn and 212 are not the only restaraurants that sell Kobe beef. They're the only ones with certification.  Also, look through the pages [here](http://www.kobe-niku.jp/en/contents/exported/index.php). Why would the UShave different importers?Looks awesome!I'll take all of it.

Including the wasabi. Love me some spicy.lol salsa sauce? so sauce sauce? Then, and only then can you move on to rice.It really doesn't need to be perfect if you just want it to taste good. It just needs to not fall apart when soy sauce touches itThis is how you enjoy the overfishing of the oceans.Needs ketchup!This reminds me of the first time I went out for sushi, on a date. I thought a "roll" meant one piece. So the waiter comes over and I order this roll, this roll, this roll, this roll, this roll......

Needless to say, the order turned out looking something like this. Asked my BF, "Why didn't you correct me?!" and he said, "I thought you were hungry!" Quite the gentleman. [And here it is all ready for dinner!](http://imgur.com/230Se6Z)

Please excuse the filters.I would if I knew where to go?!Looks great will definitely try to make someday.  You didn't come up with anti-GMO talking points yourself. They were fed to you by environmentalists in order to make you support higher food prices for vulnerable populations.

Mutagenesis is an entirely uncontrolled process that cannot ever approach the level of safety and reliability of intentionally changing a single gene.I've seen this somewhere!!! Throw it in the oven for me...thanksIs group sex included?  Dogs aren't my thing though...

You guys are awesome and have made me laugh on a day when I really needed it. Thanks :-)

I will make lemon meringue pie for dessertI find myself saying "Violet, you're turning Violet, Violet" way too much. I probably wouldn't have caught it otherwise :) have a great weekend!No metal on Teflon at all! This is your mother!......speaking through me. That beef is overcooked.  That is a hard medium.  Professionally, I would call that medium well.

Any beef of such high quality should be heated just to the point that the fat begins to melt.  No more.  High heat for a hard sear, and it's done.

https://www.finedininglovers.com/blog/food-drinks/how-to-cook-wagyu/Why? That's good to hear.  Congrats to 212 for their hard work.

The biggest problem is the marketing.  So many people have no understanding about the differences between "Kobe-style", Wagyu, and genuine Kobe.  A lot of restaurants depend and rely on that misunderstanding.

Chances are that OP had Australian or American Wagyu A5.  It's possible that it was even Japanese Wagyu A5.  Unless it was at the Wynn or 212, it wasn't real Kobe.  Besides, that pic.  That beef is grossly and criminally overcooked for even Wagyu. Hahahahah
Amazing.It's pretty good for hot chocolate mix. I mean, it says rich chocolate but you don't expect it to actually taste richer. This one does somewhat. Even made with water it has a milky taste.

It may depend on where you are. I tried looking on the website for the ingredients but it says that ingredients may vary by location, so I guess possibly it's different in different countries? Group date it is - what are we having for dessert? The only sushi I ever had was store-bought at an Italian supermarket.I need friends like theseNo problem :)Wow.

Did you and your seven friends eat well or what?Yeah curse this individual how dare they post food on our subreddit about food!

It does seem to be homemade though.Or they're all just addicted to Rotten Ronny's roadkill slop.  I don't think there's a single thing on their menu that doesn't have some sort of addictive property.  Even the plain old buns are made with added sugar.

IIRC, the only thing is unsalted fries.  They put shit like "regular bun" and "salad blend" in their ingredients list.  Well wtf is in the salad blend guys?  Did you mention all that sugar?

Edit:  Oh LOOK!  The PR department stepped in.  Don't listen to me everyone, I didn't work at McD's corporate for almost a decade or anything.  Just read the infomercial below and all your worries will be washed away!

Edit:  Don't eat at McDonald's, kids!Shit, I sent that?I was over at accent a few summers ago! Gusta pizza was awesome!&gt;Am I the only one who finds Sushi such an overrated and overpopular hypster food?
Yes, probably.

It's tasty food especially when it's done right what's there not to like?

Granted you will have to define "overrated" and "overpopular", it could use more.


&gt; hypster food

It's not a kale salad, also i think you mean. "hipster"http://youtu.be/dO2uAKwhB0QI want to eat it allKikkoman isn't brewed?  I thought it was..now I'm going to have to look into it.  I thought it was the cheapest soy sauce, like the ones American Chinese places give out.

I haven't tried that brand before, but usually the deep forest mushroom sauce types are called something else.  Not sure what you'd call it in English.  I'm first generation Taiwanese, and my wife is Chinese, and Taiwanese and Chinese people have different sauces as well (ie., Soy paste vs. "light?" soy sauce? Chinese people have different soy sauces for cooking (old soy or regular), or dipping/putting in soups ("light" soy sauce).

I love soy sauce too ^^And while you're at it, Can you tell people in San Diego that french fries in a burrito is not real Mexican food. San Diego thinks they have the best Mexican food in the country and all they talk about is Carne Asada French fires and California (San Diego style) Burritos. Oh, the first time I clicked the link only the first photo loaded!

I'll stop now.I've never really been disappointed by McDonalds, personally. But if I ordered a bunch of McNuggets and got empty shells, I'd be disappointed too. I want to go to there.Bacon, scrambled eggs, and onions topped with Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper?Too much tunaMy guess is cheese on top, jam and a lot of rice. Made for people not really into raw fish.Oh the album outlines a vague recipe, but at the end I linked a more exact recipe!The corn of today is obviously different form the corn thousands of years ago. I'm not sure how you thought that I was under a different impression. The changes from generation to generation however, are minor and can't reasonably be tested. GMO modification is obvious with major phenotypic changes.

Although GMO's do appear to be safe for human consumption, many independent studies have shown concern for environmental effects of GMO.

Ultimately the dramatic change in phenotype can't reasonably be compared to the slow changes involved in conventional breeding and should be held to a higher standard.  No, I only make this when I have a surplus of fruit. Say like when we pick fruit and we have to use it up, or bruised apple and stuff that you have to cut out bad spots. Also when fruit is on its way out and I have too much to eat in a day or two. He's a nice guy. But.............he could have cooked it better.  He a super nice guyThat might not be enough sushi for meI would need 2 days off work if I ate all that.. was this made in restaurant or at home? Either way looks delicious.that's like 50k caloriesThat has got to be at least $50 worth of sushi. What restaurant did you purchase it from? What was this platter called?
Ohhh now I get what you meant before. SorryLooks freaking delish!It's quite common when people are losing an argument, to resort to the "you been manipulated!" accusation. All it shows is a lack of reason to support the argument.

And mutagenesis by the way, isn't controlled to add specific genes, and usually results in minor mutations that can't be reasonably tested. That chart is oversimplified to create a false equivalency. Thanks! I'll check it out!This looks very delicious.

Granted, though it *probably* isn't Kobe beef, it is available in NY.

Edit: sentence structure/missed wordsMmmmmm, looks wonderful! Thank you for sharing!From what I understand, it should be cooked very hot and a bit longer than an average cut of beef, in order to liquify as much of the fat as possible. I have never had it myself. It was a pun joke, instead of using "play" I used "plate", but I understand the confusion as it was poorly stated.
Edit: Used play twiceOne piglett on rye, no rabbit food, chili sauce hold the mustard and Mayo.Anybody have any sushi recommendations for someone who likes shrimp and crab? I usually get california rolls, dragon/super dragon rolls, and vegas rolls so I'm looking for some others. My god, that looks delicious!!!!That restaurant is pretty packed most of the time and EVERYBODY goes there to eat the sushi boats. So they run of of them pretty fast, so they have to resort to using the plates instead. We actually weather once with 6 people total and everyone ordered a boat. This was during the places slow hours, but they served the sushi on the plates because 6 boats could not fit on one table :( Bt me and my friends vowed to go back one day and see how many boats they would let us order :)Yum.Woof. Put an NSFW warning on your pornography. Hot damn....Why?Ayyyy, we're making sushi tomorrow. I get a hard on for sushi and this looks amazingly delicious. Nice job!The breast of a specific breed of Duck(Moulard) raised on the foie gras plan(gravage).

I went to Woow once and asked them if their sushi was nigiri the asian girl looked at me like wtf is a nigiri. Come on people you work in a sushi place.This reminds me of Pokemon Stadium.My friends and I used to call these "burgickens"If you like Italian food, [Anton's](http://www.antonspastabar.com/) is amazing! HUGE servings and GREAT flavour! It's a really small restaurant though. I would suggest going fairly early or later on as a line to get in forms during peak dining times.Yeah, 95% looks good. The other 5%... I'd try.  Ham and processed cheese on rice seems weird, but why not, I guess. This looks like it was cobbled together from the spread of a buffet. It only looks impressive because of the amount of different pieces offered. Son makes the sushi.

Dad takes the credit.

**FUCK JIRO**. Agreed. They look delish :-)Cream cheese in sushi is bomb.  A restaurant in my town serves the "Fusion Roll".

Tempura shrimp and cream cheese, topped with strawberry and kiwi (and some savory sauce maybe? Can't remember).

Anyway.  Super good!Weird, i react similar to leather.
Everytime i wake up in bed and still have my shoes on, i immediately throw up and get a headache.McDonald's used to have mozzarella sticks on their menu ~8+ years ago - they were always my favorite item and I remember being really disappointed when they didn't have them anymore. I tried them when they came back and... they were pretty awful, maybe they just don't make them like they used to. Also, back then they were on the dollar menu at 4 for $1.Thats a lot of shushi samwichesIntelligence is knowing this distinction.

When you make something as simple as a small lump of rice covered by a slice of raw fish, it has to be done to a certain standard.   If this was made by OP, I give him or her thumbs up for the effort.  If this comes from a shop, someone needs to go back at flipping burgers.(O_O)


OmnomnomnomnomI mean with all due respect, that's **your** opinion. Its like saying someone put too much cheese on a pizza.Relevant username.When the restaurant runs out of the "boats" they serve the sushi on the plates instead :(  Oh so bad for the diet...Agreed. Its hilarious how much rice there is on the salmon. So, are you accepting drop-in guests to help you with your cephalopod problem? If yes, i'll need your address too... For uh.... Delicious reasons.

Not remotely necessary. Please see recipe posted above :)Make her squirm and... Be vocal, with your tongue instead.OP Please send invites next time you are getting sushi. Also where's the Calamari!? Always love a good calamariTo be honest I didn't follow a hard and fast recipe. I looked at a few and used what I had but here it is more or less:

- 1.5 onions chopped
- 5-6 cloves minced garlic
- thumb sized piece fresh ginger, minced
- ground coriander
- garam masala
- chili powder
- cinnamon
- 9 or 10 curry leaves
- fresh ground black pepper
- kosher salt
- turmeric
- curry powder
- can of tomato paste
- can of beef stock
- grapeseed oil
- about 1.5kg of stewing beef
- water
- white vinegar

1- Heat oil in cast iron Dutch oven. Add onions and cook until semi soft.

2- combine spices (to taste) in small bowl. Add a couple tablespoons of vinegar and a little water in order to make a paste. Stir paste into onions and cook for a few minutes.

3- Add beef, ginger and garlic. Stir/cook until beef takes on the spice paste and starts to brown.

4- Stir in tomato paste. After a couple minutes stir in beef stock.

5- Turn to lowest setting and simmer for a couple of hours. Beef should be fork tender and you should have a rich, brown sauce.

I think that's about it. Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear :)


Edit- I can't believe I forgot one of my favorite spices- cumin! I used both ground and while in this dish. chef protip:

After you dip your petit chute in your colorful saucez, swirl in in a circular motion several times to evenly distribute the coating and break the tail clean.No, it doesn't, it looks like prepacked bread from walmart.

This is how tasty bread looks like, to me atleast:

I don't eat McDonald's ever so I don't know what their name for it is, but you take a double bacon cheese burger from McDonald's and then head over to KFC. Get a Double Down (the burger that is just two pieces of chicken, bacon, cheese, and ranch, I think) and a medium gravy. Put your Double Down in between the patties of the double cheese/bacon burger and dip in KFC gravy.

I would be impressed if it was edible.LifeProTip: to make shrimp sushi, ebi, stick a toothpick or bbq skewer into the shrimp (parallel to the shrimp's vein) before boiling.  This will keep he shrimp straight and prevent the curling seen in the picture.  After boiling, remove the stick, and cut the underside of the shrimp so it will lay flat. Now that is a thing of absolute beauty. I hope you guys consumed it quickly though because that is an expensive spread and I see no way of keeping it cold. We used to do this for our gaming group and found that it lasted most of the night if you used either the board or a cookie sheet covered in crushed ice and lay the sushi on that.

Man now I have to go find some sushi...Is this.....is this heaven?Dear God yes.  One of the top five reasons I moved to Las Vegas.  Carnitas.I bet your cost was $5?

(Or tree fiddy?)My husband made this for me for my birthday. The slice of the steak is a bit rough, as I was more focused on eating it.

He used this recipe for [Sexy Surf and Turf](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/sexy-surf-and-turfseared-scallops-and-tenderloin-steaks-with-manhattan-sauce-recipe.html). The Manhattan sauce on the steaks was really a nice touch.No we're talking about sushiAm I the only one who finds Sushi such an overrated and overpopular hypster food?

I don't mean it is bad per se, I enjoy it from time to time, but it seems to have more popularity than it deserves.This is basically the sushi cheerleader effect (no offense OP)...Try cream cheese with Jalapeno jelly. I've only had it on crackers, but rice would doubtless be good, too.I agree. There are large chunks of cucumber and avocado sticking out of some pieces. I'm getting nauseous the more I analyze this picture...&gt;[That's not my hand.](http://ladysproblems.com/wp-content/uploads/gay_a_gay_musical_dvd.jpg)I want to go to there!Hey there - if you're going to get freaky with sushi, you need to commit to decent soy sauce - that kikkoman, or whatever derivative will kill all of your hardwork. I lived in Japan for a couple years, have Japanese relatives, blah blah. The only halfway decent-in-grocery-stores-soy-sauce is Ohsawa Organic Nama Shoyu Unpasteurized Soy Sauce. The stuff is available at Whole Foods (I haven't found it anywhere else), and anything comparable costs insane amounts of money, and must be purchased through Amazon. This stuff includes no artificial fermentation agents, but Harold McGee sums it up best in saying
&gt;Nowadays, defatted soy meal, the residue of soybean oil production, is broken downhydrolyzedinto amino acids and sugars with concentrated hydrochloric acid. This caustic mixture is then neutralized with alkaline sodium carbonate, and flavored and colored with corn syrup, caramel, water, and salt.

But don't take my word for it, here's some random person's review of the stuff:
http://www.thenourishinggourmet.com/2009/03/soy-sauce-what-to-avoid-what-to-buy.html

Seriously, this has that wonderful deep forest mushroom taste; it will blow your mind.

TL;DR - I have very strong opinions about soy sauce.what for? wishing didn't do any good for the tuna involvedwill definitely try, thank you!What the hell is salsa sauce and why is it being put on mozz sticksMoved from California a year ago and I this is about the only thing I miss.  Looks delicious. I'm only going to judge the salmon since that's all I'm really qualified to judge... but it doesn't look that great. I don't care about rice ratios or any of that, the fish itself doesn't look to be of particularly good quality, especially for sushi. I would still eat it, but I wouldn't go back to that place again. Salmon sushi should look something like this https://everystockphoto.s3.amazonaws.com/food_sushi_salmon_327554_o.jpgHow to make your own Courtesan au Chocolat from Grand Budapest Hotel.

1. Start with three sizes of cream puff shells.
2.  Fill each shell with rich chocolate pastry cream like Agatha would or your own favorite flavors

We prefer Chocolate, raspberry and vanilla.  Yum!

3.  Dip tops in colored glaze and let them set up.

4.  Pipe filigree using white chocolate or vanilla butter cream.

5.  Assemble using colored butter cream, top with a candied almond and add your own special touches!

Every love story should have its own signature dessert but if you dont have one then you should borrow Agatha and Zeros!  Good luck at the Oscars!


Cream Puff Shells
Measure:
1 cup AP flour
1/8 tsp salt
1 TBSP sugar
Put in a Pot:
1 cup Milk
1/3 cup unsalted butter
Crack into a measuring cup:
4 large eggs(room temperature)

 Get out your wooden spoon!  Heat milk and butter in large sauce pot till butter melts and the mixture boils.  Dump in all dry ingredients and stir vigorously with pot still over the heat.  Keep stirring until mixture forms a so;id lump and no longer clings to your spoon.  Remove from heat and wait 2 minutes.  Add eggs one at a time and beat well until incorporated after each addition.  Dough should stand erect on end of spoon when scooped up.

Pipe each size on separate trays and bake immediately.  Start at 400F for 10 minutes and then lower oven to 350 and bake until golden brown and firm to touch.  Smaller puffs will take less time so check them every 10 minutes.

Pastry Cream
In sauce pot:
8 oz milk
1 oz sugar
In bowl:
1 yolk
 egg
.625 oz cornstarch
1 oz sugar
Measure and have ready:
 oz butter
2 tsp vanilla extract

Put the sauce pot on medium heat and let it scald.  While the milk is heating up put your eggs in a bowl and whisk lightly then add the corn starch and sugar and beat until well combined.  Once the milk has heated up add to the eggs in a slow stream while you whisk(this is called tempering).  Once youve added all of the milk.  Dump everything back in the pot and return to the heat.  Stir with a whisk while you cook the mixture to a boil. Once the mixture has boiled remove from heat and add your butter and vanilla extract.

Flavored Pastry Creams:  You can add a variety of flavorings to pastry cream my favorites are raspberry curd and melted dark chocolate.  But have fun and try your own favorite flavors

Glaze
Powdered sugar
Water
Lemon juice
Liqua gel food colorings

Put a cup or two of powdered sugar in a bowl and add a splash of lemon juice and then a few teaspoons of water.   Adjust the ratio of water to sugar based on how runny or thick you like your glaze divide up into bowls or cups and add your favorite colors.You had me at "melted"Haha the light sour cream.

These do look pretty awesome. I always like taking good from other spots and trying to replicate it. Nice job!How about next time you be more considerate instead.  Now run along.That looks ridiculous. Ridiculously fantastic.fish 7/10

fish with rice 9/10

Thank you for your suggestionHow would you go about making this? I'm asking for a friend...I don't remember the last time I came to /r/food and didn't leave disappointed. The submissions aren't great to begin with, but the comments are just completely overrun by snobs who shit on everything. Sushi posts are some of the worst.

Of *course* Sushi is going to taste better when it's made to order. Most foods are this way. You put together trays like this for a party so you can eat and hang out with people. If you go to someone's house and they've pre-made a bunch of subs for you are you gonna sit there and complain that the bread dries out faster if it's not made to order?

What a glorious bunch of food assholes we have here./r/expectationvsrealityWow, looks awesome! What are the rest of you gonna eat? - Me+1 for Martins and probably jacksApparently it's seared duck breast. I could get down with that combo.Pictured: Hundreds of dollars in sushi.What's the best way to get into making basic sushi rolls? I was looking at one of the sushi-makers on amazon, but i'm not sure if it's worth it or not.

Any advice on starting out with making sushi is appreciated.I haven't eaten salted caramel before so I couldn't say! It is so delicious though! The problem is, is that I'm a diabetic so 1 piece is more than enough for me! looks [delicious] (/spoiler)
Look at all that raw fish hanging out in the food temperature danger zone!I could eat this whole thingSo does [mutagenesis](http://i.imgur.com/5rjp4Z0.jpg), but you haven't been manipulated into opposing it because mutated plants are commonly used in organic farming.i was literally just about to say that LOL
rice seems like it's waterloggedI Concur You be here 4-hour! You  leave now! You eat all fish in restaurant and now out of business!Your fish to rice ratio is out of proportion, unless you're trying to mimic an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant.  Aww...welll I could not remember what it was from my childhood. Thanks!Gracias!No it's true, I saw Anthony Bordain eat it on the Colombia episode of his new show.Espectacular.On the internet, everything is related to sex.

That looks so good :DDefinitely homemade, but yeah, the tuna and salmon nigiri on the center board are hilarious looking.I'm of Japanese descent but the only kinds of sushi I like are the futomakis and the inarizushis (and throw in a makizushi with takuan, eel and watercress).  Can't stand sashimi. Not surprised to find criticism in a sushi post.I want to go to there&gt; What I meant by not occurring in nature was the fact that no reasonable amount of breeding is going to produce corn that produces its own insecticide. There's a clear and obvious difference between using genes a plant already possesses and adding genes from bacteria that has never been introduced into human food before.

Many genes brought about through conventional cross-breeding never existed in that species before until that trait was sought out. The fact that the gene existed in another organism before doesn't make it any more inherently risky. Plus, there's zero evidence that it causes any harm.

That it hadn't occurred in nature in that species yet doesn't really mean anything in itself. It's the naturalistic fallacy.

&gt;Non GMO's are in fact tested, but less often because things like corn and beans have been know to be safe for thousands of years.

You think the corn we eat today is genetically identical to the corn that humans grew a thousand years ago? Do you think the corn from a thousand years ago is in any way similar to the corn grown two thousand years ago.

The corn we eat today has only been around for a few decades. There are no long-term tests to show that today's hybrid non-GMO corn seeds (or indeed, any major crop) are totally safe for human consumption, yet this doesn't bother us because that's not how it works. You can only test to show problems, not safety. The "safety" part comes from doing numerous studies (in this case, many thousands) and finding absolutely nothing showing any harms whatsoever (as is the case). That's as close as you're ever going to get to "known to be safe".Not necessarily. I get the kid's taco kit and it has plenty of food for about 445 calories. You can easily get a burrito bowl for under 500 calories. All that rice makes me cringeThose look awesome.  Location?American cheese slices and ham.
Whoa that's a huge compliment! I'm flattered, thanks!What is wrong with you? I wanna eat them :(My kind of party. Take my good handWow, some people are so judgey. I think it looks really good, and I'd eat the heck out of it! I don't really understand... How is being eaten alive somehow related to sex?2 questions

-NThats probably the best looking homemade banh mi I've ever seen, looks outstanding. Great job!
&gt;Top right the heart shaped "things" are rice with ham (jambon blanc) and processed cheese (toastinette)

Gross.It's either some restaurant using a fake account to advertise their food, or some shit soccer mom meal from an old Girl Scout cookbook. You do see a few chef's dishes, and once in a great while a good home cook, but mostly just total shit like this post. Oh, awesome. I think magret de canard is duck breast. You'd normally only get that in a fancy restaurant here.literally drooled while scrolling&gt; so OP is french (judging by the bottles on top, I know all these store brands)

plus, "axelmanFR"Thank you! I really appreciate that :)I get it, but I wouldn't get it. Need a wingman?Don't be discouraged by lack of traffic, looks awesome.  People jut can't find anything to correct or poke holes in...why cringes? I know right? Fucking snobby redditors...they got to critique everything.

Edit: Ok, I went back and really looked at the picture. Holy shit, that better be some homemade sushi because any restaurant that would serve this kind of sushi, should be shut down. THERE ARE FUCKING ORANGES ON RICE! WTF!No unagi? You monster...needs more salmon sashimi :PIf you were up for a snack/food exchange i'd totally do it.  PM me and we could put a box together for each other.Will do next week.Fuckin' A cake . Much obliged.

Yorkshire Puddings are pretty much pancake mixture but with extra eggs so it rises.
It doesn't have the butter or sugar in though, so it's what you add on after its cooked that makes it sweet or savoury. I believe that is Escolar.

That title sounds like a knock off of Fruit Ninja I've been to osteria Santo Spirito last year, and I loved it! I'm quite disappointed you tried pizza but not "lampredotto" and "fiorentina" in Florence though!
meh not impressed by some pic off google imagesYes!There's a strong anti-food snob movement on Reddit for some reason. I think people are just insecure about having bad taste. I don't know why you're getting downvoted, the sushi looks terrible."That'll be $1000" I learned it takes ten years to make eggs. well if you want to get real about it. back in the day rice was the main ingredient in nigiri. they used to use three fingers to form instead of today's twoI want some!!Thank you so much!Interesting, it looks almost like pate I don't. Unless you have like 8 people... sushi is not meant as a buffet food to be sitting out and become warm. it's supposed to be made to order. plus a lot of those cuts are not uniform and the nigiri is not properly formed. the rolls are all oblong and misshapen... 2/10 would not eat.

yes i'm a sushi snob. I dont careLove the effort you've put into the calories, costs, etc. Such a well thought out post Tuna is very easy to overcook...so when you're searing the tuna be very very careful.  I like using non-stick pans for fish since it's delicate just fyiGIVE ME ALL OF THIS!Nice work. Looks delicious! Jesus Christ dude...I use (roughly nowadays) the recipe by Foodwishes, I'd highly recommend it. Also, onion goes great with carbonara. Try it.  This makes me wish I was the size of a toy green army man, I would totally live on top of that sandwich. Then I would dig, and have a tunnel of gooey cheesy veggies, then meats!

Looks really delicious! *A little* quality?Getting anything edible for $1.61 is a win, but that looks like something from a different part of the hospital than the cafeteria.

I'm not super picky. So be it if there isn't a restaurant in 50 miles of me that serves "authentic" sushi, it ain't like I'm not going to eat it because of the dozens of reasons some of you folks claim you'd send it back, or whatever. Shit's still good. But there really is too much rice here.I can't harsh too much on the sloppy preparation because obviously you were making a lot of this, but next time consider using less rice, especially on the nigiri. The balance is way off on some of those fat blobs.Yeah, cream cheese at least is used in some sushi. Not sure is that is what this is or not, it was just the first thing I thought of.and surf clam!It doesn't need to be made by Jiro but some properly cut fish would be nice.

Ingredients

* 397g can condensed milk

* 150 ml milk

* 450g Demerara sugar

* 115 g butter

* 1  tsp Cornish Sea Salt Original Pinch salt

* 1 tsp vanilla extract


Instructions

1. Grease and base line a 20 cm square tin with baking parchment.

2. Place the condensed milk, milk, sugar and butter in a large heavy-based pan. Stir over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to the boil and simmer, over a low heat, for 10-15 minutes, stirring continuously and scraping the base of the pan. To test if the fudge is ready, drop a teaspoonful of the mixture into cold water. If it forms a soft ball, it is ready. Stir in 1 tsp of the Salt and the vanilla extract.

3. Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool for about five minutes then beat the mixture vigorously until it becomes thick and grainy.

4. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, sprinkle over the remaining salt and leave to cool and set before cutting into squares.I feel the need for sushi today.Yep.  Check back for an edit!Cool, Is this how you make sandwiches?

but Sushi is not healthy...
Watch out to Diabetes,They're expert.Thanks! I have a whole pound so I think I'm going to try a few different things. I found this recipe that sounds simple and awesome as well. http://www.simplyrecipes.com/m/recipes/seared_tuna_with_avocado/Ah, my bad. Perhaps sliced kamaboko? That looks fairly similar if it's undyed.It'd be like eating a sandwich like this

http://i.imgur.com/vG2A393.jpgA day ago i saw a youtube video about a guy who made maki with brown rice and altogether in a strange way. Somebody asked how to make good maki and another person told to watch Jiro dreams of sushi. I did as he told and loved the movie... but i learned nothing about making sushi.Appreciate the help, I think you're right and the US version of a biscuit is more like a savoury scone for us. Though we have scones with cream and jam... so I think I'll go for pizza dough, or a basic bread, make it more like a tear-and-share!orgasimAgree completely.Been getting in to cooking Indian lately, can't wait to try these. Thanks! Try the supermarkets then. The link I provided was just to show the photo and an idea of the cost.Recipe, please. I have been trying to make some good carbonara pasta and haven't quite got it right. Any tips and advice on how you add the egg and incorporate it well so you don't get a little bit of scrambled egg in there would be very appreciated. And this looks delish! I am assuming this in not in the US because there is a Blackberry on the table. I'm thinking cream cheese on top maybe? Not sure what is underneath (maybe some fruit spread or something?)Really nice set of pics, I especially liked the central market ones, there are fascinating and unfortunately nothing like that is available in Romania (at least as far as I know), my home country.Irrashaimase!!!I just wish they could have been full druids in their prime at the same time. They were two of the best in my opinion.Upper left, next to the Philly Roll? Whatever it is it (like much of the sushi) is an uramaki full of avocado, very American.

The thing is, the other person already did a good (if harsh) job of pointing out the beginner's mistakes with rice, fish, and serving too much at once. These are indeed common amateur mistakes and the criticisms reasonable. But you were the one that added "Americanized sushi" into the mix, and I wanted to know what you meant by that.

If you didn't mean that was a part of the problem then I don't know why you brought it up at all. If you did I don't know why you then linked to a bunch of extremely "Americanized" sushi to contrast it. Basically, that aspect was either irrelevant to what was being said or was in fact being refuted by the picture you posted of very nice looking (and very "American") sushi, which is why I asked what you were trying to imply.I only recently ate tofu for the first time and it didn't taste anything at all! And the only faint taste I could get was gross, so why would one eat it? The stuff it's made of is so much better!Is it bad that my first thought was not 'if I could' but 'whether I should'How old is this pic?

That's some pretty sad looking fish.When we were little, my brother and I would walk to the PX (big store on military bases) and "shop" around. Then we would achieve our true goal: going to BK to get the mozzarella sticks.*score!*The thing that makes me think its home made is the fact its served with ginger and wasabi in their packaging, and at a restaurant they just give you a bit with the stuff that comes out, never a whole jar.  I guess some people can't take criticism well...but try and tone down on the bitch a little.No we're talking about the upper right of photo.So scrummy...15.99 for shipping? They are so easy to make at home for less than the cost of shipping.  Also the napkins and holders. Most restaurants don't have napkins on the table like that.Indeed we are.

Yours looks way better, to be fair. But it still looks like shitty sushi. I'm admittedly kind of a snob.
My guess is sushi for the kids; it looks like cheese, ham, and maybe some red sauce (likely ketchup?).That is some of this shittiest looking "sushi" Ive seen in a while.Vomiting skittles. Cute. Super attractive. &gt; It can add things that would never occur in nature

This applies to literally everything we eat. Nothing we eat that's plant-based got here without human intervention and the changes we've forced over millennia simply wouldn't have happened without human intervention. Plus, gene variation with traditional cross-breeding changes the genetic makeup of a plant far far more randomly than genetic engineering.

&gt;so it should be heavily tested for safety.

Are you under the impression that it isn't? Are you under the impression that non-GMO hybrids, the ones you are fine eating, *are* tested heavily for safety?ugg, i never understood why people liked Sushi.  Guess its a coast thing.Mozzarella ran away ..McDonald's being trolls The most "authentic" type of sushi is probably nigiri sushi. Basically, it's a ball of rice with a slice of raw fish on top of it. Another common type is maki sushi. It's the things that are wrapped in seaweed, with the raw fish in the middle. California rolls, or any kind of rolls, is less common AFAIK.

As for toppings, raw fish is the most common. Many kinds of fish (and crustaceans) can be used, including tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp etc. You can also substitute it with other ingredients, most commonly egg or other cooked stuff like eel or salmon skin.

Sushi is generally made from very simple ingredients, with quality determined by the freshness of the ingredients and skill of the chef. Americanized sushi generally uses a bunch of additional ingredients and sauces to make sushi, as they cater to a different tastes. It is sushi. sushi with too much rice.Whoever fried them was incompetent. I'm also incompetent and when I fry mozzarella sticks at home this always happens to me. Take me with you Holly mother of all sushis! So we're in agreement that OP looks shitty.Those mozzarella sticks are all sticks and no mozzarella. Sushi for one I see?no, this looks shitty too. People like the "D"...
I'd go on that date. (we're all lonely here)That's because they fried them too long. After a certain time in the fryer, all the cheese will run out through a hole and its hard to tell until you actually break or bite them.i just mix it all with the sauce and microwave the sauce and pasta mix, its not bad but im basically a human garbage disposal when it comes to pasta. If op is active and eats somewhat better foods later in the day it really isn't an issue. This is how I get fat.At first my eyes widened, then they narrowed as I realized this was NOT great sushi preparation.this is relevant
http://makemysushi.com/most common is

maki - this is your basic roll, seaweed ourside, rice, whatever is inside. lots of western places will put the rice on the outside and the nori (seaweed) on the inside, this started cause white people dont like seeing that theyre eating seeweed. in most western places maki will refer to a smaller roll with seaweed on the outside.

nigiri - slice of fish/whatever on top of a packed roundish cube thing of rice. some kinds will have a piece of seaweed wrapped around either around the outside or the bottom and top

sashimi - served alone, no rice, usually fish

temaki - usually called a hand roll or cone. cone of seaweed filled with first rice and then whatever other ingridients

traditionally all of these except sashimi are eaten by hand in japan. for white people usually just the cone but feel free to do whatever you want.

as for wasabi/ginger/soy sauce, the sushi is supposed to come with a proper dose of wasabi already on it, lots of places dont do this though. soy sauce use a small amount, dip in only the fish/main ingredient, not the rice. only use soy sauce if the sushi doesnt already have a sauce. wasabi and soy sauce arent meant to be mixed. ginger is a pallette cleanser, its not meant to be mixed either.

there are too many toppings to list but here are some of the more common ones

salmon

tuna (bigeye, ahi, albacore, blue fin, yellow fin, etc.)

toro (fatty part of the belly of the fish, otoro is even fattier and

chutoro is slightly less fatty)

negi- (scallion, prefix, usually mixed with hamachi or toro)

saba (mackarel)

sanma (pike)

hamachi (yellowtail)

ebi (cooked shrimp)

amaebi (raw shrimp)

unagi (eel)

ika (squid)

tako (octopus)

inari (soy bean curd)

tamago (egg)

uni (sea urchin)

ankimo (monkfish liver/sea foie gras)

ikura (salmon roe)

tobiko (flying fish roe, also used as a topping for california rolls and others)

start off with california, dynamite roll, spider roll, bc roll (obviously theres safe stuff too like avacado or cucumber roll), if you wanna try nigiri start off with ebi or unagi probably, or you can try raw fish and if you like it then sashimi. go for basic stuff like tuna or salmon first, sanma for instance is super fishy tasting. rolls i cant really help you beyond that, every place does different stuff.Ha! that was comical to picture! She's tiny so she'd be floored, and then she'd be so angry!Would love to have this recipe! and how to do it! Also, how much was the pork belly for you?10/10 Would eatI'm not implying anything. I'm saying it looks amateur-level at best and I'm not sure why people are impressed. It's not even the presentation that's at issue here, it's the quality of the fish and the proportion of fish to rice.

As far as the pictures go, there is one philadelphia roll, but I don't see any california rolls.They look to be homemade. No restaurant would bring out sushi looking like this. At least I hope so.Looks good to me.  Pretty much like bacon!Tamagoyaki isn't that pale I believe.Well I just came in my pants. Twice.Awesome for homemade. Bad for restaurant, the cuts are imprecise. don't palm your own face, palm your friend'sRandomly reminds me of when I ate at Le Cirque.. If you have the Crme brle, when you get to the bottom of the ramekin, it has the recipe printed on it. Ofc I suspect having the recipe still wouldn't do me much good.
LolThat's not my hand.These are just sticks! I used to be like you, friend. Some tips that helped me were to microwave and stir, prepare "cold lunches," or do something with a sauce that I could keep in a small container. Like in the previously mentioned spaghetti, reserve some sauce and then pour that over to "rehydrate" the meal. Why is this being downvoted?I want that in or around my mouthOh man, vegans cant stand these questions. Truth is, we dont need all the average american eats. You'll be fine. If you want to know more in a less than boring way google fully raw kristina. Im not raw, nor know anyone who is, but it proves that you dont even need beans. Fact, is theres protein in a lot of food. Just not the amounts of meat, obviously. She even has her blood tested. Anywho Im rambling. But I hope you learned somethingLol I honestly didn't read the post that HE was responding too so I don't know the context.

I wasn't really tryin' to call you out or anything haha, I just like instigating.

EDIT: Ok, just read what he was responding too. You're right. Although the person he was responding to sounds supremely pretentious, case in point:

&gt;Not to mention having all your sushi sitting out at once is a complete faux pas.

Faux pas? We're on Reddit dude, tone it down.Id eat some of it but a lot just looks too bland. Im not big on the shrimp or fake crab rolls. Also the kiddie cheese looking ones just look horrible yet...cute... lolThanks, glad you like it :)Ok, so OP is french (judging by the bottles on top, I know all these store brands) and for those who are wondering about some mysterious sushi :

Top right the heart shaped "things" are rice with ham (jambon blanc) and processed cheese (toastinette)

The other one with oranges is rice with magret de canard (no idea how you can call that in english or even if you can find any outside of France, but it is from my area of France) and a slice of orange

Before anyone asks, NO we do not eat this kind of sushi in France, Op got a little crazy apparently and tried some stuff.It's a DIY mozzarella stick, cheese sold separately.  I'm still cumming.Totally read "penis" instead of "penne" and was like "...what? why is the penis talking to the macaroni?"

Also, I'm stealing that joke. The non-penis version. Thanks.American born Chinese here, mom ran a couple of westernized Chinese restaurants.

There isn't so much a "secret menu" as it's more the fact that the staff almost certainly does not eat off the menu for lunch and dinner.  Assuming you knew the dish you wanted, you could probably get it cooked if you asked nicely.

One specific memory stands out in my mind. A big Caucasian family comes into the restaurant and upon being seated, the dad asks the waitress in perfect Chinese - "Do you speak Chinese?" The waitress did and the dad asks if the kitchen could make some more traditional food than what was on the menu. Turns out the family had been living in Hong Kong for the past 10+ years and had recently moved back to the US. The kitchen staff came out, chatted with them, and made them a bunch of food that wasn't on the menu.

It doesn't hurt to ask. I don't care how it looks, I'd put as big of a dent in that as I could. I've tried them all - Oolong and Green Tea are the only two i love of the bunch.  Delish!they are an acquired taste, but did you expect them to taste like potatoes?i'm loving the top down pictures, will try it out!i really like the use of the orange slices on the tuneI'm curious why it was cooked so much.  I always thought Kobe beef (or wagyu) would be cooked pretty rare.* ugh. uncooked foodI'd dive in head first I think you're right. It's probably for kids. Hell, I'd eat it.Only enough for mayyybe 2 people there.You must be tired.As a woman heading into a surrogacy pregnancy... I need this.It's like a work of art.

I don't like very creamy or overly mixed scrambled eggs either. I don't overcook them but I like them when there's bits of white and yolk rather than one whole mixed thing. The pack is already on the way&gt; you're fucking retarded kid.

Get yourself a super sharp knife

Slice into strips and you got yourself Sashimi!

To make sushi - you'll need a bunch of other things - but if i recall correctly - you wash the short grain rice until it's clean (water coming out clear) and then you steam it.  After it's done you put it on a wooden wide bowl and you mix in some rice vinegar - then mix it in with one hand while fanning off the mixture with the other.  Once it cools to room temp doing this method (liquid will evaportae and it'll get sticky) get youreslf some Nori - fill that guy up with nori, tuna, wasabi, whatever and voila you got a sushi roll.

or you can youtube how to make itIs that a blackberry in the corner?Where the fuck is the unagiTenderloin of Fido.I remember burger king doing these many years ago and they were delicious. It was around the same time they had the green ketchup! These look so disappointing :(Man that's shitty~

In upstate NY it was .10 for the mac sauce; although I never got lettuce on them so that's where they may be gettin' ya.

Kinda a shame I don't each Mickey D's any more a McDouble with mac sauce sounds good~Oh man, do I have the song for you - [Speak Can't Read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeXUxjmn6as)I'm sure its delicious, I'm just not familiar with this sort of breakfast&gt; The rice looks too doughy/dense too.

I don't think I've seen any homemade sushi on this subreddit that didn't get the rice totally wrong. They treat it like an afterthought, when it's actually the most important part.  No offense but by the time you served this to your guests, I wouldn't have wanted to eat it. I like to eat my sushi right out of the friggen chef's hands. Or else I go to Pizza Hut.also the wasabi is in a tube lolI want to be inside of that.Yeah, just pointing it out cause there are a lot of Neapolitan pizzerias in the city. I'm also a big fan if Joe's and if I find myself out in BK (I'm a Manhattan resident) I REALLY like L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens.

Rock over, London

Rock on, Chicago

Diet Pepsi, Uh-Huh&lt;Idea to become a gazillionaire #53&gt;I can feel the heartburn...I would still trust a 3rd generation Italian American who has grown up in that culture to know more about Italian food than your average american.. As someone who lived a huge part of my life in Chicago, I have to say this: I never liked it, not compared to other deep dish offerings. It has WAY too damn much cheese! So much my stomach hurts after eating a single piece! I'll take a Malnati's, Uno's, or Maciano's deep dish over Giordano's every day.

Although, now that I live in Denver, this pic did make me tear up a bit ;)Lol you're so mad. You shouldn't talk shit if you can't handle getting it in return. Some advice right there you might want to write down. Education is key hereMy k/d is always 3 to 0Used to work at Gino's. They have roaches in their ovens. Only if you go to the one on taylor and then get a Mario's lemonade. It's the only wayEww...either that girlled cheese I just ate ruined my appetite, or this 'pizza' looks more like a lasagna, and if I got this having ordered a pizza, I would be angered.
pizza needs to be simple.Lou Malnati's Master Race. Oh you're from Chicago? You must really miss that deep dish pizza!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZKDdd1fu4How dare you insult Lou Malnati's!Butter crustIs this is Calgary? ;)Lou Malnati's is the only deep dish I will eat. No white gravy?
It's pizza. That's what we call it. Just because haters are afraid of the greatness doesn't mean they get to rename or reclassify it.Lou Malnati's Master Race. Nah I love cheese more than is humanly possible. I am a huge fan of Chicago pizza and was told this is the place to go but I tried it and didn't like it at all. Also got sick pretty instantly and had to run into a bathroom at a nearby shop. I'd be willing to try it again if I got just a cheese this time. We got a special one with 4 or 5 toppings and that also didn't sit well with me.[americans think this is a casserole.](http://www.campbellskitchen.com/recipeimages/tuna-noodle-casserole-large-24254.jpg)I've been here. The food is straight up magicalGeorgios out in the NW burbs is the absolute shit. Great crust, great sauce, great toppings- and extremely consistent.My t-cell count is all over the place.I like Roma's beef and Dino's pizza on the North Side. I think for me it's about enjoying what I grew up eating. I began to expect that particular taste, texture and quality from a dish, when I order from another place and it deviates too far away from it, I don't like it...in comparison to my old neighborhood staples. I do have a few places that I enjoy, but those neighborhood gems will always be #1. Then I moved out of state and found I will take ANYTHING Chicago over Michigan's "Chicago Style" menu, now they are doing it all wrong.You can see onions and peppers in there.  Are you blind?My parents always complain about Giordano's skimping on
the ingredients. It's still great pizza, but they always mention
how it used to be much thicker.Any love for Chicago's other pizza-- the crispy, cracker thin crust?

Tourists go nuts for the deep dish-- and I love it during my annual trip to Chicago, but to my mind the cracker thin crust that my old man used to pick up on the way home is the under-rated hero of Chicago.AWESOME!!!!It's kind of a hidden gem around the hoover area.

Make sure you go to the Tortugas in Hoover on Hwy 150, it's the first and original (I think there's one in Trussville that recently closed, and one on Hwy 280). The other 2 were spin offs with a long story behind it and try and display the original Tortugas pizza awards.I gotta disagree with you on pizanos. I only go to pizanos for thin crust but they lead the pack with their thin crust pizza. Just get a pepperoni pizza and let that buttery smooth crust melt in your mouth. As for deep dish, Lou Malnati's is the best deep dish by far. For alternative style gourmet pizza, Stella Barra in Lincoln Park takes the cake. I ate Olive Garden twice, and then I gave up on Italian food, its disgusting.There's a reason nearly every culture that goes heavy on spice also goes heavy on dairy/creamy things with their spicy foods -- South America always adds queso fresco or sour cream or avocado to spicy foods, India has raita (a cucumber-yogurt dip), Thai curries are made with coconut milk -- because dairy calms the cells' exposure to the capsaicin in chilies. Have more dairy with your spicy foods, and eat more bread/pita/tortillas alongside your food since they will absorb more of the spiced-up gastric juices. Giordano's has no flavor or substance at all!I want that inside of me. It is.Lou's blows left right and sideways. Have a Nancy's and finally have  a real deep dish!The black pudding?It's pretty hard to screw up a Chicago dog if you start with S. Rosen's and Vienna Beef.  quarks - technically in all food. You look awful.And since it's from Giaordano's, it won't taste better than cardboard...Are you sure what you thought was undercooked dough wasn't a thick layer of cheese?If you want some great pizza check out Guisseppes in Blue Island, Illinois. Its near the city and theyve been voted greatest pizza in the area numerous times as well as being open for over 30 years. Way better then Beggars Pizza!It's not Chicago style, but Pizza Luce is one of the best joints anywhere, and Mesa is also pretty goddamn good.

Not Lou's, that's for sure, but you still got options.
I still order Lou's by Fedex to Houston. Somehow it is still amazing. They just opened 2 Gino's around here, but it is just no comparison. It is more convenient, but I still prefer Fedex'ed Lou's.I'm sorry you were born without taste buds. Have a REAL deep dish from Nancy's then come back. We'll forgive you. None of that Lou Malnotti's crap either!!!!!!I live in Chicago and it has been my dream to travel to Brazil. Switch places for a few weeks?This is my favorite any time food!What on earth is this supposed to be? Pls don't call this pizza.Meh. Once Kuma's blew up enough they stopped making:

- the buns
- the patties
- the fries


They are the city's best burger assembly and mac-n-cheese 'to order' team. Chicago transplant here. Nancy's is good. I'm not sure they have it up there in the Atlanta Nancy's but try the Super Gyro Pizza. It's "yih-roh", not "guy-roh" btw. I swear if one more Georgian asks me to go get guy-rohs on a food run, I will dip my nuts in their tzatziki sauce. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.  He didn't even touch on falcos, palermos or home run inn. UNOs is damn good. Duos is UNOs. Angelos on the southwest side is pretty impressive. I mean come on! my parents recently claimed Fortel's is better than Imo's

I want to retroactively emancipate myself from themThey just opened one a block away from me and it's not bad. Perfect, quick drunk food as someone else stated.Superdawg is a Chicago treasure. You done good. Til. Thanks.Chicago pizza: best kind of pizza there is, if [Zachary's Chicago Pizza](http://zacharys.com/) is any indication.

Never been to Chicago to have deep dish at the source, but I hope to go one day.Nancy's is indeed great but I gotta stick with Lou's for #1that shit looks fucking vileHad this when I visited a friend in Chicago, hands down the best pizza I've ever had and probably will ever have.&gt; Pequod's ... Their crust is actually shit,

Take it back.As someone who orders their pizza well done with light sauce jets is my favorite. Usually they throw on way more cheese to make up for the lack of sauce. Once I had jets with extra sauce and it was just terrible!
[Nope.  Chicago-style too.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_pizza#Thin-crust_pizza)Pussy.I'm actually interested if this is the case or not - if you saw it sliced and served as pizzas are, yes, I think you're right.

But if it was fresh out the oven unsliced, I'm not sure if it would be recognizable because of the top covered by red sauce and the high crust walls - it does look like a casserole or savory pie (even though it doesn't technically fit the definition of pie - I've looked into it haha). Whereas, most other pizzas unsliced still look a lot like the "platonic ideal" of a pizza.

Too bad we don't have the resources to run an experiment and see, I think it would a) be really interesting and b) help settle this debate a little.True. The entire plate would be tossed into a blender and milkshake-ified if it were drunk me making it...Had Giordanos twice when I was in Chicago. What surprised me most was how filling it was. Three large men (all over 6'2") ordered a medium and we took leftovers out. And eat divorced eggs!I'm moving to Chicago in a few months... This was much appreciated.I would eat the hell out of this...Lower bad cholesterol, higher good cholesterol, lower blood sugarall of these things are also benefits of a very-low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein, high-fat diet.People think Chicago is about deep dish. I just laugh.

Vito and Nick's was also on [Diners Drive-ins and Dives](https://vimeo.com/103610667)

Also, in some places you can buy the Vito and Nick's frozen pizza which is literally almost as good as the real think. It genuinely tastes great out of the oven. This is what my friend who moved to Chicago said, that deep dish is mostly what tourists eat.   I had a slice from lou's and while it was good, it's not something I would ever go out of my way to order again. http://www.caloriecount.com/calories-chilis-grill-awesome-blossom-i102131*They'reMargherita Pizza ftwDeep Dish: Lous
Thin: Piece

And now im hungry... Why does there have to be difference!

Side note: I'm from the South, so it's no wonder I trend toward a more casserole style pizza. ;)I'm torn.  Part of me thinks it's really good and when I'm hungry I'll devour a ton of it.  The other part of me acknowledges it for being extremely oily and spongy thick dough that isn't very good at holding the volume of sauce sitting on it.

On one hand, all that oil gives me the shits.  On the other hand, a Jet's recently opened up near my apartment...I've never even been anywhere near Chicago and that made me feel nostalgicFamily's favorite. They're from the Chicago area. Israel, instant downvote.

Also, who cares?California, amiright?!NYC sauce was pretty meh when I last tried it.  I'm sure there's good spots and I could've just had bad luck, but really, I've had the same level of quality of NY style sauce and overall slices outside of NYC as I did when I was there.I never knew about this place. I'm in huntsville, and I might have to travel down there to try it out. As a Chicagoan I agrees it's all that. I will add that the best pizza (non stuffed) is always based on sauce and crust preference, and will never be agreed on by all. With that said, I prefer Johns or Sanos on the Northside, or phils on the southside. Tried this when I was in Chicago and didn't really care for it.  I actually had better deep dish in Denver. I'm sure there's other establishments in Chicago that are better, but people sometimes don't understand that just because Chicago is known for its deep dish doesn't mean it has the best. YEAH!! My family is from Chicago and that's all they eat. Giordanos is good but overrated. The Lou's in Schamburg is a lot easier to get to, and just as good. Its like a giant ass house they added some space onto and made the whole thing into an amazing restaraunt of amazingness. Worth checking out if you are still in the area (probably 30 minutes away from Naperville) The main difference here, in my opinion, is that if you showed this pan pizza to a person from pretty much anywhere in the world, most people would immediately identify it as a pizza. If you chopped up some bread ham and cheese and threw it in a bowl, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a single person who would say "oh hey, a sandwich!"Yeah, and I bet you pressed the button, too. U wot m8its amazing but its obviously not the same when you have it shipped to you in dry ice.  Best pizza I have ever had.This. What he said. 100%. Vito and Nick's is the best pizza in Chicago. No debate. Try their salad dressing (house dressing, vinaigrette). Seriously. I miss Chicago. We used to go every year, and even though we would only be there for 24 hours we would eat pizza twice. I'll eat an Al's beef dipped in your name. &gt;  It's a pepperoni pizza with truffle oil

Fucking truffle oil. 99% of the time, when a restaurant serves a dish with truffle oil, you know they're pretentious and their food is over-engineered. Truffle oil is usually the sign of a wannabe chef. The 1% of the time when it's not, you'll bloody well know.Four Scottish breakfasts and no Lorne sausage?!Also, Vito and Nick's. The best pizza you'll get in a bowling alley.Now do Chicago burritos."Wha'chu talkin' 'bout, Sears?" +1 reasons to marry a Mexican girl!Which Lou's location? Is there a best one or personal fav?

Makes us all feel better about our own shortcomings.That's actually a pretty good idea, I'm still new to the whole dieting thing so I'm always on the lookout for advice. Thanks :)Gimme that Portillo's! nomnomnomIMO Superdawg is more of an event than a great hot dog. Family owned, fun with the drive-in atmosphere and in car delivery. Hot dogs are good, but presentation is somewhat down for the finest 'drag it through the garden' Chicago style.
"Authentic" is another good word if you want to start an argument, though I guess it's in the same vein as traditional :PIt's layered and salty enough that you can taste it.  It adds value to the whole pizza and, as you say, blends perfectly with the cheese.  Which is more than I can say for places that don't put enough salt in the dough, like Gino's East (worst offender by far, tasteless crust), Connie's, Lou's...But if by doing it wrong, I'm making it more healthy... Am I not actually doing it right?As a college kid who spends 9 months a year away from the city, you are a saint.I've been to Urban Chestnut, but didn't eat anything! The food did look good, though!

There's definitely good food and that's great hearing that there is a growing food scene, but it just feels that the dining culture is much, much smaller in St. Louis (of course, comparing to Houston/Dallas/Austin might not be fair). Whenever I visit, I still eat very well, though!

And yes, West County is rough. Original concepts that are worth eating at are few and far between. OP definitely needs more fibre in his diet after eating that.&gt; Pizza is a pie by definition.

[It's not, though, because other dictionaries (and Merriam-Webster is more highly regarded than dictionary.com) don't reference pie](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pizza) except to note that the phrase pizza pie is sometimes used. And like I said, none of the possible root words that the modern word pizza comes from involve pie.

The definition of pie is, from [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pie):

1:  a meat dish baked with biscuit or pastry crust  compare potpie

2:  a dessert consisting of a filling (as of fruit or custard) in a pastry shell or topped with pastry or both

If we're going to go by dictionary definitions, then the only way a pizza could really be a pie is if it's loaded with meats - which invalidates your other point about the crazy toppings.

It's called pizza pie as a colloquialism, and not consistently, which is fine but it's not as if that's what everyone calls it by that term exclusively at all times.

Taking your points into consideration, there are still some significant differences between deep dish and 99 percent of other kinds of pizza. I can't pick deep dish up, the cheese is under the sauce (and therefore doesn't cook in the same fashion as the vast majority of pizzas), it needs to be eaten with a knife and fork, etc.

I'm not saying it's not food or that it's objectively bad, but it has unique and major differences from the majority of other pizza styles. I don't think it really counts as pizza. I'm not saying you're a bad person for liking it, I'm saying I don't like it and presenting my personal argument as to why I don't think it really counts as pizza.It was the crispy texture from being so fresh that I liked.  Whatever you buy in a store is at the very least a few days old...this had been baked an hour ago.  I wonder if it will stay as good over the next few days.
Nvm; read the recipe.a) that was so long ago

b) they ruled that tomato sauce is a serving of vegetablesGiordanos is good, but Lou Malnati's will forever stay as my favoriteThe culture maintained in a family over generations is not the same as that found in the country of origin. An Italian American is simply not Italian. A Chinese American is not Chinese. There is a huge difference. Even if you maintain the language, which most don't over generations anyway. The society you grow up has a tremendous influence on who you are. If your great grandparents immigrated from Italy to the US, there is little chance that you share a great deal with people who live in Italy beyond the similarities shared by other Americans.Superdawg is definitely known in the area.  You definitely have a lot of Chicagoans who have eaten hot dogs at many more less famous locations and who are "over" Superdawg, which is fine, but that's just a testament to how many hot dog places we have.  Probably most of these people loved Superdawg at some point during their hot-dog-eating lives, so it's probably safe to say that it's pretty good.I'm eyeballing that mac 'n cheese 0_oPizano's is very close to Lou's - it's another family spin off, this time from the Malnati family. We're talking about Pizza not foldable cardboard. Wanna know why Papa John's, Domino's, and Pizza Hut can make "New York Style Pizza"? Because it's literally: scoop sauce on cardboard, cover with cheese, cut into big pieces so that shit will fall into your lap when you pick it up. Deep Dish requires effort and love to create.Upvote on Lou's and Pequod's. Being a northish folk, I know both from the original loations, Lincolnwood and Morton Grove.

Giordano's is seriously meh. Need to *really* want stuffed. My son and I participated at a program where one of the perks was G's thin crust for break time. He seriously bad-mouthed it.

A good non-touristy takeout and delivery for thin crust on the north side is Villa Palermo. This used  to be a nice neighborhood Italian restaurant before the shift to Devon Ave. to be South Asian, Russian and Orthodox Jewish caused them to downsize to a little takeout joint.


I'm glad I kept scrolling. I agree with this comment 100%. I think Giordano's thin crust sausage might be the best pie in Chicago. That thread reminds me of the time when OPs computer broke and everyone spoke in Spanish.Thanks OP, I know where I am going Sat morning!!!Are we talking about pizzas or are we talking about casseroles? ;)Who fucking  cares? Looks like someone's got a pizza and ran over it with [one of these.](https://sidoxia.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/steam-roller.jpg)I used to live right next to Superdawgs.  It has neat decor, and it's not awful.  But honestly, it's just a standard Chicago hotdog.  It was essentially identical to the hot dog I liked to get from this gas station in Elk Grove - in that industrial park near the airport.   Only three times the price.

It's going to burn there too, it acts on mucosal membranes and epithelium Oddly enough, these things are also the worst parts of Chicago. Giordano's is a Chicago pizza chain. Pretty damn good.Out of sixteen words, three of them were kill.  Nice ratio.Lockdown on Western, Au Cheval on Randolph, Parts and Labor on Milwaukee.

Go, new Burgerfriend, you will thank me later.What kills you faster in Chicago? What they try to pass off as pizza? Or the young inner city people being neglected by their fellow citizens?Neapolitan style isn't "New York pizza."

Motorino in the east village makes Neapolitan style (and is amazing, btw).  The pizza you get at, for example, Prince St. Pizza is "New York pizza" (also amazing btw).Swearing off Mexican food for a month and this is the first image I see in /new

...tortureWe just got one in Indianapolis. Woo.I WHOOPED, BATMANS AAASSSS!!!I love Nancy's! Especially the Super Gyro Pizza with Kalamata olives!Cue the "Corn is a grain, not a vegetable" fight. Follow with a deep dive into how words are really meaningless, and that the food pyramid is just a quick and dirty reference, not a guide to eating healthy.  I only have one really generous fatty meal per week. I read a lot about dieting and apart from the fact that it's harmless to indulge once a week it can actually be good for the metabolism, which slows down considerably when you cut calories. So cheat meals jump start your metabolism  in a way.  :)&gt; Like the football debate.

Eh?If you're not stuck on deep dish, Papa Ray's and Pizzeria Serrio do a good pie.Fancy tomato cakeThank you! I have a canon 6D which I love. For food photography I almost always use a Sigma 50mm Macro lens. It's not an expensive lens at all but I really love it. Not as good but gets you by:

Yes! Art of Pizza is always on point. Love their pan. Also, if you haven't had one of their subs be sure to remedy that asap. My favorite pizza in the world. A slice of that and some Goose Island beer and I feel like I'm in Chicago againSure thing, but weight loss is not the only thing that equals health.  What? That's not a casserole; that's a stew.

[These are casseroles.](https://www.google.com/search?q=casserole&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v2kdVe2ICsiqggSTvYG4AQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1115&amp;bih=724)

EDIT: You know, I bet you're British or something. We might have a cross-Atlantic difference in terms here. In the US, a casserole looks more, um, solid than what you've posted, and much closer to the "pizza" OP posted.Most people don't know that Giordano's is actually a spin-off of Nancy's Pizza, which features the same delicious thin crust and stuffed pizzas.

Nancy's also has the most ridiculously good breadsticks you'll eat in your entire life. Really, everything on the menu is delicious.

Giordano's is obviously more famous and successful now. It's probably because the owner of Nancy's is an idiot who doesn't know how to properly run a good franchise.

Source: I worked at the one Nancy's Pizza location in Indianapolis that was driven out of business despite having amazing food.I love it Deep and stuffed.... pizza..I love my pizza stuffed deeply.

I was desperately trying to find someone who feels the same about AoP. Their pan blows others away. And Pequod's delivery is fine. Literally had it yesterday. I feel like I'm in the minority here, but I think Giordano's sucks.  Cool that you can BYOB, but while the pizza looks attractive, it's sub-par, flavorless, goop.traditional...with tomatoes? whats that orange shit i know that aint pine nuts or basil sonBeautiful.  I would like to add Bojonos on Clarendon.  Great thin crust and they pile on the toppings[Pizza is a pie by definition.]( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pizza)

Pie doesn't need a cover, like pumpkin. It can be full of vegetables and meat instead of fruit, like chicken pot pie. It can be panless, like a galette. Pie is literally dough with stuff on it that you bake.

It's called a pizza pie for a reason. Also, lots of styles of pizza exist. And deep dish has fully cooked crust unless you get it super cheap. Not all deep dish has crazy toppings, that's personal taste.Don't talk shit about Pequod's, brah. I actually like their thin crust. It's cracker thin and crunchy. I agree with you about Burt's being the superior.

Didn't mention Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Company. And Dimo's something God created for drunk people, it's fucking great. If you're ever out on the NWside/Logan Square area and haven't tried Dantes, do it.

Out of the big Chicago deep dish places Lous is absolutely the best. That corn flour crust. I really wish I was in Israel right now, that would be a very very good ice cream. For the plain burger (read:just about the beef) try Owen and Engine.  Close by, by the Regal theater on Western south of Diversey.Fuck Giordano's..Lou Malnatis is the pinnacle of greatness...&gt; Reheat value 100

I think Lou's has this on lock down as well. The next day, throw it in the oven at 350-400 for about 10-15 minutes. Crispy crust, and all the flavor still remains.

 For a while I tried it in the microwave just out of eagerness, but with lou's it's best to wait it out...totally worth it. Fuck yeah. Line that cast iron with bacon weave crust, bake it crisp, THEN add the meat mixture. THEN top with MOAR weave!!! Ho-lee-shitsorry I wasn't aware of the drunk food rules!:P I'm glad I'm not super into football or else is get pulled into some outrageous argument. Packers are still better. There I had the last word. I winI'm not sure that I want to take cooking advice from someone named KakaPooPooPeePeePant... ;)

Good point, though, about the olive oil.  I love it so there is no such thing as too much olive oil for me.  The butter sounds interesting so I may try that the next time.  Do you melt it or use it solid like shortening? What is this pizza flavored cake monstrosity?Meat Pie Loaf with Bacon Crust??&gt; maxwells hot dogs,

And if you order with Ketchup...you're a deadman.

Source: As a kid growing up in the Chicagoland area, I got a lot of funny looks for a while before learning my mistake...What kind of casserole is that?nope im from the US. 100% Caucasian lolthat's why it's my favorite and not yoursi fried them with a glass lid ontop the panThe interesting new stuff is mostly being done by the immigrant communities at the moment in St. Louis. Get some Bosnian food while you're in town, then make a trek out to Urban Chestnut's Tower Grove location. They make some damn fine German-American food.

Honestly, though, Edwardsville has a growing food scene out in the Metro East. Cleveland Heath is quite good, and Social has a few dishes that'll knock your socks off all on top of the slightly older good restaurants Peel and Robust. Is West County really that bad in comparison?DiFara's, plan to wait. There is a difference between subs and flatbreads and deli-style, etc. but they are still sandwiches... We can disagree though yeah.*feels privileged to have a giordanos near me in Florida*. Pequod's thin crust is the bomb dot com though.Ouch to Art of Pizza. I guess I just appreciated their convenience.I wishButtercrust, it comes on most of the specialty pizzas, otherwise you need to order it.
Giordano's isn't considered a tourist spot, though it does have locations in touristy areas.

Gino's East and Uno are places only tourists eat. For now, I've chosen to be hetro.Even random hole in the wall places are serving at least a Vienna dog with an S.Rosen's poppyseed bun (which is a damn good baseline).

It's pretty pricey. I usually just wait for my local store to go down in sale.

I'm not going to tell you which because I'm not sure you actually know. I was 100% certain this was a post from /r/justneckbeardthings Fuck yea deep dish! Best kind of pizza! Fuck you New York with your thin limp pizza!I think Kenji wrote it best: Don't think of St. Louis style pizza as a pizza. Think of it as nachos. If you think of it that way, it's really good. There's also Cecil Whittakers as an alternative to Imos (And I think they actually use Provel rather than the Provel-like cheese Imos uses.)

Additionally, there's Peel in the Metro East that puts out a pretty good pizza competing with smaller chains like Dewey's. I also have a special place in my heart for Alfonzo's Pizza since they were attached to the arcade when I was growing up.Hooray, case closed. Thanks. This article struck a chord with me - I made sous vide gefilte fish yesterday and have some 48-hour lamb shanks on now for Friday...The body prioritizes breaking down carbs instead of fat. So in a high carb diet, the carbs are converted into energy, but fat just sits there. So, carbs=bad if you're trying to reduce body fat, but ok if you're a really athletic type.That would be artichoke!i remember after i finished boot camp (navy), we got some liberty to go into chicago. my rdc's kept telling me how awesome giardano's was, so you bet i went straight to the nearest one in chicago city limits. took a picture and showed it to my rdc. worth the 65 bucks i ended up having to pay the cab driver.Bread, ham and cheese together is a sandwich, but not if i serve it diced up in a bowl.

I don't think you can't like deep dish, but I also don't think it's very similar to most other kinds of pizza. It's food but I don't really think it's that close to being pizza. That's my opinion, it's cool if yours is different.With a fork and a knife.This picture depresses me because I have experienced pizza like this, and I know I won't again for years, if ever.There is green pepper poking out  at the bottom, but there's also something else lighter and thinner on the top.

    Buttercrust

    Add Malnati's World Famous Buttercrust! Try it, 'cause Lou likes it! $0.75

That is good that they took notice because a lot of people I knew did not like their gritty crust.
It's considered REAL good.

Gene and Jude's is my favorite out of small local shops, but I eat Portillos once a week. People will argue to the death over which hot dog/beef joint is best, and there ARE better one off's than Portillo's, but I'm a loyalist. When in Chicago next find a Portillo's. Love em.

edit: just saw I was minutes behind somebody else recommending Gene and Jude'sOh.  Spring has sprung here and one can already feel the Chicago Summer starting.  Really there is no reason to not come to Chicago for the summer.  I LOVE PIZZA. But I think it's silly that you are being so dismissive of great pizza because you'd prefer to semantically argue that it isn't pizza. It's crust, sauce and cheese bro.I concurCan we retire you?Yassssss.  Nobody really knows about beggars, but their sauce and sausage is the shiznit.  It's not the generalizations that bother me, it's the simultaneous pride and derision that (anecdotally) I see a lot as someone who lives in the city. It's just hard to reconcile people being proud of something but also trying to distance themselves from it.The key is in the Oil added to the dough. Personally, I do something very similar, BUT, I prefer veg oil mixed with butter. EVO colors the flavor a bit much for me.Green pepperAre there any New York pizza shops that will ship pizza like Giordano's does?I've never had the pleasure of visiting Chicago, however there was a Giordano's near where I lived in Tampa. We ate there once and never again, the crust was so doughy it was disgusting. I feel like I would love Chicago style if the crust was better cooked, I guess I need to make a trip to Chicago sometime soon.People make sweeping generalizations about their city based on their own preferences all the time.No  matter what they say, this is not a pizza. It's more like a salty pie.Spent the night in a hotel on the forth in Feb, no bacon and my tomato was raw. Never again.

Edit: Day 4, No beans, black pudding. Sign me up.Not for nothing but I would eat that shit up in no time! Image 4 - cured ham!I just don't understand arguing with people about what they call their food.  A deep dish pizza tells me everything I need to know about it in the name.  It's some kind of pizza, which means dough, cheese, sauce, and toppings, served in a deep dish, implying that it'll be thicker than other pizzas.Go for the pizza, but stay because you were murdered.***Grandma Andy's Stick-to-Your-Ribs Homemade South-of-the-Border Blue Ribbon New England Style Slap-Yo-Momma Chicken Noodle Soup by Guy Fieri***

*Stock*

-Whole chicken carcass, raw (or roasted for browner stock)

-2-4 Ribs Celery, the leafy centers if you have them, cut into 4" pieces

-2-4 Medium Carrots, peeled and cut into 4" pieces

-5 Radishes, rinsed and halved

-1/2 Turnip, peeled and cut again in half

-1 Parsnip, peeled and cut into 4" pieces

-1 Whole Head Garlic, cut in half widthwise (so every clove is halved), no need to peel

-1 Leek, rinsed and halved, roots discarded

-1 Onion, quartered

-3 Scallions, roots discarded OR 1 Shallot, halved

-10 Sprigs of Thyme

-10 Sprigs of Parsley

-Salt, whole peppercorns

In a large, heavy-bottomed stock pot over medium-high heat, brown the chicken thighs on both sides.  While browning, peel and chop the vegetables as detailed above.  Once the chicken skin is golden and the visible meat cooked, remove and drain on paper towels.  Discard the chicken fat, reserving 1-2 teaspoons in the bottom of the stockpot.  Brown the onion on all sides in reserved chicken fat over medium heat.  Once onions are browned, add remaining chopped vegetables, herbs, and salt/pepper, and return chicken to the pot.  Cover with cold water, and increase heat to high until the water comes to a boil.  Lower the heat to a bare simmer, and continue to cook uncovered for 4 hours.  As the stock simmers, skim foam, fat, and impurities from the water's surface, as these will cloud the stock.  When the stock is done, strain it through cheesecloth into a metal or heat-safe bowl, and allow to sit for 10 minutes.  As impurities and fat rise to the top, skim them off.

*Chicken Noodle Soup*

-1 Tbsp Olive Oil

-1 Leek, white section only, rinsed, halved, and chopped into bite-size pieces

-3 Scallions, white sections only, roots discarded, minced OR 1 Shallot, peeled and minced

-1/4 Cup Turnip, peeled and chopped finely

-1/4 Cup Parsnip, peeled and chopped finely

-3 Radishes, halved and sliced thinly

-4 Large Carrots, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces

-4 Ribs Celery, cut into bite-size pieces

-2 Tbsp Fresh Dill (or to taste), chopped

-Stock (recipe above)

-4 Chicken Thighs

-Fresh or Dried Egg Noodles

-2 Tbsp Fresh Flat-Leaf Parsley (or to taste), chopped

In large stock pot, heat olive oil over low-medium heat.  Add leeks and scallions/shallots, cook slowly, do not sear.  Once scallions/shallots have softened, add turnip, parsnip, radishes, carrots, celery, and dill - stir to evenly heat, but do not cook.  Add stock, enough to cover the vegetables with room for meat and noodles - you may need to add water to make enough room for the chicken and noodles - do this now.  Bring to a simmer, and add chicken thighs.  Cook chicken thighs completely, place on a cutting board, discard skin/fat/bones, and shred meat.  Return shredded meat to the pot.  At this point, your vegetables should be tender but firm, and not have lost their flavor - if they are undercooked, allow to simmer for an additional 5 minutes.  Add chopped parsley, and remove from heat.  Salt and pepper to taste, garnish with parsley, and serve.  Cook noodles in the soup that's being served - do not store the soup with noodles in it, as they will get soggy.  You couldn't fold a sloppy pizza the tip would dip.  With good NY pizza when you fold it, the crust needs to be firm enough that the tip of the pizza doesn't dip at all, but it needs to be soft enough that the crust isnt brittle and doesn't snap. Super Dawg is good maybe once a year as kind of a nostalgia thing.  Remember going with parents when I was young and friends in high school when I was also still young.

Next time you're in the Chicago area there is a place just off Grand and River Road.  Gene and Judes.  They've been around for like 40 years doing the same exact thing.  Bit different than what other might consider a Chicago style hotdog but it's relish, onion, mustard, and sport peppers.  Every hotdog comes with fries that go right on top.  Not fancy in the least.  No sitting room unless you sit in your car and I guarantee you'll think on it fondly and tell everyone about it. &gt; --- Said no one ever.

Can we retire this phrase?&gt;floppy bread taco that is New York-style

I am not a violent person but my first instinct upon reading that was to strike you. It's so cute how Chicago thinks they know how to make a pizza. Damn, I associate "tuna salad" with a scoop of fishy mayonnaise. This is real tuna salad.This looks delicious, but really filling.  What are the light green bits, artichoke? I had Giordano's near the airport, and what you say makes sense about their crust.  I thought it was under done, but otherwise delicious.  Does it help to ask for the crust well done, or will it never get cooked through without negatively affecting the rest of the pizza?

Also, is it weird to say their caesar salad was awesome?  We split this enormous salad as an appetizer and it was head and shoulders above caesar salads you get at even upscale restaurants.  Delicately arrange three broccoli crests on the seat of the wooden chair.  Place a moist towel over the pieces, covering them entirely.  Take care not to disturb the setting and leave the area.I've been on a Black Sheep kick recently, its nothing like a Chicago deep dish, but its still damn good.I never fully understood how Americans can eat such Pizza? A Pizza needs thin crunchy dough and thin toppingIs that a donner pizza and where do i go get it
Great summary, only one I would definitely add is Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinders. Every single thing on their menu is great. Pizza pot pie is unique and when you mix the two salad dressings (to eat with everything from salad to Mediterranean bread) it is magic..I'm sure many guys will be thankful for this groundbreaking adviceMake yourself a favour and shut up, please.In Europe that would never be classified as a pizza. It looks like a pie. I'm sure you Americans like it, but i have very serious doubts that would be sold anywhere in Europe. It looks like you'd gain a kilo from just looking at the thingfrito pie and chili cheese tater tots. Salmon cakes sounds nice, and so does a simple plain salmon if you are having a green salad. I suggest simple and easy, and light. Sounds like you were on the right track. You can never go wrong with some cute little finger sandwiches either!You are legendarily stupidWhat are you talking about?  They renamed it after the greatest Chicagoan who ever lived, Wesley Willis.  At least that's what I tell myself whenever I see it called by that name.the absolute best chicago pizza. i used to work at a company HQ'ed in Chicago. A couple times a year, we would all go to Chicago for meetings, and end up at Maxwell St Polish near the UC campus at 2 in the morning. it didnt feel remotely safe at all, but nothing better than getting a couple polish with onions and mustard and a bag full of fries and grape soda for like $4. Looks absolutly amazing. A Pizza Pie done right yeah?(Apparently girls are suckers for oral. Who would've known? Take note boys)Yeah but compared to a sandwich it's low carb. To *repeat* it's high fat but the crust in proportion to all the rest is pretty low, because there is a ton of topping. A decent sandwich would be about 2/3 bread, 1/3 filling but this is about 1/10 crust. As a precaution I only message these types of deals with smoke signals and pigeons...Looks more like baked burritos. Casseroles are served in a dish you dipshit.Who gives a shit?Vito and Nick's must be mentioned with thin crust pizzas. It just has to be. It is the best pizza in Chicago.Cuz there is no argument about what nfl team is better. Da bears. PeriodI was thinking the same thing. http://i.imgur.com/OjpKacg.jpg As a fellow Philadelphian, you're right.  This is what I use to make mine.  I cook it in a large cast iron skillet and this recipe will make enough dough for one pizza:

    * 1T active dry yeast

    * 2t Sugar

    * 1 1/4 cups Warm water

    * 2 3/4 cups Allpurpose flour

    * 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal

    * 3T Olive oil

    * 1t Salt

Mix the yeast, sugar, and water in a small bowl and let stand for 5 minutes or so.  Mix the flour, cornmeal, and salt in a large bowl.  Add the oil and yeast/water mixture and knead for 7 to 10 minutes (I use a breadhook on a Kitchenaid).  Let rise for 1 hour, then punch it down and use it to cover the bottom and sides of a large cast iron skillet.  I rub some olive oil on the dough before putting on the sauce since I feel it keeps it from getting too soggy.  Add your favorite sauce and cheeses and bake at 475 for about 25 to 30 minutes.Did I say it was bad?  OP is obviously on some sort of diet.  When I hear someone on a diet say "cheat", all I can think about is how they are "cheating" themselves.  He/She is on a diet for a reason.A list without Vito and Nick's isn't a list at all.

Also, while technically not from Chicago, Aurelio's always deserves an honorable mention.Ricobennys! South side off the Orange line on Pulaski.Bro, do you even map?I accept that there's neapolitan, NYC style, NH style, Greek/medium-crust style, St. Louis, California, etc. etc. etc.

Deep dish is just much more different than any of those are from the "platonic ideal" of pizza, insomuch as that exists. It lacks qualities that some people associate with pizza.

That's all I said - I didn't attack different styles of pizza or say I don't accept that different types of the same food exist. I said it's foolish that some people don't realize why other people think deep dish is weird, or that it's food but not really pizza.Maybe it's because I'm from brooklyn but this looks gross to me.I make my burritos with panda meat. It's a real lean meat with a kind of sweetness to it. It's actually illegal to kill and eat panda bears here in Asia but it's worth it. I'll make you 10 It's a casserole, not pizzaIt's just kind of gross with the ravioli, in general I agree with you. Deep-fried pasta doesn't do it for me, though.As current Chicagoan....well done. I'm already not a huge fan of the pizza hereI love pizza. I have a passion for pizza. What do you love?The crust is actually about as thick as pie crust though.Fuck the packers. Commenting as a bookmark.  12 days and i am back at lou'sIt's weird, most Chicagoans prefer Chicago thin crust pizza &gt; Bitch, what do you think the Italians in Italy, you know, the actual home of pizza, think about your definition of 'pizza'? And even there I'm sure they have arguments over what's better between pizza napolitana, pizza rustico, pizza al taglio, Sfincione, etc.

Don't both styles exist in Italy?Using a blender I guess?So what's the best pizza in Chicago? Also the fact that you just  admitted you can find any source stating Somalia has better dental care also means that you could find any source that says the UK has the best dental care. Duhhh so your point is that your information could easily be crap? But seriously, Chicago-style hot dogs are worlds above whatever sad wieners New York has to offer.How does 30 mins of clitoral stimulation sound?I've never even been to Chicago and still call it the Sears Tower. Calling it the Willis Tower seems (is) wrong.Avocado = healthy fats and potassium
Tomato/onion = potassium, fiber, vitamins

Replace that cheese with another vegetable like black beans and substitute a whole wheat tortilla for that white one and bingo very well rounded meal!My pleasure.First I thought april fools, then I read what it was made of and it actually sound like it might be good.Thank you so much.
It's good drunk foodIn these unnecessary debates, it almost always boils down to which style and location of pizza is better; Chicago-style stuffed pizza or the NYC-style thin crust pie.

First, forget about locations, no one will agree on where you should go for pizza in either city, and the ratio of mediocre/bad places to holy grail locations is about the same in either city, in my opinion.

Next, forget the casserole gambit or the anorexic pizza retort. You're an asshole if you dismiss food because it isn't categorized correctly or if it's not enough. Why would anyone balk at good food. I know plenty of people who don't like stuffed or don't like thin crust, and they're all sinners who will pay the price in hell, but everyone else I know who loves pizza loves both styles, because they ultimately love food. And if they're still hungry, they get more.

Also, both Chicago- and NYC-style are not staples. They're proud civic traditions at best, and over-exploited gimmicks at worst. It's true, most Chicagoans don't have stuffed every time they have pizza. That's a lot of fucking food! If we wanted to die in our mid-forties, then maybe we'd consider it. And I've experienced the same thing being in New York. The slices are huge, and that's wonderful, but there really isn't a classy way to eat it, so I tend to wait til a weekend where I can enjoy a slice or three in peaceful shame.

Finally, this post-and other posts like it-was not intended as an ignition to debate. It was a chronicling and sharing of an experience with food, a thing we all enjoy. It was meant for us to come together and share our love for the existence and tradition of food.

Enjoy food for the sake of food.Your pictures are amazing, what kind of camera do you use? Looks horrible, tbh...It's funny because "Chicago Style Deep Dish" isn't eaten all that often by most Chicagoans. Typically, we get a style I'm not even sure what it's called. Super thin, nearly crackery, crust that's cut into squares. In my pizza eating life, I've eaten that 50x as often as deep dish or stuffed.

If you ever want to try the best place for that style, you go to Nick and Vito's on 85th and Pulaski. There can be no argument. It is hands down the best in the city. I'm moving to Chicago in July. I'm so excited. Where is "here"?  I'm in Dallas, I keep mine in a big pot and then bring it to my garage in winter with a light.  :)  NOTHING beats home grown! Personally, Jet's is my favorite for an impulse pizza. Especially if someone's coming over last minute to hang out or to watch movies. The only thing is it's a bit expensive for the quality but they have a great selection of stuff so just about anyone's happy. It's definitely a step above something like Domino's or Papa Johns (for me anyway).'Murica.Last time I was in Chicago, we were running late, but still wanted deep dish. We were trying to make it to Pequod's but it was too far from where we were, and where we were going, so we ended up at Lou's. It straight up sucked compared to my previous good experiences at Giordano's. It tasted like it was frozen, and just warmed up in the oven. Since we ordered a custom pie, it had to be cooked on top of the base layer pizza we started from. It was really obvious that the pizza was made in some factory and had our custom ingredients added. I'm through with Lou's. This was my second attempt to try them out since everyone raved about it. Not so good.I can't compare since I've never been to a Chicago Giordano's.  I've only tried Gino's and Lou Malnati's in Chicago.As a fair warning you'll hate your small town pizza after having Chicago style. It's happened to everyone I know from back home. you mean that pita bread with cheese?

[This](http://pestochampionship.it/en/about-pesto/official-championship-recipe.html) recipe seems really legit.  However, I can't think of a more incendiary term than "traditional" to describe a recipe.  That's just asking for trouble.  There is a non-traditional way?I'll have to see how many gifts I'm givenLou's specialFor me it's not a debate, both are good in different situations.

NY-style is good for a quick bite or drunk food, I mean, you don't even really need a plate.

Chicago-style is a sit-down meal that takes 40-minutes just to prepare.

I have never met anyone from the east coast that flat-out didn't like Chicago-style pizza, but by far the most obnoxious response is this:

"It's really good...but it's not pizza! It's a casserole!"

Bitch, what do you think the Italians in Italy, you know, the actual home of pizza, think about your definition of 'pizza'? And even there I'm sure they have arguments over what's better between *pizza napolitana*, *pizza rustico*, *pizza al taglio*, *Sfincione*, etc.

It's all pizza, it's all good, you don't get to define it, New York motherfuckers. "Congratulations! World's best ~~cup of coffee~~ pizza! Wow!" if you're confident in your attentiveness you can try to pre cook the crust so that it cooks properly.

deep dishes tend to have problems with the bottom not cooking properly.Thanks! I'll have to check them outOMG, fuck this place. That ain't pizza. People that like it have poor taste.http://mywishisnodishes.com/no-bake-birds-nest-cookies/I was following along til you said Peaquad's crust is shit. Just no.

FILTHY AFI visited Chicago once and ended up randomly going to this hotdog place a little north of he city called Superdawgs. It was like an old-timey drive-in. I just saw it while driving and decided to try it, and it was one of the best dogs i've ever had. Is it considered any good to you Chicagans(?), or just meh? I'm from California, so hot dogs aren't really our thing besides Pink's in LA I guess...but I thought Superdawgs was better. I go to Chicago a lot for work, and ive been branching my Italian beef game to outside of portillos. Granted I did go to portillos twice last trip. But so far I have found that jays in shiller park is better. your flat bread too dry then.I think people would be less pissed if they just called it a cheesy tomato hotdish. Cause that's what it is. But I suppose that's not a really marketable word.Hahaha, I love it.  Totally agreed.  I've visited a few times an heard it.  I've heard entire rants about the dudes who go to the bars near Wrigley and drink only Olde Style.  I never had Italian beef when I was there, but later on I caught one of the Man vs. Food segments where he went to Al's Italian Beef.  Now, I really, really wanna try this.  They actually taste quite similar to brownies due to their texture.Day 3Thank you!

The dough freezes beautifully so I am always able to get my chocolate fix. :)You're dumb for drinking angry orchard.
It burns coming out the same way it will going in, not much to change that I visited Chicago a few years ago and the guy at my hotel directed me to Giordano's due to it being my first "real pizza in a real pizza city." It was a super solid pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I still prefer Philly style./u/thesandragon PLEEEEASE MAKE ME THIS, YOU GLORIOUS MEXICAN!Of course I do - but I'm just clarifying that Congress didn't say "pizza is a vegetable". From the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/did-congress-declare-pizza-as-a-vegetable-not-exactly/2011/11/20/gIQABXgmhN_blog.html), "Congress passed a revised agriculture appropriations bill last week, essentially making it easier to count pizza sauce as a serving of vegetables." I have a subscription to better homes and gardens. I don't think I've ever seen flowers in the garden pics. Ill have to go through my archives and see.


Edit. In the oct 1997 issue there is a picture of a garden with flowers next to a fence


Edit 2. I meant to type the flowers are between the fence and the garden so not sure if the flowers are actually part of the gardenTourist.You missed Gulliver's bro. Also Carmen's used to be pretty good.

Otherwise spot on.Chicago is foodie heaven.  What exactly do you have to do?I love you for saying this.It's definitely more of a suburban staple, but it's great.

I was forever sold when a guy gave me a free cake-shake for wearing my Blackhawks sweater out, and there were probably twenty other people wearing the same thing (playoff season).what's you take on beggar's pizza?Breadstick Grovegarden

Also A vegetable garden does not typicaly have one type of  vegetable in it.We're getting a Giardano's in minneapolis this month! I hope it doesn't close down like uno's did :(I've been to Chicago a number of times and never made it out for pizza.  From what I'm reading here, I should just hit up the touristy places like Gino's or Uno.  You know anything about Oven Baked?Depends on your perspective of 'healthy'. No traditional crust=no carbs, and for people on a low-carb high-fat diet, items like that are a godsend.

Edit: wordsSalutations intensify!!!Haha I'm not succeeding in winding you up? No I think I am Haha you just reverted to cursing and dim witted language.  And again it's egotistic for you to say you invented Indian Food when you cane up with a couple dishes, why not  take credit for another people culture entirely.. you do know that the UK has one of the worst rates of obesity in the world Too right? especially in Europe.  I literally told you I hadn't been there is that how you knew Sherlock? I obviously made you mad or you wouldn't haven taken the time to type 4 paragraphs ha. Really did I say the ONLY thing there known for? No I said they are known for this, which is fact,  so you can throw a fit like a child and start throwing slander or talking about inventions and history when your still not even understanding what I said because your brain only works on one level: "this is an insult must defend" you literally make yourself come off like an egotistical slackjaw who resorts to falsifying facts and cursing haha yeah I'm soooo jealous. (Sarcasm in case you don't know what that is) again teenage girl think in this fashion "she's so jealous of me." Grow up and don't take everything so personally.. or not your comebacks don't really have any substance anyways. Isn't Pizano's run by Rudy Malnati Jr? How could it be so different than Lou Malnati's?

And according to Wiki, Rudy Malnati Sr claims to have developed the recipe for the deep dish pizza at Pizzeria Uno.

Like Jesus...how do the Malnatis have their fingers in so many pies?It looks good! Not sure it's pizza but this fat guy would tear that shit up!It is.More for us then. Enjoy your cardboard pizza.It's pizza-ish.  It's got dough, cheese, sauce, but they probably serve it with a fork and knife.   My biggest concern is that they're drinking apple juice with it.  Pizza is washed down with a god damn beer.  I would do some mini fish cakes, and a gazpacho. Maybe a vinegar based coleslaw, with green apples and cranberries.

I'd also go with the garlic-asparagus, and a lemon-olive oil rapini too.peppers, olives &amp; onions. OP fillingsWhile you're in town, make sure you do the architecture boat tour. Might be over-recommended on /r/chicago but it definitely isn't overrated.Don't worry, I had 3 ;)(It was April Fool's Day yesterday when I posted this you know).did you ever do Gulliver's on Howard?  That was my favorite pizza.I'd bet that if they weren't called the same thing people wouldn't be arguing over which is better.

Chicago-style seems like a unique enough divergence from what's commonly known as pizza that it could have a new name.How?A garden is a place where vegetables are grown not flowers. Jon Stewart laying waste to deep-dish pizza.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrqSizC-T-4&gt;Pizano's is basic bitch pizza.

This almost made me tear up from laughing.We prefer "Chiberia".Dude, it's just thick pizza. It's gonna be okay.Also with duck-fat roasted Cipollini onions.

http://nerdswithknives.com/roasted-cipollini-onions-with-thyme/

I got the pleasure to attend this restaurant in chicago. Can confirm that the pizza will leave you breathless.This reminds me of my days in college. I'd mix in Jalapeno Cheetos (crushed) in with my Easy Mac for dinner. Actually pretty awesome.
That is not how English works. A flower garden does not typicaly have one type of flower in it.Taste of Chicago? Are you serious? That event is a shithole.You know the best way to get downvotes?

I think the west coast has an amazing selection of great pizza places. I had a Gino's East pizza and it was delicious.It's not.That's just not true, about the chains and franchises. St. Louis has a pretty thriving restaurant scene, and you don't even have to look that far. EVERYWHERE has chains. As a Minnesotan who visited Chicago in September, Lou's is fantastic. I've also had Giordano's and I figured it was the best because it's all I've ever had but Lou's pizza was some of the best pizza I've ever had and I pride myself on searching for pizza joints around MN because of my love of the pie. Although there is a Giordano's coming to Minneapolis in June that I'll happily frequent because it was also great.Heartburnnnn the acidy heartburnCome for the Burger, stay for the Music.I'm hoping to go to the new Giordano's in Indy tomorrow night. How much different is it than in Chicago?Looks like a quicheLou's has a special crust you can ask for, i forget what it's called but it makes it better. And if you're in the suburbs Lou's is consistently the best deep dish.As a Chicagoan, one of the better places for a slice of deep dish in Chicago is ironically called 'Philly's Best'.

I mean, they do cheesesteaks first and foremost, but you gotta hand it to them for getting the deep dish right.They put clams on their pizza. It's not even fair.I've been getting Lion's Choice for over 30 years. I haven't detected any quality dip at all. And I'd put it up against any fast food in the country. I'm curious due to the fact it's not on your list, what's your opinion of Gino's East?Semi-toxic? ...sort of poisonousSince when is just dropping something in a deep fryer bad?That decline happens everywhere.

I think St. Louis has a weird niche for fine dining that prefers established, more old-school restaurants. There's a lot of history that is eagerly maintained (I think the Hill is a great example of this, tons of older restaurants, that do very well [they also make really great food]). There are only a small handful of people doing new and interesting things. I first went to Pastaria on a Friday night around 8 (about a year and a few months ago), we were able to get a table really easily. If that restaurant were in another city, it would be damn packed on a Friday night.

Though, I should give note that my views are influenced heavily by growing up in West County (kind of a food desert, save for Annie Guns). If you went out to the Houston suburbs, you probably wouldn't find much better. But, the inner loop here has so much exciting dining that I can't handle it all. Midwestern born New Yorker here. I LOVE deep dish pizza. But the best imo has the cheese *on top*. Totally changes the taste of deep dish from weird, to amazing.

(Also I hate about 90% of NYC pizza, sadly.)It's good, but if you're not careful, it may fly off your plate with it's broomstick.You can have Lous shipped to you frozen and just pop it in the oven for 45 mins. Still very good.God I miss real Italian pizza. Mail me one?I've got to disagree on Pequod's crust being bad.  The crust is the main draw for that place.  Lou Malnati's does not have the best crust by any means, they are pretty much on par with Giordano's.

Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder has a "pizza pot pie" that is fun. But honestly their salad dressing is where it's at.hahahaha edibles are a fickle mistressGiordano's is good. But the local restaurants in Chicago offer what some might argue as better deep dish.

My example would be Alberto's pizza over by the morse red line. Even the thin crust is delicious  Nice analysis, but I can't agree with the last sentence. I love deep dish pizza and if I'm in Chicago I feel obliged to get some. It's not very common outside of Chicago, so it is novel in that sense. But you can find good pizza almost anywhere. I'm from Ohio, which is not considered a big pizza locale. But my favorite pizza has still been from home rather than abroad, as great as some of those places are. I've had a handful of Chi-town places including Pequod's (in restaurant) and Giordano's. Love it love it love it but that's cause it's big thick pizza, still not my favorite/the best pizza I've ever had.

The same can be said for the big deal pizza joints I've been to in New York. Yup, that's pizza. Yup, that's delicious. But there's nothing about it that separates it as clearly superior from the rest of the country. It's just misplaced pride on food regionalism.

Again, very nice analysis, only really commenting on the idea that out-of-towners will all come away feeling like they've had the best because they visited Chicago.WTF is wrong with you people.

Pizza should be flat.

Steam it. I melt butter over it. sprinkle some salt pepper and dip it in thick and hearty A1 sauce. Hope this helps!That's.. I mean you do understand why the sauce on pizzas can't possibly be labeled a serving of vegetables, right?Of course I'm not, Chicago and NY pizza are obviously different. I just think both are shit compared to real Italian pizza which they are. There's no contest. Ramen in London and Paris might be great but it's not like ramen in Tokyo. What steps are required to get my dick blown?


^^^DISCLAIMER: ^^^idontactuallyhaveadickTell me there's a defibrillator in that place, or at least it's next door to a hospital....by not eating that more often. That really isn't bad for you.It actually isn't bacon they are salami bits. I go to school with a bunch of people from Chicago, all I hear about is your food and Lous and portillos and more pizza, then they argue about the cubs and the socks, never the bears which is weird. Drunk food is food you wouldn't eat soberI feel like you and I wouldn't get along at all in real life.

Pizza is a beautiful thing. Some of its good, some bad. Many varieties exist. Most are good. People who talk like East coast pizza is the only pizza don't know jack shit. My first thought when someone corrects it as Willis Tower is you are not from Chicago. If he could take Obama's cock out of his mouth for a minute
to try deep dish, maybe he'd actually like it.Part of me wants this to actually be spaghetti... and not cake... So they can't both be called "pizza?"From Chicago, never been a fan of deep dish, I'm good with just real good mom and pop neighborhood pizza. That deep dish stuff seemed to me like a north side thing, or pizza that people from Iowa or the suburbs would eat when they visit Chicago for the weekends. But I guess if you twisted my arm I would have to say Lou's is probably the best in the city. Whatever you do, DONT EVER EAT PIZANOS PILE OF FECES PIZZA. Their pizza is straight ASS, especially their thin crust. You want good pizza, go to Phil's in Bridgeport or Lena's, there is also Triano's and few others on the south side, not sure about the north side. For deep dish, go with Lou's. This.  This right here... one of the best reasons that I moved to Chicago...Chicago-style pizza is [not only not better than NY pizza ... it's not pizza](https://youtu.be/BrqSizC-T-4?t=35s).Might as well be a calzoneThere are a couple of ways. Make the base, drop the eggs in the simmering base and baste the egg whites with a little of the tomato sauce, put a cover on and cBest way if you are good at it (I'm not that good). Another way - the cheating way - is to poach the eggs and drop them into the base. Let them simmer for about a minute in the base and then dig in. I usually do that. Easier and the eggs turn out tastier. Look for my next "reply" and I'll share my recipe.
HOLY SHIT. Buying one now. Good thing i'm bulkingNo Beggar's love?Loaf?

Looks more like a pie. You are only cheating yourself.Oh koo!! I LOVE BLACK BEANS!!I want to go to Chicago this summer so... Your comment is now saved. AKA a proper Chicago deepdish pizza.Giordano's pizza walks up to your silly "Low-Carb" food, kicks it in the crotch, and steals their girlfriend.Deep dish crust is traditionally made from corn meal.  That is like 40 extra servings of vegetables.  Healthiest casserole ever.This is a pizza casserole, not pizza. Pizza is like sex. When it's good, it's great. And when it's bad, it's still pretty damn good. Do not forget kuma's korner. Oh my god, i've never eaten a better burger in my life.That's a beautiful casserole.I live in Denver now, but I used to live in Chicago and eat Lou Malnatis every Sunday. My Uncle used to send me 12 pizzas for Christmas and I would get to make 1 a month:) They should just be called different things because they are different things. Like the football debate.I disagree on piece. You should go in there again and let that red sauce sink in a bit more. It's on the acidic side and it's so damn good I would cover myself in cheese, grab a few crusts, and take a bath in it.

That is not pizza. That is cake with cheese and tomatoes. Nice! The local spot serves that dish too and it's easily my favorite.

[Yum!](http://i.imgur.com/lRtilkM.jpg)Awesome. I always either try to eat at Giordanos or Lou Malnatis when I visit Chicago. Boiler Room! A location is about to open in Minneapolis. After having tried it in Chicago I'm excited.To expand on pizano's: there's almost no sauce. Their crust is thin yet crispy and sturdy, but flavorless. Their pizza's strength is in its amount of cheese and the good intensity of its flavor. You can get tired of it pretty quickly though since it's the only thing you taste.

I disagree with Uno and Gino's recipes being the same; their crusts are largely different. Gino's has a thicker, softer crust, and their sauce is on the sweet side. Uno has a thinner, crispier crust and their sauce is rather normal/expected flavor for deep dish.Former Chicagoan living in the twin cities. Lou malnatis is the best. But I guess I can deal with giordanos since they are opening one in Minneapolis in the next few months! I can finally eat pizza and not cry!I put a frozen pizza in the oven and hope I don't fall asleep...People who don't accept that there can be different "styles" of pizza just like there can be different styles of wine, beer, even chili, are the foolish ones. I mean, what's the deal with provincialism?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrqSizC-T-4

'nuf saidI would take a fist full of lactaid if I could have but one bite of that glorious pie. I live in Chicago. I love pizza. I do not appreciate stuffed pizza like I appreciate Domino's, or if we have to go smaller, I prefer the big floppy NY style slices like Bacci's. I don't eat Italian beef or hotdogs or kielbasas either so I essentially have to conceal my eating habits from diehard Chicago foodies like a little Anne Frank. As a current Chicagoan, I have the agree with everything this guy says.OMG I miss there pizza!  Everytime I'm in Chicago I get it at least twiceMy girlfriend makes this joke all the time. It saddens me. The only correct person in this thread.  New Haven style pizza &gt; *.My knives are great...it's my cutting board that sucks ;-)

The interplay between the sauce and cheese is the key to making good pizza, so using the cheese and sauce in an entirely different way (both in order and proportion) mean that executing a good deep dish is entirely different than executing a good pizza.Why so pretentious? Do the Sumerians get mad at Italians for their "abominazione" of an economy?But that's the shape it is. It's just calling it by its nameI've lived in Chicago for a few years now, and I agree with you. Chicagoans have this circle jerk about pizza, and are almost always quick to judge you, or point out how the pizza is "touristy" if you like Giordano's or Gino's pizza. Personally, I've had pizza from many of the places listed on the original comment, and I've enjoyed them all. Sometimes I've enjoyed a pie in one place more than another, but usually when I go back to try the food again, the pizza is fine.

The same thing happens with Italian beef. If you tell Chicagoans that you like the food at Portillo's, then all you'll get is a bunch of comments about how they aren't even that good, but just well known. The next thing you know, people start arguing about how the best Italian beef is at X joint, or at Y place (which only makes Italian beef sandwiches - and nothing else - so they should know what they're doing)... arrgh. Enough is enough. It all is good, why do we have to make it into a competition? Can't we just eat the food, and just appreciate it for what it is without judgment or petty criticism? Done fucking deal. Please PM me so we can arrange the details of this new partnership. CPOG FTWAnd once the little local place becomes a local chain, there is always the inevitable decline in quality and taste. I tried to get some food at El Maguey last time I was in town, and it *really* is a shadow of its former self. I think Lions Choice has held up well, but they seem to have started to fall into the standard drive-thru rules.

Yeah, I agree about other cities with actual food cultures. Being in those other areas is a real eye-opener after being in St. Louis for a while. That doesn't look very appealing to me. Not to mention the tomato sauce.Girodano's is OK.  I prefer Edwardo's and Carmen's.  Indeed they have a better crust.  Carmen's can deliver it in less than an hour.No, man, now it's the ~~Willis Tow--~~

*murdered by the entire population of Chicago*Are you chilean?
Gross, Lou Malnatis is where it's at!Hotdog buns vineyardAny food looks delicious when you're drunk.  I'll raid the cabinets and eat whatever I can find when I'm wasted.Great analysis, I almost 100% agree with you, especially on Pequod's.   I have never tried Burt's and will make it a point now. 2 things Chicagoans never agree on are the best directions and who has the best food. I sir will subscribe to your newsletter.Yes....  Love it whenever I'm flying through ORD.Exactly.

That exact tin opener that was next to the hammer, because Sober you remembered what happened last time and put it there for good measure. Low and behold, Drunk you done fucked up again.

Still got the job done.I love Giordano's. Haven't had it since the vacation I proposed to my now wife. A few weeks ago we were in Indy and wanted to eat at the new one there, but we were told there was a 3 hour wait and we had hungry children with us.

It was so sad. Like I said, this pizza holds a special place for us. On the next anniversary of our engagement I plan to have some shipped to us, but the price to ship a frozen pizza is pretty high. I have been wanting to order some of Giordano's frozen pizza because I live in Michigan, has anybody done this? Does it work out?Other than the cheese and white tortilla that still looks pretty healthy. depending on how lean the beef is that could be considered a healthy meal. Avocado, tomato, onion, lean ground beef. Shit, now I'm really hungry for burrito's!Curious if you've ever been to Oakland California and tried Zacharys. If so I'd be interested to hear an unbiased (ie not "its not Chicago so it sucks) comparison. I haven't been to Chicago for pizza but I am a little obsessed with zacharys.I'd agree with that.

There are definitely a few gems in St. Louis, but after having spent some time in some cities with larger food cultures, I definitely realize how much St. Louis revolves around franchise restaurants, hell even the most popular local places become weird mini-chains (Imo's, El Maguay, Lions Choice, etc...). When you're actually drunk, it doesn't look this neat.+1 this guy knows what he's talking about. everyone's autistic you miserable fuck.I'm a protein eating paleo idiot. Give me this right now. Mine.

Pappy's is southern style BBQ, and while Sugarfire is local, it doesn't follow the old St. Louis BBQ style (flavoring wise). There are a few smaller joints here and there that do, but St. Louis (and the surrounding area) is mostly a city that caters to chains and franchises. Nancy's is the best.Props for Chicago style thin crust. Love that stuff.Rancho restaurant, 1210 Irving blvd.

Another great place for breakfast, and only open for breakfast is Carmen's Mexican cafe, off Singleton in west Dallas.I'm sure OP's taste good. But you will never impress a Greek with this recipe. When they are made this way, the just don't taste the same. Yeah I don't think it's garbage either, I'll eat it maybe once every couple years or if a visiting friend really wants to go. I just think it's strange that there's this mix of intense pride and defensiveness with (abecdotally) relatively common declarations that it's not eaten often by people who live in the city or that "real" Chicago pizza is the crunchy, thin-crust tavern-cut style.with your hands.
You have left out the best deep dish pizza in Chicago IMHO, which is of a similar type to Giordano's but better: NANCY'S.   MmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmI was in Orlando last week and was thinking..."man I'd love some good pizza"; on a whim just looked up Giordano's and was amazed to find 3 in the area (we were staying in Kissimmee and there was one about 10 minutes away).  You can even get it delivered to your hotel.  I agree with yyoo...get it, you won't regret it.  Also, as others mentioned; get a bigger one than you need and save the leftovers for the next day.  Glorious.
I'm Julius Pepperwood, I'm from Chicago.  Thin crust pizza no thank you.Looks like a hunk of shitIs there flour in the topping/filling?
An orchard typically would have one type of olive but I think a garden would most likely have several.

Orchard -&gt; farmer
Garden -&gt; olive enthusiast No, /u/iaintbatman perhaps you are the retard failing to use proper vernacular even in your name. Education is key hereAs someone who became lactose intolerant late in life, I am so so so so jealous. NYC style to an extent and NH style (significantly more so than NYC's) are both much closer to the "modern" Italian pizza - Neapolitan style - than deep dish. Also there are straight-up neapolitan pizza restaurants in the US, some are even certified as offering "authentic" Italian pizza.Savory cake.
Yummy cheese and tomato casserole...I gotta say though, Bartoli's (Damen and Addison, by Addison Brown Line) Chicago Stockyard deep dish pizza (Italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, prosciutto &amp; Italian beef) cannot be matched. It's a small joint, maybe seating for 15, but amazing.The crust on that seems to be amazing. Often the crusts tend to be doughy and heavy, but this appears crusty on the outside and light and airy on the inside this is the way it should be done.We're talking about hearty, tasty, full bodied pizza, not paper thin fold over that just can't handle the ingredients on top of it. ;)they should rename it to Breadstick GardenPizza is not a pie.An olive garden typically only contains one type of olive. By the looks of the cilantro it seems like you need a sharper knife ;) good work though!What? How do you fold it in half if the crust is crunchy?It's simply not the culture found in the country of origin.Once it becomes over who whipped into butter, I don't think there is any going back. But I hope you find a way!People assume NY pizza is all soggy because there are pizza joints on every corner serving shitty dollar slices. Any good pizzeria in the city usually has their crust on point. Especially if you hit up a Neapolitan style pizzeria...Yeah, YOU think its shit. Apparently over 2000 others in this thread disagree with you, so your irrational hate is your own problem. In MY opinion, Neapolitan is shit, so your entire argument is hypocritical.

You're also assuming that all American pizza is the same, every city has different types **INCLUDING** neopolitan, so again, your argument is an irrational overgeneralization.

And no, I'm comparing a Lamborghini (US pizza) to a Nissan altima (neopolitan). Over priced and unreliable Uno and Chicago pizza both use that same pizza size sausage in their sausage pizzas. Lou's is overrated considerably, and their crust was always the weak part.

Giordanos crust was ALWAYS crushing it, always.  I don't know why you find their crust weak.

Connie's is excellentI know what you mean. Even from good places you might get a stinker once in awhile. I'm betting it's harder to get a crunchy crust right since it's easy to over- or undershoot the target.Smitten kitchen has a pancake 101, the recipe is super easy and they are AMAZING! My recommendation is to fluff up your egg whites and add them at the end. They are so good, I do pit them on a cookie rack because I find they get soggy on a tray or plate.No, why would I do that?More people need to know about Pequods.It looks better than it taste. Giordano's is probably the most bland, pathetic excuse for a pizza ever... Much like most of the Pizza in Chicago-- It's just imitation.You don't give Uno's enough credit. I know it's similar but I like their deep dish more than giordanos. And their small wood restaurant definitely feels less touristy than the tgi Fridays esqu giordanos on the same street. Only a heathen would call it a square You can be sure that it is delicious.A soggy mess with a tomato sauce that leaves a lot to be desired. That was my one experience with Giordano's. Wow. I had it once while visiting St. Louis; ordered it delivered to our hotel room. Worst pizza ever.This looks like a lactose intolerant's nightmare On, does pizza mean dinner pie in Italian? Then where did you pull that definition from, your own head? None of the possible root words mention dinner or pie.That means what you're tryng to pass of as an objective definition is subjective and no more valid than my interpretation.

Your definition makes sense but it's just how you view pizza, which happens to leave out all the things that make deep dish nonstandard. It can't be held in the hand, no other pizza needs sauce on top to stop the cheese from burning, not all pizzas are made in pans (they're not pies like an apple pie), not all pizzas are so loaded with artery-clogging toppings, not all pizzas end up with undercooked dough because they're so thick. You can actually replace the term "not all" with "almost no other" except for the part about pans and everything I've just written would still be true. Deep dish is a total outlier on the pizza spectrum.If anyone reading this thread is in CT and knows where I can get anything even resembling this (other than Uno's in Milford) please, please let me know. What the fuck is sir and madam that's not pizza. you know because you need to preface the word with "chicago-style" for anyone to know what you are talking about.Funny story about that, once I ate a special brownie not knowing how it would affect me and walked with my buddy to Lou Malnati's. I was so high that I was drooling and we had to get our pizza to go. Just thought I would share. Really great pizza though!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KR44a_5v_A

Careful when adding back the water to the blender, I always seem to add back too much. Either way, the whole thing as a very unique taste that's fresher than steamed, more mellow than raw, and different than roasted.I'll let John Stewart handle this one.
https://youtu.be/BrqSizC-T-4Lou's crust is the absolute, hands down, best in Chicago.I don't know who you're trying to kid. Pretty much anything that involves flour is not even remotely low carb.What are you talking about.

I just don't think it's unreasonable that Italians would be upset that this is pizza to some Americans.Come and visit! We have over 7,300 restaurants in Chicago.

But that's just like ... my opinion manDamn I love that casserole place.  s/You missed one, the best one. =DChicago style pizza is awesome.  So is NY style pizza.  I don't understand why it has to be such a big debate.Guys, guys. Everybody knows the best pizza is in Connecticut.Same. Art of Pizza is incredible.Deep dish or gtfo! Keep that New York stuff.looks more like a pie than a pizza to me...Tourist pizza. Pequods or GTFO. I'm surprised by the amount people who've never heard of it. It's my personal favoriteDag's at Southport and Addison. Their sauce paired with the cracker crust is to die for.No mozz.  They use Provel which is the worst thing ever.They actually are, dunno why you're getting downvoted. The literal translation is "Attention Italians! " American Pizza-culinary abomination found on /r/food! Click at your own risk!"
Probably they see this "pizza" as a parody of the American "supersize everything" culture, especially considering that Italian pizza is supposed to be thin. Source: I live 5 km from Italy and eat their pizzas all the time.As someone who has not yet visited Chicago, thank you for the comprehensive review.

Personally, geno's is a close rival to lou malnati's Pizza is a Italian loan word for pie.  So, instead of saying Italian pie, you could just say pizza.  Pizza is a type of pie, so all pizzas are pies.That looks great,  you have a recipe? I haven't been to Dino's, but no, you can't just get a thin crust anywhere. Chicago has it's own style of thin crust, with a crunch to it like a cracker you don't find anywhere else. Also, the toppings go under the cheese, where they belong.I know Chicago is known for the deep dish, but Giordano's makes an insanely good thin crust. Unlike anywhere else.  What's your opinion on Albano's pizza? I watched a travel network show about them some time back and made a note to try them. How do they stack up with these other pizzerias?You realize it's possible to still have an Italian identity even if your family has been in the country for several generations? I mean, would you shit on someone for identifying as Chinese or Japanese even though their grandparents were the ones who immigrated to the US? Culture can be maintained within a family even when living in a different country. Had Giordano's for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I literally moaned in pleasureGreat write up, though I will disagree with a point here: I will not swear that is the best pizza I've ever had. I'm from Indianapolis, and I tried 3 different pizza places in a weekend. First place was "Little Maria's" - this was most definitely not typical Chicago pizza. This was a very thin crust pizza. It was so so, the atmosphere was a lot cooler than the food. Giordano's...well, you've been over that. The last place I always have a hard time remembering the name, but it tasted exactly like Papa Johns. I believe it was called Sarpino's, but I might be wrong on this.

My point is - none of these pizzas stood out to me. I've always been told how good Chicago pizza is and how much better is it than the rest of the world (excluding NYC, as anybody who has been there claims it's the best pizza, too). To be fair, I visited NYC last summer, and while you can't beat how cheap some of the pizza is (and the quality for the price), it's still not what I would consider "the best". The best pizza I've ever had was from Sal's Pizzeria in Plainfield, IN. There is also one in Brownsburg, and Mooresville. Sometimes they cooked it too long and the crust was overdone, but most of the time it's amazing.sure it's delicious, but it's not pizza.Why don't you ask them to make it light on the sauce?  &gt; And here comes everyone trying to prove they're cooler than you by dropping increasingly obscure Chicago places.

lol spot onthat's because it's not pizza.Yeah and Lou's is a gallon of sauce and 10 lbs of cheese. There is no balance in flavor. I've always thought this! I think they just introduced a greek flatbread thing that's got black, green and kalamata, but still!Wow- look at that cheese... rip open chest, pick an artery and throw a cork in it!   But ohh soo tasty looking...Chicago Pizza sucks. New York all the way!

*This comes from a Michigan guy who even dislikes Detroit Style which is similar to Chicago style.This is so far down the list when it comes to complaints about Olive Garden...you can have your deep dish.  Ill stick with Vito and Nicks :)  .  South side represent!  Sorry, but it just irks me when I see this bandied about as if Congress ordained all pizzas vegetables.

The *sauce* on the pizza can be counted as one serving of vegetables because it's made of tomatoes. Not the whole damn thing now fulfills your five-a-day. True.  That rat shit on matzo you idiots shove in your loud-hole totally speaks for itself!

Jon Stewart said so!

No Salerno's?Never really tried making Chicago style pie, but I make lots of pizza dough. Not positive, but just based off of eating Chicago pizza, I think they cut shortening into the dough. Gives it that flaky quality and probably affects flavor, too.Philly folk dont know Pizza like NY or NJ.

Source: Have sampled from all 3 locations. Lou Malnati's is the best imhoGood old New Yorkers and their famous past time of bitching about anything other than their paragon of pizza. Lou's is king. Also that bacon salad they serve..mmmStart with dough, because pizza is literally dinner pie.

Add sauce and cheese. Maybe toppings.

Put in oven.

Grats, you made pizza!

All deep dish does is put it in a pan (again, pizza is a pie), put the sauce over the cheese (to prevent burnt cheese), and add a ton more stuff to the pizza.

It's different, it's fantastic. But saying it deviates is just wrong. Pffffffffft!


*edit*

Just to illustrate my commitment to my comment, I waited 5 minutes to be allowed to post it.
except any type of pizza in the U.S. isn't close to the classic ideaIs the one in Orlando FL any good? Anyone?Deep dish is overrated anyways, it's all about neapolitan or new york style.Have you tried Lou Malnatti's?I think Lou's has the best. It's the crust that makes the difference. The others are just too dry or too greasy.Although an internal temperature of 130-135 degrees is below the USDA's recommended tempt of 145, it is still safe.  Professional chefs and steakhouses will serve meat at rare, an internal temp of 125 for at least 3 minutes.  The greatest risk of contamination for uncut steaks is from the outside.  For this reason, one should never poke an uncooked steak with a fork.  I have never measured the temperature of my steaks near the outside but it is much hotter than 135 which kills bacteria on the outside.
With that being said, I would serve you the ends of my tri-tip since you are definitely grossed out by medium rare steak.I agree with most of your pizza man comments. I disagree on Piece, Peaquods, and Dimo's.

Piece does a good pizza.  It great, but when it comes down to specialty pizza, they throw down.

Dimo's isn't really a try hard IMHO. They are more experimentalist. Where else can you get a Malort sauce pizza? And late night after a loss in the bleachers, it's good to sit on a curb and carb up for sorrowful drinks.

Peaquods is angelic. Their deep dish is the best. Who gives a hoot about the base taste when the burnt crust is so far off the chain?! I do admit that their new lunch special sucks though. It was great getting a personal pan and a beer for $5.

You mentioned all heavy hitters, but not  Beggars. It's nothing special, but they deliver in the loop, so I ate some. Nothing to write more than a few words about, but you seem like a completionist. Try them.It's sounds like you're saying meow...Just went to Plainfield, IL for the first time a couple of weeks ago on business.  Towards the end of the workday, I made the mistake of asking the people around the office where I could get good deep-dish pizza because I had never had it - and that, apparently, sparked up an ongoing debate between Giordano's and Lou Malnati's.  People are very passionate about their deep-dish there.  I ended up going with Lou Malnati's because they were closer to the hotel I was staying at - I got a small classic Chicago style and it was very delicious.  Next time I find myself down there I plan on trying Giordano's to decide for myself - I'm sure they're both equally delicious, it just comes down to personal taste.I fucking hate Chicago style pizza. This is bullshit.I don't live in St. Louis anymore, but I would argue that the St. Louis bbq scene is thriving. Pappys and Sugarfire are well regarded, there's also quite a few other joints as well.

I'm not too much in the know anymore and having been in Texas for 5+ years now, Texas bbq master race &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.

I fully admit that Imo's is only good to me, because it is nostalgic. I love it, but if I had my first slice of Imo's as an adult, I would hate it. quiche Mmm... Giordano'ssssThank you for calling that out. Too many times do people pull that shite.This is certainly how we spell it in the UK, hope this helps!You must be from New York. Gino's is digusting.The italians have spoken:

As long you don't use words like pizza and Italy/italian describing that thing, it's ok.

We don't mind if you call that "Chicago Iper-American Freedom Tomatoe Democracy Mozzarella Deep Pie" or whatever.It's not in Disney World itself, but it's pretty much across the street. It's a little different than getting it in Chicago, but it's good to tide you over if you haven't had any in a while. Connie's IS underrated.Some sort of pizza flavored caserole?This is an abomination!Where is this?That's some crusty lasagna. I wonder what their pizza looks like. They're "Detroit" style, I think. Similar to Pizza Hut from my experience.

They aren't bad. They're fast and cheap. But if I want *pizza*, I'd go most anywhere first. If I want some quick food because my friends are coming by for a LAN night or something, perfect.

I'm a bigger fan of Tortorices, Mug's, etc. I don't know how to cross post off mobile so shout out to /r/pizza instead... you seem like a guy id love to grab a slice with, thanks for the write up &lt;3You eat this with fork and knife right?God my apartment is right above Pat's Pizza and I do my best to not get it every single day. Best thin crust in the city.Lou Malnati?  I think you are looking for /r/conspiracyI found it tasted better as a reheat.Holy crap the caloriesYep, it's good.  I'm not a chef or anything, so if you get it in a restaurant it'll probably look more appealing.  If you're nervous about trying it, try the tail meat before you try the leg meat.Brussels sprouts are probably my favorite vegetable.  Sautee in a pan.  Roast in an oven.  Braise in some stock.  They're always great.

... But I don't think I like them that much.I really wish they would branch out to more areas in the state.Gios is good, no doubt, but when I'm in Chicago I take my business to Lou Malnatis.  God Bless Lou!Smith &amp; Forge is new to me.  I can't drink beer so it's a god-send.  It's so delicious.

The steak was perfectly pink.  I was honestly surprised at how well I had cooked it.Yeah, the legs have more of the gamey flavor (which I like) and are better prepared this way.  Tail meat is usually fried or blackened.  Similar to the white/dark meat of a chicken.Imo's. First, last, always. Easy enough. Thus looks like a place called carmines in my town. I personally love Lou Malnati's ..dat deep dish butter crust!Oh sweet Mother of all that is good and pure...Pizza originated during the neolithic age.
That was a few years before either NYC or its bloated self importance appeared on the scene.  I'm totally with you on the crust. I feel like giordano's crust blends perfectly with the cheese, and I've never found it to be weak. It's not too crispy, not too doughy. Are you gay?I couldnt handle yolk for the longest time &gt;.&lt;

It tasted nasty (I still dont eat the yolk in boiled eggs.. especially after trying balut)I personally like the plasticity taste of Imo's pizza thank you very much. Just stay away from the south side and you'll be fine.We accept that honor with extreme pride. It's delicious.Only if you're turning into delicious jam :)As a Chicagoan I can say with truth that deep dish pizza is shit. Honestly... I end up running to the bathroom immediately after eating it.

Save yourself the nightmare and have a hot dog instead.I don't know what that's supposed to be, but it sure ain't pizza. Maybe a casserole? Lou's. Too much sausage for my taste, so I always specify "sausage pieces". You're correct. I like deep dish a lot and I can even understand (if not agree) with liking it as a foodore than pizza, but they just aren't trying to accomplish the same thing so there's no reason to group them together. Christ!Well I'm not a huge cheese fan so deep dish isn't my favorite, but I definitely see why people like it. I've had some varieties that go easy on the cheese and damn that shit is good. Especially the way the really good pizza places do their crustDoug and Pattie forgot to put em on.I dunno, man. They're serving it up with a shovel. The first one in minneapolis is currently under construction. Can't wait!![**deep.**](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/531/557/a88.jpg)Giordano's crust is like a pastry crust. I think it's pretty darn good. The building we used to stay in when visiting was right by Giordano's. I also like Pizano's for when you want a thin crust pizza, very decent.Sears Tower,  90/94,  The taste, Michael Jordan, Lake Shore Drive, the mag mile, da Bears, maxwells hot dogs, southside/Northside, pot holes,  and corruption. I lobes pizza too!Hands down the best pizza anywhere in the world is Mother Bears Pizza in Bloomington, Indiana. This looks Devine. Looks like your stomach will be doing flips later eating uncooked meat.I love Giordano's, wish they would open one in Atlanta. Instead, we got Nancy's... UghWe just got one in Indy, it's not as good as the one downtown in Chicago. You mean saltines with ketchup and mozz?Pretty much every you just wrote is a blatant lie.

The crust on stuffed pizza cooks all the way the way through.  Just look at the picture.  That doughy substance is cheese.

Also, Lou's doesn't make Chicago style pizza.  They make deep dish.

Of course someone that doesn't know the distinction would get upvoted.this isn't pizzaFuck yeah.   Chicagoan here, went to NYC and dropped in at This Little Piggy had Roast Beef thanks to some redditor.


I always thought roast beef was kinda the same everywhere... I was so fucking blown away there.  Thanks redditor,  wherever you are! I went to Oak Brook for training back in 2007.  I ordered Giordano ' the first night because they delivered. I proceeded to order it every night I was there.

I miss it.    My personal favorite Chicago deep dish is a South Side place called Arrenello's. Its the greatest pizza I have had. Take out only though.
http://www.arrenellos.com

It looks like a traditional deep dish but they put a layer of crust on the bottom of the pan, then a layer of sauce (They have the sweetest sauce I have ever tasted on pizza.) Next they put another real thin layer of crust, then load it with cheese and your other toppings  and lastly they put another layer of sauce right on top of that.

It is heaven in a pan.


I live in Northwest Indiana  (before you judge its only a 30 minute commuter train ride to city) and we have one of their restaurants right down the street, I think they have another takeout place in Glenwood and maybe Orland.

While agree with this guys assessment a mostly in that Lou's and Giordano's are great, I disagree strongly with what he says about Gino's. Gino's is fantastic, I love the corn bread style crust. Uno and Duo I can personally pass on, but it's mostly because I am not a big fan of bug chunks of tomato in the sauce.

This guy also doesn't get into the great thin crust Pizza like Aurelios and Sanfratellos, cut into squares, not triangles.
 ["It's not pizza... it's a casserole."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrqSizC-T-4)Oh damn, i just had this pizza last weekend!Yeah their ribs are a lot closer to the classic idea of ribs than, say their pizza is to the classic idea of the same.I cant stand lou's simply due to the cardboard tasting crust. It is moderately tolerable fresh but the worst cold or reheated to me.Yeah most people who bash Chicago style have never tried it or are butt hurt New Yorkers who are so distraught that Chicago and New Jersey have better pizza than them Deep dish and lasagna are much more similar than, say, lasagna and Greek or NYC style pizza.What's the place? I have yet to find a good Mexican breakfast in Dallas.I hope the Italians are mocking what Chicago did to their pizza.You go to Chicago for pizza, but stay for Portillo's.Oh, like pizza?If you like this very specific style of pizza that's much further removed from the original concept of pizza than most other types and lacks certain intrinsic pizza qualities, sure.

Deep dish just doesn't remind me of pizza when I eat it.
it's so strange...My wife is italian, and she is kind of a pizza-fascist. But she absolutely loved giordanos pizza when we were in chicago for a holiday. you just have to realize that this is a completely different dish than italian thin crust pizza. And Lou's TL;DR - Go to Lou Malnati's. Yeah, there is nothing unhealthy about this. I mean, it's not like we ate one of these each with a bottle of wine and then snorted a line of coke of a cream filled chocolate eclair. Who would even think of such a thing? That's crazy. Shut up. yeah, fair enough.
and - admittedly - other countries do it, too: I have seen hot-dog pizzas as well as kebap pizzas in Europe ...I understand your point about floppy crust, but I've had more over-crispy or otherwise poor crusts in a few years here than bad crusts in a couple decades in the Northeast. I think Chicago's non-deep dish is good but I haven't been impressed by overall quality - I'm weary of trying new places, something I wouldn't really say about pizza in the Northeast.

He's doing a weaker than version of Giordano's. What he has going for his place is late hours and a huge delivery area.

What?M'Pizza.Connie's is better too.naw that's delivery. 10/10 did bangIt does against the Chicago thin-crust, which is why that pleb completely ignored it and spun a strawman that everyone bought into.I still think the best Chicago's pizza is Baccino's in Lincoln Park.Oh. Oh, God. I have an erection now.Lol TheFk... There's still a Woolworth in Australia? ... I guess that's what they meant in the 90's about the business going 'down under' .. I have a deep dish pizza pan, been a while since I last used it, I need to try and make some good deep dish pizza.It's funny to me that so many people from Chicago feel like they have to say something about how "they don't eat deep dish" or it's for tourists. Like they're embarrassed of it or something. At least you're being truthful here.You must have a will of iron. &gt;these places all seem novel if you are from out of town

Dude, you have no idea. I'm from Brazil and it has been my dream for a few years now to travel to Chicago only to eat this kind of pizza.Home Run Inn, etc. is pizza. Not as good as NYC or NH pizza in my opinion, but good.Funny story about this. Another Chicago deep dish place called Lou Malnati's serves an "Atkins pizza" which is basically the above deep dish pizza, but without dough. What do they use? Sausage. Not joking. It's an entire sausage patty that is the same size as the entire pizza and acts as the base. It's.....delicious. But not even remotely healthy. The ribs are good though.LoL, lots of spice in this dish.  Only know one place in Dallas that does this. Reasonably priced, the taste is beyond rich.It's a qualifier that people use because deep dish lacks some of the intrinsic qualities of a classic pizza. I'd call Domino's pizza but not deep dish. Is that elitist?It's like the comments are just transferred from the last time somebody posted deep-dish. I can't believe you're all impressed by each other's pseudo-snobbery enough to actually upvote each other.If you're sober enough to make this, you're not drunk enough for drunk food.Why? Why? WHY?! It looks so disgusting. What the hell is wrong with making/ordering a normal ass pizza? I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks Pequods front end workers are the absolute worst. I've never been given so much attitude from just trying to order a pizza. And if you try to do it over the phone be prepared to be treated like a 5 year old. People who don't realize that deep dish pizza deviates from the standard concept way more than most other kinds of pizza - and lacks certain qualities that make pizza "pizza" for some people - are foolish.We're all really impressed. Have you had lasagna before?Since you love pizza maybe you'll love this story:


About 4-5 years ago, I applied for a job in Chicago. I had a friend in HFT and he wanted me to apply to his company. After speaking on the phone they want to meet me in person. Sure thing! I'm just two years out of college so I don't really know what to expect.

I lived in Atlanta so they scheduled a morning flight. I don't like being full for a flight so I don't eat breakfast. My flight and taxi ride will bring me into the office right in time for my noon interview so I haven't had lunch. I had assumed that maybe because of the timing they'd feed me first? That was wrong. The interview goes from noon until six. At this point I've had one bottle of water and a job offer.

My friend needs to wrap up work then I'll ride with him to dinner to celebrate: I'm going to have my first ever deep-dish pizza! No problem except: he lives in Naperville and we're going to wait for his wife to get out of class. We ride Metra, pick up his car, hang outside, meet his wife, wait through the Friday line, and finally get seated. I've now fasted through 24 hours a pretty nerve-wracking day. What's the first thing I get to eat? Malnatti salad. I'm a dude and almost crying over how good it tastes. Next up: The Lou pizza with sausage. The job was exciting but right there I was thinking, "I think I'm going to like Chicago."Giordanos is the place I went to get Chicago deep dish pizza. Am I missing out on one to try next time I'm there?Go away.&gt; cheese that leaks out of the sides and carmelizes on a baking sheet while you're heating it up takes it to another level entirely.

That's exactly what deep dish is missing for me. Without that caramelization, it tastes like pasta sauce in a bread bowl. It's below-average medium-crust/"Greek" pizza.This makes me nostalgic. When we lived in Milwaukee, we drove down to Burt's every 2-3 months. The craving would be simply unbearable.

The place has its charm, order on the phone, arrive to your pizza, no starters no nonsense. The best part would be the quick chats with Burt and the lady.
I wanna go back!You'll go from slopper to proper.This is another reason why people in the Midwest are fat as fuck.This deserves gold.I'm so sorry but the best Chicago style deep dish pizza will forever remain with Gino's EastThat Easter Pie baby.Giordano's was my best experience in my 22 years of living, by far. Dantes pizza is good but ran by idiotic hipsters Yeah. It's not an out-of-this-world experience or anything, but it's tasty meat, with a consistency somewhere in between chicken and fish. The entirety of St. Louis cuisine is a joke. A harsh thing to say, yes, but their pizza is basically a handmade version of a frozen pizza (super-chemically, gross cheese), toasted ravioli is just dropped in a deep fryer, "slinger" looks like vomit on a plate, etc.That's called Lasagna not pizza.Yeah but sometimes there's a slight bit of runniness where the yolk meets the white.

Username checks out Well sure, but not *only* fries. At least some kind of meat or other protein-rich food. From reading the comments I guess I'm spoiled from having a pretty damn good Chicago pizza place ([Tortugas](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tortugas-pizza-hoover)) 10min away from my house in Alabama.

I've never been to Chicago, but the owners are from there and even the first review on yelp mentions how it's very close to Giordano's. Tof, man.I went to the Chicago a few years ago and had this pizza. If that was my last meal I would of said "Bring on the injection!"lol.

I went to Pi the other day and they said they were the best pizza in the city and were the same as Chicago pizza.

I just nodded.You've never had Chicago style pizza, have you?I can only imagine there's a lot of New Yorkers who downvoted you. I have to agree, I think NY pizza is too thin for my tastes. Yup!


http://giordanos.com/location/lake-buena-vista-disney-area/Lou Malnati master raceVisited Chicago for the first time back in I think 2008/2009 for Lollapalooza.  NIN, radiohead,  ratm,.. Whatever year that was.  Anyway.  Ate Giordano's everyday..  Soooo good.  Wish they had that here.  You used the word pizza wrong.Well, first you have the famed "thin crust" pizza... with the delightful melted-plastic cheese...

Edit: Actually had someone send me a PM over this. Sorry, I will give a bit more information!

Imo's is pretty much the one pizza place that everyone in the St. Louis area knows about regarding thin crust. The cheese I was referencing was provel, which is good at very specific temperatures (a very narrow window). Too hot, and that shit will bond with the top of your mouth, leaving you in pain for a week while you heal. Too cold, and it has no flavor and the reheat value is *shit*.

When they say "thin crust" they truly mean thin. Crust is about the thickness of a doughy tortilla, and (depending on toppings) is cooked to the point it is like eating pizza toppings on crackers.

Why does it continue to survive in this world of other fantastic pizza options? Because those options don't exist in St. Louis. Unless you are in very specific areas, such as The Loop, the only pizza available are the crap chains such as Papa John's, Pizza Hut, etc. St. Louis just doesn't have anything unique. It used to be a big BBQ city, but that kind of went by the wayside also. Such a punchable comment.I miss living in Chicago.Because it has almost nothing in common with lasagna &amp; tastes totally different?Fun fact, Chicago deep dish pizza was invented primarily by a Texan.   After trying a slice of the then NY/Italian style pizza, the Texan co-owner of the restaurant said it seemed like an appetizer, and wanted to make it bigger.  The rest is history.  Everything in Texas is bigger, and therefore pizza is now bigger in Chicago.Probably because it's a pizzaWe do eat Giordanos though. There's a ton of locations and they're always busy This even tastes better than it looksYou're wrong though. It is, in fact, pizzaAin't nobody say Unos is the best? There's like a 20x higher toppings to bread ratio on that thing compared to a normal pizza.Actually it's a fucking awesome reimaginingYou will laugh at all the dead weaklings in the bleak post-apocalyptic landscape as you purposefully grind away on fibrous vegetable nourishment.Or just shoot some sriracha on it.I think that's Gino's. It may be because i live in the burbs but up here lous is shit. Me and multiple people i know think it smells and tastes like vomit. It may be the type of sauce they use and the acidity of it. It literally tastes like someone threw up on a crust and cooked it. They're also called squaresMy brother lives in Chicago and one of my favorite things when visiting is to order from Giordano's at least once. I love my NY pizza, but damn Chicago can do pizza pretty alright too.The crust was a bit too sweet imo  - or is all Chicago-style crust like that?Has anybody in here called it a casserole, a lasagna, or posted that Jon Stewart rant yet?

Bacino's Pizza, what do you think? Big fan.Maybe the one in my old neighborhood (Rogers Park) was exceptionally bad, but I had Giirdano's twice and could not believe that anyone would prefer it to Lou Malnati's or Uno/Due. Crust was not at all up to snuff. &gt; The tri-tip will continue to cook to a temp of 130-135 (a perfect medium rare). The outer pieces will be medium to medium well. This will make anyone who does not like rare/med rare steak very happy.

Baraccos!!!! There's one on Southwest highway as well. Ever had the around the world pizza?Deep dish is much better the next day anyway. I used to order them and put them straight in the fridge to reheat the next night.I still haven't been able to get in.Can you get a pizza with that loaf of bread?
Connie's is all about the butter crust! Thank you for mentioning this!

 ...and now I'm hungry and miles from Chicago. Damn.First pizzaria is in NYC, longest operating I'd in NJ.  Sorry cowtippers, you're wrong.I wish we had some rain. Said California. Thats half rare half med rareMayo makes everything taste good. As delicious as this looks, I think drunk food should be more greasyWell, I suppose, this changes everything! I never knew the ministry of signage bestowed the "best pizza in the world" sign upon one lucky, but deserving, NYC pizzaria...What is quinoa. Yeugh not for me, gimme a thin nigh burnt crispy crust with a good tomato sauceReheat value 100For anyone interested.... http://giordanos.com/shop/ you can have them ship the pizza.

Edit: anywhere in the USI always dig pizza metro when I visit Chicago. I'm gonna have to try your deep dish recommendations though.My fiance's dad flies to Chicago on business every couple months, and always brings back a giordino's pizza. He brings it as his carry on, and the whole plane smells like delicious, delicious pizza.Go to Japan.  They call every color but green bell peppers paprika.  (At least in most stores.)There's one in Indianapolis that opened last year in the winter time and to this day it still has a 3 fucking hour waiting time on Friday and Saturday evenings just to dine in, I think I'll just do carry out and wait a few years to dine in.&gt;Lou's has expanded greatly over the last decade, it's part of the same family, touristy but probably the best all around Chicago style place in the downtown area, mainly because their sauce is good and they have the best crust.

That is strictly a matter of opinion.  Lou's is good if you like their gritty corn-meal like crust.  Personally I prefer the flakey buttery crust of places like Giordano's.  To each their own.
I disagree with you on Art of Pizza (unless something drastic has changed in the last year.) However, this review in general is fantastic. I'm a total homer, been in Chicago for 30 years now, and would happily show this to someone that asks what's good.

If you ever make it to the south side, I can't recommend Baracco's on 95th Street enough. Hands down my favorite pie in the city. But but... I ordered thin and crispy. Wtf is this?

^^sidenote... Miam. I am so fucking homesick for Chicago right meowends with an sIve never wanted to go to Chicago before now, just for all the variety and history of something you can eat.

It'd be cool learning that paragraph from experience over years.

Growing up in a small town, our pizza is pretty much Pizza Hut and Hungry Howie's. Kinda shitty.Let's do one for St Louis style pizza! --- Said no one ever.What are you talking about.. I live two blocks down the "Best Pizza in the World" in Manhattan.. it says so on the sign..Sounds lovely, you made my mouth water xDNew Yorkers up their own ass? Say it ain't so!This is a picture of my medium rare tri-tip steak.  Tri-tip normally comes in cuts of 1.5-2.5 pounds and is sold near the roast section.  I have found that the smaller cuts cook better so I recommend limiting your cut to 2 pounds.  Season over night using your favorite dry rub.  You want to cook the tri-tip at a temperature that cooks it for 30 minutes to an internal temperature of 120 degrees.  That is 275 degrees for my grill.  You will need to flip it half way through.  I will flip mine when the meat temperature gets to 90 degrees.  Remove the tri-tip once it reaches an internal temp of 120 degrees and immediately wrap in foil for 10 minutes.  The tri-tip will continue to cook to a temp of 130-135 (a perfect medium rare).  The outer pieces will be medium to medium well.  This will make anyone who does not like med rare steak very happy.

EnjoyRefried beans, slices of avocado and tomato.  An what we have to the left is chorizo con papa (Mexican sausage with potato). It's fit for a king, tribe leader, and conquistador etc.Indianapolis here. I've had this pizza once and it was pretty much the best pizza I've ever tasted. I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4945103 and here you go
http://www.simplysogood.com/2015/03/chocolate-beetroot-cake-with-cardamom.html?utm_source=BP_recent, this blog gives detailed directions with plenty of pictures to follow along.Says you.  We don't call it pilaf in South Asia. We call it Pulao. We don't want to name our delicious food after shitty Western food. But we call it that to make it easy for you pretentious pricks who "love" ethnic food. But you usually go home to an exclusive diarrhea after having small channa masala dish. Eat more fibre. Take your pilaf and shove it up your constipated anus. I dunno. I think Giordano's crust is awesome. Also, I'm not a huge sauce person and find all of them use way too much of it. I take off probably 75% of the sauce. On top of that, I think the real key here is how these pizzas taste after they have sat in the fridge overnight. There's no way in hell anybody finishes one of these and being able to have cheese that leaks out of the sides and carmelizes on a baking sheet while you're heating it up takes it to another level entirely.Geppetto's is my favorite deep dish ever!It's lasagna without the pasta. How was it? Does rat taste anything like rabbit?That's brilliant Giordano's also ships pizzas and has for as long as I can remember.Backfisch! Or in smaller pieces Kibbeling. They always have these at our market twice in a week.I'm not insulting you, you are saying these things. Livestock, sentient beings, call them whatever you want. Equating human life to cows, chickens, etc., is bizarre, and wrong. Equating black people and the Civil Rights Movement to animal rights, is incredibly wrong, and racist. Your inability to see that is laughable at best, and fucked up at worst. If you want to think that everyone else is wrong and you are always right and being insulted, go right ahead. Never heard of Chicken Bacon.This all looks amazing :) do you have any recipes? ITT: "That's not a pizza, it's a casserole".

I'm not even a Chicagoan, but deep dish Chicago style pizza might just be the most delicious thing on this planet.  i've said it before, /r/peopleareweird needs to be a better subreddit where people can post things like this knowledge but point out that it is just weird that people do that. Because no Italian ever cooked anything on a flat dough before they landed in NYC.
New Yorkers are full of shit.  Pizza pie!Giordano's was convenient as a tourist because it was on the walk to the train to get back to o'hare. Tourist spot or not, it was delicious and I didn't have under cooked dough.
Sigh. I recently started getting GERD/LPR eating anything but vegetables and eggs. Even max dose ppi + antiacids dont help. Didnt mean to ever cut you out giordano, but now you're just somebody that I used to know :*(It's called a Sicilian slice, not squares, read a book for onceGo to Burt's while you can. He's not much longer for this world. And it WILL close down when he goes.Not gonna lie, after eating there while in town for a conference, I packed a fresh pie in my boss's luggage and shared it with the fiance when I got back to Long Island. I crave it from time to time still.
What is the stuff in between the eggs? everything else looks great :D"Traditional"?

More like "manually."Ah a fellow New Yorker.

Want to get some *real* pizza and post it for the world to see? This casserole is an abominationJohn's pizza @ Western bit North of Armitage. Get a football. 24bucks and a bit of hot sauce will have 5 people ring of firing the next morning, no problem.One can get good thin crust pizza in a lot of places. One can really only get good Chicago pizza in Chicago. Pizza was invented in NYC, so yeah, it is the center and everyone else is imitating.Needs more tots.Let me help you.. It starts with a GDoner kebab, cheesy chips. Wouldn't touch them when sober but they taste sooo good when you're drunk. Wait, Disney World has a Giordano's? Are you serious??&gt; these places all seem novel if you are from out of town; you'll probably enjoy any of them and swear it's the best pizza you've ever had

Sorry, nope.  I've had deep dish pizza in Chicago on more than one occasion.  Did not like it.

Not "the best" at all.
Upvoted. But I will say that of all the stuffed places in Chicago, Art Of Pizza is by far my favorite.Because its better than pizza.I am sorry, but this thread is about Chicago pizza; NYC is not the center of the universe. Besides, new york pizza is overrated...I sincerely hope you are kidding.

Or retarded.I checked and http://karmadecay.com/results/u4945011 here you go http://www.food-pusher.com/2012/03/bite-size-chocolate-cream-pie.html What the hell are you talking about? Are you trying to argue that a GMC is objectively better or just as good than a Lamborghini Veneno because it's cheaper?

 Maybe if the whole thread was about eating pizza on a budget you might have a point but I originally said American pizza is shit, which I think it is. I never said it was better value or whatever.

Where are you getting these prices? When did you last eat pizza in Italy?People who call deep dish pizza a casserole have either never had pizza or casserole. LOL. Still proudly channeling the spirit of Mussolini over there, are they?that they lube their pans with bacon grease. mmmmmmmmm baacooonn greasssssseeeee. That looks like a quichePrice is absolutely a factor if you're gonna trash a cultures pizza then struggle to justify your reasoning. But that's okay, I'll be fine with my american pizza, good luck with your 20 8" lunchable thoughAww the famous cheese casserole.... you are so not pizza..... #NYC4Lyfe! Uncle Enzo?Corfu is stunning! As long as you stay away from kavos WHERE'S THE **FUCKING** BANANA?Bella Bacino's represent.And drinking mojitos.That's not a pizza, that's a casserole!!

http://www.eater.com/2013/11/14/6330695/watch-jon-stewarts-epic-rant-against-chicago-pizzaWas recommended Lou's when passing through Chicago during a cross-country move.  It didn't disappoint.  But man, trust the menu when it says that a medium can feed 2-3.I love deep dish of all brands and flavors!!!Giordano's serves the best deep dish in Chicago. Lou's deep dish is good. But Lou's thin crust is the worst pizza in the world. Frozen pizza with freezer burn is better than Lou's thin crust. Anybody here can send me a pie from Zachary's in the Bay Area?These are olives. Ligurian olives are way smaller than black olives. [Dner Pizza](http://i.imgur.com/B9zTQmq.jpg) Size: american.Man, practically everything on that dish is the same beige color.  No vegetables?  Way too much cheese and crust.  I would pass.  I love pizza and can appreciate someone who lobes pizza too./threadAs a former resident of Chicago and deep dish non-believer-turned-convert, this post is a good little guide to "Pizza" for the uninitiated! I'll add my experiences.

 Giordano's, ubiquitous, good pizza. Variety of pizzas from them all come out well, and their delivery is quite good. I really like their classic pizza. The crust is the weakest bit, but if you haven't had a deep dish before you won't know that, and you'll still think it's the best thing you've ever had. Their sausage is very tasty.

Lou's, another place with a couple locations. Their meats are good but their veggies are a bit lackluster. The crust is good, the pizza ends up being a little on a greasy side though, which I don't love.

Uno's is actually a good place to get a pizza from in the city. They're comparatively quick and the staff is experienced. Their crust is quite sweet iirc.

Not sure if I ever ran into a 'hipster' pizza joint, but I have a feeling it wouldn't be hard to spot one. If anybody working the place is wearing hair product, that's probably a red flag. If they try and tell you their vegetarian pizza is 'actually tasty', duck the fuck out.

If you only had one night in Chicago, you can go to Uno, Due or Giordano's and leave knowing you pretty much did it right. A warning though, it's pretty good so you might find yourself thinking about the next time you'll get a chance to go to CHI....As the great man John Stewart said, the fact that it's called "deep dish pizza" proves you know it's not really pizzaI get irrationally angry when people say it's only Americans who call pasta noodles. Don't kid yourself. Dead accurate. Goddamn is Lou's crust good.Great scott! thats a lotta cheeseI still order a frozen one twice a year! Soo good!!! Lou's-4-lifeMy opinion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrqSizC-T-4https://picasaweb.google.com/davidjdaley/StuffedPizza?authuser=0&amp;feat=directlink

There is our version of Giordanos.   It's taken a number of years, but we are getting very close.   The crust is our only shortcoming.  It's close, but getting that flaky bite into the crust is very tough!  I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4944916 and here's the recipe http://bsinthekitchen.com/cinnamon-toast-crunch-cupcakes/Excellent comment.

I have had good experiences with Dimo's, but maybe that's because I'm a basic Lakeview dweller.

Also what many might not know about stuffed or deep dish, especially Giordano's, is that one slice is a meal. You don't really need more than that.Living in Chicago. Can confirm. Best review and summary I've seen to date. Indianapolis welcomed its first Giordano's last month.  Woot!  :)Shut up New York. You have cheesy bread and Chicago has a casserole. GIARDINIERAI thought it was meh. Visited Chiraq this past summer, stopped at giordanos for a pizza. I'm from Boston. This pizza is one of the main reasons I want to go back to Chicago. Not only because it's delicious, but locals tell me there is better pizza there!?!?!? Begin quest. BisquikCan someone do this for proper Brooklyn joints?  I wanna grab some pizza nowDino's on Harlem and Higgins.... Oh man I miss that place. Everyone always thinks deep dish when they think Chicago pizza but they have easily some of the best thin crust pizza. I'm down in SW Florida now and thanks to the shitty pizza down here I've learned how to make it myself. Still not Dino's but I make a damn good pizza! The funny thing is that the overwhelming majority of pizza consumed in Chicago is not of the deep dish variety. Chicago's thin crust pizza is served in squares, and has a somewhat brittle, crunchy crust, as opposed to the floppy bread taco that is New York-style.As a former Chicagoan, this paragraph has given me more nostalgia for Chicago than anything else.I know you're joking but it might be. Lots of fat but there isn't much crust compared to the rest. This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.
