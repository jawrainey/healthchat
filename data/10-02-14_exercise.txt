I agree with what everybody else is saying about this jersey.  I'd MUCH rather see the Reddit logo on the center of the back, and highly diminish the /r/bicyling text.  Because those rims are painted, and they painted over the braketrack, you're going to have AWFUL braking until your pads wear it off (which is normal).  It wouldn't be a bad idea to sand it off now, but see how it stops in the wet before you find out the hard way.

Also, I'm not sure if you need to remove a link in the chain, or you can pull the axle back further into the dropout, but you do need more chain tension.  Take a look at youtube for some tips on how best to do it (I personally recommend walking it back by tightening and loosening each side at a time).  The culture is completely different though.  In Netherlands, bicycle is a legitimate form of transportation.  In US, aside from a few areas,  bicycles are considered more of a toy that one puts in their cars drove to the lake or mountain or something children ride on their driveways.
Let's make bicycle registration a thing first. I would love to have bicycles in a police database. &gt;Helmets have saved my life twice.

There is no way to quantify whether a helmet saved your life or not. Helmets don't protect from internal concussions.

This is about creating a barrier to entry on the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation. It has been shown over and over again that the only thing helmet laws do is decrease the number of cyclists. How far is your commute? Are you spending more time cleaning and performing maintenance than riding?Any word on EU/UK shipping costs?One option is free and the other costs money. The most notable benifit of running a chain tensioner is that you are afforded the freedom of switching up your gear ratio. If you have a flip-flop hub, consider a tensioner.

What gear ratio (# of teeth on chain ring : # of teeth on the cog)?
What is topography of the area that you will be biking in (flat vs. hilly)?This is tricky. Used bikes can be a hell of a deal, IF you know what you're looking at. New, close out bikes can also be a hell of a deal, and you most likely get follow up service with the shop and future discounts... I would lowball him since he swapped parts out, if everything else lines up.At the end of the primary submission round I asked each designer to send me designs that they wanted to see in the final voting.

Nothing is set in stone at the moment though, so we can still move elements and such without much issue.I am actually surprised there isn't a lyca dude in this group. I live in SF &amp; it's really awesome to see the mix of bicycles &amp; riding styles. Our college kits looked almost identical to this last year and we won worst kits in the conference.Just take a link out.Yes, it's still possible to tweak. I'll be working with /u/Highwinds and Podium to take this design, modify where needed and then put it into production.Thank you!Great question! Designed them myself (important for you to vectorize them) and set background to transparent. Once designed, save it out as a .png - and then you can send them along to pretty much any signage store, they can cut decals.  Should only cost you about $3 bucks per decal max (thats a high estimate too)

The cut them on their printer and what you'll end up with is your design on a sticky surface with a layer to pull off.  Then push to apply it to your bike, and press on all corners of it.  (Do ti slowly)  Then peel and voila! You have your decal!

Just be sure to apply clear coat AFTER putting the decals on!Hopefully everyone that voted for it. I know I am. If you like your Krampus you'll love an ICT so much. And find a way to afford the Bluto, its amazing. Thanks dude!Thanks so much! haha gotta admit i was a little worried that I would get some flak for taking a classic bianchi into a no-namer fixie!

And thanks for the feedback! I'll give it a shot tonight!What kind of bar tape is that? Good luck dude. As a guy with two right knee injuries, do everything you can to figure it out and address the problems asap. I didn't have insurance for my first one, fractured the tibial plateau, and was unsure on ligament damage because i couldn't get an mri. Straight leg brace absolutely atrophied the hell out of my leg in no time. Because i didn't get physical therapy as soon as possible took me forever to walk normally, then it was weak and i refractured it on a fall.... Got physical therapy that time, but a year of neglect has left me with stiffness and rang of motion issues all which could have been avoided.
Cleaning at LEAST once a week in mandatory. I usually do a full wash and lube on sunday, but lately my chain has been completely enveloped in rust by wednesday :/ So looks like I'm going to have to start cleaning 2x a week and maybe wipe and lube the chain every day or so? This winter has been brutal on my drivetrain. Thanks so much! Really pleased with it! Learned some things and will definitely do things differently, but a great experience over all!

And thanks for the feedback! Seems to be what a lot of people are saying! - would it be better to get a chain tensioner? or just the take a link out?The Netherlands where virtually everyone bicycles don't have a helmet law. The thinking is that if you force people to wear a helmet you will effectively create a barrier to entry causing fewer people to adopt biking.

I'm not saying you shouldn't wear a helmet, I've seen one probably save a friends life when he slid into a curb at high speed and I've had my fair share of falls too, but they may have a point.Screw ID and credit card, I'd insist on having the cash in my hand while the prospective buyer is on a test ride. I was surprised it isn't already a law. I know motorcyclists are required to wear helmets, I thought surely cyclists would too. Southern Ontario here - yuppp :'( and it's supposed to drop below -30 degrees C this weekend.Podium CyclingLOL, a biker must take the safest route.

You sound dangerous if you would rather risk the safety of yourself and those around you.
If you dont think it is dangerous to bike on 50+ mph roads then you are crazy.

A responsible biker always takes the safest route for everyone.

Also, since drivers dont drive on the sidewalk, then it wont matter if the biker is on the sidewalk.  I dont get what their expectations have to do with anything.

As for bikers in crosswalks, drivers always expect someone to cross in a the crosswalk on either foot, bike, rollerblades, skateboards, etc if that crosswalk has the green light.  That's what I thought too, so I went back and checked, and it looked like [this.](http://imgur.com/a/ibsLP)

However, it did change in the actual head to head voting thread.  So I'm not really sure when the change was made.You're the driver in the black car. You're justifying unsafe, illegal actions. Is this one of the sidewalks you can ride across in Los Angeles? Nope. You're disregarding the expected behavior of people who commute in cars/bikes/walking.

You can do anything you want. If you wanna walk your bike across the bridge on the sidewalk, that's your decision. How long is this bridge? How much time would that add to your commute? I don't know either of those things. You're pretending things like that don't matter. You're pretending the decision here is as simple as "hurt or don't get hurt." It isn't.The shorts look awful (do i need to say in my opinion?) and I think they will not come out nicely from my experience of last years kit. The only saving grace is that the jersey is pretty nice and will go with last years bibs, so that's my plan.I'm surprised at the negative reaction to this. I think it's a great idea. I see tons of people daily who ride without helmets and it absolutely boggles my mind. If you have a minor accident and hit your head without a helmet it can kill you. Helmets have saved my life twice. This seems similar to seatbelt laws. Good to see him smiling and having a blast.Cold forged cranks aren't that expensive anymore.Of course he did. Definitely bib shorts. They are pretty comfortable and will cover everything.Totally understandable.

We had to play a careful balance between price, quality, ability to work with reddit inc's weird requirements, and our sub's requirements like being able to ship each order to a different individual.

Podium represented the best balance of these needs, and has great quality. However, pricing isn't the lowest out there, and I understand that's hard for some folks.Who will be making the kit?Definitely picking this up for the spring.Looks sweet!!Hawk wheels

Did you buy a bike before a bed frame?God dammit who is chopping onions back here?

Really unfortunate title, but goddammit if this doesn't make me want to go for a ride.I know, California just seems to have more than their fair share of silly laws on the books.Good Quality Jersey ~$45 USD
Good Quality Bibs ~$60 USD

High Quality Jersey ~$80 USD
High Quality Bibs ~$160 USD

There is shipping to Mexico available, but I can't remember pricing offhand.I don't get it...I say "bikers" but people think I mean beer-gut-wannabe-hard guys on motorcycles.#####&amp;#009;

Keep your head up! Live to ride another day. :)Thanks for the constructive feedback!

Nothing is set in stone yet, so there's a chance some of these suggestions could be implemented in the final product.This design in various dark greys of matte and shiny would look awesome.Thanks for the info and encouragement. The mileage I'm doing is not about the STP; it a personal goal for the year to average 100 miles a week throughout the year. I'm considering bumping it up only because I feel like I can. Tossing off a 43 mile  ride in the epic rain that was last Friday gave me real confidence, too.If you want a solid number:  about 100 people  are killed per day as a result of motor vehicle collisions in the US according to CDC.  For 2013 that number is 33 804.

Census.gov says  2 217 000 injured in 2009 as a result of motor vehicle collisions.  This is 4 people per minute or 6100 per day.Podium Cycling

Here's a good write-up on the quality of their kits:
http://www.bikerumor.com/2013/11/04/summer-weight-road-kit-shoot-out-podium-cycling-gc-vs-pearl-izumi-elite/This isn't actually a law and isn't likely to become one.California seems like it would be a cool place to live if they swapped laws with basically any other state.Not sure if the 404 is from redditmarketplace's side or Podium's. I will look into it.&gt; Tens of thousands are killed by cars, most of them _in other cars._

I really wish lawmakers wouldn't ignore this.  They think increasing what they consider to be safety margins makes driving safer, but all it does is make people drive faster to 'compensate.'
That sounds ridiculously brave (potentially even foolhardy). "Stealing" from a gang of thieves in So Paulo sounds rather a lot more dangerous than taking a bike back from a single guy in Vancouver!More armchair cycling advocates telling cyclists what to do.Yeah, for custom stuff this is a good relative price, I just wish the going rate for a full kit would less than $100.Please tell this was posted in /r/JusticePorn.

Man, that is awesome.We actually get a really good pricepoint on these because of the volume of our order. While it's not chinese-knock-off cheap, the price for just a jersey is around $40. And that's getting you a quite nice jersey, of much higher quality than those eBay specials.Like others have said go with a bib. Not going to say they are better then shorts but they just keep everything nice and neatly tucked away. This is even truer if you are a larger or taller guy. I am 6'6 and having a bib on helps in the but-crack/lower back showing off department. going to put this out there just in case you have any interest.

[brandt-sorenson](http://brandt-sorenson.com/) makes custom fitted kits. this works well for those that don't fit the average joe kits. I'm a pretty stocky dude so for most kits, it's either too loose or too tight in a variety of places.

I had brandt sorenson custom make a few kits and they fit like a glove. no weird sagging, no uncomfortable tight spots. they send you a measurement form and you can either do it yourself or take it to a local tailor.

some find getting custom tailored gear kinda over-the-top/too expensive but it's really awesome when you have an odd body size.

also, the kit quality is EXCELLENT. super comfy bibs/chamois and both jerseys and bibs last for a long time.

my usual squadra, pactimo, LG kits last about a year after heavy use. my first brandtsorenson kit, i bought 3 years ago and i am still wearing it heavily and it still has lots of life in it. also, if you lose weight, they do free size downs as well.



Am I the only person that would knock someone's teeth out if they stole my bike and I found them? Fucking thieves...Yes, it will ship internationally.It never gets easier you just go faster! Honestly for the first few months(2-3) I got my first proper entry level road bike I just stocked to my indoor soccer shoes which was comfy enough for decent distances. The bike came with clipped pedals so I didn't have to buy anything. After that few months I decided to get clipless pedals and shoes for Christmas as a gift to myself. What I got was SPD-SL ($29) and Nashbar's SpD-SL shoes ($65 I think? The one after their cheapest pair) as they seemed rly well-made. Only 2 months in using SPD-SLs but it still feels great! I can't go back now. I only wear normal shoes now if I'm communiting to school (less than 4miles). Even with shimano SpD-SL pedals its wide enough to not make normal shoes uncomfortable for short rides. ["cycling furiously"](http://vimeo.com/74449197)

I put RS80 hoops on mine, swapped the saddle, and the rest is stock Sram Rival. It's just brilliant.Great design overall. Just for the love of cycling please but r/bicycling into the lines like the front!If you ride a lot, such an extreme position could have really bad effects on your junk. Just fyi, if you didn't already know.That's so nice to hear, I keep getting more and more excited about it as the days passThat bothers me oh so very much!I had a friend kind of do the same. He had his bike stolen in downtown So Paulo, Brazil. A few days later he saw some suspicious guys riding bikes that (for him) seemed to be all stolen.

He realized one of the guys was riding his bicycle. So he waited for a distraction, grabbed it and rode away. He was chased by the other guys, so he went to the police station as fast as he could.

When they got there, he still had the receipt for the bike in his bag, because he had just filed a report for the theft. The cops made some questions to the chasing guys then released then. Yeah I haven't had anyone balk at the request in person, but I have had people suddenly stop replying to my emails when I say that. Maybe they're legit and think I'm a creeper fishing for addresses, but most people seem to think it's reasonable.Thanks! May order a pair thenHOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST AND HOW CAN I GET IT SHIPPED TO MEXICO?ZachlyNice. Now, no more pedal stands (he said, having learned it the hard way)Rabobank?What's risky about this? There was a stop light in front of the bridge, there's a stoplight on the bridge, this is GROSS negligence on the part of the driver. I've got an RS myself, and it's a brilliant bike. Too bad it's UCI illegal, so I guess I'll never be able to do Le Tour with it.

I went through the same process as you, I rode 25 or so bikes, and kept coming back to the RS. The shop tried to put me on an R3, and it just wasn't the same.

Ride it like you stole it.Ah, I was looking at [this one.](http://www.slingshotbikes.com/technology-foldtech.php)I think STI is for shimano only.Exactly location? I'm from Yorkshire and I can't figure out where it is... Looks great!Fined for $25..? What the hell?Yeah I know it's easy to get upset about victim blaming, and obviously the cyclist has the right to take the lane, and obviously the car is at fault.

*But* if you can't keep a decent pace in traffic, maybe walk until you have a safer path. That guy was going slow af (maybe it's made worse by perspective but it looks like joggers were moving faster than him.) It's not about being right, it's about being safe.Depends on your city. It is legal in many parts of los angeles.

I  am trying to say here is simple. There are drivers like this and there always be. If there is a great chance (from what i read in the comments here) this happens very often, especially on this particular bridge.

Here in america we are caring about the laws more than reality. I know you are legally right but i prefer to live legally wrong than dead legally right. Makes sense now?Not anymore so much, but i have padded tights so i have that going for me Trading a license for your bike (it's a decent road bike, too) is not necessarily a bad call.

When I sell bikes at my shop, I tell buyers they need to leave their license AND credit card with me during a test ride, and I still worry that the test ride may become permanent. The colors &amp; patterns are very good.  But...

* I think the back would look a lot better if the snoo/gear and /r/bicycling were swapped.  That way you could use a bigger snoo/gear and the sub name wouldn't break up the angled design pattern.
* I don't like the "reddit" on the front at all, and it won't be legible while riding (covered by right arm).  There isn't really a great option, though ... OH YES THERE IS: wrap reddit around the collar, twice, once on each side.
* The bibs are fantastic as is!I personally gave up on risky rides like this long time ago. I am riding to work everyday and bicycles are my daily commute. I nearly got killed multiple times so no, i won't ride because it is my right. I totally understand some of us will.I agree. I won't be buying it unless this change is made. As it is it looks rough.&gt;And just so you don't get the wrong idea, I have ridiculous reflexes, peripheral vision, and situational awareness. It would be hugely safer for me to ride a bike in traffic than literally 99% of the population.

I found this part exceptionally awesome!If this was the first time this happened, I would've said the same thing. You're right, the reason I mentioned it is because I noticed that OPs saddle is all the way forwards. If he had it set professionally, thats one thing, but if it is actually too far forwards, he will feel scrunched up on the bike, and possibly feel like he wants more reach.Super agreed! I really hope they either remove that or move it inside one of the stripes for the production run.Guys, guys, guys... I've been putting together a campaign of the pen &amp; paper superhero rpg, Aberrant and... well take a glance at this hero, [Caestus Pax](http://www.rpgpost.com/uploads/gallery/album_14/gallery_1_14_104325.jpg).I like that the article shows that in doing this and using similar phrases (don't say cars, say person driving a car. Don't say accident, say collided with. etc.), it is reducing the "us vs. them" mentality as well as being more accurate in descriptions of events.I'm glad OP's okay too! I rewrote the title and the sentence to emphasize the absurdity of blaming cyclists for their own deaths:

&gt; **California Senator wants law forcing all humans to wear bullet proof vests.**
&gt; Lius nephew, Alan Liu, was killed in 2004 by a drunk gun owner while sitting around in Sonoma County. Liu was wearing a bullet proof vest.

Definitely thought it was a butt cheek ...which really helps with scaleLasco is the pits. Looks like there's a darkened portion in the break, this means oxidation, which means it was probably partially cracked through for at least a bit of time.

I can't stress enough the importance of looking over your bike at least semi regularly. This crack may have been evident? I wish this stuff didn't cost so much.What, are you one of those people who thinks that roads are paid for using some magical usage fund, funded exclusively by drivers? Buahahhaahaaha. Everybody pays for roads. &gt; Lius nephew, Alan Liu, was killed in 2004 by a drunk driver while riding in Sonoma County. Liu was wearing a helmet.

These are the sort of people who tell you bikes are dangerous even though only a handful of people are killed by bikes each decade. Tens of thousands are killed by cars, most of them *in other cars*.I don't even get the joke of the title. I did, however, enjoy the film and appreciate this kind of commercial endeavor. I'd rather see an advertising budget poured into work like this rather than some garish spread in a magazine or obnoxious signage in a store or event.

I get that Rapha is an easy target for snark, but you can still enjoy a film like this without buying their clothes.And this is why when I sell bikes on CL, I tell the buyers in advance that they have to leave their licence with me if they want to test ride.No I had a few time constraints, and my rural area is extremely hilly. 10 miles is all I could manage before on my BSO and it sure as hell would have taken me twice as long :') the geometry is going to be a bit of a learning curve I know, but I'd rather learn the hard way. The saddle is set up correctly and the frame size is right for my height though, thanks. Ha yeah, GP4000s definitely. Although don't you know how tricky the logo thing is, I always start out trying to do that, them I'm like, sod it.I have the Thermal Elite bib tights from PI. I've had them about 2 years, and I'm in WI so they see a lot of use. I like the fact that there is no chamois, because then I can wear a pair of bib shorts underneath and change up which pair depending on temperature and ride length.


The fabric in the crotch/inner thigh area is very wind resistant. I have never gotten cold there even in 20 degree 2-hour rides. The lower leg area doesn't stay as warm, under 25 degrees I will usually wear a pair of knee warmers underneath.


I am very skinny and they are a bit loose in the upper thigh area. It's not enough that the wind catches them. The lower legs are nice and snug, they might be too tight if you have large calves.


The zippers in the bottom have held up well with lots of use.Have you done any century rides previously? What is the longest ride you've done?It does but you have to have a Garmin which can be cost prohibitive for a lot of people.  Or just not a high priority if you're not serious about training.Do you have testicles? I can't imagine how you ride this.wow that makes me so happy to see. Really devastating to learn of his injury after watching those amazing road bike party videos. To see this man getting to still do what he loves despite his injury makes me feel like no matter what happens there's still so much joy to be found in life! :)I had the same problems bud, using bibs solved everything. Also bibs don't have any waist elastic, so they are much more comfy.

On AliExpress I bought 6XL clothes that are huge for even me (6'3" 270lbs).I thought it was reasonably old when I saw it, as the frame looking nothing at all like my 2012 model.Why not helvetica???????? Would look so nice.Pedestrians on bikes has potential problems in urban planning because much of the cycling infrastructure in the UK already assumes that people using it will basically be pedestrians on bikes, hence the having to give way to every single side road and property access and that putting up signs allowing you to ride on the pavement is somehow sufficient.when I was 18 or 19, I hit over 60mph down a very steep hill that had some (I thought) gentle curves at the bottom. 60mph on a bike made those curves seem very very sharp, and the amount of lean I had to do was horrifying. Never again. These days I stick to 50.I honestly looked at this and said that I would buy it if the /r/bicycling didn't look so damn out of place.It's often used in cycling circles as a derogatory term for someone who isn't a cycling enthusiast, rides down the street on a heavy mountain bike with fat tyres then down the pavement getting in the way of pedestrians, that they are a "person on a bike" not a cyclist to avoid giving cyclists a bad name.

However for cycling for transportation it's a useful device, to say the infrastructure is not for 'cyclists' but for people who want to get around using a bicycle. It taps into the way our brains have to organise everyone into groups and it's all too easy to put cyclists into an out-group, as they are strange, and not one of us.Ride it and see. I'm 6'4" and I ride a 58cm fits perfect.[This fucking thing BRAAAAAAP BRAAAAAAP!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqpcBpSsj1A)Now do that for 50 miles ;)From one big guy to another, bib shorts are where it's at.  Aerotech Designs makes some great big or tall bibs for plus sized people.  I've ridden the hell out of a few pairs of Aerotech bibs and jerseys and they really hold up.

My normal mountain biking setup is Aerotech bib shorts under the [Aerotech pedal pusher shorts](http://www.aerotechdesigns.com/aetedemecoca.html).  The shorts are long enough to cover up any knee pads I might be wearing which is more comfortable than shorter shorts that bunch at the top of the pads. Bib shorts cover the crack and lower back and I'll normally wear an Aerotech tall jersey over the top or a motocross jersey if I'm getting a little more aggro.

Just own the uniform.  The drivers are just angry that they're stuck in traffic and you're keeping pace.You gotta be really pro to pedal with the height diff between your saddle and handlebars...

If your legs cant keep your body "floating" on the bike through pedal power, you will feel exhausted after 10 miles indeed.

EDIT: [This can help you](http://cdn.mos.bikeradar.com/images/bikes-and-gear/bikes/road/CYP216.workshop.riser_prev-500-90-500-70.jpg)This will be my first time buying one, but in the past it's been a piece by piece thing so you could buy any individual article if you wanted. The prices vary but I think you could get the higher end kit, or jersey and bibs, for around the $200 range and the lower end kit around the $130 range. Of course if you preferred you could just get the jersey or bibs or get only socks or whatever else they decide to offer. I will probably go a little crazy. I messaged aggleotis about the quality last week and he said the GC is a very nice quality kit. I am excited to try out the brand as all I have been exposed to is Pearl Izumi. All of my kits are their PRO line and I have nothing but great things to say about that brand. I'm interested to see how the GC stacks up and I'm excited to show off this sub reddit. Not to mention PI has some pretty boring designs so this will be my first set of bibs with loud colors. I'm Pumped!I don't upgrade things that are working just fine for their application.Theres a cat4 climb connecting my city to another. It goes through a forest and has a big bike lane.

I love to ride there and I know it very well. Last time I went through, a truck hit one of the light poles and everything was pitch black. I descended on complete darkness, just looking at the tree shadows at 54 kph.MN rider here. I stay indoors on a trainer mostly because I don't want to get my bikes full of snow and salt. Next year I think I'm going to get a cheap CX bike for winter riding.How do we purchase a kit? Didn't think about it at first. Now I can't stop thinking about it.Make a "freeride" 3/4 lenght version of this and I'm in. Looks amazing.Exactly this. He was at fault in this situation and caused damage to someone else's property, so he should pay for the damage. Which feels weird for me to say because I'm usually rooting for the cyclist. But if we want equal rights on the road, this is part of it.  Granted the bill was pretty far-fetched when comparing it to the damage shown in the video.

But playing devils advocate here, I wouldn't be surprised if the insurance lawyer or whoever wrote up the bill, got quotes from the actual manufacturer of the car for the original OEM parts that were damaged and needed to be replaced. Which in doing so would cost a lot more when you need to replace a whole hood, quarter panel, lights, hardware, and etc. Not to mention the labor involved would really bring that bill up, in comparison to a bill from an autobody repair shop. Plus the insurance company wants their cut as well. People don't work for free. So I wouldn't be surprised if the insurance company puts a percentage on that bill for administrative processing fees or whatever fees.

So even if this guy takes this to court he will still be paying a couple of thousands for the damage done on his part, plus his lawyer fees, which in Canada aren't cheap. Either way, this guy will pay.

Are you trolling?

This car was going to have an accident regardless of the cyclist or not. He's selfish, wild, and ignores road rules. If it wasn't this cyclist it could have been a car in the same exact situation. If it didn't happen that same day, every other day he's on the the road driving like a socially-dysfunctional child he puts himself and others at greater risk.

You realize it's illegal for the rider to bike in the sidewalk, pretty much everywhere in the US? I fail to see how the rider was being unsafe.I have used this exact phrasing when trying to distinguish enthusiasm (cyclists) from convenience or perceived laziness (people on bikes) as motivation for riding. It's not fair because I don't know what their motivation really is, but it's helpful when discussing cycling issues in urban setting with someone who can't see the difference. Maybe "pedestrians on bikes" is better.Ty, I started going backwards after the first two. I assumed it would finish with a full shot. I don't mind it much except for the huge /r/bicycling on the back.... I don't even understand why that's there at all.Even though the clothes are nice, I get making fun of rapha sometimes, but this is a video about a guy overcoming cancer. Title is idiotic. It is a emonda with campagnolo record groupset and shamal ultra wheelset.. 7.0 kg with bottle holder.. Had some problems with campagnolo and the bb90 Okay. I thought it was your butt.I think it's a good design. But I agree the /r/bicycling should be smaller and located on the lower back. Also I think something can be done to correct the design break with the back.I wonder if it's possible to still tweak? Just to put the text in the orange band across the back?It is hard, especially after taking it for a short spin. But selling them will help recoup some of the cost of purchase, so I'm trying to stay strong. Thanks!Can you change the back text? Check road.cc for reviews on all types of clothing. They seem to always be spot on when it comes to reviewing. I am quite satisfied with my castelli sorpasso and would buy them again (actually I did because I have 2 of them haha).How much do they usually go for and is it the whole kit we'd have to order?I think it would make a really sweet retro merino wool jerseyyeah I have this, its not very good and the handle bar mount still sucks if you have hoods.They are metric not quarter inch by the way.I used a Smartwool Rambition knicker last year but I lost some weight so it fit like a diaper when I put it on in December. (In TX, don't hate on me because I didn't need it in October.)

So when my club ordered new kits from Voler I picked up their thermal knicker and I'm really happy with it. It's been plenty warm down to 40 and it wasn't overly hot in the mid 60s when a ride stretched out to 4 hours.

Obviously not Buffalo weather but I've been happy with both when they fit properly.You must have strong willpower to sell those incredible wheels. Obviously you don't need it for the type of riding you do but they look absolutely badass.When mother nature isnt trying to drown us here in the northwest thats the plan.I really like the 2014 kit :(Er, the third one?Thanks, but I want something good for long distances even if it's less convenient to get upstairs. Bought last year's, didn't fit. Was sad and $60 poorer. :(Find my friends on iOS and Android.Shame, I loved all the data it showed and the comparisons. I had a good 450 activities on there over a couple of thousand segments.

If it's less than 10 per year i'll probably upgrade to Pro, that's not a lot in the scheme of things and if it means VW can keep going that's great.All that while maintaining his mobile phone in the pocket.like that a lot - Ill get one
That's the seatstay. You can tell it's not a fork because the head tube isn't there (it's out of shot at the top), it's too wide, and the angles are all wrong. If it was the fork, the head angle would be all whack.Might have been nice to have something about this group mentioned in any of the threads about the jerseys this year.

Honestly, this year's jersey has been horribly mismanaged, I already thought we won't be getting any. And I wasn't alone, judging by the threads in december...

I will be buying at least a shirt, though.Is there a single picture where I can actually see the bike and not pseudo-artistic closeups? How/Where did you get the decals made? I think it's important to remember that in Chicago, drivers cut off other cars like this all the time, too. Not saying it's okay, but it's less bike related and more shitty driver related.

Also, I always have better luck on Dearborn than you. I'm sorry for how terrible those pedestrians are. I'd wear it.  Whats with the google drive belly?Yup, I liked the runner up jersey.  I would've voted for that one had I seen the poll.  The Trek 7.4 FX is not very light, and it's just as bulky as any other full size bike, so not going to be a lot easier to walk up. A proper road bike like Trek 1.2 or whatever they call it now might be slightly lighter. But if you want something much easier to walk up stairs with, a folding bike like the Dahon Mu SL might be better.That sounds painful, I'm glad I didn't add laceration to the mix. These were Lasco cranks, not unbranded but not great. I'm thinking of going to SRAM S100 or Omnium. I have spare 5700 nd Rotor 3D24 cranks lying around though, so those may be an option if I can make the chainline work. Though the Rotor cranks cost nearly as much as this bike!I voted against this one at every head to head.

Can't believe this ugly as sin kit got chosen. I wish there was a way of knowing how many people who voted for this were actually planning on buying a kit...If you are really immersed in it, you should talk to /u/BucknChange, he just posted below that he's willing to pay people to design stuff for his team!Looks like you need to take 1 link out of the chain, besides that a great looking build, congrats :)&gt;The standards have tripped up other helmet makers who have been working on more portable models. European models  including the foldable Pango and a model from Carrera that collapses like an accordion for storage  are not certified to the U.S. standard. There's even a Swedish-designed version worn as a neck collar until sensors detect a crash, at which point a head-covering air bag is deployed. It might appeal to those who eschew helmets because of hat hair, but it, too, doesn't meet U.S. safety requirements.they hate us cause they anusWell, now what are you going to do? Any other big plans?Running a single freewheel.Lasco branded, unsure if there's a model.Don't ride cheap bikes. Life's too short. That's a junky cast alu Chinese crank. huh TIL I always just called them sti'scool bikeAre you saying 10 miles is all you can ride now? It seems incongruous with your saddle-bar drop.What do you mean? Did they add a bike lane since I last watched?Then what is the black thing on the very bottom left? It appears to be the fork to me.

OP could have his terminology wrong. Yes my renters insurance can be updated but the cost to do that was more than the bicycle only policy and I found out that the renters insurance doesn't pay replacement cost and the bike only policy does. Knowing a bike only policy will pay a claim is more comforting than hoping the renters policy will pay fairly.
1. Talking on a cell is still legal in Georgia. Drives me nuts
2. Watching people just stroll around in the bike lane makes my blood boil.
3. You did blow a couple stop signs there...
4. Salting the roads really kills the stripes in the bike lane I live at 6th floor and changed my bike a little less than a year ago, beside that the current bike has drops and the last doesn't the main differences for me are the weight (6th floor with a too small lift) and the numbers of gears.

Ask them if you can take it to a spin and then find some stairs to try to bring the bike up.

The bike seems a good bike to me, you should be able to go faster with the same effort.So, what exactly does this thing do that other cheap E-Bikes don't, except for a pretty add campaign with charity slapped on to it?It's too easy to spend money.

Bright side: it's good stuff.

Not-so-bright-side: you don't NEED it. :)Colour me surprised if they manage that!Oh man you got me looking through their website. Damn you Internet and online shopping!Cyclists aren't the barrier to cycling, the infrastructure is. Looks good! If you saved a bike from a rusty grave that's fine by me and I think by most. You didn't grind the derailleur hanger off too like some people...

Your chain tension looks slack, though! I'd take out a link, you should have enough movement in the dropouts to account for this.They're going to lose $250 each bike at their initial price if they make it through production.I'd love to cycle in the clothes I work in and arrive fresh faced and, importantly, alive.

However, the roads in London on which I commute are decidedly *not* suited to Dutch style riding. If I changed my riding style, I'd be in a world of trouble.

With the new protected lanes that have just been approved for London, it should help the development of a less Lycra-fied cycling culture.

However, I enjoy riding my bike the way I do at the moment.Slingshot bikes actually have a fibreglass hinge in the top tube.Get the backpack! That way you can pick which one you wanna use on which day.Was it a fixie?I broke my left crank starting from a light on my singlespeed earlier last year. It sheared off just like yours, then the sharp bit left on the bike scraped about 6 inches along my shinbone. Had to get a bunch of staples for that... I replaced with Sram Rival cranks because there was a good deal, and they are hella stiff and leave me much more confident than brandless OEM cranks.[Sorry, but you're wrong ;)](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vl0rg/okay_for_leisure_riding/coio1j8)

It's the underside of the downtube. You can see the seat cluster in the background, but you can't see a head tube.You mean, strip off, naked? No thank you. I think my gentleman's vegetables would fully invertIt used to be a rusted beat old Bianchi Strada LX (i know it's probably a cardinal sin that I turned a bianchi into this).   But I had to strip down the bike to it's bare metal and sand off all of the rust until she looked clean again!

Then repainted, and even decided for fun (and since would always be my personal city bike) I would create my own logo and make it my own.  Made the decals and recoated the bike.  Then sanded down a lot of the old parts, repainted them black, re taped the bars, and cleaned up the hoods.

Bought new cables, and since the old crankset was blown, replaced it and bought new wheels (wheels were also bent).

I had painted the old wheels and they looked really cool, but didn't realize how untrue they were until they got on the bike. Lot of wasted work there...so life lesson learned!

Let me know what you guys think!No this is definitly the seatpost tube. You can clearly see it is a pic from behind the seatpost tube, the fork is visible on the bottom left and the downtube has the cage mounts.

EDIT: he is holding the headtube, the fork comes down on the left, the downtube is on the left and has the cage mounts. You know what's the SHIT is the Timbuk with the DSLR camera insert. I picked one up a couple years ago, and at the time I was skeptical 'cuz it was so expensive but it's the BOMB! Completely inconspicuous with tons of storage.

Maybe I had to find a reason to buy another one, since the first one will never wear out.Thanks for cross posting here. saw this in r/funny and thought "That's not funny, that's just awesome"Easiest bingo ever created.
Big fan of my Endura Thermolites. They come with or without a chamois so you can wear your favorite pair of shorts underneath if you so choose.Agree.

Simple solution could be to just swap the position of the reddit alien and the "/r/bicycling"What crankset were you using? I haven't seen anything like that in years.Yeah, I have a timbuk2 bag that I've used for 4 years now and it still looks new. It's my daily laptop carry-bag even when I'm not riding, and when I travel via plane I can pack all of my electronics, 3 days of clothes, and my toiletries without much effort. It expands beautifully and gets tiny easily too.

I would DEFINITELY invest in the cross-chest strap for riding.

My wife has the timbuk2 backpack, and I love that one too. Came with a bottle opener! :)Ehh not sure, most likely responding to a robbery or taking a break. I would not say better, different certainly. Fat people tend to like them because they support the gut and don't show the crack.I am every day..I'll bet it was brisk up there. Some proper amazing scenery in Yorkshire, i'm in Sheffield so have the TdF route on my doorstep!First of call, start calling yourself a clydesdale. That's what I do.

Bibs are the answer. There is thin material that comes up your lower back and the should straps keep the shorts from drifting down.

In general, look for the words "club fit". They are designed for people with an...umm...non-ideal cycling shape.Agree its an insurance play, but get legal advice first. Don't want to be hit with costs if it goes against you.What logic is that? People who are legally obligated to use infrastructure they've paid for should be able to use it without being killed? Retarded, right?

What you're advocating is (on another plane) this: women should avoid going out alone, because it's easier for them to get attacked.Looks like the Wal-Mart fat bike with a battery and motor tacked on.You are literally telling people to not use infrastructure they have paid for (and are often legally required to use), so that others may use it without slowing down.

That sounds really fucking stupid.reminds me of Team GB's 2012 Kit.I have a size small 2014 Timbuk2 Classic. My biggest problem was deciding on the size. I went with a small to allow for a smaller bag for lighter loads when on a bike/around town. I have a backpack/rack for more stuff.

It's a decent bag but maybe not the most bike specific that is around. You'd have to go with the Chrome or Mission bags for a really bike orientated bag. But for my purposes it's solid.

I found it for about $50 on amazon.Yea, out of all the kits, this one was the only one i would never buy.No. No it wasn't  Yeah. I would go with shorts with built in chamois. Using normal clothes over the lycra just feels weird. It feels "floaty".~~Does it say that in the video?~~

~~I was one of two tourists I know who went to Porto Vecchio last summer to cycle. By the amount of bike stores around town and non-locals I met on climbs, we weren't the only ones. So if a conservative estimate is that there where 50 tourists in corsica last july to ride bikes, that would mean there would be 50000 now. I highly doubt that.~~

oh wait. this is rapha. you're making fun of their customers. nevermind this...I started getting really into cycling in 2005 in SF. Even then that city had great bicycling infrastructure, community, and weather. You don't know how good you have it ! Attempted *hit* is even worse, because of intent, malice &amp; aforethought. That could even net you as much as murder (or at least vehicular assault.)Wrong again.

For people who aren't children, it is in fact illegal to ride a bike on the sidewalk in many areas.

http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6255/can-cyclists-legally-ride-on-the-sidewalk

It's also more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists alike. Drivers don't expect cyclists on the sidewalk, and don't look for them.Combining that fork with that frame is absurd.

I love it. &gt; Yep, move it back along the lines of the orange and I would consider picking it up.

Me too. Now the subreddit name looks like an afterthought.
I use the Android version of the Road ID app - I'll assume the iPhone version has the same features:

It generates a lock screen background to give all the info I'd want someone to have if I couldn't speak for myself just by turning on the screen.

It updates my location on a tracking map, and texts a link to pre-set contacts. The tracking is active for as long as I specify - I usually set it quite a bit longer than I plan to be out.

It has an option to alert someone if I don't move for 5 minutes. It warns me first so I don't scare anybody if I take a break or have to fix a flat, but if I'm down and out it'll let people know where.

I also use Glympse when I'm out and about because my watch has an applet to start and stop it manually, perfect for errands and JRA days (my worried person has an uncanny ability to call for my ETA with the dinner ingredients precisely when I'm busy dodging heavy traffic 10 minutes from home!) but I make sure to use the Road ID app for non-utility rides.The top tube is also much bigger.Laughable Insurance company ploy. He should reply with a counter offer of $100 and if they don't accept they can see him in court. In court they will need to prove damages and actually win a judgement and they are likely to spend more than they win.  It's nothing more than an extortion play.I've developed prostatitis from biking. Sucks when it flairs up. And is probably a scam.This is quite disappointing... I do not feel like wearing a rainbow riding.I've been using the same Timbuk2 bag since I got it in 1993. Still waterproof; none of the truck tarp lining has worn out.I'm getting those at the end of the month. Glad to hear they're nice and stiff!Keep the seat, it looks like a bananaThat is really useful info. Did you read this somewhere or reason it out?What the heck SUV did he hit to get a $6K repair bill?  Guessing a BMW/Mercedes or something else along those lines.Thanks everyone!  It seems like I should probably use this as an excuse to get myself one of those fancy Garmin's I've been eyeing for the past year, haha!  "No no, honey, I'm actually getting this for you!"Totally agree. I'm all for periodic driving review tests. No idea why this doesn't happen. There's a lot more to driving than being able to see.These are some of the many companies making "true" messenger bags. There are a ton of great options out there.

Seriously though, don't knock it till you have tried it.This is my thought as well. That's exactly the point. It's a stress-surrounded cycling culture. The city just needs to relax, take a deep breath, strip out of their lycra and just enjoy riding a bicycle.Exactly. Remove as many barriers as possible to the adoption of cycling. As it remains (gear heavy, including carbon lycra and high vis) it will continue to be dominated by young and middle aged men, serving as a large barrier to adoption for women and childrenUnless theyve changed it (i havent been back in years)there's stairs on the South Side end of the walk way. You'd have to carry your bike down or up, and the walkway itself would be pretty cramped for pedestrians and cyclists alike if they split it. As to why there's no designated bike lane? I dunno.#####&amp;#009;

&gt;__Paul van Winkel__ (born 1953 or 1954)  is a [Belgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) former [wheelchair racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_racer) and multiple [Paralympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic) gold medallist.

&gt;He is [Belgium's most successful athlete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_at_the_Paralympics) at the [Summer Paralympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Paralympics), having won seven gold medals in [athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_(sport\)) between 1980 and 1988.  In his first [Paralympics in 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Paralympics), he was a gold medallist in the 4100 m relay (category 25) and the category 3 slalom. Two further golds followed in [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Summer_Paralympics), this time in the 400m 1500m. He was also the silver medallist in the 100m and 200m sprint events, as well as taking a bronze in the category 3 slalom. Van Winkel medalled in all the events he entered in [1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Paralympics): he was first in the 400m, 800m and 5000m wheelchair races, and was the runner-up in the 200m and the 1500m. In his fourth and final [Paralympic Games in 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Paralympic_Games), he came close to further medals with a fourth place in the 800m and fifth in the 200m. He did not make the 400m final and failed to finish in the 5000m, making his last appearance one without medals.

&gt;He twice medalled in the demonstration [wheelchair race at the Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_race_at_the_Olympics), winning the inaugural event in 1984 and coming runner-up four years later.   He has also competed outside of Olympic competition and took three consecutive victories at [Grandma's Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandma%27s_Marathon) in two separate streaks.  He encouraged fellow marathon racer Marcelo Ordaz-Cruz to enter the sport, after Ordaz-Cruz became paralysed due to a gunshot wound.  Van Winkel now lives in [Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota).

Nobody had any idea until one day a guy was in the breakroom talking shit about how fast he is on a bike (being a douche). [Paul](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_van_Winkel) pipes up that there is no way that the douche could beat him. They set up a race behind the store I few days later and Paul repeatedly whup'd Mark's ass. Multiple ways and distances. The only time Mark won was with an impressive full roll head start. At the end HR very casually told everyone that he owns gold medals. We call Paul "breakroom" because he is always sitting down but he works harder than anyone else in the store and customers love him. If you have iOS 8+ and your wife also has an iphone go to a message of hers, click details, then click "share my location". You can then set a time limit (hour, end of day, or until you turn it off) and anytime she wants she can see you on a map when she clicks details on one of your messages.

For non-phone specific tracking, which has been mentioned, the new garmin edge devices enable live tracking of your location. They sync with your phone (they have android and iphone apps) and upload your location. The advantage here is more frequent location updates and less battery drain since the device has the GPS and doesn't use the phones.Because bicycles are vehicles and don't need a seperate path.


http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/1335/9552/original.jpgLook into bibs. Way better than shorts.Are you saying these guys are racing to their IT jobs? Fastest I've gone is around 45mph, a couple of times

Downhill of course, I think I could go faster but the road dead ends into a grass drainage and I don't wont to go from asphalt to grass at that speed.

http://i.imgur.com/VznY647.jpgSounds like you're too strong for your own good!it was stickied to the top of the subreddit for daysWow, I know what I won't be buying.Yes, I was hoping this one would win. So when is it going to be ready to order and how much?
 I don't have this problem where I live. It's just too cold for slush. Everything is frozen rock hard.Error. Wheels not found.That's what I'd call fresh air.http://www.aerotechdesigns.com/big-and-tall-cycling-apparel.htmlAh, I see. That actually makes it quite chaotic indeed. If this bicycle-business is consistent, they might as well turn part of that road into a cyclepath.Oh, I wasn't even referencing to real racing, just the behavior. I don't even know what Cat 6 is :'). That blogpost is pretty good, heh.I like the idea of stopping cars from driving on a public sidewalk, but the way they are going about it is aggressive and misleading. No signs or anything, just a giant group of teens in hoodies stopping traffic. Even as a cyclist, I would be more frightened and anxious then questioning my road choice and listening to what they had to say :/
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reddit-jersey-announceLast night was my first puncture since march last year.

In feb last year I had one ride with 7!! punctures, one with 3.
Funnily enough that was a "change the tyres" moment and it really wasn't a good day.


Turns out it was just bad luck, one of my friends has run my old tyres for the last 6 months without any problems.You can subscribe to the Jersey Announcement Google Group. You'll get an E-Mail when important stuff happens. Pretty good:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reddit-jersey-announceKit looks fine, I'd add a couple of bits (same kit comes with me everywhere on any ride and fits a jersey pocket)

- Multitool with chain breaker
- Spare chain links

Otherwise, go ride your bike. You'll be fine. Who wants to bet all the people commenting on how the cyclist deserved it are a bunch of lard-asses high on too much mcbeetus?

Easiest bet ever......ugly as sin. I wish I'd known about the voting so I could have voted for something else. Blegh.[Reminds me of Southwest Airlines.](http://www.wggb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/southwest.jpg)I, too, greatly dislike it. I wish there was some way to do another run of the 2014 design so I could get something that actually fits me. :(Yeah, wtf. I'm on here every day and never saw anything about this. I wish I could have voted for something else...Wow. This is hot. Can't wait to buy one.[Just like the '83 Astros!](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sUNW_fWgUbE/TxXxHDZMMmI/AAAAAAAACAA/YeiiumqXkNM/s1600/HoustonAstros1983.jpg)Just about all dedicated cycling shoes will have holes to attach cleats so you can clip into the pedals. Mountain bike cleats (SPDs) require two bolts, road cleats (SPD-SLs) need three, and they clip in to different types of pedals.

I'm gonna assume your bike currently has flat/platform pedals. If that's the case then you're probably best using regular sports shoes (unless they're super-minimalist running shoes or something extreme) until you get the new pedals and shoes together. If you use cycling shoes on flat pedals you'll find it hard to keep your feet on the pedals - because the shoes are designed to be used with cleats, they generally have a hard smooth sole with just about zero grip.

As for brands, I personally wear Shimano shoes, but it's best to try on a few different pairs and see what feels good. Prices range massively depending on how securely they fit, how stiff they are (more stiff = more efficient pedalling but less comfortable), how little they weigh, and so on.

As ever, the best thing to do is go to a local bike shop and ask for advice.Where and when can I buy one of theseWell they are built knowing there is no downtube. OP's bike was designed with the structural integrity of the downtube in mind.LOL, no it is not.

Also, a biker needs to look out for their own life and take the safest route for them and others.
Many times the safest route for everyone is the sidewalk.
In most places the sidewalks are empty anyways.

Safety trumps everything.  Who produces these?nice repo girl.Upvote for Glympse. I use this for my commute both ways because my wife worries a little bit when I'm riding in traffic. Works very well and doesn't drain the battery too much. Entirely determined by pressure?  Even if the rubber on the tire is much harder (that is what I read and it feels much harder even at 85)?  Makes sense though, today it is going up in pressure, so we will see.Well they are called [brifters.](http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/shifters.html#brifters)Chrome and Timbuk2 are the go-tos around here.So he hit a car and is surprised to have to pay for the damages?Haha yea I was on my phone and I'm not to Good at spelling in the first place!No snow in the Caribbean!Because fuck you.

Good for her. I probably wouldn't be able to keep calm in front of the asshole.Yep, move it back along the lines of the orange and I would consider picking it up. As it is it looks rough. I do like the overall design though. Not my first choice but I do remember voting for this one more than a few times.This is great. But if you think about it, for most people who can only afford one bike for whatever reason (could be financial, space, not wanting to deal with x amount of bikes, etc...), they would buy the one bike that serves all potential purpose they need it for and use it in anyway they can. Basically, the thing is here, do the best you can with what you've got. I am a mountain biker. I've got a dual-sus 29er bike. I use the same bike to be out there on the mountain going incredibly fast downhill, climbing hills in forests as well as being on the road heading to work on most Monday mornings or the occasional meetup with friends for dinner at a restaurant on Wednesday evening. One bike, multiple uses.

As for Lycra, some need to get work fast, and have made arrangements to clean up once they're at work. And let's not forget, it is incredibly more comfortable riding 15 to 20+ KM in lycra than it would be in any other type of gear. And this has nothing to do with middle-aged men but there are all sorts of people and also Women out there.

One thing you and I agree on is the messenger bag. But hey, I use a backpack which might be worse? (Not too sure). But it's what works for me and the type of bike I own.

Finally, clipless shoes... There are clipless shoes out there built in ways you wouldn't know they're clipless unless you looked really closely. I've got one of those for when I commute. They're practical off the bike but on the bike, they allow me to put in as much power as I need. And again, it wouldn't make much sense for someone with one bike that is used for multiple purposes to keep changes pedals just because...

It's quite simple, cycling will become mainstream when people start more and more realizing its benefits. If they're waiting for us all to start "dressing up", they'll wait a long long long time.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I see where you're coming from, but somehow I strongly feel that this is a false debate.Reality reduced into a cynical and sad metaphor.Indeed, thanks.That's exactly what I would do, too. Nicely done.Ty!

Yes; I'm already seeing some differences in the style of raiding... like paying way more attention to the road itself; ty!, i'm 1.63Well, the beer came after we rode. Though the mental image of somebody chugging along the interstate whilst chugging a beer is a funny one.Nice bike! I've been lusting after an Anyroad for a bit now -briefly considered it as a first 'proper' bike, but ended up getting a Defy instead due to availability. I'd still love to have one as a gravel grinder though!or a descent, I believe it goes by a variety of names you smart ass.I'm in the same boat when the hell did voting open? I swear I've been on reddit every day and somehow missed it.. Ground effect (New Zealand company) make mountain bike shorts that have a high back to minimise the bum crack visibility. They are very comfortable shorts, but aren't cheap. Might be a good option for you. Came in to say thisSo because you can get killed by a rando (no idea what that is) when you are following the 'obvious' rules, then it is ok to ride recklessly? Oh come on.

We've started to see a lot more people sharing their rides with videos, and an obvious part of doing that is that you are going to get feedback and criticism for your riding. It was clearly obvious what could have happened in this situation and the rider was lucky they avoided a serious collision. Being able to get that feedback and learn from it is very valuable. If you don't want that feedback, don't post videos.&gt; negative incline

so a decline.This makes me sick.Sure but so many in this thread are too quick to look at the bridge and think the guy was wrong to do what he did because they think they'd feel uncomfortable doing it.

That's fine but that doesn't take away that this cyclist was 100% textbook in his approach. And if we are gonna bring personal experience into it, then we should defer to him since he presumably knew the route and knew what he was doing. What's more likely, he decided to go ahead and do something risky (no evidence of that  in The video at least) or that he just had actual experience of what this bridge was like and rode like he was supposed to?

All evidence and reason points to the latter. &gt; My balance apparently sucks

Damn, I'd say you quit a little soon. My balance sucks too, the great thing about rollers is that is one of things it's more effective at training.I have a chrome citizen, it's really well made but I find like many messenger bags the inside shape is rather weird.

If I buy another one, which I probably won't, then I'd probably get one from these guys:

http://www.grimbags.co.uk/

As the inside of the bag is much more rectangular and thus good for carry boxes and whatnot. It also had a padded back which is something the chrome bags sorely miss.Can I turn it into night mode for that more 'sheek' look Lots of high vis does make sense for cycling in the UK, especially in the winter. Gloomy overcast days are frequent, and we generally just don't get a lot of sunlight.Walking it? Sure.

Riding it? Nope. Bicycles should be ridden in the road.That sort of speed will be normal to you - eventually. Just going down a very very slight hill it's pretty easy to exceed 23mph and eventually it'll feel like cruising speed.

I don't much like descents either, once I'm topping 30mph most of the time I'm thinking "ok that'll do" and I'll start braking to scrub off some speed.

But it depends on the road concerned, the fastest I've been was going down a long straight road with it blowing a gale at my back and I topped 50mph at one point but I knew I had plenty of space to brake if I needed to. Yeah, that's exactly what I was hoping for but didn't get. Not like it wasn't fun, it was great! But could've used just a little bit more... adventure, shall we say?

And seriously, the level of planning that went into this was, at best, very low.is....ugly as hell
I read the comments.  Lord help me, I want to wash my eyes out with acid right now.There's tons of cool little hole in the wall places all over the place to see and experience.  For example, the town I live in split across 4 river valleys, with the main body of the town in one.  When you get out on your bike to explore the back roads through the farming country you find crazy things - like roads laid right over/partially atop older roads, barely market castle ruins (which I only noticed because it was on a hill and CARPETED with cherry trees in bloom, temples build into caves dating back close to a millennium, weird territorial boundaries where you bike in and out of a town 4-5 times on the same road in a straight line with only one crossroad in that stretch...)

Only problem doing it on New Years is that so much stuff is closed for the holidays - I like to get out and do a tour on Golden Week or during Obon.I really want the Patagonia Black Hole messenger. It's 22 liters and comes in some awesome colours. Seems to have all the right functionality of a great simple messenger bag for cycling. Ya sorry, even though obviously no one should be commended for a hit and run, there was no reason for that guy to take up a whole lane of traffic like that. That's, well, how you get hit by a car... And this coming from someone who was run over and almost killed...on a bike...by a car. You can bet your ass that guy will think twice before riding in the middle of the road on a busy street like that again.

I don't care how much we cyclists may think we're entitled to the road, we're absolutely not. Roads were built for cars, and you'd be wise to gtfo of their way. Yeah, I was hoping to be riding through some of the lost lands, but alas... Next time! Hoping to make this an annual thing.I wish I could claim the paint job but it's not mine. I love the colour though. Looking to go a green and black colour scheme with some deep v black wheels,  black cranks and chain ring too.Me tooI live pretty far north too - and not too far off the 4.  Going north/south along the corridor you can go for 50-60miles of pretty much the same intermittent towns.  Go west or east from that corridor and you can find some real inaka.  Especially if you go towards Naruko or the coast - some of those little river valleys are like the land that time forgot.  (Until you ride up to the Lawson or 7/11...)They said I could become anything when I grow up, so I became a samsumg wallpaperWe all look stupid in cycling gear, that's half the fun!

If you're wearing baggy shorts, you could wear a pair of bib shorts underneath, that would help.

 There are also trousers and shorts cut a bit higher at the back that are supposed to prevent it, I've a feeling Rapha and Vulpine do them, though they're expensive. There's also a Levi's one that are I think.Kinda reminds me a bit of the 2012 team GB olympic kit.I used to live in Iwate, so I can definitely say that the entire road to Utsunomiya never really set off my Inaka Sense. Honestly, the whole ride was really just through a lot of dilapidated buildings &amp; crumbling infrastructure. Not that I didn't know that that was the case, but its a lot sadder when you are faced with an endless wasteland and aren't just hearing about it.Wait, when was there a vote? Why do I keep missing this stuff?!Nice!  New years up around Tohoku was about 10cm of snow and ice!

I'd choose something other than beer to drink mid-ride, but cool non-the-less.Very cool and sleek looking! Nope - they just didn't get rural enough I guess.  Up north we have bears, wild boar, monkeys, foxes, raccoons, and tanuki (as well as snakes, but they're less of a hazard) which all like to run out onto the roads.  If a cop sees the roadkill they'll call out the local municipality to have someone come and clean it up, so a lot of roadkill gets cleaned up quite quickly.Loving the paint job. Certainly would turn my head (and my bike so I could follow you and ask if you did the paint job yourself)
Double agree. I'm not buying the kit as I have enough gear...  But the r/bicycling tag on the back it out it place and breaks the very awesome design. Super sharp kit,  integrate the forum name unto the design better. Not Pro enough, needs more black. /sThis isn't good advice. You shouldn't move your saddle to accomodate your reach; saddle placement is solely dictated by the placement of your feet over the pedals. Moving it up and down could give you discomfort or knee problems. If OP needs more reach then he needs to get a longer stem.Congrats on the new bike. How tall are you if I may ask?Even the guys who look like Lance get ridiculed.  You kind of just have to own the Lycra look.  Haters gonna hate.

If you want baggier clothes though, look into mountain bike clothes.  Lots of loose-fitting stuff there.  Shorts with a built-in chamois but not skin tight.  Jerseys that don't conform to your pony keg.

You can get away with wearing street clothes over road Lycra too.  Gym shorts over bike shorts, no big deal.  But you'll still get shit from drivers who want to give you shit.  You're still a guy on a bike as far as they're concerned.  Haters gonna hate.Wooooo, go Team BARF!&gt;Wiggo isn't pumped on Qatar

Didn't really get that sentiment from the article, but whatever. He's not here for GC, which you can tell before even seeing the race as it consists of only flats and one extremely short TT. The 94th place doesn't really tell us anything, and neither does his 3rd place in the TT. Just a warm up race/paid training camp to start the season, and I suppose the conditions does help prepare for PR.All you need is some decent core strength (abs and lower back) and flexiibility to hold that position, and being lean helps too because you're supporting less weight; if you have a gut you won't be able to hold a aggresive position because it's weighing your lower back down. Being naturally flexible is also of great help but if you spend enough time on a bike you can build up the flexibility.

If you want to adopt more aggressive positions then you can do so by gradually dropping your bars. You can also build lower back strength (which is more important than abdominal) by doing backward supermans or deadlifts. You don't need to work out much to be able to support your torso, so it's actually rather easy.70kph on a mountain bike on a country road.... Good times.Agreed, also don't like itRuntastic's "Roadbike" has something like that. pll can see you during the ride via their website(runtastic.com) and can cheer for you. This might work.

https://appsto.re/at/8tO3B.iGo Snowboarding or Skiing. Will help you over getting over the fear of going fast.

Trust your equipment,  in context.

White knuckle the bars, ready to stop, enjoy the ride.Still a lot of work to do on it. Looking to get a new seat,  seat post and stem sometime soon. It gets me from a to b kind of quickly and the paint job turns heads.Odometer is already built into Strava.

How many tubes and water bottles ($10 wth?)  do you go through?  I had two spares for my road bike until I blew up one tube, but I purchased them in the middle of 2013.  I've only ever had two flats since then and  I just patched them.  Same goes for my commuter, the four tubes I have (2 spares) are from 2010 or 2011 because I patch them.  take my moneyPwobablyJust don't take it as a license to dope. Great bike... Love it!!!Ok, then same range of price. They look cool too !There was a crash up ahead involving the LBS manager and my friend couldn't stop in time, and ran him over... Thankfully everyone was OK!How do those Slingshot bikes not fold up, then?If you take off a 27" wheel with 25c tyre and put on a 700c wheel with 25c tyre, you have more clearance. You're overthinking it.Or at least put the front one on correctly with the logo next to the valve :)We both ride fixed gears, so the flatter route ended up being more appealing than the warmer one. It actually wasn't all that bad.

We rode about 155 miles total, so call it 35-40 miles per day. We're not all that hardcore in regards to trekking.Congratulations to /u/highwinds on the win. I'm pretty new to bicycling in general and hadn't seen many real jerseys when I submitted, but since then have immersed myself in it. I'll be back with a vengeance and more experience next round.I always have a cycling multi-tool on me with a chainbreaker and I keep a spare quick-release chainlink in my toolkit.

If the unthinkable happens and I need to walk a long way I use my multi-tool to remove the cleats from my shoes.

Have a patch kit with you. I prefer a mini-pump over CO2, you can fill the tire with air to find the hole. If you find the hole, you'll most likely find the cause of the flat (always check the tire and rim).

I also bring some zipties for when something loosens that shouldn't.You picked a nice color, it goes well with the chrome and leather.

One day i'll strip my winter/commuter roadbike and have it powdered in the colorscheme of the [cannondale synapse rival disc](http://www.cannondale.com/nam_en/2015/bikes/road/endurance-road/synapse/synapse-sram-rival-disc). Instead of "cannondale" I'd get my (nick)name on the downtube and my initials on the headtube and on the forks. The thing about looking forward and going fast actually works, also the thing about keeping hands on the bars and using shoulders and elbows to lean against the door or doorway - works perfectly. After 10 minutes I could ride almost not using wall to keep myself straightIt's a three lane one way road.
Change one lane to a bicycle and motorbike lane.
That will at a minimum mean some paint on the road and some signage, not 'fucking a lot of shit up' by any means. Thank you! I like the orange color scheme.&gt; had I not been in traffic...

&gt; ...and saddening since I broke my favorite shoes

Well you're lucky you only lost a pair of shoes and that your pedal came off. Terrifying indeed, it was an unpleasant suprise when I had it happen on a freewheeled bike. Can't imagin it happening on a fixed gear...Shit.I use heavy bontrager "hardcase" tires, the ones with metal wire, on my training wheelsIs that Ayrton Senna nephew?&gt; So what's cycling around Moscow like?

Over the weekend, a very good ride because no one in the city center practically lives. To work on weekdays tolerated. Today posted a video about everyday life and travel to work by bike in September last year.Yeah it's not very practical. It was meant for days when I needed to take the train (no restriction of folding bikes) but I got a little side-tracked! :D&gt;  the notion that cycling is an inherently risky activity (its not).

I think you'll agree with me that this bridge, right here, is not a place where you'd feel safe. No place to pull over, enclosed by very tall concrete barriers (6feet? It was hard to tell from the video).

I think I'm a very safe cyclist, and I'm also a very experienced cyclist, having cycled for 30 years in a large city.

On this bridge, I'd probably get off and become a pedestrian (or break the law and cycle on the sidewalk, if there were no people around).

Accidents and risks are also highly dependent on infrastructure.At this point, I'm usually getting 100 km (60 ish miles) every week. I'm bumping that up to about a hundred a week starting this weekend.Lovely work there! I do like this type of bike and would love to have one myself. Unfortunately I'm too tall for them because the seatpost never extends high enough for me. The model they put this jersey on looks like they are bloated. Thanks! I got the frame stripped and powdered locally. The bars are Velo Orange Porteur with Elk hide sew-on grips. :)
Wow, that's a good job. I like the handlebars and brakes.

Did you repaint the frame? Did you do it yourself or had somebody do it? It looks nice.Know if your feet are wide and get wide shoes to accommodate them! I got narrow shoes (Shimano R088) for my wide feet and decided to go on a six day bike tour from San Francisco past Los Angeles. My feet had me curled up on the bed after the second day, and I had to make it home with my shoes half closed and hopped up on ibuprofen. Not pleasant!I've never looked back...&gt;Reddit jersey

&gt;overnight shipping

lolThe old "fast or safe" debate. I also prefer Folsom. the majority of vehicles using market st. During commuter hours are bikes according to the San francisco bicycle coalition. w00t!Glad that guy's ok. Bus driver is a hero. Yes, do tell us more about why we should wear what you want us to wear rather than what we want to wear? Honestly, riding a bike in London, all we get is don't ride here, do ride there, wear this, don't wear that, don't stop there, do stop there, where's your hi-viz? Why are you wearing Lycra? Slow down! You're going too slow! Your lights are too bright! Your lights are on! Your lights are too flashy! Take the lane! Get off the road! Don't wear black! Where's your helmet? Get out of the way! Don't ride in the gutter! Why are you crying?Thank you! That much more pumped about it. In order for cycling to become 'safe' it needs to become mainstream and appear as a safe and everyday activity that everyone can participate in and not only *adventurous* middle-aged men who need to don a 10-piece activity-specific outfit to do.

Also, it's getting a *lot* better (in SF anyway) recently, but for some reason us cyclists are *incredibly* impractical. Stem slammed road bike + uncomfortable messenger bag and clip-less shoes is what people think they should be commuting in. I'll admit to that being me at a younger age, but it seems practical bikes with panniers + front basket + upright position are making a resurgence.



people have *too much* ambitionThere isn't a brick n' mortar in the world that wouldn't try and sell him a new bike if he brought that frame in. I'm so sick of bike shops... They're Ksyrium SLs. Great wheel for everyday and race day abuse. They're bombproof, stiff, and fairly light. Not aero, but who cares. I have the SLRs and think they're the best alloy wheel on the market, even with Mavic's shitty hubs.And what a fine job you did. It looks a really fun ride.That's the wrong direction to travel in winter!
I made the same mistake and went south in the middle of summer.

Also, you split that over four days?! How many miles did you get in per day?Yup. Personality and an eagerness to learn is what gets you hired. Bikes are easy to learn.Cat 6 isnt a real division of racing, its just a joke to describe the commuters who feel like they have to be the fastest every morning on the ride to work.

[Related article.](http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com.au/2011/05/probing-for-answers-cat-6-racing-boom.html)Ok sir. You ride like that. Check out the AirZound. Refillable and it mounts on the barsYeah exactly. Don't actually engage the brakes until you see danger, but have your fingers resting on the levers so you're ready. Sorry I should have made that clear.Oh, over here we use it to ruin our roads and make the country miserable.Even sim city 4 had that issue :/Thank you dude! I swapped the forks for a set of 24" from an old road bike. I run track brakes on it.

[Here's](http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r82/ThiBitterPill/TwentyFour_zpseae9f884.jpg) how it turned out. Y'all motherfuckas are gonna look like the default Samsung Galaxy wallpaper in this.Sick! Reminds a bit of Rabobanks jerseys. Definetly getting one this year.I need this in my life and I need it with overnight shippingSoon you'll be able to do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIcrppPDqFIUgh.... if you live out the road in my community you have to go along a 45mph to get into town. It's the only way in, period.

It's no problem.  Wide shoulders &amp; passing zones mean cars can get around bikes easily.  I've never had a problem as a motorist or a rider.

Where I do have problems is in the busy downtown traffic.  And those speed limits vary between 10 and 25mph.I'm on Golden Gate just east of Divis. Dont get the full hill but I do time the lights every morning!Not bad, not bad.Agreed. That's the reason I voted this design over others. Maybe if it was across the pockets out would look better, but it clashes on its own up there and make it look bad.Was going to ask about age too.  My city makes it illegal for anyone over 12 to ride on sidewalks (I think that's the cutoff anyway).  Basically before puberty, you may ride on sidewalks because no one expects you to go very fast.  After you've grown you need to ride on the road.  In reality, they let the middle school kids slide but do enforce the rule for high school students and adults.Will it be available in Europe?

Eh, it was actually a pretty good joke.  I didn't know Germans were allowed to make good jokes.  I'm kidding, of course.

...Sort of.   I studied german for 4 years in college and only ever heard my teachers (who were Austrian and German) make one outright joke.  My german's pretty rusty, but I think it went something like...

&gt;Warum soll Man nicht nach funf im Urwald gehen?

&gt;Weil die Elephanten Fallschirmabsprunguebung haben.  (Or is it "Fallschimabsprung ueben haben"? )
this is the key. keep in the paceline. keep out of the lead. if you're training and hitting a 7 hour century by yourself, know that the same effort is equivalent to a 5 hours century in the paceline in zone 2. it's so much easier. that said, it's easy to get in a pissing match with the one-day riders. let em go and pass em when you get to mid way mark and they peel off to tent-ville. fuck em. you don't need em. second half is when shit gets REALIt signifies cars licensed in The Netherlands. It was an attempt at banter.
I take Turk (Balboa) to Baker to Golden Gate to my office at Gg&amp;Taylor. If you wait at the top of the hill above Divis, the lights are timed all the way to Gough.

You can cruise at like 30mph the whole way down. It's amazing.and practice staying away from rookie folks who don't know how to ride a paceline. keep your chin up and fingers on the brakes. it's risky until renton and then you can relax, a bit. preride from seattle to the hill and back at least a couple of times before the ride. it'll get you used to the first half and you'll get confident.

i hear each year a few riders get ass raped in winlock. watch your back door. So true. I'll take my chances hurling myself toward roots, ruts and rocks. At least as the rider, you have only yourself to blame and you usually have actual control over what you hit or don't hit.You sure it wasn't: accidental hit, attempted but unsuccessful run.Still shouldn't havehey, one day newbie. it's ok. there's lots of time left. just do what the training tips on the cascade site tell you. exactly. do the mileage and you'll be ok. even though there was a shitty 96 degrees f heat warning last year, i pulled through no problem in 11 hours. why"? i drank way too much and ate like a mofo and i did all the training to the letter.

Yeah but Minneapolis has entire bike boulevards to ride recklessly on. And we do!Completely agree with this. The overall look gives a very streamlined and cutting edge look, but the /r/bicycling part stands out too much and affects the flow of the design. Also the lettering is a bit too rounded, but I understand it was done to standardize the font like the front.

Overall, very cool design, and I would definitely pick one upoh, fuck, please don't do this. please keep these sorry fucks away from the goodness that is STP. last year I did it and found the same dickhead ford f.350 driver following someone nearby to make sure their little precious was okay. for fucks sake, if you are going to do this ride, do it like everyone else. pack a shit ton of food in your fucking bag, or bring some fucking cash to buy some shit on the the many, many stores along the way. but, please, don't think you need to have a fucking mini van full or your shitty wife and kids following you all day.please. That's exactly what I'm looking for. I love my krampus, but felt I needed a little more tire for some snow this winter.

I got some gold weinmann wheels coming for it, they're heavy but I hear they're near indestructible too. Going to run a turbine cinch crank in the front with a narrow wide chainring, SLX rear der, SLX or deore brakes (depending on how much cash I have), and a king headset, since I've always wanted one. Thinking blue atlas handlebars, blue chainring, and blue seat to be all matchy matchy. I'm really excited for this build. I'm going to basically build it up one piece at a time as I can afford it this spring so I get my dream fatty. To be fair, I don't think it be much better to ride a bike off a cliff.Haha, thanks for the laugh.A lot of us in /r/mtb are honestly afraid to ride on the road.  Throw myself down a mountain, no problem.  Ride on a street in rush hour, hell no.  You roadies have guts. ISM AdamoThis was my exact thought. Good to see that I'm not the only peloton nerd hereThanks! Looking to those awhile ago. Thinking of getting the microshift but saw a claris around 90$

Do you think this is ok? 3x7 micro shift http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-Microshift-road-bike-shifter-21-speed-mountain-bicycle-shifters-SB-R473-3-7-7/32242694098.htmlI'm curious about this too because it wasn't like that in either version in the original submission thread.Thanks, that makes sense.Those gatorskins definitely look out of place.  Swap 'em for some conti GP-4000's!

Sweet bike!Been trying to use some myself, good luck!!!

I find looking up, like others have said, helps. Also, get your wheels spinning as fast as you comfortably can. I find that helps. Minneapolis rider here.  Winter biking is fun!   The cold is hardly bad at all once you get going and generate your own heat. Wind can suck, i'll give you that, but when spring comes you'll be loving what that wind did for your legs.

This winter has been a piece of cake. I was actually praying for more snow because I have studded tires and am not a fan of rolling them on dry path... also too lazy to change them out until spring.

Just get out and enjoy it.  We are stuck with a long winter, might as well take advantage of it.About to do the same thing myself... /r/bicycling is filled with car apologists, too. Plenty here defend the following of car-centric road laws when the laws are attacked for their absurdity, without taking an equally critical look at the absurdity of such laws.http://i.imgur.com/W1RqoBn.jpgYou know, a lot of reviewers have been saying that the ICT is basically a fat Krampus, which is actually really rad. I haven't ridden one myself but hear nothing but good things about them. What's the rest of your build look like? Hehe, well it just means you are now challenged to get out on yours and take some even more awesome bike/scenery photos!It was almost a tie for me between *Somuch* and the winner. *Somuch* has a cleaner, more refined look, but the colors and pattern really pop with the winner.

What are the chances of you submitting a design next year?His upper body does not move, it does not carry any inertia relative to his hips or shoulders, so there is no mechanical stress besides the weight of his torso vs gravity. Anybody with a strong core who is flexible enough can hold this position on the bike without risk of injury.I don't know about iOS, but on Android I regularly run Endomondo and Strava at the same time with no problems.   No compromise necessary.Thanks again for putting all this work into the whole process! Thanks! I'd be lying if I didn't say the color played a big factor. That along with being symmetrical unlike the pugsley and moonlander. The front thru axle I also liked so I can go to a bluto in the future, and the MDS is awesome. I love how flexible the frame is.

I also really like the the rust resistant coating they paint the frame with. There's a lot to love about the ICT.

I forgot to add, the geometry played a big part too. I have a krampus and really dig how it rides, and the ICT is closest to that out of all the fatties. Finding errands to run or commuting via bike is a good way to get all over the place.  If you can do everything on a bike, then every grocery, library, anything trip becomes time to bike. :DWow this is reaaaaly similar the velocult logoIt was definitely the best design,  I can see how it wouldn't appeal to everyone but it was the best. I also think this subreddit has a lot of serious cyclists, probably just not as fast as you though. Cheers. Thirty years of daily biking &amp; I have no issues. It's like a cat scratching post.Just got on this 2004 Carbon Scott CR1.
I had been in the market for a new racing bike since I joined the cycling team at USF.

Big step up from my 1999 Allez (aluminum).

She has a Mavic Ksyrium wheel set with bladed spokes.

Full Ultergra components. Not going to upgrading this puppy for a LONGGGGG time.... Although I'm thinking a new pair of slicks would do me well.


Edit: actually not positive about the name of this wheel set. yes microshift is pretty good and really cheap. its at least as good as the A073 if not a bit better. Ride your bike there.NICE! What made you go with the ICT over other fatties? I've been eyeing some Salsas pretty intensely over the past few weeks.I have a Garmin 510 and use Live Track
Why were there a ton of people/cops near the end?The contact patch is entirely determined by the pressure. It's literally pounds per square inch. So if your wheel has 100 pounds on it and is pumped to 100 psi, it will have a contact patch of one square inch.

Just because your tires say 95 psi max doesn't mean they will explode if you use 100 psi. That's a minimal difference anyway, so go ahead with 95 if you want and rest assured this will give similar performance as your old setup.+1 for Glympse. I use it twice a day on my commutes as well as long rides. Only drawback is the 4 hour max sharing time but if you can stop during your ride at least once every 4 hours you can reset the expiration timer. &gt;i can't find any brand that support 21 speed/3x7.

Old shimano stuff will do it (but not dura ace). 8 speed microshift will too. Or even more modern claris and sora.

 Should be the same spacing as 8 speed anyway, so any 7 or 8 speed stuff will work just fine.

See the comment above. It will be on reddit marketplace. Stay informed with the google group:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reddit-jersey-announcei can't find any brand that support 21 speed/3x7.I have a pair of sure light slip on shoes that I strap to my belt I put my cell in(it's a running belt because I don't have a kit) if I think I might be riding into sketchy situations. This one I figured would turn to dirt somewhere just not as soon as it did. If I get a flat or break something I can walk out without dying. What exactly irritates you?It's illegal to ride on the sidewalk in most places.That's what I use.

Is there an Android equivalent?Thanks! Bike rides like a champ too!!Is microshift good? I saw it while browsing before.just a heads up:
http://www.snopes.com/quotes/twain.asp

still a cool quote tho, but definitely not true.

(source: born and raised in SF)Why?fuck yeah! I hope that cop actually did something. I had a similar thing happen, but I think the cop must have got a nice bribe or somethingDefinitely agree with this.

It would be perfect and make much more sense from a style point if this were the case. Whoa...your top speed is 23? I live in houston and its bothing but flat...hit 34 on the way home from work...whoa...i'm alot faster than i thought i was...i'm sorry if i'm mean...My topspeed is twice this. :DPurchased because I wanted to upgrade from my '13 Specialized Roubaix SL2 w/ 105 which was slightly too big for me and didn't inspire too much vigor or enthusiasm.

I looked at several bikes: Giant Defy, Cannondale CAAD10, Giant TCR, Cervelo R3, Trek Madone, etc. I was open to any and all possibilities, but as I kept doing my research I saw that Cervelo made my ideal bike, so I started the hunt for an RS. After a few weeks of scouring craigslist, eBay and PinkBike on the daily, I found this one with Zipp 404's and full Ultegra at an amazing price that I couldn't pass up.

I have wrapped the bars in Lizard Skin and added some Speedplay pedals to the bike. I have some new wheels coming (H Plus Son Archetypes w/ Ultegra/DT Swiss hubs) and I intend on selling the Zipp wheelset this month. After that, this bike shouldn't see any changes or modifications for a long time.

I ride anywhere from 20-60mi on weekends, and my round trip to work is 20mi. I don't intend to race it, I ride for fun and to challenge myself. I'm not looking for a hardcore racing bike, but one that allows for a fun, nimble, comfortable ride. Becoming uncomfortable in the middle of a route has the capability of ruining the whole ride.

If I could change anything, I'd keep these amazing Zipp hubs instead of selling them with the wheelset. When my new wheelset comes in, I'll be 100% happy with the bike. I've done this ride before. Find a pace line that's not making you work real hard to keep up and enjoy the draft. Take short turns at the front. With 10k people you should need to be in the front of a pace line for long until after 100 miles or so. I love the colors and patterns, but why is "/r/bicycling" cutting across the lines on the back when "reddit" on the front is fit inside the lines and parallel?Poor little guy. That's probably the reason why you didn't see any, because they are all too scared to go near the roads ! :DHave velosurance and am currently going through a claim, will update you on how it goes &gt;I have a thumb shift on my bike and I'm planning to upgrade

So you have thumb shifters on drop bars? Thats really strange but i guess not unheard of, if its the weird stem/thumb levers. If its not clear, you won't be able to properly use road levers on flat bar. Just making sure you are aware of that.

&gt;STI A073

Just buy some used better shifters. They will be better than those crap ones.

Used tiagra, 105, ultegra, should be able to be purchased for &lt;$100 on ebay and craigslist.

or you could buy new microshift levers, anything is better than that stupid shitty pointy lever on the side.

(Not dissing campagnolo style, they actually have a great thumb lever, i prefer campagnolo)For the love of god don't spend your money on the A073... just go used on CL or ebay for something better or even the Claris which I think is super smooth, you can also give Microshift a try but the non-paddles on the A073 I don't think will give you the full Brifter feel. This happened to me once while going up an overpass,  it's surprising to say the least I live on top of a hill. Going down through the neighbor hood streets I hit around 35 each time. Its really fun until after a long ride, then you get the joy of riding up.It was eerie how little wildlife we saw. This was basically it, and it was dead!It's not comic sans, but the much more appropriate VAG rounded that reddit's logotype is set in. I like this face because it feels much less gendered than 2012's ultra-masculine selection, and because it has a stronger visual connection to the reddit brand than the script face used in 2014. That said, I would have liked to have seen the same weight used for "reddit" across both the jersey and the website.Will do! My second to most recent video I have text on the screen instead of using those lame annotations explaining what is happening in each clip. Glad you enjoy my videos, always love to hear that :)had to look up "brifters" turns out all you meant was integrated brake and shift levers.

it seems people love 'em!Which one did you vote for and why do you see this as unappealing?RIP Mr. Raccoon :(Haha awesome. I like watching your videos. Quite entertaining. A little info on where you are headed or why you showed that clip would make it more entertaining :)where/when can you get this?I don't race or ride long distance. I just use it for commute.Ah, my bad. Looked a lot like comic sans first time I lookedSPACE HORSE!I'm pretty sure that's [VAG Rounded] (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/vag-rounded/) - the same font used in Reddit's logo. oh... well you're welcome lol.

But yeah. Triple cranks suck. They're more work to clean, more work to shift, theyre just a waste of metal. Look for bikes that have a wide-range cassette (like 11-28 or 11-32 cassette) which will give you the same super wide gear range as a triple crank does. Guys, can anybody explain to me why Wiggins's lower back posture on that picture isn't super unhealthy?  I'm fairly new to cycling and not too knowledgeable about technique yet, but from my background in other sports this feels like a great way to get injured.I was very close to getting that exact kind of bike after commuting via MTB for many years as well. I ended up going with just a crossrip instead. (Which I know is not a road bike of course, but not super different especially compared to a mountain bike).

I really love the difference after so long on a mountain bike. So much nicer! The thing that really took some getting used to was the difference in gear ratios. My legs were pretty used to the good pickup of the lower ratio of the MTB, and then to suddenly go to the much higher ratio of the cyclocross bike really left me sore for a few days.

You're going to love it though. Much more spritely.Reminds me vaguely of the old Rabobank kits. Not in a bad way. I got it at a local shop so I'll probably go back and see what they have. I'll definitely look into the fitness hybrids as they're right in my budget.

Thanks for the tips!Generally, when there are no reasonable alternatives, bikes are allowed on interstates.   I know that in California, near Camp Pendleton, sometimes the roads through the Marine base are closed to traffic.   During those times, it's legal to use I-5 as that's the only route through it.I also considered the Straggler but got the space horse.  i got the horse because of aesthetic and more braze-ons.  The Straggler still has a place in my heart though.  I have a 56cm 2010 Tarmac and am 6'1. I wish I had gone for the 58cm and just used a shorter and slammed stem.  58cm would most likely work out for you once to set the correct seat and bar position. I'm either going to work, classes, home, bike session, or going out to eat somewhere. My bike is my only means of transportation, so I use it to go everywhere. Where are you going? As noted above its common for cyclists to use this bridge and it's encouraged for them to do so. What I can't gather us if the guy who got hit is standing up, why isn't he down there beating the fuck out of the person who hit him. Or at least scaring the fuck out if them. When I came super close to getting tboned, I told the chick driving that I was a father and she'd nearly stopped my kids from having one. She was blubbering and shaking so I hope she got the message. No, Your bike is not a bad build, missing holes, or have a tube welded upside down.

The bike in the picture provided from the trek website is a much larger size than yours. It has a longer seat tube that can accommodate water bottle cage bosses without them interfering with the mounting of the seat post. As you may have also seen, the bosses on the bottom side of your downtube are indeed supposed to be there as location for an additional bottle cage or other accessory.Comical, let's agree to disagree. That happened to one of us on a bike tour. Not fun to be in rural northern Minnesota and missing a pedal. We were pretty close to Duluth so we just had to have him wait while we sent someone into town for a new one.Brifters are awesome.  They make it convenient to shift.  A073 for $100 though?  Ehh.  I'm not sure that's worth it.

I would look at getting a road bike with brifters as your next bike.that's not comic sansoh god. guess im not buying onemaybe a dude with rubbing brakes or something
Why is the writing on the back in comic sans D:On the streets of San Jose, California. In some of the rougher neighborhoods there's lots of glass on the streets (I believe it must be from breaking into cars?). Though I also have had multiple flats from just plain thorns.  It could be that it was something of the past (around 2000 - 2005) and bicycle tires are much better now. I have about 800 miles on my current tires and have not flatted yet. EDIT: And I ride in much better neighborhoods now :-).Any anyways, I just double checked my calculations in Google Sketchup. I created a pair of wheels with a wheelbase of 110cm, each wheel had a diameter of 740mm which corresponds to a 700c rim wearing a 42mm tire, aka. a 29er.

I then deleted the rear (depending on your perspective) wheel and replaced it with a 700mm tire, which corresponds to a 700c rim wearing a 22mm tire.

This is the largest possible difference a typical consumer can reasonably hope to expect or tolerate.

The result? An offset of 1.2 degrees, pretty close to my original rough calculations especially considering I didn't bother to google the exact tire measurements that time.

So that means you could have normal tires (offset 0d), small front (-1.2d), or small rear (+1.2d), which happens to be three possible alternate head tube angles a person can choose from, should that be their main desire, with a total range of 2.4 degrees. So I assume that if a person had an extreme head tube angle to begin with, they could change a tire to help negate it, or end up with an uncommon headtube angle.

Oh, [pics so you all know it happened](http://imgur.com/yuRS4LM). I'll gladly upload the file to anyone who wants to measure for themselves. Pedestrian lane.  Biker was in the bike share lane.I just started cycling for fitness. My next bike will be a road bike and I'm already making a list of things I want. Up until a few minutes ago I had no idea what a triple crank set was. Thanks for the input.I wish these incidents were relabelled as attempted murder.
Because that is exactly what it is.
We need to stop pussyfooting around with road rage, people die on the road.
This was not an accident, it was a clear road, the car was not involved in a collision with another vehicle which resulted in a secondary collision with the cyclist.

The fact the cyclist did not receive substantial injuries is irrelevent.

Only when the legal system is able to take road rage drivers and those who drive with gross negligence off the street can we expect to see cycling on public roads become safe.I don't think millions of people around the world would be using them every year if they *weren't* worth it...

That being said, I bet you could find a used pair of Shimano Tiagra shifters on eBay or something for that much money (make sure you specify 'shifters' because they make reels of the same name).Three or more flats on a bad day.... I hope I never have a bad day. I guess it depends on what kind of surface you are riding on but on the streets I have a flat maybe once every 4000miles.I moved to SF from Portland. I only lived in SF about 6 months, and this was more than 10 years ago, but SF's weird is not the same as Portland's, like they don't mix. Portland used to be edgier - more libertarian than the hippies of California. I always felt like SF likes their version of weird to be more mainstream or clich. And people were not nearly so friendly.  Like they could tell I didn't belong. Im super excited for the Cap especially, I really hope it looks as nice as the rest of the kit.
Your wheels weren't spinning fast enough.My only experience with that area is from touring down the west coast on the 101, and the section just south of Crescent City was probably the most difficult, confusing, and awesome part of it. miles and miles of climbing, drastic temperature changes as you get higher up, and (the morning i rode it anyway) the fog up in the forest drenches you. however, you're riding  through the redwoods and it's beautiful and amazing and i would absolutely recommend doing it.The only thing that's wrong with your bike is that triple crank *slaps knee*Still no. I did the drawing. The difference with a 42c front and 25c rear and a 1000mm wheelbase (More extreme than your setup) is less than 1. It's all in your head.True. Last weekend it was mid 60s.

This weekend, 20's and snow. Ahh! Good for you.Thank you for your advice. I have taken a more defensive attitude towards school zones and bike lanes in general since this incident.

The video does not show it, but there is quite a sharp negative incline to the road and so coasting does pick the speed up fairly quickly. I'm being extra cautious now. This is heavy-trafficked, 3-lane one-way road in the middle of town, that is heavy congested already. The only way they could add a bike lane would be to remove a regular lane. That's not logistically or economically reasonable, not when there's a bike lane literally one fucking block away.

Like I said, if you ride fast, ride the road. But if you're going 10mph, what the hell do you care about going a block out of your way?

American metropolitan architectural layouts and city planning is very different than in Europe. This is in a very dense part of the city. You can't just add a bike lane without fucking a lot of other shit up.yeah, awhile ago. you obviously weren't missing itAnd trolls. A lot of people get a big kick out of trolling that particular set of mouth-breathers.It was on a flat.I know they make cleat covers, but I would like to see whole shoe covers. Preferably clown-shoe-sized.You should be keeping your weight and grip on the hands pressing against the bars, and not the other side where your fingers touch the brakes. And if you're on a MTB, then you should only be using your pointer fingers to engage the brakes, gripping with your other four fingers on the bars... Should have no reflex pulling if holding your bike right.&gt; a full bike wash and a full degrease/clean/lube of the drivetrain

I know it can be done, and that people do it (as you illustrate), but the fact of the matter is that your drivetrain is still getting eaten up much faster than normal, even if you're cleaning weekly (especially with the slop we've had this year).

I know, relatively speaking, that it's peanuts compared to car maintenance and yadda yadda yadda. I guess that's what separates the die hards (you) from the [mostly] fair-weather riders (me). I've no issue with bicyclists using the road, I bicycle many times myself, but if bicyclists cross that bridge so much, why haven't they created a designated path for them yet? I see the walking path, why not a bicycle path?!

And since this is /r/bicycling, I don't think it's necessary to say that in a lot of places riding a bike on a walking path can get you a ticket. Love the color scheme! The Bike looks fun as well! Trek makes some great bikes.Oops, incorrect unitI think your color choices here look fantastic. Ride on, man.110mm wheelbase? 3? No way, not even close, to both.I knew it would be this one. It's a really cool design. Can't wait to buy one.never mind than lolI used to skate board it frequently too, It's a breeze on a bike. You can easily keep up with traffic so just keep your head on the swivel, and be safe. It's a fun ride, enjoy!If you're riding similar routes frequently you should be able to cancel out some of the noise.  Yeah lots of things are always different on rides but if your last 10 rides were on average faster than your last 100 that's a good indicator.  Especially if your app allows you to group and compare similar routes.  I'm not sure if Strava does that.While the drive was wrong, why was this dumb ass on the biking not riding on the sidewalk??
Why the fuck would you attempt to ride slower than traffic on a busy high speed limiit road??? The driver and bike rider were both stupid.  Folsom bike lane blues? I love to hate it and hate that I love it.Something something dust caps...he was riding in the middle of the fucking road....http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vjmru/attempted_hit_and_run_on_a_biker_stopped_by_bus/coik7z5Have a support vehicle person/crew meet you at any stops you take. Ask them to bring your favorite goodies and their motivational speeches. Even though food is provided at stops, nothing beats your favorite food and friends and family to join in.

Coming from a racing and touring background, to prepare for a long ride, I will normally stagger my rides over a week or two (maybe three or four if you aren't as experienced). For example, the first week, I will ride six days out of the week, doing 15-30-45-60-30-15-rest. The following week will be 25-45-60-80-50-30-rest. I don't have any sports science to support this, but I find this a better method than cranking out two 100 mile rides and then being too fatigued for the rest of the week. Before last year's STP, I only did an extremely easy 10 mile ride after a rest day.When it starts fraying and shifting feels like crap, presumably OP will.On a serious note, I legitimately felt bad for him. It just seemed like he was really desperate for some form of communication from another human being.for science!!That's not so bad.

The other source of chaos is somewhat visible from the picture. There's a bus/streetcar island in the middle of the street, and all of the bicycles have to go straight from the right lane, which is shared by cars using it as a right turn only lane. Only taxis, buses, streetcars, and idiots can use the left lane. The right lane is also frequently very narrow to the point where filtering takes some serious effort. I've found it's easier to just hang behind other cars, but many other cyclists will insist on squeezing by to the front, using any means available: the bus lane, part of the island, the sidewalk...

SF has made steps towards reducing the amount of non-commercial auto traffic on this road; it would almost make sense to eliminate it entirely as it's a very bad car route, but that can't be done quite yet. Improving traffic crossing the street, since it's so centrally located, is almost more critical to improving this road than to making more changes to the road itself.2019, in Ann Arbor. :(If you aren't buying clip less pedals yet I would just ride with regular athletic shoes on the platform pedals until you are ready to get clip less pedals and shoes. As for good brands? I have no idea. I would just go to your local bike store and try a lot on to see how they feel. I have some pretty simple bontrager shoes because my local bike store was a trek dealer when I bought my bike. My new store is a giant dealer and sells a lot of shimano stuff. I am sure you can't really go wrong with either of those brands. Just make sure you buy a shoe that has the right holes for whichever pedals you want. Some shoes have both kinds of holes, like mine, others will only have the three holes for SPD-SL type cleats, while some will only have the two holes for the mountain bike type cleats. Your best bet is to ride around and get comfortable enough on your bike until you are ready to get clip less pedals then go to your local bike store and ask for help. They'll steer you in the right direction and help you find the best fit for your needs.mounting it on the hood is going to be a real pain.

but 3d printing anything in PLA is probably not going to stand up to abuse, just FYI

Maybe I will try them at 95 tomorrow.  It says 85-95 max though and they are much harder than my old tires and seem to be "rounder" (in the sense that they seem to maybe have a smaller contact patch like when I ride on skinnier tires on summer set up pure road bikes).Many bridges allow cyclists to use the entire right lane due to wide expansion joints, cables, and other tire eating monsters that are on the pedestrian side. I rode across many bridges and through tunnels like that on a cross country tour. Maybe there needs to be some better signage to let motorists know they may come up on a bicycle?I've always wendered about measurements. I sort of figured the measurement was done from the inside radius, then any material (both normal and inverted treads come to mind) would be the few mm wider that everyone sees. Maybe that is the case.  Good thought though I can't seem to find what the Specialized Borough CX, 60TPI ones my bike came with weigh.  My other thought was maybe the contact patch as these ones seem "rounder" if that makes any sense.The laws are sooooo fucking skewed in LA, you'll get one ordinance and a contradicting one in another.  Mine is definitely illegal as it's over 3" but I've considered having the blade shortened down but the gray area is whether a fixed blade can be carried- one says completely no, another says yes if it's sheathed and fully exposed.

However my store sells a lot of shit to cops they say:  as long as it's not "overly" illegal and not used negatively, they're not going to just ticket somebody for it.  No but. That lane wasn't built for two vehicles side by side. You'd change lanes to pass a car, you change lanes to pass a bike. Most people seemed to get the idea.###Official Results:

Before that, I used Life360. It wasn't quite as good because it would only update every 15 minBy my (admittedly rough) calculations, on a bike with 42mm tires and a 110cm wheelbase, replacing either the front or the rear tire with a 25mm tire would produce about a degree and a half of change in head tube angle. That means the widest change in head tube angle possible, from fat front/small rear to small front/fat rear should be about 3 degrees. Seeing as the entire spectrum of head tube angles ranges from about 71 to 74 degrees, I would say that there is a very large effect on head tube angle.

Reproduceable, anecdotal evidence: when i first put a smaller rear tire on (42mm front to 35mm rear) I was amazed at how firmly the front tire held it's direction while speeding. No-hands especially has a difference. Now flip, put the 42 on the rear and the 35 on the front. Suddenly my bike (beefy 29er MTB here!) feels twitchier than my Vilano TT bike. Riding no-hands becomes much more difficult, the slightest lean produces a wide swing of the tire.

Edit: 110cm, not mmI'll ride down O'Farrell tomorrow to see how it is. If you read about someone hit by the 38, you've got that on your conscienceCongrats!Your comment about geometry makes sense. Thanks. I bet there's nothing wrong with the bike. I should have specified that. I meant all the laws in your area (city/county/state) rather than just the state laws.

CA is a pretty interesting example. Open carrying that in L.A. would be completely illegal.Those are some hip bikes.I agree, but that thermometer just makes me want to hibernate...Great bike but they often have rear shifting problems. This is a combination of full run cable housing and a sora level rear derailleur. It works a lot better with a better derailleur, good housing, and a thin shift cable.Im in Milwaukee.  Soooo stir crazy, I'm going nuts.  I have the necessities to ride in winter, and like riding in the snow, but these temps are killing me.  I can't ride when it's below 20 degrees.  It sucks....To be fair, the queuing here is chaotic too. That is, it also makes some sense. Traffic lights are a place where the fast can calmly get past the slow, since the latter queuing on the right while the former push up a bit and generally leave the intersection quicker.

Organized chaos.if they welded the tube backwards, there would be a bottle boss on the rear of that tube, right next to the rear wheel. that would be a serious fuckup and you should return the bike or talk to trek.

if there is none, if i had to bet it has to do with the size of the bike.

your bike is the second to smallest size, and perhaps they deemed a bottle cage to be too unwieldy/uncomfortable to put there given the frame geometry. and looking at your bike, i'd agree. putting a bottle there would be a pain to get in and out, and might interfere with your legs.

if you really want to know, ask trek, or ask the shop if the other size 17.5 trek 8.6 ds's have seat tube bottle bosses.

a lot of the other pictures i'm seeing of other 8.6 ds in small sizes seem to agree with this hypothesis:

http://www.evolution-bikes.co.uk/bikes/hybrid/mens/trek-86-ds-starry-night-blacktrek-charcoaltrue-blue-155/Yep... but more importantly is actually the county laws, not state laws.  "Most" states are actually pretty relax, however it differs county to county and that's where people usually get fucked. Thanks for the reply. I'd never seen bottles there that's why I thought they welded my shit backwards hahahah. I guess you learn something new eery day. I assume fenders are somewhat mandatory if using a bottle down there.Start out very casually, and give yourselves 20 min (time it) to find what pace you think you can maintain...then back off 2 gears from that pace, and stay there for the next couple hrs.Yes it did but a $1000 bike and a $1000 deductible renters insurance isn't much good. Plus they don't cover the bbike away from home, only in the apt. Velosurance has a $100 deductible and they cover the bike for theft and accidentsNot bad points but I'm usually on country roads that aren't very busy hence why there are zero bike lanes. I generally just get over if i ear cars coming but it definitely makes sense to stay further away from the side. Mostly I just ride around the roads off of the blue ridge parkway because they're just as nice and not as busy.Agreed, that is why I was wondering if anyone had some experience with a similar replacement set of tires, or just general knowledge that could back up or disprove what I felt.  Since I have traffic and weather (and just basic difference of how I feel at different times/day to day) I do not have a precise enough group of measurements to show causation in times I feel fast but Strava says are slightly slower.Congrats, just wait and you'll start beating that on flats.

I used to do 40mph/60kph down a giant hill onto a bridge every day. Best part of my commute. However drivers were VERY unforgiving and would often do shit like buzz me (despite the fact that I was riding at the speed limit).

Can't believe people...Your English teacher's head just popped.Gimme gimme gimme [Water bottle bosses.](http://www.tamiasoutside.com/wp-content/themes/paalam/img/wbcage4.jpg)You should really re-think how you ride, the way you are doing it is putting you in danger.  You have had so many close calls with cars pulling out in front of you because cars look towards the middle of the road for oncoming traffic not all the way to the right where you are riding, ride further from the edge of the road and you will have fewer cars pulling out in front of you.  Also cars coming from behind will pass closer and faster to you if you are close to the edge of the road.  If you ride just far enough away from the curb so the overtaking car must cross the center line to pass you then they will slow down and since they are already over the center line they will give you more room than if they think they can squeeze by you without crossing the center line.  The final reason to get away from the curb is in case you have to dodge something in the street, if you are as close to the curb as you can be you can only swerve out into traffic. That's always the problem for small riders. You get to pick;

Smaller wheels (nothing wrong with that) And or ....

Sloping top tube (nothing wrong with that either) and or .....

Toe overlap.

Four of my bikes have sloping top tubes and I have a custom road bike that has classic diamond frame, full sized wheels and NO toe overlap. It's an engineering miracle and a work of art. But anything that fits and works if you're short.I'm going to be honest, I only run red lights when I see no cars coming and it's been red for awhile. But, I don't fly through red lights going 20mph without looking. Fuck that! LolYes when I say times I mean on Strava.  Problem is on a day like today there is 17 MPH wind in my face on the way home.  Many factors change that.  Never really thought about sensors, good point about that.Here's another huge picture, sorry about that. Its missing the cage holes on the tube with the seat post. I thought maybe the welded the tube backwards.

I absolutely love my GoPro Citrus. but what if you hit a bump and reflex pullWell, if you break a spoke you could tweak the others to make the wheel usable. But it's not critical, same with the chain tool, just nice to have to be self-sufficient.I commute all winter in Minnesota, maybe 2/3 of the winter I have to wade through this salt crap. Then every Sunday afternoon I'll do a full bike wash and a full degrease/clean/lube of the drivetrain. Pretty relaxing and meditative if you make it a habit. The [Park Tool chain scrubber](http://www.parktool.com/product/cyclone-chain-scrubber-CM-5-2) is a must-have in these conditions.  Remember that if you keep a healthy chain, the rest of your drivetrain will stay happy for a long time.

Then for the other 1/3 of the winter the roads will be bare and dry so it's just like riding the rest of the year! Except for the loud buzzing of my studded tires...Awesome.  thanks--that was driving me insane all day.post a picture of where the holes are supposed to be, your current picture only shows the lower set.... not sure why you would post a picture of the lower holes when you are concerned about not having the other ones...

are you saying there are literally no holes in the frame for the bottle cage?

or are there simply no bolts in them?Source: http://www.twinsix.com/gear/mens-techok hit and runs are bad.  let me get that out of the way.

but this fuckin roadie was out in the middle of the lane... i'm not saying he deserved it AT ALL, but fuck me man, get the fuck out of the middle of the lane.  have some gd courtesy. How much does your head tube angle change between a 25c and 42c tire?  I haven't done the math but I'm guessing it's negligible and not noticeable but mere humans. And rotational weight doesn't only affect the drive wheel. You have to accelerate both wheels, so no difference in acceleration, weight, or climbing.Here's the Salsa;

I think Garmin has Live Tracking.Yes, it is "ciudad de mexico". We usually don't call it that way. Since it is also called federal district or distrito federal we shorten it df. But your translation is correct. :)I only have one set of holes for the bottle cage, not two like the website shows. It makes me sad to acknowledge that this is true in Toronto. /sigh
So you're saying you don't have holes to mount a bottle cage?

what do you mean by both are "inside the triangle"?

don't know what you mean by bad build.

edit: after doing more research it seems like those holes are for another bottle cage.

still not sure what you think the problem is, your picture only shows those holes.

i highly doubt trek could fuck this upIf you're going really remote then a SPOT might be a good idea.  You can send several pre-programmed messages (OK, please call, non-emergency help, etc.) as well as a SOS beacon for serious shit.

saddle and bars seem too highNaw, they don't fight for a spot. They seem to refuse to queue in any sensible manner, though. There's also a decent amount of car traffic mixed in, but some blocks have a decent amount of room isolating bike traffic into its own narrow-ish lanes.You should know about http://www.geartrade.comGood idea, I'll bring a patch kit too.

I just plan to wear my bike shorts and jersey and maybe a base layer depending on the weather.Man, you're missing out. Flying down o'farrell is a great ride. I love riding down from Larkin to union.

Should I?A might fine [opinion](http://img.pandawhale.com/102690-tipping-intensifies-gif-neckbe-HLOi.gif) you have there!I just realized that the website shows the set of holes under the frame. Im still missing a set inside the triangle.  The first time I rode clipped in it felt like I had 4 legs. That's gotta count for something!Whats up guys, i just discovered these 1/4-20 threaded holes under my bike. I wonder if this is a bad build. The bike webside shows two set of holes on the bike and they're both, "inside the triangle"

use your elbows and shoulders instead of your hands to steady yourself inside the door frame ....in a post-apocalyptic world.Doesn't need to be posted at least not in my state.  That is one reason I hate those signs, I may always use full lane.It's true. There's probably almost no one in the world who's top speed of all time is lower than that.I also have a 64cm bike that I'm happy on. Cool.

Random question I was thinking about earlier today: "Mexico city" in spanish is..."Ciudad de Mexico?"  Do people normally call it that or do they shorten it in some way?

Like I said, I had this question flit through my brain earlier today, and I can't pass up the opportunity to ask when I just happen to cross keyboards with somebody who seems to live there. :)

Also I apologize for my high-school level spanish being completely terrible. more *is* teenage males.Out of curiosity, why? Cyclist mentality?

(just curious)too much text, I assume it said something offensive, so screw youUnless they're treating it as a speed contest, if anyone rides about the same pace it's delightful to cycle in. Note that this spreads out rather significantly when the light turns green. It's just that at stops it all squeezes into one tight mass.&gt; commute race

Race? Are most of these trying to ride as quick as possible? I can imagine that being annoying.

If so, imagine a future where everyone just wants to get where he needs to be, but not at sweaty-high-speed. Just waits for their turn, all ride in a line. That'll come, just give it time.One minute response time by the police...not bad. Would have been 6 o'clock by the time they arrived in my town.It is hard to see, but (I'm speculating) it looks like the car was tailing the bus really close + picking up speed, but as the bus started to turn left because of the cyclist, the driver of the car probably didn't see him until too late crashing into him...really reckless and then trying to flee. The bus driver did the right thing.   that's how you do it, in the doorway.  keep your head up as already suggested. just don't get drunk and think "now would be a great time to ride rollers."  it's not, trust me. Bar end streamers?Coulda shoulda woulda. Safety first. And this is America, that's 35mph, which is travelled at 40-45mph usually. Well, how to avoid traffic when I bike to work during the summer?@.@Agreed. I would take the sidewalk.In all fairness, they threw the book compared to most prosecutions.Sorry, no pictures yet.  I'll try to get a few tomorrow.  I'm really just looking for any info on the bicycle that I can find.

Doesn't matter if your shop doesn't sell them, nor if your customer doesn't want that.

&gt;2. most cutting edge innovations in the technology in the last few years..

Doesn't matter if your customer isn't looking to spend $2000-3000 for a bike.

&gt;3. valuable trending sound bites/topics

Don't try to be that person who knows the buzzwords but doesn't know what they mean.

Learn about what you're selling. Know it inside and out, from the bottom of the range all the way to the top. Know the differences between Steel, Carbon, and Aluminum.

Know the difference between gear ratios and how/when they are used.

Know the Shimano/Sram/Campagnolo component hierarchy.

And know the names of all the parts. (Rear derailleur, front derailleur, crankset, brakes, cables, housing, pedals, cassette, headset, seatpost, saddle, handlebars, stem, wheels, hubs, spokes, rims, tires, tubes, tape)

Know the brands your shop sells.

eventually learn how to recommend different frame sizes.

All of that knowledge about bikes will help you sell them most effectively.

Its also important to understand what kind of shop it is. Is it a super high end shop that caters largely to wealthy people? Is it a place in the city that is focused on fixies/track/singlespeed? What kind of bikes do they stock? Tri/TT bikes? Is it more of a Mountain bike place?

Make sure you know what accessories go with what, and how they are used, and suggest people buy that stuff from your shop.

edit: also know and understand all the wheel sizes
To all of the folks who are doing a one-day this year (and especially are newbies...), my buddy who started this thread and I are doing the one-day ride. We're both virgins. We're both crazy.

I *think* the goal is to average 14-15mph on-road so that our four stops don't keep us from getting into Portland in time.

Anyone want to join us?!Like when you're at the beach and you get too close to the surf.  It's like taking a bath bro.Can confirm: am bike.For recreation, there are some really nice trails. Unless by complete chance they don't take a direct path anywhere, but there are definitely plenty of trails in Omaha.

I like to go places, so for me it isn't great, East-West is the primary direction through the city and the trails mostly go North-South.

I live in Lincoln, and have only ridden some of the trails in Omaha. Someone else in Omaha may be of more help.&gt; We have a damn video and people are still saying people should ride like this.

A single data point doesn't mean it's a bad idea.I hope no stupid people injure themselves and sue the owners.That is definately something for a mountain bike. The fastest I've gone is 83km/h I live in a hilly area out in the country and we have a mile long 16% grade strait. It goes by so quickWhat? No pictures?I wear a helmet on mine! Your rental insurance can be updated to include a high valued bike. Talk to your broker about adding a named peril to the policy. Essentially you add your bike specifically to the policy which will increase the premium a bit. You usually can decide in the deductible on it as well. Typically a much cheaper option than a bike only policy.Great read.
I think social evolution "isn't there yet". We've come a long way from black slaves not being considered as people to where we are now. Today if you're openly racist, sexist or homophobic you get fired. I hope the next thing modern civilizations throw to the curb is toxic behaviors and overall being an asshole to anyone for any reason. Patience though, it might not be in our time, but let's work toward it. You don't want to be on the wrong side of the debate in history books.Hey how's the biking in Omaha? I might get orders there.

There's no duty for cyclists to not "impede traffic" and it's clear that traffic was flowing fine in the video so that wasn't the problem.

And he was working with traffic. He was riding lawfully and predictably.

The only person who did anything bad was the driver who apparently didn't have the patience to make sure the lane was clear.

The cyclist did nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing. Just because you wouldn't want to do it doesn't make it a bad idea.I'm an avid bicyclist, and I do feel for the guy...and the driver was wrong -

Used to be a god damn war zone, and I rode on Mission since it was way more predictable.I live in SF. I avoid Market St. If you're a more confident cyclist, there are lots of other roads to take where I can keep up with if not go faster than traffic, and let me avoid routes that are cycle traffic heavy like Market.There are a lot of great stops set up for socializing and eating (especially the REI in Kent). Don't stay at any one too long as the longer your wait, the less happy you'll be when you get back on the bike.  Also, stretch whenever you're off the bike.  Also, practice riding in a [paceline](http://www.bicycling.com/training-nutrition/training-fitness/9-paceline-rules)./r/theydidthemath Working on market means riding on market. Most direct route from my apartment would be Geary and there's no way I'm riding Geary. It's in compression if the front wheel is braking and it normally takes torsion too.This is some arrogant BS, and exactly the type of thing that gives cyclists a bad name in the first place.  Don't be stupid just to be right.  This guy is clearly not using sound judgement and riding in a way that impedes the flow of traffic.  A smart cyclist works with traffic, not against them.

You have shown us nothing here but the A B C's of your arrogance and stupidity.

Awesome! I just got a 2011 Synapse and I'm waiting for the first ride just like you. :PJust got a Fly6 v2 and am using that.  No video posted online to share, but my experience so far has been good.  This is South Bethlehem right next to Lehigh University. It's crawling with cops. Watch for cracks, check after every ride. As long as it isn't near any welds it's alright. Closer to the middle of the tube the better. I've been riding a CX bike with a dent half the size about 2 inches away from the toptube/seatube weld and I haven't seen any cracks yet. If you are ever unsure ask your LBS.I've got a couple of similar pictures
Then I got cocky and got stuck in the middle of a field of clay mud. Wheels literally jammed in place and couldn't free them up for more than a few feet.

Had to carry the bike 4 miles, in mud, on road cleats, till I found a road and a stick to clear it out.

There's now a metal tyre lever in my kit for just that purpose (I'm always ready to fix the LAST problem, the next I'm sure will be something new....)Ah yes, the cat 6 commute race. As much as Folsom sucks to ride on, it's a little nicer than Market due to relative lack of congestion.Congrats ;-)
A pb is a pb and worth celebrating.

There are people faster than me and slower than me, that doesn't devalue any of my achievements and neither should it yours.

Well done - time to start aiming for 30. Doable on a flat sprint on an allez, easierdownhill of course (tailwinds are always useful too)6 inches? Tell me more about these fantastic drivers that leave so much room. Around here I'm brushed by side mirrors if I don't take the lane.If you want to objectively measure faster/slower, get a computer or run an app (Strava, Cyclemeter, RidewithGPS, etc).  Then you'll know.

GPS isn't accurate enough for acceleration though.  If that's of interest you need sensors (either standard with the computer or bluetooth/ant with the phone).How so? He was riding safely and legally.She needs Dura-Ace pedals, too much power output for anything cheaper. ;)Psst

/r/fatbikeI don't know man, staying away from short girls is kind of a tall order (   )Is that a Short Haul Trucker?Mine's actually 210! But it also has external headset cups which "add" 10mm each end (sort of not really).Alrighty, for 90% of the year fixed gear bikes get a lot of hate in this sub (sometimes deservedly so), but imma grab a soap box real quick and say that this is the weather fixed gear was born to do.

Cheap parts, strong parts, simple parts, less parts, and really really nice control over your rear wheel. I love a good gear change, but in the winter it's all about about fixed gear with SPDs.

Just make sure you stretch your quads/knees right after your commute!I hit 29.4 last weekend! 30 should feel great! Let's do it! Howwwww?? My top speed ever 70km/h and this was going down hill drafting a truck. his looks bigger. 200-210mm
yours looks about 180-190.

When they go down a hill from motorcycle view you will turn with them and fall.Just don't ride your $100/ea sweet summer skinnies and you'll be happy as a clam on rollers. they have less damage to tires than road but since they are completely smooth why bother with high tpi babies?I peaked at 60kph.  It was a great feeling after a 45minute climb at about 15kph.You went from a wire bead tire with unpublished weight to kevlar bread tire with published weight of 430g. You likely dropped a bunch of weight thereby reducing rotational inertia. this means your wheel will accelerate a bit faster so it may feel a bit faster of the line.  Your top speed will be minimally affected if at all.This is an x-post from JusticePorn.  I posted it earlier giving credit to OP and was downvoted: http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vinuu/bus_stops_motorist_after_bicycle_hit_and_run/i thought that was 4chan?

trolling has gone meta.Yea exactly.  Problem is since I ride in a city i'm rarely at the same cadence for any extended period of time, and in the winter the wind around here (Chicago) gets pretty serious.

I guess what I feel is that in the same gear I spin up faster and easier, but for some reason my times are slower.  Wasn't sure if someone had experience with these tires or similar ones and could speak to which one "should" be faster.need to figure out how to do 3 pedals at the same damn time. make a lot of money with that ideaSorry link added. Bus Driver Uppercut!I say we have a collection and buy this guy a bike. That's a negative on all 3.

It'll help you make the case that you're less safe on the sidewalk than the road as well as show her that you're aware of the most common types of collision and how to anticipate/avoid them.

Also, you can find some stats that show you're more likely to be hurt or killed in a car vs on a bike, so as long as she's statistically cool with you riding in cars on the street, she should be cool with you riding your bike there too.Whoa, I finally "wrong threaded"!  My bad.I personally just let it melt off, dust off what I can, occasionally clean the chain and lube it up.
I usually get a year out of front gears and cassette, chains every 6 months or so, and brake pads every few months. With Marathon tires my tubes never puncture and the tires last forever. So relatively speaking it's almost no cost.

If you're smart the bike won't be some 10k carbon wonder bike so you can just treat it like a car. Regular maintenance and replace stuff as it wears out. Triathlete?  Definitely spend the money on the helmet.  If I've learned anything from tri-highlights it's that you'll spend way more time falling off your bike than riding it :P.&gt; The difference between a bike and a segway in the case of an impending accident? You can jump off a segway; whereas it is almost impossible to quickly get over the center rail on a bike to get off in an emergency.

Apparently this person thinks it's normal to just jump off a moving vehicle whenever there's an emergency. Yep, see my other replies.These are data, not stories or accounts; different studies yielding slightly different results does not make them anecdotal evidence. My friend telling me a story about how fat people are in Mexico would be an anecdote, a UN FAO report listing measured obesity rates by country is not.Shimano's camera is really thin and sits really nicely under a saddle but for consistently good video go for a go pro cause you can use the app to get the right angles wireless
Came here to say FrameSaver doesn't work well on thieves, and they're the harshest element an "outside" bike will have to deal with.  Especially in /r/floridaman.&gt;Instant Karma's gonna get you

&gt;Gonna knock you right on the head

&gt;You better get yourself together

&gt;Pretty soon you're gonna be dead
Buddy, you can start riding again right now! (Ok maybe skip tomorrow since it'll be below zero).

Coincidentally, Friday is [Winter Bike to Work Day](http://winterbiketoworkday.org/) and MSP is at the top of the leaderboards in the US. If you live in Minneapolis, the MPLS Bike Coalition is doing [a big group ride](https://www.facebook.com/events/782736445134095/) from city hall to Midtown on Friday.

That said, I know how you feel, it's been too long since I've been out on the nice road bike.I don't know. That sub has a pretty even split of misogynists, latent homosexuals, and guys just wanting to up their game.&gt; I feel like these new tires roll better and seem slightly faster (might just be in my head), but my times on some of my normal rides are up.

The sensation of speed is tricky. You'd have to base it on cadence while in some known gear or the sound of the air past your ears with no wind.

What you might be experiencing is a different vibration from the tire tread.So this new info just makes that driver an even worse person

Hit a bike in a bike heavy location, and tried to run away in front of a police station.  Darwin award nomination, anyone?I hit 40mph on my roadie going down a nice little hill. Pedaling of course We also have water to drink and farm with ;pIf you want a starting point, check out a Trek Domane 2.3 or if you are a woman, the similar Lexa SLX. These are endurance road bikes aimed at people like you, and within your budget more or less (there are cheaper versions of each, too).At first I thought "well he is out in the middle of the lane". But if its posted "May Use Full Lane" then it is what it is.
I don't leave that bike locked up in public.. I have a $10 bike with a mix of parts that I ride to the pubThanks for the response. I've been fitted before, but still experience some numbness when riding on a Fizik saddle, kinda been wondering if the ISM saddles are worth looking into.You can ride the first 100 miles easy with very little training!  Try doing the whole thing in a day in that condition and you might have a bad time.

source: me last yearYou're getting a lot of hate for some reason, but I appreciate seeing what a potential dooring looks like from the cockpit, thanks for posting!

I suspect some people on here may like to victim blame because it helps them feel like they're less likely to get hurt because they follow all the "obvious rules that will keep them alive" when in reality you can do everything right and still get killed by a rando.  I think that's a scary thought for a lot of folks.Sounds like you've pretty much got it sorted. Ensure you have multiple CO2 canisters, or a pump as mentioned by the other posters, and get out there and enjoy!Can confirm that this a an accurate and very reasonable list. In particular, note the recommendations for breaking the laws well - that's a very Dutch attitude, but one that works.I thought was OP was overly polite letting all the cars through the pinch-point first with nobody letting him in.  If that's me, as I approach the construction, I'm taking the lane so I don't get squeezed out like that and then, no need to shoal, as he would've been through the intersection before all that truck nonsense.

Nothing wrong with shoaling through traffic at a stop though, it lets you get started ahead of the cars (and so more safely) and it's also eases up the congestion as you can get through and let cars fill in all the "waiting in line" spots.This is [Mxico City](https://www.google.com.mx/maps/@19.410596,-99.172602,3a,75y,15.28h,54.73t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1symvKZ3P8M7rVHpNBdkhmeA!2e0?hl=en).

Nearly shit my bibIf your going to make such a ludicrous argument at least back it up with some good examples.  share the road and thank the cyclists trying to think of your children's future. Is it easy to make a loop in google maps? I feel like I'd have to enter point A to point B, then B-C, then C-D, then D-A, stopping at each point to pull out my phone.

I found http://bikeroutetoaster.com/ to be even better than MapMyRide. I then export the TCX file and import it in to RideWithGPS. Hahaha my thoughts exactly.My comment was more about the visual design.

I also do wish for laces, as the velcro is wearing out and isn't as easily replaceable as laces.  Of course, laces bring their own issuesfor sure.

You're a pro now.I find it's split 50/50 in /r/winnipeg , not hit and runs, don't know anyone who would advocate that there, but 50/50 int he sense that 50 % of people find them annoying and wish they would only use sidewalks

However the me and at least one other mod are big into cycling and we make that the conversations don't get out of hand, and we promote cycling activities if and when they arise to help raise awarenessIn which parallel universe is this??Ok then...Go biking bro! Don't let the winter keep you in from biking. It's been in the single digits here a few times in Chicago and I still went out biking, with plenty of others too. Just wear a lot of layers and you'll be good That's why single speed road is inferior except for commuting hahaThank you so much! \o/I've never thought my Sidi Genius 5s were uncomfortable to walk in.  Awkward yes.  Thank you SPD-SL.  But my feet don't hurt. There are some valid reasons to use higher speed streets though.  For example I recently figured out I could cut my time on a 600ft/180m section of my ride home at night from 5 minutes to 40 seconds using 35MPH streets rather than sticking to 25MPH streets.
You can put Wisconsin on that list! Madison is a bikers paradise in a lot of cases. Many small towns I've been to have bike lanes as well!Strange. Tried to link to this comment from this thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vjmru/attempted_hit_and_run_on_a_biker_stopped_by_bus/coik7z5

Apparently I can't reddit.

Edit: Don't mix the link with your punctuation. No fucking way! I bike this bridge often!Yeah but why don't the kids confronting the drivers just keep putting up make shift barriers? Seems like they would stop more drivers that way. The whole thing see,s more like people that want confrontation, rather than actual change. I'm 6'6 and comfortably ride a 61cm....Honestly, I'd almost be happy to be charged with "cycling furiously" for breaking the speed limit on my bike. It would be like a medal.Well, my comment was mostly a dig at just how ugly that e-bike is. Keeping in mind that it's an e-bike that was most likely designed to be eye-catching rather than being a real bike I would imagine it wasn't exactly designed for churning out the watts, and that most of the force would be generated by that big ass motor, which looks pretty sturdy.  It should be noted that I'm no frame design expert and I'm just speculating/talking out of my ass. Your comment links to this post
What were you trying to link?Google Maps for routing directions, Strava for recording? I pretty much just remember the route, and glance at the maps app occasionally when I'm in a new area.The back and forth on who is right or wrong and the cyclist should or shouldn't be there isn't important here.  What is important is that a driver hit someone and then took off.  No matter which side is right or wrong, an accident happened and one of persons involved fled the scene of an accident.Oh thanks :)I have this 1 mile 12% grade that I occasionally ride. After slowly making my way up, it's fun to blast down. I got to 49.5 mph last time without any pedaling. That was exhilarating. I hate to say it, but I hope cycling never gets that popular where I live.  I bike to *avoid* traffic like that.Yeah, but do you have the fat redpill virgin parts nailed down? We're looking for the complete package here!

More BATTLE ROLLERS!
Will do, thanksExactly, but I think that's the point.  Buy whatever bike you want, ride it however you want, and don't judge other folks for doing the same thing.  As long as you're riding, the bike is doing what it's supposed to do.I would never ever in my entire life ride on a road like that, I'd rather walk than put myself in such danger...The dictionary definition of anecdote is "an account regarded as unreliable", so yes, the conflicting sources make a statement of Mexico being higher than the U.S. a dictionary example of anecdote.&gt; What's the significance of yellow in Germany?

In Germany you get a yellow license plate when you fail the driving test three times!

No, honestly, the Dutch have yellow license plates. That was a banter between neighbours. I'm pretty sure that in the Netherlands and Germany such a road would not be free for cyclists. Of course we have bike lanes and alternative routes everywhere. But's the USA when it comes to cyclists: When they have the choice between building actual infrastructure and putting up road signs that pit cyclists with motorists, they will choose road signI commute every day from East Hollywood to Culver City and back.  The infrastructure is terrible and the cars hostile, but at least we have great weather for it year-round.  Because it's not easy here there's also a lot of hella cool people out riding in LA.Just watched better call saul.

It's an odd room.I've been bicycle commuting for about a year in Dallas.  I have seen exactly one other regular commuter.  You'll be able to tell when things get numb. It's a really weird feeling. If it happens, get it corrected. If not, don't worry about it.I was nonplussed the first time I put the rear wheel back on, but I found that 1) tugging it backwards 2) firmly engaging the brake and then 3) tightening the QR while holding the brake worked well. Awkward, but also infrequent.As a skinner trouser guy I've had to buy new ones. My calves and quads don't fit in the old ones anymore. This..

I adjusted the Front Derailleur by myself today. It had gotten offset slightly and the chain was rubbing so I unscrewed it and set it then cleaned and oiled the chain again. Runs like a dream.3 spoke lengths is.. abnormal.My coworkers call me crazy.

&gt; Its 15 Fahrenheit outside, just drive your car to work!
&gt;  its raining, let me drive you home

The cold goes away by my first stop sign

And ponchos are great for rain :DIt's true. I live in a small (university) town in the middle of the US, and one street has a bike lane. It's not even a good street... there's just a random bike lane stuck to it for some reason.

Also this kinda confuses me... we're a small university town with a beautiful downtown that has tons of local businesses and gets a lot of walking traffic. As far as I know we're the perfect town for bicyclists (outside of having no bike lanes)... but I see maybe one every other month. I don't get it.

Then again, I don't know much about bicycles. I don't even know why I'm subbed to this subreddit. I think I just like talking to you guys. You're right. I'm not a big coffee guy...
That is the one! They were awesome through the whole process. Sell yourself on your ability to sell and gain trust from a person.  I've been a salesperson for 20 years.  Any good salesperson will tell you that a good salesman can sell anything, it doesn't matter what it is.  Sell them on your ability to learn, as well.  If you really want the job, have the interviewer tell you about any bike on the floor.  Then demonstrate how you would sell it based on what he told you.  He will be impressedI've found the 631 steel in the Aurora Elite (and also a Jamis Quest I have) to be very stiff, and not in a good way. It's plenty comfortable, though, when combined with bigger tires.Yeah ew, that awkward limping ride home is the worstOkay, that driver was an asshole of course and hopefully got what he deserved, but please don't tell me that this road is open for cyclists and that the the cyclist was allowed to be there! That would be like pitting cyclists against cars (with foreseeable outcome).

Edit: [Turns out this bridge is indeed meant as arena where cyclists are thrown to wolv ... I'm mean motorists.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vjmru/attempted_hit_and_run_on_a_biker_stopped_by_bus/coik7z5)

Edit: Some motorists in this clip act extra stupid though. They must have seen the cyclists from far away, yet manage to close up on him instead of, I don't know, switch the lane 100 meters in advance.Are the people hitting the thumb up trolls too? That's what is concerning me the most. I would think that an anonymous like/dislike system would be biased toward what people truly believe is the moral choice.Trailhead in Champlin, MN?? Great shop, enjoy the bike!If you are concerned, skip the co2 and bring a mini pump and one of those tiny Park patch kits (as well as a spare tube or two).

Also, don't over think it.  You're not riding across outer Mongolia.  I've got to imagine that in Texas, there might be a few pickups passing by.  Ease off on the day-glo neon Hi-Vis and hitch a ride if it all goes tits up.I have a good friend who lives in St. Paul and mostly bikes rather than driving.  She was hit by an SUV last year and now has a long-term disability (limited use of one arm) and chronic pain.  She regularly has close calls in St. Paul, it scares me to hear her stories.I wish I'd see that shit in MilwaukeeYour renter's insurance doesn't allow you to update the policy to cover such objects? It seems to be a psychological problem some people have. Like when a child gets extremely upset when an established rule is not followed. There must be name for this condition. Many adults seem to have this problem where I live. Those two tallies on my bike are the cars I've just killed this yearInteresting! Does that enable you to use more modern brakes? And how did you deal with the narrow width of the fork dropouts? I love how many fairly safe biking roads there are here in Minneapolis. You have places like Park Ave with a full, painted off lane marked specifically for bikes.

What's awful is when you have to bike out of the city. I've had a guy try to fight me while waiting in the righthand lane for riding in the street on lyndale in bloomington to cross 494.

The point of my mentioning this was that, even if you're riding safely (stopping for the lights and signs, signalling, etc) people just do _not_ want to hear it. "Get off the road!" You're going too slow for them, pretty much the bottom line.

St Paul is even worse for this kind of stuff, from my experience riding there. MPLS is doing a fairly good job. I just hope the trend keeps spreading around the metro area.Lets do the following weekend when i'm not so stressed out about my interview. lol. i'll text you.

&gt;No helmets are worn when cycling except possibly by babies and toddlers

Ah, what it would be like to be treated like an adultIts the downtube I've heard this from a couple guys that use these and this same bit of advice was repeated by both of them...

Don't look down. Look straight ahead, just like you're on the road. Looking down is the wrong way to ride those.haha, or at least not a headwind... a nice lead-out helps too.From personal experience, get out and ride 15 to 20 miles a few times a week, so that your legs and bottom end are adjusted to being in the saddle. I hopped into a hilly half century after not riding for years and while completely possible if you're in decent shape, it isn't fun the next day. That aside, rink a lot of water and drink it before you get thirsty. Take breaks, and eat.&gt;Your quads will get too big for your pants.

ftfyOk after looking at the various sources, it appears that there is disagreement between them as to the actual obesity rates in the US and Mexico. The cia data says that the US had a higher obesity rate that Mexico in 2008, but the data from the [UN report](http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3300e/i3300e.pdf) says the opposite. So I can't actually say which is true, but saying Mexico is fatter than the US is still more than just an "anecdote".

Also there are a number of countries with a higher obesity rate both the US and Mexico, for whatever that's worth.For sure. Regardless of whether he's allowed to ride where he did, it's just ridiculous to slow down motoring traffic, AND put your life at risk in order to be a smug cyclist. Upon looking up this bridge on Google Street View, it appears that they've put in bike lanes and a share the road sign, so this guy at least has a lane of his own now.. If your bike is fit properly and you have good posture in the saddle there is zero risk of developing ED.

It's and old wives' tale.Waiting excitedly for these puppies: http://www.orfos.bike/

Stupid expensive, but so is being eaten by a car.I don't think /u/neonmelt actually meant engage the brakes, more like keep your fingers on the brake levers in case of stupid in front of you.Was that a pedestrian only sidewalk? What this guy said cyclist here.....but why the hell is he riding his bike on the road like that when there is clearly a separated lane for him to use. Oh man, you don't even know. When I did my double century last year I managed to get in the zone on the way home, and was able to maintain 25 mph for a good hour and a half on a long stretch of flat road. Best experience of my life. You completely zone in and become an extension of the bicycle. Hearing the noise of the road whizzing underneath you gives you a certain undescribable feeling. Once you get that momentum, you don't want to lose it, and you feel like you could go on forever.Drink before you get thirsty, eat something every 45 minutes or so, and just ride. Steadily increase the amount you ride, and tackle every hill you see.If you water it, it will grow...thats code for a beastly tailwind isnt itBeing too informed can be bad, especially when buying a bike. Everyone looks for different things on a test ride, bikes also ride differently for different riders.

I can tell you that Pinarello, Cervelo, and Specialized bikes all ride really stiff and because of that they are uncomfortable to me. But someone else who has ridden those same bikes may love that super stiff feeling.

What one person really likes about one bike, you may completely hate about the same bike. Thank you. Seems silly but this post just restored my faith in humanity a little bit. Needed that.

Awesome bus driver. Glad the cyclist was alright.Buss driver is honorary biker. thanks!Yea, it really is a "when" for us. People think I'm joking when I say I've been hit by a car. It happened within a few months of when I started cycling. It was something I could walk away from and I started cycling more "aggressively" when it came to ensuring my safety. &gt;Keep your fingers on the brakes

Actually, you really shouldn't your brakes other than some light feathering. Nobody is expecting you to have significant fluctuations in speed while descending.I'm doing STP for the first time this year too- but doing it 2 day. Good luck!

I want to live there!If I ever get a speeding ticket on my bike, I'm framing that bitch and putting it on a wall.Mine was 49MPH and I was drunk so I wasn't scared at the time.  I also didn't realize I had gotten that fast until after the ride when I looked at the GPS.And then you realize that the pros AVERAGE higher speeds over hundreds of kms. They are truly beyond humanThat's disturbing. Do it drunk. Third degree. Year in jail but highly unlikely. Just lots of fines. This should be treated as intentionally hitting someone with a car regardless if it was so. If she cant see someone like that she is lying.
And if she really did not see the cyclist she was too blind to drive and still did it. So she willingly accepted that she might kill someone. 1 year in prison is too short for that. And she didnt even get that.
That's the one behind it with the cage mounts, you can see the seatstays behind and the top of the seat tube/seat cluster.i have a saddle like this - http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/cl/en/selle-italia-sls-kit-carbonio-flow-saddle/rp-prod120579

it's just as comfortable as a "normal" saddle.  i have no idea if it helps, because i have not had any numbness with any saddle.  but since i needed a saddle it seemed better to be "safe than sorry".

obviously different saddles fit different people.  but for me, that has been a great saddle - very comfortable.  if you (OP) are worried, why not get one in that style?&gt;Not even a yellow license plate would come close to explain that.

In the US, license plates are a whole bunch of different colors--[including yellow](http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/New_York2/ny2010fbr.jpg)--depending on what state issues it.  What's the significance of yellow in Germany?Use Alientube extension, replaces with reddit comments.That's a giant headtube!Some good advice here already regarding eating/drinking and pacing yourself.  Since you're beginners, I would also add that you should be comfortable making some repairs on your bikes.

It looks like its slammed forwards right now, which probably isn't where you want it.Know different wheel sizes, what kinds of bikes for what kinds of jobs, apparel, and how to pronounce bike names correctly would be my best guess for general sales staff. Any other specific questions on fixing bikes would be for the mechanics I would imagine. If there is sales staff it sounds like a larger shop.
 Didn't even need a flair to tell me you were Dutch.I believe that's a felony, no?you might be interested in [this article](http://alittlemoresauce.com/2014/08/20/what-my-bike-has-taught-me-about-white-privilege/).I get a justice boner every time I see this. I think I've found a new fetish.I wouldn't trust a dent that large in the seatpost tube.

Especially if its aluminum. Steel is a little more forgiving, but even a dent that size in steel I wouldn't trust. Hell, I'd add to that people should have to take mandatory bus trips, subway/train trips, and trips by bicycle before being given a driver's license. I believe complete lack of empathy is the main culprit for most bad drivers, besides maybe just being a bad driver in the first place, but I think this lack of empathy is mostly due to ignorance, not being a bad person.
The whole "walk a mile in their shoes" bit could do the world some favors.
You're frustrated that there's a cyclist in *your* lane, then you remember you could be in a cramped, smelly bus, taking three times as long to get anywhere, or could be out in the freezing rain on a bike, trying to survive your commute. All of a sudden that lone cyclist struggling up the hill looks a lot more like a human being to the motorist.It looks like the seatpost tube. &gt;Every single cyclist that I know has been hit. Every. Single. One.

Checking in!

Luckily I've only been hit once, in November, and it was about as minor an incident as you can have. Left cross--I ended up on the hood of the car, but my (then) brand new bike had decent brakes, so nobody was hurt and (more importantly) the bike was fine.

If I'd been riding my old POS schwinn with its terrible V-brakes, I'd probably still be unable to ride.  Without a helmet I'd probably be dead.6'4". I even contemplated putting a longer stem but with this being my first "non Wal-Mart" bike I decided to take it slow. just sales staff...
In the case /u/transientapathy3 is describing the problem is people not using the existing cyclist-specific infrastructure, namely the parallel bike route. Calling it a 'detour' is a bit extreme, it's just an alternate route the next block over and from /u/transientapathy3's description it's unlikely that those riders are riding to or from someplace directly on that road anyways.

However there could well be a problem with a lack of signage indicating the presence of a parallel bike route, which could lead to people to just riding the same route they would drive.  And you're within your rights to do so, unless it's explicitly illegal, and even then breaking the law is better than getting killed. In Denver it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk, except there are spots, often a bridge or underpass, that are signed as OK for bike use.

But projecting your own experience on that of this guy, who may have been safer on the street any other day is pointless. Maybe he's just sick of dodging pedestrians, or maybe he needs to turn left up ahead, is pointless.If your shoes are cleated, can you figure out a way to comfortably walk for a few miles?  EDIT: Stick a patch kit in your kit also, it's not unusual to have 3 or more flats on a bad day. Spoke wrench and multi-purpose tool. A bit of duct tape rolled up. Chain link tool if not part of the multi-purpose tool. Motorized traffic isn't allowed either. Must be 250ccs or greater, and cannot be a Mo-Ped. I like that the driver in the second car got right behind him and blocked him in.You link to an article from 2013 to show how the articles I linked from 2014 are out of date...What are you interviewing to do?Are you ever scared of someone steeling your saddle? I've been looking at leather saddles for a long time, but I'm scared of a ~150$ saddle being stolen....I like how he cites Segways as a safer option, but the founder of Segway died because he drove his off a cliff...&gt; Getting hit by a car is a matter of "when" for us, not "if."

This is a horrifically depressing fact that runs through my mind every time I strap on my helmet. Every single cyclist that I know has been hit. Every. Single. One. Most of them were hit-and-runs. Some, like me, were lucky and walked away with bruises. Some, like my friend, woke up in the hospital with a million dollars in medical bills.

Barely a day goes by without a near miss, a honk, a shouted curseword, or something thrown at me. It's to the point where sometimes I don't ride because I am literally risking my life every single time.

Fuck this city.I understand.. I just feel like its quite exaggerated, dont get me wrong, Im a cyclist commuter, I've riding my bike to work/gym for almost 12 years now, and I live in a big city (1m pop. aprox) and there are no bike lanesholy cow how tall are you?Wrong thread...I'm with you on that, which is why my Seek has a rack on it. Axiom also makes the Streamliner and Streamliner DLX, which attach to the fender braze on. The DLX fits on a Macho Disc and had no issues with my calipers (TRP Spyre).

I prefer to ditch the rack if possible because if you can carry your stuff with just fabric bags, it's considerably lighter than a rack and panniers.Use [**www.searchtempest.com**](http://www.searchtempest.com/), put in your zip, and search for Bianchi San Jose. It will find any in you're town or any town around you, you can even search all Craigslists if you so choose. Hopefully one is at least close enough you can pick it up or someone is willing to ship.YES.

If I try to ride on the edge of the lane people won't think twice about passing me with literally 6 inches to spare.  If I feel threatened and unsafe I can take the ENTIRE lane forcing drivers to pass me by switching lanes.

It's the law and my right as a cyclist.  This applies in the US and in my country Canada.
Thanks, that was a bit surprising. Sometimes a Singlespeed just makes sense .... Burden of proof lies with the arresting officer. 'Cycling furiously' would be almost impossible to successfully prosecute.ahhh statistics! that'll honestly be very helpful rather than "trust me mom I have a 16 year old friend who does it all the time"My friend hit a pothole doing exactly that. He just about managed to stay on the bike, but his rear wheel was messed up, a huge section of carbon brake track flaked off.

I can't remember if it was that time or another time when he ran over the manager of the LBS.cause she's my homie and I don't want her worrying about me.Manitou 3 forks on the right - circa 1993/4.

I am both a cyclist and a driver (as are nearly all of us), and I can tell you I am an equal-opportunity law-breaker.

This is not to say that I am trying hard to be an asshole, but it happens both ways.  I am much more concerned about the cyclist who is much less experienced and unfamiliar with riding a bike safely and predictably.  Sometimes "illegal" cycling is the safest option available, and inexperienced cycling is often the most dangerous.I plug mine into a potato or a lemon.If you ride in New England, you haven't lived till you bomb down roads at 35+ while dodging 6 in deep potholes. That's why I never read reddit comments. I didn't even read yours, any correlation is purely coincidental.It's probably already on the books like you're saying. It just needs to be enforced. Writing a new law might help enforcement. It's frustrating.exactly, pedestrian lane. " Traffic laws in all states consider bicyclists as a vehicle and as such, must obey the traffic laws that motorized vehicles must observe"the vast majority of almost-incidents I've had in the last year were due to people on their phones.  They kind of slowly drift into the shoulder while looking at their phone.  At like, 2MPH, but there I am about to slam into their vehicle.Is it the downtube? That's in tension, so it should be fine (If you want to see how little downtube is needed, check out [slingshot bikes](http://www.slingshotbikes.com/)!

Also check over the rest of the frame very carefully, an impact like that could well have cracked the head tube.Wat

NOt sure how this applies to my comment.  I can assure you the law is not my moral compass.  Driving is pretty damn risky too.  As casual as everyone is about it, it's probably the most dangerous thing most people do.

If safety was a priority we'd start with discouraging driving and yanking licenses.It's bicyclist like this that gives us all a bad rap though. It's an xtracycle.  http://www.xtracycle.com/

I've been riding a Surly Big Dummy with xtracycle stuff on the back for years.  It's an excellent way to get around with my two little kids. Just pour it down a drain, it should be pretty runny.Man, I was in your exact same position as you a few months ago. After weeks of digging around it came down to two:
Ultegra wheelset and Campagnolo zonda.

I ended with with the Zondas for a few reason. Same wheels as Fulcrum racing 3 that run 100ish more (Fulcrum makes some great wheels), slightly lighter than Ultegra (like 100g), tubeless ready (no rim tape needed), and they had a lot of very positive reviews.

I don't think you could go wrong with either though. Got it from Trailhead Cycle on close-out because it is last year's model. I looked at road bikes and hybrids before settling on a CX bike.  If people would take a deep breath and relax a bit while driving, perhaps not always be in a hurry and generally mad at the world... a lot of things would work better for everyone.

Drivers also seem to have forgotten the basic concepts of road safety, first being "pay attention and don't crash into things" which is closely related to "drive at a reasonable speed so that you have time to make decisions and not crash into things"

sigh.

&gt; Because traffic is safer and more efficient when everyone on a given street is going a similar speed.

Well yes, which is why I pointed out that the problem are not cyclists, but the lack of cyclist-specific infrastructure. Cyclists should not have to take a detour to accommodate drivers - in fact, the opposite is true of good planning.

You will see that this is how streets are designed in places where cycling is common: bike paths are not only standard, cycling routes are also often more direct than routes for cars (and pedestrians, in turn, often have ways shorter even than cyclists). All the best with it!, I found letting go for a drink hard but just keep pedaling and it becomes stable.

I usually do 10 minute warm up then 25-30 in a high gear jumping up one gear every 5 minutes until the last 5 are in my hardest gear. I then do a 5 minute cool down.

During the season if it is raining and I can't be bothered going out I will do intervals, 1 minute highest gear at 110+ cadence then dropping down 10 gears. Another minute recovery then back up to the highest. Next time I drop down for recovery I only drop 9 gears so it progressively gets harder.


I would like to add I am just an average guy who doesn't race but pretty strong when out on the group training rides or chain gangs.The truck was in the "care, custody, and control" of the dealership and they have a duty of care to protect the property of others. They didn't fulfill that duty and you have been "injured" financially. Your right is to be placed back into the same financial shape you were in prior to the theft. Whether the dealership or their insurance company does that it is your right to be made whole again. When you buy new bikes look into a bicycle policy from Velosurance and all the mystery of who covers what goes away.&gt; you just put a tube in.

Yes, but you have to deal with the sealant getting everywhere.I am not sure of the need for a training tire on rollers, the tires don't suffer the same friction as a turbo based resistance trainer.But you can get charged with "cycling furiously".Sorry old sport, across the pond we have this thing called 'bad weather' and it turns this whole cycling malarky into a bit of a pickle sometimes.I'm also doing my first STP this year, one day too! What kind of mileage are you used to? If you use the law as a gauge for your moral beliefs you're going to be pretty disappointed in yourself. I feel the same about my tires which measure to an actual width of 35, though they're listed as 700x33.333(repeating) :P That's right, the venerable [Jack Brown](http://www.rivbike.com/product-p/t100-g.htm) tire by Rivendell. Though I'd guess it's more to do with actual *volume* as opposed to width. A nice, round 32 might have better ride characteristics than something marginally wider, but with a profile leaving less actual air in the tire.
Also, I doubt my ass is really that in tune with the bike that a few MM really makes more difference than any other placebo. Either way I love how they ride on [my bike](http://i.imgur.com/StnS3N3.jpg)Those numbers are out of date, Mexico passed the US only within the last few years.

[Source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/mexico-obesity-rate-united-states_n_3568537.html)It's the law in CT, and I agree with it. Riding a bike on a road where cars generally drive 75+ mph and do not stop or even slow down when entering/exiting is just reckless.that guy can do some serious hauling!  Anybody know the name of that rig?Home insurance does a horrible job when it comes to bicycle insurance. Velosurance.com offers a bike policy starting @ $7.83/mo Check out their 10 questions to ask your insurance agent about bike insurance and see how many answers your agent gets right. Cheers.that looks like it could scratch your paint and get the bike started on losing all it's paint, though.Plus, as a cyclist, you really should avoid roads with significant minimum speed limits. I don't know of any such roads here in CT (except highways, which cyclists are obviously not allowed on), but I too think cyclists should be as liable for minimum speeding tickets as cars.

But that's pretty much the only part of his rant that I agree with.Filtering is legal, passing on the right isnt. Its similar to a motorbike passing inbetween lanes on a highway theres a legal gray area at the very least in most places that allows bikes to move to the front of traffic at a stopped intersection. Both incidents could have been avoided by using the bike lane in a more controlled fashion. You know you're hemmed in by cars on both sides, and know that many people exiting parked cars do not check for cyclists, so why make the assumption that it'll be safe to go at high speed in the bike lane? And before anyone jumps on me, I ride 6,000 miles a year, I too caught a door prize many years ago by riding too close to parked cars, and I now ride defensively assuming 5% of car drivers will do something stupid enough to potentially ruin my day. The approach seems to be working....Building that would require valuing human life, in much of the U.S. People are just "human resources" to be exploited for profit in any way possible.It depends on the subreddit, hit and runs are almost encouraged in places like /r/Toronto.Wassup, LA-buddy!  It's getting better and better the more of us that're out there (I feel like I've seen the number of other riders double or triple in the last year and it feels like I'm getting more love from cars with the 3-foot law, and them getting used to seeing bikes on the road).  Keep riding and we'll have this town turned around in no time!Eh I mean where I live it feels like traffic laws are not existant to the police. I've never actually seen anybody pulled over for speeding or anything since I can only assume the cops hang around the seedier areas of town. Because traffic is safer and more efficient when everyone on a given street is going a similar speed. When such options are available (which is not always the case, but that's another discussion), people should take the slower street if they're going to be going slow, regardless of what vehicle they're using. If you're in an old jeep with a max speed of 45 mph, you should take the side road rather than the 75 mph interstate. Likewise if you're going to ride at 10 mph then you should take the side street with a bike lane rather than riding in the midst of 25 mph traffic. I thought it was the other way around? the "(le) reddit army" goes to youtoube to spam/troll.Ugh, the details of that case are pretty distressing.

&gt;Ytsma had been hit by a 79-year-old driver who said she never saw him. He had been riding on a bike route designated by shared-use arrows, using one front-facing and multiple rear-facing lights, and wearing a reflective safety vest and a helmet and glasses covered in reflective tapea police official would later say he was illuminated like a Christmas tree. According to an accident reconstruction, the car traveled 200 feet with Ytsma on the hood before coming to a stop.

and

&gt;The driver, Lucille DeMartin, 79, of Center Valley, told investigators that she never saw Ytsma. She was convicted of careless driving resulting in accidental death, a summary offense punishable by a $500 fine. Police also recommended that state transportation officials require DeMartin to re-take her road test, but are not able to mandate the test themselves. Schiffer noted that it would have been hard to prove that DeMartin was guilty of the more serious charge of reckless driving, which carries a likely sentence of one year in prison.I'm sorry, I live in [California](http://d35brb9zkkbdsd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140304_CA_trd-638x501.jpg) and some of these words are really confusing.

What's a "puddle?"  "Muddy?"  ;)Don't be scared, its exhilarating!! Just keep your fingers on the brakes, pay full attention, and stay in the right lane and don't not do any of these three things. Also try it at a time when there's minimal traffic./r/bicycling seems like the only sympathetic voice to cyclists. its not justified, i know.. but.. right on the middle of the road, was that necessary?Since she is strong enough to snap pedals, we will need to see pictures of her thighs...I live in England.

IME, there is no relationship between someone's title and their fitness knowledge, even among doctors. Some doctors will tell you squats will kill you, some physical therapists know more about your body than you ever could. It really comes down to people.8-9 am MWF.

Partial thickness tear of my supraspinatus and a bone bruise 6 months ago now. Did about 6 weeks of pt. I'd say I am back around 80-90% now. Full mobility. The only things that can still bother it are back squats, just because of the angle I'm pulling my shoulder back at. And also weighted thick jump rope. And of course shoveling in Boston these days. Because people need to get worked up over trivial things to feel smarter than your average pleb.Surgery and a long rehab. Yeah I would eat closer to an hour before. I find that for strenuous workouts I start to get dizzy if I eat any earlier. Alright so I'm 17 and rather new to strength training/weight lifting. I'm 205 lb, lift 4-5 times a week focusing legs, arms, back etc. After my workouts (usually 1 - 1 1/2 hours) I take 2 servings of whey protein. I am primarily aiming to gain strength, so weight is not a concern. Is creatine a viable option to increase strength?not sure why you are downvoted. that is actually a good point. my bent bar works fine for me because i dont do those lifts. i want to replace it because i just like nice things. but for my lifts it functions 100% fine. but if i was doing power/olympic lifts where bar whip has an affect, it might not be.Oh, I agree it's nice to know all that stuff.

I've been working out for about a year now but never used pre workout. What would be a good one to start with?That's a good idea. I'll try it.You can do but it just adds an extra level of complexity to your math. Ie you have to eat not only a surplus for the lifting but also a surplus to take into account the hiit, both during and after the training. I would avoid it until its time to cut tbh.For just about anything related to gym-related health I would recommend a physical therapist. They won't tell you to stop activity, they'll assess your individual biomechanics and add or modify your exercise to fix your issues.

That being said, realize that their goals may not be the same as your own. For example, I've had three different physios tell me not to squat to or past parallel. They're obviously just trying to minimize risk, but that interferes with my goal of being able to safely squat deep.Not arthritis as such [arthritis affects joints], rather the acromion sometimes grows a bone spur down onto the supraspinatus tendon and impinges upon it, leading to tears. That would be fine.Cool, I hope it helps out.

If you think this is the cause, here are some things that helped me with my tightness and pain:

[Pigeon pose and 'couch stretch' from here](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/08/05/undo-the-damage-of-sitting/)

Using a lacrosse ball on my TFL and stretching it, youtube search "tfl release".

Weighted back raises to strengthen my glutes.  Also, I changed the way I did back raises.  I never thought about my glutes before, I just ... raised my torso up.  I started thinking "fuck the pad", or if you want to be less crude, "Drive your hips into the pad" instead of thinking about raising my back.  This really helped me learn how to use my glutes.

Unilateral work (single leg work).  I'm guessing it just forced me to use my glutes more, since I had more balance to maintain.  I bet with some googling you could find a better explanation, or maybe it was all in my head, but doing some single leg step ups onto a box help me out tremendously.

Learning what the fuck "hip hinge" means, and using it on my lifts.Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Also might want to try some high bar and front squats. Protein powder is just an easy way to consume a lot of protein, it's not necessary. It is good for losing weight though because regular protein powders have some of the best protein to calorie ratios because they are so pure. If you get enough protein in your diet there is no need, but I find it hard to reach my protein goals while staying under my maximum calories without itusually do 9:30-11PM. I can't stand the crowds and theres something very relaxing to me about working out at night. When I'm done I can go home, shower, eat something then go right to bed. That's always a good feeling to me.I would just add to this that if you ever get a potential rotator cuff tear, get yourself to see a shoulder specialist ASAP. The supraspinatus does not easily heal without surgery as it has a very poor blood supply, and you will have poorer outcomes if you wait more than 6 weeks for surgery. Calluses take time to build up, you can either suffer through it, or switch to lifting gloves. In the long run your rough callused hands may be better for everyday life, but if you don't want that gloves will protect themHold your arms out in front of you with your fingers together and your your thumbs sticking out facing each other. Turn your thumbs down toward the ground = internal rotation. Turn your thumbs up toward the sky = external rotation. It's called a subluxation, and I had this problem for many years. I was a swimmer and I guess after many years of swimming my labrium was weakened. I went to PT and they prescribed the standard shoulder exercises to strengthen the rotator cuff. Well as time went on I would keep getting these subluxations and progressively over the years they would get worse and more frequent even while maintaining my shoulder exercises. The exercises helped with quickly bouncing back but eventually it was popping out about once a week or more and I'm sure as you know it sucks.

I went and visited the sports physician and due to all these subluxations I had managed to tear my labrium from the 2 o'clock position to the 11 o'clock position plus I had fractured my glenoid at some point so I had what was called a bony bankart lesion. Pretty much my rotator cuff muscles were the only thing stablizing my shoulder since the cartilage around my shoulder socket was shredded. Elected to get the surgery. I hit the pt hard and bounced back after a few months. Was cleared in 6 months but still do my PT exercises to this days. No more problems with my shoulder but I do have a slight reduction in mobility in it (~95%). No problems with lifting or anything other sports I do such as mt biking and skiing so I'm happy I eventually got it done. Well for starters I would completely abandon "Phrak's GSLP" and make your own workout split. I don't know who designed that program but it's God awful.

Design a program dedicated to your goals. I've been lifting for 7 years now and have never plateaud and I honestly credit it to the fact that I've personalized all my workouts contoured to my own goals. It's fine to base your workouts on others program but I almost never do the absolute exact program designed by someone else. I realize that a lot of people do follow workout and diet programs designed by someone else and have a lot of success, which is great BUT look at any top bodybuilder, fitness model, powerlifter, etc. They all have workouts customized to their personal goals (even if someone else created it, it was designed specifically for that person's goal).

I'm new to Reddit so I don't know where I would find a link similar to these but these are some great links I've used to help me in the past.I have a question on pre-existing injuries.  I have had a posterior and anterior labrum tear for close to 5 years now and I've always neglected to have it surgically corrected after my last tear ended with a botched surgery and very extensive rehabilitation.

I've been slowly rehabilitating it over the years with what I learned the first time around but the same problem remains with heavy lifts in the fact that I can't do them. Call it fear or pain but when I really get up in weight on deadlift, military press, bench press or lat raises I can never go to muscle fatigue failure, it's always a failure from the pain or I'll start feeling something giving out or on the brink of giving out, not fatigue related, and stop what I'm doing.

I'm an Ex-wrestling, lacrosse, football athlete and college wrestler.  It's frustrating being limited in any activity I do and at this point I want to continue to lift, but also be able to have a baseball catch with my future son (or current, I don't have any kids that I know about).

I guess what I'm asking is, at a certain point do these stretches actually keep helping or do they just prevent worsening.  Is surgery the only answer in my case?

Thanks fellas, a pleasure as usual.

i was responding to the safety of wood holding that weight. and i do agree there are flaws. one you are not loading the posts truly vertically. you load them in front so they will create a moment across the post, so you dont get the entire section in compression. some will be in tension.

the design of the pegs/holes dont have enough information to begin to look at, though i do agree they are the likely first place of failure. especially as shown i am skeptical of their strength. that being said there are tons of wood connectors/straps to design something that will not result in a failure you are describing. im sure someone smarter than me could come upw ith something adjustable.

but like i said, i was mostly discussing the strength of wood. not necessarily this design.How long ago did you quit smoking? I'm no doctor but it might take a while for your circulatory system to start recoveringNo doubt about it in my mind. Static stretching done as a warmup is kind of useless but actual warm up (including dynamic stretching) does help to prevent injuries. I noticed multiple times I got a stupid "pulled something" injury when I skimped on warm up. Especially shoulders.Didn't say they would be terrible for any situation. Said they are terrible when the goal is to compensate poor mobility. Atleast that's what I meant to say. :(I don't have any short ribs but I do have a big piece of beef I was going to make stew with tomorrow..might just some sort of fucked up korean beef stew with this instead.I don't go to someone who isn't a medical doctor to help fix an injury. Maybe once you're done seeing a real doctor and you're healed, you can go to a trainer to learn how to fix the problems that caused the injury in the first place.

You're going to have slight soreness and discomfort when with exercise. Sharp pains that only come when you move a certain way are very bad, and you *should* stop moving that certain way until it heals. Dull, constant aches or soreness that go away after movement/warming up are fine and just part of the deal.Probably not utilizing your body to its max potential. A lot of people just "bench" and it becomes just an tricep workout. You should post a form check video to check if your shoulder blades are pinched/back tightness and incorporating leg drive. Maybe your body isn't responding to your program. Change it up and modify. Someone once told me lifting programs are trial and error. Best advice I got from a gym bro.I do it all the time, kinda pudding tasting
I suffered a small tear in my right rotator cuff during high school football. It wasn't discovered until I had an MRI w/ arthogram for a later subluxation, and it had already healed and what remained was a small tear. I was benching 240-260 before the tear, and I've struggled with anything around or over 200 since (sublux occurred about 2 years ago). Any tips on how to overcome this setback? I've been trying to get back into training but I just can't seem to get my bench max anywhere near what it used to be. I have used it frothing coffee and hot chocolate and it works pretty well, never for a whey protein shake though.

Another thing you could do is instead of adding the powder to the liquid and a little liquid to the powder first, mix it up and then pour the rest of the liquid. I honestly think it has to do with the coffee. Any protein shake I make using coffee gets foamy and starts to separate pretty quickly. Not sure how to fix it though. Drink fast?I'm calling you out. You did not read the wiki.&gt; Everything else is annoyingly angry and wrong.

/fitness/ logic - "I can't think up a good response so I'm just going to say you're wrong"

Sounds like you're on a program for more than just your workout.
That's true and its why you wouldn't work to exhaust the rotator cuff muscles, just warm them up before you lift. First off congratulations!

Secondly, you are most likely hitting a plateau given your time frame, you might try switching up your routine by adding in new exercises, resting less between sets, lifting heavier, etc. You could also try adding in more cardio or a different type of cardio.

Lastly take a look at your diet and see if it can be improved at all?

Quick edit: take a look at some training techniques like super sets, compound sets, drop sets, super slows, and eccentric training, these may also help you to break throughThis submission has been removed.

5'6 22 year old in shape female looking to gain muscle.

I found the tingling has become more noticeable as I have become saturated in it. Keep taking it for a while and if you still don't notice an effect then i guess stop taking it. 3-5 grams is the recommended daily doseRather than answer, let me ask, what do you think would happen if you did?The source is probably just someone's backside.Check the FAQ.  The first part. That 2011 paper used intense power training to achieve the muscle gain while losing fat. Also http://suppversity.blogspot.ca/2015/02/two-crazy-but-scientifically-proven.html

There was another on boxing I saw recently.

I have always been told to do your single joint exercises last, and your multi joint exercises first. The rationale being that exhausting small stabilizing muscles first can lead to poor form in lifts that involve multiple joints. So having bad ankle mobility is ok and instead of improving it everyone should be using weight lifting shoes?No. If you eat that, you will die.False, I'm actually thick skinned.Resistance bands are also good, just tie it around a post and then the other end around your ankle while standing.No, I took almost 9 months off of lifting, except for some stretching and "rehab" type stuff.  I could have kept doing upper body, but the pain had gotten to the point that I just didn't want to do much at all anyway.

After 5 or so months it started to feel better, and now I am asymptomatic.  Started back in the gym Thanksgiving day (my gym is awesome and open).  Squats back up into the low 400's, and I pulled 455 pretty easily this week.  When I quit I couldn't even set up for a pull off the floor, or squat 135 - it just hurt too much.Thats why in Crossfit we blow them out with a gay swinging pull up.Fruit and vegetables, rice, beans, oats.  [Tortilla shells](https://allisonhurtado.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/photo-4.jpg).  Never added it up.  I remember reading somewhere that the minimum dose to get the maximum effect is 0.03 grams creatine per kg of body weight, which means 5 grams is still enough for you. Most people just take 5 grams because it's a standard scoop/teaspoon size and creatine is cheap. Great post! Except I just got done with an MRI and the doc diagnosing that I have a Superspinatus strain.
Note to Self: Check Reddit more often. It's free!As the external rotators become really short (in the last stage of the exercise where gravity isn't working against you) I find it really difficult to stop the movement becoming abduction. To be honest the cable version is, as you say, more optimal. But, I just seem to prefer the other.This submission has been removed.

My lockout strength and general tricep strength have gotten miles better since I've started push pressing. Haha yeah its always the ones that look like they don't even lift that tell other people how to lift. Good idea! I'll add it to my arsenal.Invest in a good jacketYou need to clearly define what type of results you want to see, size, strength, cardio whatever. Then research more specifically into those areas.

As a general rule free weights (Dumbbells and barbells) are better than machines because they require more stabilization muscles, but since you are a beginner, machines are a good choice for a few weeks until You build some some strength

Maybe they mean doing a strengthening routine versus a warmup or dynamic stretching routine.SAT word of the day, students, is pusillanimous. Added to daily lexicon.So I'm not an expert or anything, but this could be a sign of a sleep disorder. Other com mentors have suggested things you can try, I'd add that this can happen if you are consuming too much caffeine within six hours of bed time.

What you can do is track what is happening, when times do you wake up? How many hours of sleep have you gotten? What did you do/eat/drink in the hours before bed time, ect. See if altering things in your routine helps (like less caffeine,  better diet, no heavy exercising within two hours of bedtime, ect) if nothing is then go talk to your doctor and take the information you've been keeping track of as they will probably ask you about it. It's a stimulant so if you take large doses at once it can have very negative effects, and yes potentially cause heart problems. Here is a good resource I found

The assumption behind the statement that he could gain material weight is that it would be lean weight (this is a fitness subreddit after all).

40 lbs of lean body mass does not have the same health implications as 40 lbs of fat.

 I suspect most of the serious lifters here would fall into the overweight category of BMI and to imply that BMI is a good measure for lifters is, simply, wrong.

You got a source on this?I'm not natively speaking english so seems like people have problems with reading comprehension or I worded myself poorly.

Anyways, my point was that if you have poor ankle mobility I'd not use weight lifting shoes to compensate the lack of it. Would improve the mobility to the point where you could squat deep naturally.

Who the hell would squat heavy weights and have bad form because of bad mobility?
Around 6PM on the way home from work.  I just don't have enough energy in the mornings to have effective workouts.  I've tried it and my lifts are all much worse.  By 6PM I've been up all day and eating a lot of food and it just feels right.  Maybe if I stuck with it for a while it would be better - it would be nice to have it out of the way in the AM, that's for sure.  All day with that post workout glow. The only real supplement that works for weight loss is Ephedrine. Caffeine can help a bit too but EC stacks (ephedrine and caffeine together) is the only effective "fat burner" supplement. here is some more info

http://www.hotnfit.com/ecstackAnd, like golf, this asshole rarely has any game himself.OK, I guess I might try it and if it don't work, I'' buy one of those ankle weights. You're right, they're up to 2 kg unfortunately. My kettlebell is 4 kg. Maybe it would be possible to put on my ankle two ankle weights?I'd just like to add that these are all correct exercises for improving your flexibility in your shoulders.

I've had extreme pain in my rotator cuff, so I had to go to the chiropractor to see whats wrong. He always started the session with testing my flexibility, like in OP's post. Luckily the damage wasn't huge, only a muscle that will not relax on itself.Not entirely. I agree on the cardio part. It is possible to influence how much weight gain or loss goes to muscle or fat through training and it is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.  We added a section to the FAQ to address that point.  The type of training that works is HIIT, sprinting, metabolic resistance training, high intensity power training, Crossfit and boxing.  There may be other methods as well. Anything that works is very hard and usually requires external motivation.&gt; when I internally rotate it.

Doing what exercise?I've lost a bunch of weight and gotten in shape and I still see my "old" self in the mirror but I get a lot of positive feedback from people that I look a lot better, slimmer and stronger.  Funny how my image of myself hasn't caught up yet.

The other funny thing is how people are dying to know what the secret is.  They keep thinking I'm on some miracle diet or weight loss pill or some other shit.  They look so sad when I tell them I walk, run, lift weights and eat less calories than I burn. Nobody likes the reality of what it takes to lose weight and get in shape.  It's hard and it sucks some days but then it clicks and now I feel crappy if I don't get to the gym for 2 days.it is when the number one question is "why I make no gains"? and the number one answer is "what program are you on"?Just film yourselfIt's not uncommon for supplement companies to recommend higher dosages to make you buy more. My multi recommends 2 a day but I only take 1, it's just an insurance policy if you are missing anything in your diet. 1 is probably good enough, especially if you have a decent dietLol mostly joking, you'll find your never healthy enough once you feel the difference in being over weight and being fit.Thanks for the advice. That was the initial plan, but you know, of course I'm impatient and I thought there is a "quicker way". But yeah, there isn't :)Out of curiosity, why do you prefer ER in lying down position? I was taught this is sub-optimal as the range of motion is only working against gravity for part of the movement. With cable ER, resistance is applied throughout the range of motion. I would like to see stretches that identify what parts of my cuff are tight, as opposed to just saying if I'm tight or not. That would help those of us with an imbalance to more effectively target our problem areas.&gt;Male, 5'9", ~149-150lbs

This is like literally average.Greek yogurt is great for me. I mix it with everything!

I make romaine lettuce wraps with a cup of Greek instead of sour cream.

I mix it with Granola.

I put a cup into my protein shake with scoop of whey and cup of fruits or I'll freeze it and eat it as an ice cream/sorbet.

I'll mix it with peanut butter and jelly or nutella.

It's great stuff. I love it!

You can mix it with cottage cheese...man  the list goes on and on.

This is what I meant, I wil eat at a surplus but I will also do HIIT 2 times a weekBoth.  I've read (on this sub I think) that stretching doesn't actually do anything besides mentally prepare you, and in my experience it's never helped with anything.  So if I'm doing something wrong I'd like to know about it, but I also want evidence because I know a lot of people *think* stretching helps and have just never questioned it.

Also, the article above says not to do these exercises before a bench/shoulder press.  So if you aren't supposed to warm up your shoulders, why anything else?I just started. Just 1 week in I already see a difference.I haven't experienced being cold after caffeine from cofee...But the fat burner makes me feel cold for 20some minutes, thanks for helping with it.Unfortunately I don't have an answer for you.

[Here it is](http://fairlife.com/our-products/fat-free/).  Nutrition info looks pretty solid, basically trading half the sugar for protein and making it accessible for the lactose intolerant.  I wouldn't mind using this in shakes, or on cereal, or oats.

Everyone I've talked to about is just saying "Yeah, but it's coke, and therefore bad" but I cannot find a REAL reason to dislike it.Ever since I've been lifting heavy (~6 months), I've been super twitchy and really active in my sleep, and it's been affecting both me and my husband to the point that I was considering sleeping in the guest room on my lifting days.

I started taking 150 mg magnesium citrate on Monday, and have noticed a huge difference.  YMMV, and it might be placebo, but I've been really happy with it so far. Yes this is the best way to observe your gainsRule of thumb, if it doesn't hurt when it pops/cracks, then it's nothing to worry about. That's how I know I'm not trying hard enough.

lift weights, don't hate.

Or keep hating and never get swole =)7 pm is pretty late to take EC. I take 2 doses a day, 1 shortly after I get up in the morning at like 6:30-7am, then take my second dose around 11am-noon. General guideline is 4-6 hours apart. Here is a pretty good resource I found:

http://www.hotnfit.com/ecstack

http://www.hotnfit.com/ecstack/ec-dosagesIf it's painful, go to a physiotherapist.  Otherwise, go to a trainer.  Something is clicking/painful in my shoulder when I internally rotate it. Mostly avoidable and not excruciating, but I know that I'll screw it up totally if I don't pay attention to it.Phrak's GSLP is a variant of greyskull linear progression. OHP and bench are on alternating workouts, and it's not 3 days in a row. Also, SL 5x5 and SS are both proven programs for beginners that require no dumbbell work or incline.

Your only good comment was the first one, post a video. Everything else is annoyingly angry and wrong.Are you skeptical or just curious?Does anyone take fish oil supplements that has a fish allergy? I would have thought that the athour would believe that doing a rotator cuff routine prior to lifting overhead would exhaust the muscles meaning that they wouldn't fire during the exercise, when they are needed.

However, if this was the thinking, its incorrect. Doing a sub maximal rotator cuff routine prior to lifting would increase the firing rate of the those muscles during the compound movements. Maximal rotator cuff strengthening may not be advised until after compounds. 5 p.m., after work. I like the feeling of unleashing all my rage after work in a controlled setting. Then, I go home, shower, eat a nice meal and relax.Jumping rope.Coaches Eye on iPhone is convenient if you find yourself recording frequently.It's hard to sound like a joke/sarcasm online. You are misusing amrap sets - they are to gauge your progress and add a little extra volume with heavy load. But you had right intentions - benching more. Maybe the dumbbells weren't the best tool if your one side isn't lagging heavily behind. That said - drop a little more weight and work back with extra volume. Work in 8-12 range.

You could honestly use a belt and be fine. Just strap on the ankle, tie to the weight. As long as the weight isn't too heavy for you, you should be able to control the ascent/descent and not hurt yourself.People sticking to a program too much is not fittit's problem, homie.I drink a protein shake just mixed with water. Then later in the evening I make a fruit smoothie with greek yogurt and chia seeds.  I don't care much for the protein powder in a smoothie for some reason.I just want to say excellent job on making it to the gym! It really can be the hardest part, especially during the winter time. I'm a native Floridian transplanted in a northern state and I hate leaving the house when the temperatures drop even lower in the evening but with my schedule that's the only available workout time. Just making going to the gym part of your routine is a huge accomplishment and you should be really proud.
That said, I really encourage you to look into the big three weighted exercises (squats, bench press, and deadlifts) and definitely the assisted pull up machines. For pull ups, you can use your initial weight to your advantage because as you lose weight, you're just going to feel yourself getting stronger and stronger, which will be really satisfying. The good news is that doing inner thigh exercises will strengthen the muscles in your inner thighs, which may make them look firmeralthough, as others have said, it won't take away any of the fat on your thighs (and you may not see the muscle gains until you've lost weight). So keep exercising, but also keep reducing your overall body fat, because the only way to lose thigh fat is to lose weight in general."The bike thing" ...it's a bikeThere's going to be a lot of pain at first.  Work through it.  Start off slow so you don't hurt yourself.  Focus on nutrition first and foremost.  he would be better off singling out the people doing this, as otherwise it just has a bystander effect. Even though everyone knows whos at fault. I don't follow lean gains and typically train in the evening. However I'm a college student and frequently my schedule changes and I don't have enough time for a full breakfast or coffee. I just use Amino energy in the mornings when this happens. Most of the flavors taste pretty good and you can control a dosage of caffeine in terms of how many scoops you want to use. This may or may not be an attractive way for you to use BCAA and still get some sort of "tangible" benefit out of it. Veggies, fruits and oatmeal mostly.&gt; (equal abduction power as deltoid)

This is definitely not true. Supraspinatus helps to initiate abduction but the deltoid is a much, much stronger abductor due to both a greater cross-sectional area and a more distal insertion point along the humerus.

&gt; If you're unable to get the fingers to overlap, or touch, your flexibility is not good enough yet.

Good enough for what? I can't think of a single fitness or lifting related movement in which you need this much flexibility, and this likely isn't limited by your rotator cuff anyway. If you can move through the range of motion required to complete your desired activity, that's enough flexibility. Many people, despite all the stretching in the world, will never be able to touch their fingers like this, and trying to force it could be damaging.What is a way to check body fat?You're a fucking dick and exactly the type of person who gives fitness conscious people a bad name. i've seen some people distribute their weight from one side to the other to maintain balance (presumably?).  [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JppwI7Krsh0)As a physical therapy student, go to the physical therapist. A good amount of modern physical therapists now have Doctorate degrees and CSCS certifications. Some trainers just have a weekend fitness course that cost $500. I've had minor chronic injuries, went to my PT professor and he showed me the best things to do. Not only did he mention the exercises to rehab, but form to prevent. If it's a chronic injury you're best for a physical therapist.

Anybody have any info on this? I read the ingredients and tbh I can never seem to trust what certain supplements claim. They always make it out to be all pros to cons with some info not even scientifically proven. It buy 1 get 1 free and looks decently promising. You can't blame them for not re-racking their dumb bells. People were sitting on the racks! You shouldn't disturb them while they're recovering between sets....Good plan.  I'm Tracking today's calories as we speak.  I haven't even eaten lunch yet and I'm at 882 calories already.  Holy fuck. Thank Christ I'm working out later XD.Yeah I would just do some heavy kickboard work with breaststroke and freestyle if you want to work on your leg strength.True, but I'm not sure if it would be safe. I dropped the kettlebell once and it almost hit my toes, so I'm rather cautious now. Also while being strapped to my ankle it won't be secure and can hit my ankle.
Don't you think something like this would be better? http://www.allproweights.com/ankleweights.htmlTrust me I have good grip I can deadlift this weight on a regular bar fine. It literally just rolled out of my hand.I've had the same problem in the past. What has helped me is doing skullcrushers laying down with my hands parallel to my head (if I were standing my arms would be over my head) and starting from pretty much behind my head towards my neck and doing a skullcrusher from there. Don't move your shoulders and just use your triceps.

General tips to help would just be to improve form, with ideal form you shouldn't have much pain, don't let your ego get in the way and lower your weight, don't lock your elbows when at the top of the exercise, and finally if all this doesn't help than I'd stay away from them for awhile. Great, thanks man! I really want to get better at it, just needed someone to point me in the right direction! I kinda assumed it was a deadlift bar and was like "Oh shit this will help me tremendously." The minute I switched to mixed grip it started slipping.I'm aware it's pretty bro-ish. It was meant to be done while doing a large volume of running. Just curious about the source.Beans/lentils, oats/grits/bran, wild rice, lots of nuts, fruit, saladsserving size is 5 pills at 3.5. So I should take 8 everyday I lift? I can just take it in the morning with my other pills even if I'm not lifting til later that night? Nope. You basically need to eat more calories than you burn to bulk up. Cardio just burns calories so prevents you bulking as well.

What you need to do is go over your calorie allowance just enough to gain muscle but not so much as to add (much) fat. It is a balancing act but if you keep detailed notes and logs on food and training you should be able to tailor it over time.Just want to point out that Creatine and beta-alanine aren't timing dependent in terms of helping your workouts. They don't give any extra benefit in a pre workout than taking them any other time. Nothing wrong with having them in there if you want to take all of your supplements together thoughKekoslovakia.

Entire separate days for arms and shoulders, and then mashing chest and back together into one.That's great because breaststroke is my favourite style :)Yes, but it will of course vary from person to person. A more slow-twitch fiber dominant person, will probably find that their max is closer to their xRM, than a person with more fast-twitch would (due to their different properties).OK.

Lets you work for longer periods, especially when working out fasted. Also gives you a nice boost with the small amount of caffeine in it. BCAA's and a good protein powder have done more for me than any other supplements. Never understood why people give them such a hard time.Using a wall or pole in front of you is fine while you work on your flexibility

You also may need to widen your stance. Think about squatting down inbetween your legs instead of sitting back.I'd be careful when "strengthening" your rotator cuff muscles. With respect to the anatomy of the shoulder joint, these muscles play a crucial role in stabilizing the joint. "Strengthing" the rotator cuff muscles improperly will cause imbalance and potentially further issues with the shoulder.
A functional assessment of the anatomy of the shoulder strongly suggests the rotator cuff to be muscles of stability - not necessarily for gross movement.
That being said, yes stretching is beneficial in increasing ROM, but strengthening them as you would a global muscle (power&gt;endurance) would be unwise. Rather, it would be advised to strengthen them for stability (power &lt; endurance).
This is simply my take based on my education and reading.You could get/make something to strap your kettlebell to your ankle.Can work for some movements, like lateral raises. But with squat, deadlift, or (debatably) good mornings, you have a higher chance of back hyper extension if you are looking at the mirror.It sounds like an ankle flexibility issue. If you have tight ankles you will tend to lean forward and have a hard time keeping your balance.
For now, just go as low as you can while keeping your balance (no wall) and hold. You'll get better with consistency. A physical therapist would definitely be the person to go to for tennis elbow.All Max Nutrition manufactures Isoflex which I consider to be the best protein powder/replacement powder that I have used. It costs a little more than competitive products, but it's a much cleaner powder. All Max Nutrition also make a straight Whey protein powder that you may want to try. I am not affiliated with All Max Nutrition in any manner.
Its not breaking up the clumps when I did that. Used twice the amount of water with same results. I had the same thought and was reaaaaly confused and sad. Had to drink twice the amount and it still had chunks, hah.This post has been removed.

Same as Starting Strength and Stronglifts. Are you suggesting that all programs without dumbbells, no incline, and a lot of recurring exercises are designed by morons?I was doing pullups about a month ago and felt a pop in my right shoulder. Only a slight pain in the moment. Now I feel pain every time I try to stretch my right arm up my back the way you described. Before the injury, I could reach and pull it a bit with my other hand. Now, I can no longer do that stretch properly. Otherwise unaffected in any lifting or calisthenic exercise. Any advice?

Thanks TonyOstrich, that was very helpful. I just tried it and the key for me was to engage core and squeeze ass. I'm not sure why it wasn't working before. Regarding the heels only contact with the floor that's the same suggestion that Rippetoe makes in "Starting strength" for squatting! Cool.
To explain the biochemistry simply the creatine does not passively move through cell membranes but is rather taken up by transport proteins and not released from the cells in any significant concentration afterward (but it does break down or get metabolized over time). Your body's naturally produced creatine actually originates from the liver and is taken up by muscle tissue from the bloodstream. Dont forget to include your own weight when squatting tooHave you used this before? Ikea is only like 10 minutes away so I might give this a go!Yeah, chocalate with vanilla yogurt almost tastes like coffee! Except once I used EAS Complete Protein and it absorbal **all** mouisture and turned into a rock... that sucked.Full scoop. It's literally just protein. Do they let you eat chicken or beans? Then they should allow you to have your protein powder.

Remember: the purpose of this protein powder is to supplement (read: add to) your protein intake so that you can make sure you're getting enough.It is natural fruit sugar without the fiber contained in the fruit, which would normally slow digestion and stop the insulin spike.

Fruit juice will have a similar effect on body composition as soda.

FACT&gt; n't open till 9AM. Usually around 10 AM on the weekend. I wish it opened earlier.

I just workout out in the weight room that the athletes used. Not sure I was allowed to do that, but none of the teams knew who was on the other teams, and I kept my head down and ran a reasonable program, so no one gave me any shit.It's common for both to be completely full of shit, by and large

What specific injuries/problems are you talking about?Nutrient timing is important for competitive bodybuilders where every gram of bodyfat and muscle counts. Its also useful with some PEDs. Chances are, you are not at that point, and jut need to worry about calories in vs calories out, and macronutrients.Probably a stupid question, but what's the difference between internal rotation and external rotation?Yeah the other flavors I've had aren't having this issue, but I don't want to waste the whole tub of protein!Sane with me Usually at work - No access to a blender :(Most people would write out either 19:30 or 19.30 tbh.

But I like the time machine stuff better. Gyms pre-iPhone generation were much less crowded. Also gotta reap those pre-birth benefits when you squeeze in those 1930 workouts in your schedule.I would really like an answer on this...I too only do them before an upper body day...sometimes after or on a day off.http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise

At the bottom is a bolded link: **try the [program picker website](http://rohitnair.net/pp/).** My gym offers a TRX class. There are some cardio elements to it (we occasionally do burpees), but it mostly focuses on HIIT with strength focused exercises. I take the class once a week to supplement a climbing, weights, jogging and ballroom dance regimen and find it really enjoyable. TBH I do the same set of stretches every workout, each workout I have 5 different workouts, I am most tight in my lower body so I will do: [hamstring stretch](http://www.soccermaniak.com/images/hamstring_stretch_7.jpg), [glute stretch](http://www.exrx.net/StretchImages/GluteusMaximus/StandingGlute.jpg), [calf stretch 1](http://www.docpods.com/images/Calf-Stretch-Step-WEB.jpg) and [2](http://www.racewalk.com/Stretching/IntensiveCalfStretch.jpg), [hip stretch](http://www.amongmen.com/sites/default/files/uploads/content/jock_yoga_tutorial_-_active_lunge_stretch_for_hip_flexors_2.jpg) and  [frog hip stretch](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-REbU0BauD7Q/TzSYRt4g9-I/AAAAAAAAANQ/2jztilg2U1A/s1600/frog1.jpg)

I feel like this gets all the major areas in my legs and I feel great afterwards. I think I'm going to add this lower back stretch in somewhere. My upper body usually isnt tight, sometimes I'll do shoulder dislocations but usually it's just those 5 stretches matched with each of my 5 workoutsIll give this a try! Thank you!No. Washing habits constitute such a small fraction of daily activity that this is not the case. Hence the downvotes. Thanks. Too bad not everyone thinks like this -&gt; she the "nice" post below...You should still add a little fat but HIIT as been shown to be the best cardio for bulking. I would do things like sled pushes and pulls for a 15 yard sprint.  If you don't have access to those just sprint balls out.Ahh...  I don't have a foam roller. Any way I could use the lax ball on my knee? Meh for what you want, I'd probably go PPL. Theoretically you'd get more gains from increased volume due to still being a novice.

However, it's probably a pretty break even split in all reality.I've got 4 kids under the age of 7 and I find time.i always tell people to go to costco and so they can buy a ton of lean ground beef, turkey, and frozen chicken.  it's much cheaper there.  they have oats and frozen vegetables there, too.  there are a million things you can do with it.  get milk, eggs and egg whites there, too.  Either around 11 because that lets me go to work (bartender) afterwards, or, if I'm lifting on my days off, around 2 or 3 because I have more energy if I eat lunch, and then have some tea or coffee or something. Also, the powerlifters tend to be in around then, and I training at the same time as them.I like modified skull crushers with two dumbbells. Put them together, so they touch, and start in front of your face (bottom of dumbbell should be parallel to forehead) at a lower weight so you get acclimated. Then, just keep elbows in and go back behind your head, then back to forehead, repeat. I don't know, it's worked really well for me and rarely hurts my 'bows.There's also running laps but I know how to practice those.Well... That's racist.&gt; I was stuck at 125 for 4 weeks

So, you deloaded when you failed and then worked your way back up only to fail again at 125, right?  Just checking...

Are you microloading? (adding 1.25lb plates each time you hit the goal weight for perscribed reps)?

Have you posted a form check?  You might want to.  The fact taht you are hitting a 100lb OHP for reps and you are getting stuck past 120 on bench tells me that there's something wrong with your form that you may be unaware of.  The only people I have ever met or heard of who had overhead lifts that were really close to their bench were people who trained almost exclusively in overhead lifts for their sport.  If your overhead and bench pressing volume are more or less equal and your form is good then, *generally speaking,* there should be a little more of a gap there.That is advice called wisdom. We may not want it but not looking will improve your form and overall condition. Why? You have to feel what your doing is right and what is wrong. I hate mirrors since theyre a distraction but I did thought I needed them. My gym has a whole wall thats placed with mirrors though.I have tendinitis in my rotator right now,  would doing all the above stretches and exercises help speed up recovery? My doctor has given me a few exercises and just the basic arm across the chest stretch. Been going on 3 months now.  Movement and pain are much better but still very painful if I try to push any heavy weight. C4 vs Nxplode? I've got c4 right now but I don't ever notice feeling any more pumped up other than getting that annoying itchy sensation. A while back I tried a one serving noxplode shooter and felt like I was going to have a heart attack but was definitely more pumped up. What do you guys think? Which do you prefer?First off, congrats on being under 200 for the first time in five years!

If you're 19 and have been only exercising for 6 weeks than I highly doubt you've hit a plateau. This early a lot of the weight you have lost is just your body adjusting to the caloric deficit as well water weight. I'd check your calories and make sure you're at the caloric deficit you want to be at.

Finally, there are so many things that effect how much you weigh. Just remember that the scale is just a number. Losing 10 pounds of just fat will make you look a lot better than losing 10 pounds of fat, water, muscle, etc. The scale is a good guide on your journey but don't let it alone dictate your success.He's american.He has wide hips and shoulders. And really, you are going to look disproportional if you are over 6 foot and under 200. Nothing wrong with it, if he is happy with his body then it is a moot point.

 I never even said anything about 40lbs of lean muscle, either. Some muscle, some increased bone density, increased glycogen, and some dreaded fat all combined after completing the novice phase of Starting Strength. 210 isn't an end point, it's just a complete guess at a set point.kYou need to take in 5g a day - timing doesn't matter, so any time of day makes the same difference.Sound familiar huh? hahaoh, okay; knock yourself out then if you're having fun, but don't stress yourself out about it was what i meant (and it sound like you're not, so great).Do you just mix it with water? What specific product do you use? This? http://www.metawellness.com/en-us/products/fiber-powders#Look up Dave Tate's videos on Youtube.  Fixing your form will make a difference.Yes that is where it is. I'll have her do this next time we squat.Being a tool in the gym!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness) if you have any questions or concerns.*Hey, don't worry about it much. I had that misconception too at some point in time. Keep asking questions. The worst that can happen is you'll get answers. (: All of our journeys start somewhere.1. post a video.

2. stop with the cut/bulk bullshit.

3. I'm always amazed at how many people stick mindlessly to a fucking program as if just following a guide some dude on the internet posted is going to change them into zyzz. Just fucking stop it, assess where your weaknesses are and work on them.

I had to look up [Phrak's GSLP](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OUcEY.png) because I've no idea what it is. It looks like it was designed by a moron. There's no dumbbell work, no incline and too much recurring exercise. OHP plus bench 3 days in a row? WTF? Just stop doing it - it's shit.Not really, if you are on a dirty bulk and are fairly good at tracking weight/calories/etc you can find a medium that will allow you to add cardio and strength training.

I do both to maintain my endurance while getting stronger but you have to eat a lot more to maintain/bulk.

However cardio is not a magic "fat only" type of exercise, it just can help you reduce excess calories you go over. While also having other benefits.The act of looking straight ahead at yourself in the mirror in the middle of a lift will change how your neck/head is positioned, and consequentially alter your spine position and throw off your form. Your coach is right. Have you been sleeping 8hrs a night? I've heard about a study where two groups who were both eating at a deficit, one sleeping 8hrs and one getting like 6 per night. The group that had less sleep ended up losing more muscle and keeping fat, while the group with more sleep lost fat much more easily and held on to their muscle. The reason I ask is that when I went through a period with depression and anxiety my sleep suffered. Incidentally inadequate sleep is a big risk factor for depression and anxiety as well. Sleep can go unnoticed sometimes, but I would check that first if you're ever confused about why you're not getting results.
Long winded, I know, but it's what I would look into.i bet you can. Look around, right now small warehouse gyms are becoming popular and there's a spot in my town where the whole block is different types of warehouse gyms. MMA, Crossfit, etc. Look around. Alot of places have a really cool family feel to them too. Plus the whole underground, not shiny polished franchise gym, makes you feel a little more badassAthletic trainer here. Find a physical therapist who specializes in sports rehabilitation. If you're legitimately concerned about your health you go to the doctor, this is no different. A physical therapist will be much more likely to find and help correct muscle imbalances and deficiencies. A physical therapist telling you to stop an activity isn't a death sentence either. Take their advice and consider why they might be giving it, and form your own opinion. The police aren't going to show up and arrest you if you decided to squat after they tell you not to.
Stopped by to say to be careful when having your phone in the sauna.

I love baking in the sauna after a workout but I've noticed that my phone battery life has diminished.  I believe it has something to do with the sauna heat.

Ipod shuffles can be gotten for cheap.  Definitely not a hip pop, more like a shift.Add HIIT or metabolic resistance training, or sprints, etc. They  will help you partition calories towards muscle instead of fat.  Conventional cardio doesn't really help keep the fat down. All it does is cost you calories. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdVCfDioTcY

Arnold wasn't lieing.wasted.gifIt's a powder and it is around 4 grams a teaspoon. I have it three times a day. The vast majority of the fiber I eat is from food. If you download "Daily Yoga" for free on either the iOS or Android app store, they have this stretch and many others specifically on a 10/15/20 minute back yoga routine.

I injured my lower back doing stupid leg presses with my lower back rounded back in freshman year of high school. Now it chronically hurts but 10 minutes of that yoga routine alleviates pain for a couple of days usually.Dang man, I have shoulder problems and have watched many videos... How have I not seen any of those?! Thanks very much! Makes sense I was just second guessing myself hahaThanks!It is nice. That is why I hate youBar can vary in weight so it's important to not only add the weight to your total, but to know how much your bar weighs as well.There's nothing wrong with it, and I do it occasionally. However, as a recovering skelly, I find it easier to get down the calories I need for my bulk if I just throw the yogurt in a blender with some milk, whey, PB, and fruit. Its just a matter of personal preference.Well obviously if one dude is 6 '200 he is going to be bigger than a guy who is 5'7 160, even if the little guy can bench a lot. But of two dudes of more or less the same size the significantly stronger one will look better.I do this. I'm sure others do as well. I use ON chocolate whey and to me, it tastes almost like a mousse.  You still have some beginner gains to make on bench press, so a cut shouldn't effect to TOO much. This is a heavily debated topic, so I don't want this to be the focus of the response. Assuming you're going to for 3x5 BP if you miss 3 reps during the workout, then you need to repeat the weight. If you miss one or two reps, I chalk it up to an off day, and I'll still up weight for next session. If you repeat the weight 3 times, it's three strikes and your out, deload 10% on your next workout and progress. Sounds like you've hit the wall and need to deload.

A deload is NOT A SIGN OF FAILURE, it's a sign YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT!

Form could be part of it, but from my experience I've had to deload more on my BP and OHP then my other lifts, it's normal.I think I tried that once but isn't it like 6 pills for a tiny bit of fiber? How many do you take?Here I am thinking it's a nice place :( Yes.
Thank you for the info! I am looking at these changes as a lifelong goal so I'm hoping I don't reach that point. I also do yoga now and it seems like that's one of those things that you can always keep challenging yourself. Thanks for the insight though, I definitely need to keep this in mind.Ya new shoes are on the shopping list. Thanks!I swear this isn't perception. I've compared my head and body with my family and friends and it looks smaller than all of them I matched with. I even asked a friend whether he thought my head was small or not, and he said yes.Yeah buts it's natural sugar, 100 percent juice no sugar added is far
More healthy than coke Thanks for the encouragement. Hopefully as the weight increases I can keep this form. I've never heard of buttwink before I will look it up. did you lift it? then it counts towards the weightI don't understand how you can't see the real issue is "how can I get more work done in less time"?  Time is the only asset we all have.  Some people want to spend as little time as possible on the journey so they can get to the destination.  It is going to be very difficult to "prescribe" a diet for you because of the many factors that should be considered regarding your overall health. You may find more success with someone local who can speak with you about nutrition and fitness. Try speaking with your schools wrestling coach or talk with your parents about your concerns. Maybe they can get you to a local nutritionist. Yes, always include it. You are lifting it anyway lolYou're eating more calories than you think you are (or drinking them).  Actually track the calories you are eating - try to eat 500 below your TDEE and watch the scale.  If you lose roughly a pound a week, great.  If you lose less, eat a bit less.  If you lose more, eat a bit more. Keep at it and you'll get there.I know this is semantics but instead of "cutting calories" I would say "increasing caloric deficit".  It's possible to increase calories and still lose fat in you increase the amount of calories you burn by more than you increase what you consume.Include the weight of the bar.&gt;Improving diet means getting adequate protein and fats and matching carbs to activity. It also means eliminating junk food and increasing nutritious foods.

That's all you really need to know.  Junk food is anything you find at the corner store or at a fast food restaurant.  Nutritious food is vegetables and fruit and protein foods like unprocessed meat, poultry, eggs, fish and dairy.  Nice congrats and thanks!! I'm hoping to be at your point in a year or two, thanks for the encouragement!!Thanks, I will incorporate a neutral head position and adjust the bar position during me next deadlift set. Deadlifts was just an example. The point is to mix it up! Try new exercises whilst keeping the core (bench, OHP, squat etc.) exercises involved The calculator is an estimate anyway. You know what the best way to figure out your 1 rm is? Do a 1 rm.that wasnt a personal story.  it was a question, the answer to which would help me reach me personal goal.

Like to you do hamstring stretches in between squat sets?Me too, adding 10 lbs every 4 days (according to stronglifts) should get me to challenging weights in 2 weeks. The thing is, stretching is only a temporary relief.  Your back is tight for a reason.  Muscles restrict themselves as a protective measure.  There is something else in your biomechanics that is causing the issue that this stretch will not solve.

Solve the underlying issue and you won't need to do the stretch.I think it depends on how serious your injuries are. I'm sure a trainer can help you out with some tennis elbow, but if your kneecap is not tracking properly, a physical therapist would be the place to go to get a set of exercises to supplement what you already do to help with the problem.

I would suggest trying to find a physical therapist that understands your goals. Some places are more suited for an older crowd making sure that they can accomplish basic function. Other places are better for athletes and people with lofty workout goals.It's what is in most fiber supplements. I get the store-brand equivalent of unsweetened Metamucil.

I've tried but I really hate taking pics of myself. You're right though, people i haven't seen in a while have commented the most.

I know it's a slow process but I expected to be at this point six months from now! That being said, these changes to my diet and physical actovoty have become a life long goal for me now. It feels so good, why didn't I start sooner?This is actually just half moon pose from yoga but with a bandI pay $190 for Equinox and i can't even go to the nearest gym because its a sports version which requires me to upgrade to the $250/m plan.   I never have to wait for equipment is the nice thing, i couldn't deal with 24 hour fitness crowd and fighting over equipment.other than the bench press, no :/I've never been to a physio who told me I had to stop working out entirely.  Far from it, I've been given a raft of corrective exercises to do, some recommended every day.

Not all trainers have a physical therapy background, but there are many physical therapists who also have a training background (I go to a specific sports physio practice, and they've never steered me wrong).

Go to a trainer if you want form correction, but go to a physical therapist if you have an ongoing injury that may need corrective work to fix.Metamucil.Any internet resources you can recommend to get a stiff beginner started?

&gt;I am bodybuilding and a distance runner

And props to diversifying and not being a stereotypeThis thread is great, thanks for sharing!I agree with you coach. never look in the mirror when doing a big compound movement (squat, deadlift, Olympic lifts, etc.) you have enough to worry about. Videoing your lifts and looking back at them is much better.Ok! Hey can you suggest a diet plan for me? I am completely in the dark about 'eating healthy' and wanted to know what I should eat in a day. Yep, there's some 1000mg capsules on the market that comes with only 300mg of epa and dha combined, hence to get the recommended dose of 2-3g you would need to swallow at least 7 caps. Avoid theseWhere do you get psyllium husk?Really like the idea of trying to find someone who has the same history as myself. Thanks!Depending on my work schedule, but i'm the same, I prefer to be at the gym when there are less people so anytime between 6-9pm or work hours.

I just like a calm atmosphere in the gym, where I can finish my sets on a machine without someone waiting.
So right now my heavy lifts like deadlifts (I've switched sumo and romanian because I have chicken legs) , squats, bench go something like this (squats as example): 5 x 95, 5 x 135, 5 x 155, 5 x 175, 5 x 185, 1 x 205, 1 x 215, 1 x 215, 1 x 225, 1 x 225, 1 x 215, 2 x 205, 7 x 135.
Trying to mix strength and hypertrophy. How does that look to you? (225 is my 1 rep max so far)This submission has been removed.

But i do believe adding cardio might help. Not sure
Still a noob tbh
Depends if you care if you experience effects sooner or not.  It's not necessary, but I always do it.  It's cheap as hell anyway.There's a number of core exercises that require you to extend your shoulders/arms, a few you named.  All with different purposes.

If you're feeling only your shoulders and lower back being worked while doing the ab wheel you're doing it completely wrong.And he can't say he just has great genetics because he included pics of himself from before he started.

I'm not talking shit because he looks great but let's call it what it is and not kid each other.This. Don't just go to the gym and get on some machines, or do some combination of sets and reps that feel right or that a friend told you to do. Read the wiki on this subreddit, choose a beginner program that you feel comfortable with, and start counting calories and nutrient intake. You can't grow if your body doesn't get what it needs to build muscle. A lot of people neglect the eating part of working out, thinking that it's too much work or that it probably doesn't make that much of a difference. It really does. And think of it this way; if you're going to spend 6 hours a week in the gym, wouldn't you rather put in a little more effort outside of the gym as well to make sure you're actually seeing results?Umm... sorry for asking then :/ I guess you were born with all those knowledge, good for you, then!Sounds like "a load of bull," Only supplement that I would recommend relating to ATP is like /u/ssasnakebite mentioned, Creatine.Hey.  Any advice regarding this...?  I've been working out five to six  times per week for never less than an hour, lifting weights and doing cardio.  Due to depression and anxiety I haven't been eating much at all for the past two months.  Food made me want to barf.
 I started working out around the time when I stopped eating regularly.  I've only lost 7 pounds in those two months,  from 195 to 187. Any advice is appreciated,  please and thank you.Right but that still doesn't explain why you would wanna put it on hold as opposed to starting it when you are backJogging doesn't build muscle, it builds endurance.  High volume of sprints, squats, deadlifts and other strength training exercises build muscle.  You should maintain the strength and speed aspects of your fitness.  Test your strength periodically without a lot of volume, correct it if you see a decline in strength.  Test your speed and correct if that declines.  Put most effort into jogging and longer distance running.   Notice that I use the word "maintain".  That is a much different word than "build".Take monohydrate.  Cheap, effective, readily available.  Yes it retains water but it's intramuscular not subcutaneous AKA it will just make your muscles look slightly bigger.  You probably won't even notice.lol best part was he said they were new books, not books he's readNo. It doesn't work like that unfortunately. You either gain fat and muscle or you lose fat and muscle depending on how many calories you consume. If you're trying to bulk then adding cardio will just make it so you have to eat more for your gains.Maybe it's just me but I feel like grip is the limiting factor for me on this exercise. I typically do overhead or tricep pushdowns with cables, but I've maxed the machine at my gym so I am experimenting with single arm stuff. Tried this last night and found my grip lacking at the bottom of the movement.&gt; Nike Football Combine

I guarantee that if you ask anybody who's gone from a 300 pound max to a 700 pound max over time, they will say the lifts feel qualitatively different. I never started exploding blood vessels in my face until I could deadlift over 500.So this exercise is good for pain in the lower back. What part of the back? What causes it? How does this help? Just straight to the exercise without even knowing if it is the area you need help with.
Good luck with that.I'm thinking about taking a multivitamin every day in addition to a protein shake to help get the right macros and micros in my diet. How do I figure out which one to take? I've never been vitamin shopping before. Post form video.

Just knowing and applying the basics of powerlifting bench press should easily give a beginner an additional 25~35 lbs. Leg drive, arched back, leverage, etc.If youre having lower back pain, foam roll your quads/hip flexors.
I guarantee itll fix it.It can be taken whenever you want. You should have 3.5-5g everyday though. I like to use it pre-workout as the tingles give a sort of placebo effect like you can feel it working. On rest days I just have it whenever I have my creatine.Enter 5 reps for whatever weight.  That's the most reps you've actually done, so at least the calculator (which isn't going to be 100% correct necessarily) is based on real figures.

To get a more accurate picture, you would need to actually try for a one rep max, or a 2 or 3 rep max.  The lower the better.  Calculators get weird once you have too many reps.

Thanks for your detailed response! Squatting low with with good form will stretch the ligaments much faster than foam rolling, yoga or anything else. Popeyes sells Progressive products so yes they are going to recommend it.

There are a ton of similar multivitamin products out there.  Compare ingredients, pick the one with the best stats and the cheapest price (which won't be at Popeye's by the way, go to a pharmacy of grocery store).Hi! I used to be a front desk girl at LA, did you freeze your account? There shouldn't be any "forms" to freeze an account its an instant button we click so I'm a little confused why it wouldn't have been frozen right that second. Sometimes I know if you come in right after the billing date it will still bill the full amount for that month but after that it would be frozen for the 10/month. Have you spoken to the branch manager? If you get no where with the branch manager there are several managers above him/her. Is the pinching in front, kinda right in the crease?  If so, it might be impingement from the femur being pulled inwards into the side of the hip socket.

Have her drop into a squat, slowly, keeping her glutes as flexed and tight as she can for the descent, and see if it still feels as tight / hurts.  Or, have her drop into a squat position, and then flex/squeeze her glutes really hard, and see if the tightness eases.

If either or both of those help, it might be tight hip flexors OR poor glute activation (or likely, both).  When the glutes fire, the hip flexors will relax.  Also, the glutes attach at the side of the femur and pull it away from the center of the body - without this counteracting force, the hip flexors can pull the femer into the side of the hip and cause irritation.

I fought this battle myself for a long time, after ignoring tightness, which became pain, which became a torn labrum.

See if engaging the glutes more helps.Luckily we're talking about the consumer using BBB, the OP isn't a business so it doesn't matter what BBB's relationship is with businesses. BBB is useful to consumers, I'd encourage OP to use them if needed. I've successfully used the BBB to get money back from a company that had told me they couldn't help me, but suddenly when the BBB gets involved they go out of their way to find the necessary paperwork that showed that they owed me money, and sent me a check.Find a trainer with your same goals or history.  When I wanted to trim down fat but build muscle I asked around until I found a trainer that had the same history as myself (out of shape skinny fat).  Once my physical therapist from a knee surgery I had told me I needed to not squat blah blah. I found one that understood and I got back to where I was and stronger than I was eventually. I'd rather have injuries and set backs lifting than I would die from being a lazy fat ass.  At least when lifting I get to die doing what makes me happy.  I'm still pretty new to all this, although I have been working out for about 6 months now. I have been taking no supplements. Everyone seems to be using protein powder, my only concern is that I will gain weight from it when my objective is mainly to get thin and fit. Should I be taking supplements? Which?fuck zanderMy initial observations would be that your bench and deadlift are both a bit behind your other lifts.

According to the ExRx.net Strength Standards, you should be above Intermediate level on Squat &amp; OHP.  May be slightly above Intermediate on Deadlift, and not quite to Intermediate yet on bench.

My bench stalls out all the time, while I progress on other lifts more regularly.  Don't get too discouraged.Everyone in this thread needs to read and understand this.  The industry will have you think otherwise because they want your money.  Your routine and diet contribute to 90+% of it.  Supplements are... supplements by definition.He's just big boned. Yes, I got it. And I also got it I spelled it wrong. English isn't my first language. Also I am on a diet and I didn't ask how to lose weight.I can't tell you what the issue is, but I think I can tell you that it's probably not (just) your wingspan. I've got a +3 ape index (6'5" with a 6'8" wingspan) and my bench press is 5x5x190 lbs, which is actually higher than my squat (I have weak legs - working on it). I'm not saying it's not harder with a larger wing span, because it is, but I don't think just that would account for the large difference in numbers that you're able to put up. By foam rolling your it bands/abductors. They both are hooked into your knee. In my case my it band is tight and it pulls my kneecap towards the outside of my knee. Very painful after a day of heavy squats.

Also a lacrosse ball on your glutes/quads helps to loosen them up. All of those and the hams act on your knee. There is a lot of muscles pulling them. I like it. I sleep great when I have it although dreams can get pretty crazy sometimes.That's why people recommend filming yourself and reviewing/have someone else review it afterwardsI love you for this. Thank you. I mean you can always try doing cable curls and following the same drop set protocol.Idk about *blatantly* wrong, but I know there's a definite difference between my first and last set.

After 3x5 of 155 and 1x5 set of 160 on bench Saturday, I barely made my last set of 160, but I know if it had been the first set I could have at least gotten 160x8.

I don't use a 1RM calculator for any real use other than to see what strengthstandards thinks, but I think it's reasonable to believe that if you are struggling to get up the last set of 5 in 5x5, then that weight is probably about your 8RM.

Totally anecdotal though, so it could be completely different for others.I agree, even the highest level "manager" or whatever at the LA Fitness I used to go to had no power to do anything regarding membership that you can't do in your own home.  All they could do is fill out the forms and make requests, the same way you would through the website/phone number.I'd go for the second one. Plate loaded is much better than a stack IMO. Means you can at least alter the weight steps in smaller denominations if needed rather than restricted to the jumps that each stack plate adds. Been in CS in many a jobs, can confirm.change your diet and habits slowly. dont try to make radical changes that never works long term. obviously being active is important, but diet is much as important to how you look. id say for me avoiding sugary drinks was a good starting point. then trying to start your day off with a good filling breakfast and slowly change the rest of your diet over time This submission has been removed.

Also, I hate the way you write.

I think it's infantile to suggest, as the mod did, that roids do not produce a visibly different muscle formation, or that it was rude to ask in a sub so heavy with roid users. It does explain, however, how so many people in this sub are so angry and insistent about heavy lifting being the only or quickest or best way to a good physical form. Roids make you stupid and crazyDoes anyone take any natural supplements for heart health? I just recently freaked out my doctors with a 100BPM resting heart rate as a 5'6" 114 pound female with no previous conditions. I exercise and I feel like I'm going to stroke while doing cardio. I've cut out stimulants and quit smoking. I currently only take a multivitamin, fish oil, and Vitamin D. Improve your fitness and the quality of your diet and the paunch will take care of itself.

Improving fitness means becoming stronger, faster and improving endurance.  The wiki has programs.

Improving diet means getting adequate protein and fats and matching carbs to activity.  It also means eliminating junk food and increasing nutritious foods.  In most cases this will cause a decrease in calorie intake as evident in weight loss. If not, you'll have to pay attention to this.

It's also important to get adequate sleep and manage your stress. It really depends on your situation. If you have chronic issues, then I would seek the help of a physical therapist or you regular doctor. It would probably be best to start with a trainer. I would explain your goals and go from there. Use your best judgement. If the guy has you balancing a 135lbs on you head while hurling medicine balls at you claiming it is the new thing to build your glutes, then I would move on. I know a couple of people that passed a test and claim to be trainers now. I dont recommend tgem. Usually you can tell the good trainers from the bad. If after seeing a good trainer and you still have issue talk to a physical therapist or your doctor, maybe there is another issue at hand. Protein, multivitamin, vitamin D, creatineNOW Foods do a good Vit K supplement I've used. Wherever you get it, you want Vit K2 and Vitamin D3, the other kinds are less effective. I'm not too sure on the specifics of fish oil.[If you read the FAQ, you should've read this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_fixing_your_diet). That's all you need for fat loss.

That said, you also might have poor posture. But having bad form isn't a good thing too.I could see that being true.

I guess if you're not trying to break records and just working on your form it should be alright. Yeah I do this too. Particularly when I'm doing power cleans. That said, my power clean form still sucks, so I can't exactly vouch for this method.Middle of the night. No waiting. I feel like the gym is humid from people moisture when its crowded. yghEat less.

The FAQ applies to you also.Really? Typically in my case the most one RM calcs are at least 10 - 15lb lower than my max. This anecdotal but that has always been the case for me.

Yeah. I mean she's one of my good friends but yeah.I think you've received a lot of good answers already. One thing I always notice is that the weight isn't very challenging for you (as you said). I would be interested to see your form when you are up to a more challenging weight, as that is when it will start to degrade. I'm 17 this year and just recently got my protein powder. Its 21grams per scoop and the salesperson advices me to take only half a scoop until I reach 18 years old. My parents was also there during that time and now they don't allow me to take more than half a scoop because they're afraid it'll be unhealthy to my body. Do i continue half a scoop or go a full scoop?Sounds like you're on the right track to get adrenal fatigue. Lay off the stimulants a bit!How many times a week have you been doing it? I know I am. I scrutinize things in my day job so it's in my nature to track down anomalies and outliers in the data. It makes it fun as well, in a weird science geek sort of way; mathematically calculating your weight loss progression based on daily calorie deficits and exercise expenditures.

Well, maybe not fun for everyone, but it gives my mind something to do.I hope you get it worked out. I used to work in a gym, not a chain. It was part if a sports complex and out policy on freezes like many other things was very lax. On paper there was a fee to freeze and only once per year but noone ever paid and froze multiple times a year. I remember seeing people have the same membership over a period of years. The only real way to make sure an account was frozen was a signed agreement that and only we had a copy. So if it was lost and you don't ask for one it may never have happened. Always get paper confirmation.Awesome. I'm currently taking an MV that gives me 800 IBU. Thanks for the info!He's referring to Fork Putdowns, an oft overlooked exercise considering its extremely high rate of success for weight loss goalsI wish my issue was that I couldn't eat enough.

Just seems so easy to fix.

Edit: damn you auto correctGenerally, with regards to contracts of all kinds, if it isn't in writing, it don't meant shit.It takes more than 2 weeks. Try doing it for 6 months [Here is the even more detail on what Nate Green did.](http://www.biggersmallerbigger.com/)

Aaaa! Hahahaha! Yeah, that's fair :DSearch for "inner thigh" on youtube and you'll see hundreds of "fitness professionals" telling you how to get slimmer inner thighs. That's how.

Fucking humanity am I right? It's a freak show."This easy thing isn't easy enough"

I don't understand that.Have you ever used BBB? I have as a consumer and they got the business to give my money back, when previously they acted like there was nothing they could do, so it can work for consumers. You don't pay a fee or risk anything by using BBB, I don't get the hate.Thanks man!She'll either say yes or no.

If she says, yes, yay! Date!

If she says no, it's not even really a loss. Just a continuation of your previous dateless state. So, technically, you have nothing to lose but everything to possibly gain. :)The tingling sensation is nothing to do with its effects on performance. You should be taking around 5g each day on both rest days and workout days. It doesn't matter if it's Pre-workout or any other time in the day. Most people take it alongside Creatine. Also, I probably wouldn't bother with using much supplements at 16. Get the basics sorted first.Thanks! I appreciate your words of encouragement!

I can't understand the LA Fitness business model, however... we ALL want gyms, we will gladly pay for them, but by doing this they are actively getting me, a PAYING customer to STOP paying.He doesn't mean lunches specifically. He means food. Can you elaborate on this?

I stopped using pre workout when I was getting caffeine headaches. If was terrible to stop taking it for a couple days. (Might have been a bad product. No it wasn't jack3d)

All I drink right now is a crystal light energy pack and a ton of water while working out. Omg thank you for not including the sleeper stretch.

Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GHIRD) is a topic of hot debate. Posterior capsule tightness and "tight" internal rotators are often the diagnosed case. It is often the case, however, that GHIRD arises from core instability / breathing dysfunction.

Did an assessment on a friend and improved her glenohumeral internal rotation shoulder by ~20^o just by having her work on some anterior core stability with band assisted leg lowers.

Top notch post, but I would recommend doing shoulder dislocations with a band while lying on your stomach. Reason being that it helps prevent compensatory movement from your ribs flaring (i.e., creating "unstable" and "false" ROM from disassociation of the rib cage from the pelvis).

Also, tissue quality and ROM through extension/rotation throughout the t-spine is important for healthy rotator cuffs.This submission has been removed.

It was a dumb way of saying it that it sounded as though cardio doesn't help. People argue that even though you're using it to check your form, if you're using a mirror mid lift then you have some element of distraction.

If they help you keep good form then i don't see how it would be an issue. Dude thanks for this. Looked up creatine and 50 servings 7 bucks.You WILL get your money back -


Management WILL fight you, but they know their employees are motivated to take advantage of the members and keep the money rolling in. Behind the scenes they know they are in the wrong, and they will capitulate. Just keep the pressure on and keep escalating.


My Story -

A couple years back I was in town for 3 weeks to sing a Christmas concert and work from my main branch. It was like $10 a day to work out, or I could sing up for a month and cancel and just pay the monthly rate of $20 for the one month. I coordinated with the person who enrolled me to cancel immediately and submit the letter, yada-yada. So I am canceled right away and only have the one month. That was what I was told.


18 months later my wife finally asks me about the LA Fitness charges. She had assumed I was just hitting up LA Fitnesses while I traveled for work, but it was now way past any significant travel. Surprise! I want's canceled. The membership notices were getting mixed up in my emails, etc.


Took about 2 days to get them to refund 50% of the premiums I had paid. After all it was partially my fault for not noticing sooner.


You will get your money back.


OP shouldn't accept 50%. OP noticed right away and should get 100% back.I've had two shoulder surgeries: a bankart and a latarjet. Thankfully no rotator damage at allSummarizing some stuff

Eggs (cheap, easy, versatile, very bioavailable protein)

Extra lean ground turkey (high protein, versatile)

Milk (vitamins, whey protein)

Greek Yogurt (probiotics, high protein, works well with protein powder or fruit, cheap)

Berries (natural sugars, antioxidants, mixes well with yogurt, smoothies)

Tilapia fish (super lean protein source, cheap, easy)

Boneless skinless chicken tenderloins (cheap, lean protein, cook them all at the same time)

Sweet potatoes (good carb source, long extended energy)

Salsa (great condiment, works well with many recipes like chicken or egg whites)

Peanut butter (lots of healthy fats)

Brown rice (extended energy)

Black beans (goes well with stuff like rice, meats, good source of fiber)

Garbanzo beans (goes well with salads, good source of fiber)

Coffee (wakes you up, natural thermogenic, helps burn some calories)

Green tea (little lower in caffeine, also a thermogenic, lots of good antioxidants)

Old fashioned oats (energy, makes a good oatmeal)

Stevia in the raw (good replacement for sugar)

Tuna (lean proteins, cheap, but be careful of sodium)

Broccoli (high fiber)

Non-stick cooking spray (essential for cooking stuff)

Cooking stuff all at once helps ensure you always have stuff available so you don't risk running to the convenience store for snacks.Dunno about that specific one, but you should to research to find a max weight for any bench before you get it. And don't forget to include your body weight.

My incline bench is good for 375 pounds. That sounds like a lot, until; you add in my weight 200 and benching 250+.  I have it braces with 4x4s and I lift inside a rack with safety bars.

It's rare, but people have died from dropping the weight on their chest.There is indeed one in therePersonally I prefer just filming the set and then review after.OK, and the next step? What to do to build muscle? Just general workout? Swimming? Or I have to hit the gym and use some crazy machines which are mystery to me? :PIts a video he posted for getting a certain number of subs. Its crazyhttp://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/04/25/do-a-pull-up/Protein powder, multivitamin, fish oil, maybe creatineWhat's your point? This doesn't prove he is underweight. All it suggests is that if OP puts on 40 pounds of lean muscle he'll be an outlier on the BMI chart. He's a very long way from that. I stand by my original statement. OP is at a healthy weight and the statement that "his body wants him to be at 210" is misleading at best.Prefer a mirror for squat, deadlift, and press.

Will go without though with no problem.You shouldn't use a mirror when you are in the middle of a lift. 1) Watch videos. Instructional videos are good and also just people doing big squats. Note their form, cues suggested, etc.

2) Film yourself. Compare your form to those from step 1. Try to identify your errors and how you can adjust them.

3) Stretch. Stretch. Stretch. You probably have some mobility issues.

4)...

5) Profit!OK. Thanks!So not the ratio of EPA to DHA, but the ratio of fish oil to each of those?I know exactly what you went through. I also did a trial for their personal training &amp; went maybe 3 times &amp; they told me that I had 21 days to finalize if I wanted to do PT for a year long contract. Day 13, I called saying I would like to cancel my personal training contract, they gave me an "okay, I'll do that for you" and hung up.
Monthly billing came a week later &amp; I'm charged for personal training. I went to the gym itself &amp; asked them why I was billed. They told me that I had signed up for a year long contract, but since I was only going a certain number of days, I only had 14 days to cancel. I told them I was told I had 21 days to cancel. They show me the contract I signed. I was fucking lied to.
So what I did, I tried to go to the gym to try to talk to the person that signed me up for the sessions. He kept avoiding me. So I filed a complaint to BBB and contacted their district manager. She called back telling me about the complaint from BBB &amp; reduced my termination fee to 1/4 of what I would've paid for a year.
It's good enough when I just want to be done with the company. It's a three minute video dude...I think you've .gif'd your brain to death. :POh right, so I'll just keep it up and be patient :)It's really interesting the gyms in China are basically exactly the same as they are here in America. A bunch of lazy people and creeps taking creepshots.Dude don't put your creatine in Orange juice - the acidity will degrade that shizz so fastFrom Candito..?  Ill have to look it up.30/F/5'7'

I went from 265-215 then did I did a powerlifting program combined with bodybuilding days for about a year, went down to 191. From September to Dec of 2014, I went down to 150 (41 pounds in 4 months) by doing a protein fast and I lost barely any muscle. My lifts stayed the same, I even went up in bench and did 135 for about 3 reps where before it was my 1RM. I went from 40+% bf to 26% BF. I ate nothing much but lean protein -160g of it a day or more - 800 cals for 4 months. I took an EC stack, kept my programming the same. I lifted with the same intensity and almost the same volume on most days. Accessories maybe went form 4x12 to 3x8-10, but other than that, I kept my workouts constant. I carb loaded every 10 days as well when I got down in bodyfat. I also continued IF during this process.

It's all about how you approach your weight loss. Following a combination of Lyle McDonald's research, Leangains protocols and Layne Norton/Alan Aragorn's advice as a whole along with supplementation of vitamins and minerals made my aggressive cut quite muscle sparring.His looks like a 4" ABS pipe at about a 5ft length..  Lowes and depot sells them for about $10.OK. But why less lunches?

http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view&amp;alt=web&amp;id=111137015311

It looks a bit flimsy is all I am worried about.Yep!Form is fine:

* Straight back, good hip position, decent speed

Technique is bad: Listed in order of importance

**Shoulders are over the bar:**

* Bad leverage. You can't utilize your weight to sit back and push off the floor. If leverage is utilized correctly, your weight can be deducted from the bar (I.e. you weigh 100lbs and you're pulling 225. With proper leverage technique, you're only *really* pulling 125lbs)

**Pulling slack from the bar:**

* Correlated to your first problem, when you sit back you can pull the slack from the bar making the lift much easier. Failing to do so results in a 1-2, stop and go, pull off the ground instead of a smooth single pull.

**Speed:**

* Something you should consistently work on with your form. Every single pull should be the fastest from off-the-ground to lockout. This doesn't mean rushing. Speed is only concerning when you are pulling, not your set up.

**Head position:**

* This is more of personal preference, but you should experiment with a neutral head (looking diagonally down instead of straight ahead). Might take some strain off your neck.

Other thoughts: Seems like you're bracing your back quite well. You always want to maintain tightness in all 3 lifts. Continue to do that and fix your technique and you'll become a stronger puller.

Edit:

**Future Problems:**

The way you lift right now is okay since, as you've said, the weight is light. The heavier you go, the more your back will have to compensate. Your legs will drive too quickly practically depending solely on your lower back.

Don't get too scared, everyone has bad technique/form in the beginning. Learn from your errors and constantly analyze your form. The more conscious thought you put into it, the better (more refined) it will become. There is a difference between fundamentals and preferences. You still need to build the base of your deadlift. Once you know what you're doing, you can begin to tweak and try new things.

Study, practice, study, practice, study, practice...
Thanks! See, that's why I asked here :) Because in shitty ladies magazine there is tones of workouts for losing fat from every body part, including fat behind ears... :PIt sounds like you don't want to just want to make them slimmer, it sounds like you're also looking to build muscle.

The first step is to eat less to make them slimmer.

Fat reduction cannot be targeted. After I put my powder in the shaker, I add half the amount of water I need and shake it, I then add the rest and shake again.

That seems to do the job for me, I was having the same problem as you with a protein powder recently but using the above method has fixed it.As someone who lifted weights for 12 years and has worked as a mover for an additional 7 after that, I can say that you need to take care of yourself. My right shoulder feels like it is full of broken glass when I move it, not so much a sharp pain but a crunching, like there is a bag of marbles in there. Lifting my arm above shoulder height will induce pain. Not a good feeling. The 100 nuggets/100,000 lbs of squats video might be the most impressive weightlifting task I've ever seenTo clarify: You want to blindly replicate a movement with no explanation?Lower cals 500 below your TDEE and lift hard. Also, Blaha says to rest for 3 mins for the main lifts, about 2 for accesories. 30 secs is fine at the beggining, but make sure to up the rest time as you progress! I assume this is his ICF 5x5 (Ice Cream Fitness). Other than that keep focused and ENJOY the progress, cause trust me, youll see it soon enough! And yes, the workout will minimize muscle loss and give you a solid base once you lean down (Id say thats beneficial).
Cheers!So its basicly [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1iy610/dont_be_this_asshole_xpost_from_rrage/)? When did this become ok?&gt;EVERYONE wants to be juicy.

-SteroidBob&gt;I eat over recommended calorie levels every day

Eat moar

Treat eating like a job.

First eat. The eat some more. And when you're done, eat.I had this problem when I started working out. I was 20 at the time (25 now) and I weighed 118 lbs. (5' 9" Male) I could barely lift any weight at all and was always embarrassed. I would even get so intimidated that I would cut my workout short because there were just too many ripped dudes that day. One day I got fed up and decided that reaching my goal and getting into shape was far more important to me than worrying about what everyone at the gym thought of me. So I put in my headphones, never made eye contact with anyone, and just pretended I was the only one in the gym. If I screwed up or did something stupid, so what? These people don't know me and chances are I won't ever see them outside of the gym. One time I busted a loud fart while I was doing cable crunches. I know everyone heard it. Who gives a shit it's just protein! Turned up my headphones and just pretended it never happened.

**TLDR** Stick with it. Once you get over the mental part and just realize what is most important to you then before you know it you will be one of those people that the newbies are intimidated by. Because I'm subscribed to some fitness accounts on YouTube, all during January I kept getting unskippable ads from Chang and some other dude dressed like a 300 Spartan (both promising to give me a 6-pack without having to work) whenever I watched YouTube on my phone. It was horrible.Keep a log to track your exercises, weights, sets and reps.

Get a beginner routine from the wiki

Get off the machines and start using barbells and dumbbells (depending on the program you choose).

Any decent beginner program is going to have big compound lifts as is core: squat, bench press, dead lift, overhead press, rows, chin ups

Discipline is the key - make it part of your lifestyle, something you HAVE to do, not something you SHOULD do. OK. Thanks! So I guess I should just do what I do - swimming and general workout - and just wait till I drop enough weight that my thighs get slimmer? &gt;Bone spurs from arthritis(?) had cut the muscle until it tore.

thaaaat sounds like fun!  fuckin ouch, manI just started taking GNC brand creatine in pill form in 3.5mg servings. When's the best time to pop them for lifting sessions. Half hour before? Right afterwards? Directions just say before or after.I don't work out on my legs. I just focus on chest, arms, abs, and I jog for 30 minutes. Is it the jogging that creates the large muscles?Only way is to lose weight overall, you can't spot reduce and the body decides what fat comes off first or last.I love you man, no homo. this is what I needed. thanks.Many thanks!Yes, I do that (should probably be more specific in my post), but I'm losing fat mostly from my stomach. Working out with kettlebell has made my arms look much better and I hoped I can achieve the same effect for my thighs...Incline bench builds your upper chest flat bench builds your lower you need to do both. Well you don't need to flat will do both upper and lower just more of the lower I believe and a little bit of upper. Do both though it's just a better way to build your chest You cannotWhat would you guys consider to be the "essential" supplements.1RM calculators are a bit optimistic in general.Burns more than fat.Holy shit, stretching to the side?! **GAME CHANGER**I liked yoga but it was too much of a bother for me to do, so now I just stretch in between every exercise. Pair up a stretch with every different exercise you do and do a good 20-30s each side or 60s if it's bilateral and there is your rest in between each set. Feels amazing. The gym is as much about stretching as it is about lifting for me now. I used to barely be able to touch my shins but now I can get to the floor.Creatine builds up in your system. It doesn't matter when you take it.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis

Tldr: no easy way to accurately measure body fat. Use mirror and scale to measure progress. Lift heavy, eat protein, cut reasonably and you'll minimize muscle loss.Enter whatever reps you did. It may be ever so slightly off, but not enough to matter. There is more inaccuracy from the estimation formula itself.And it's usually the same assholes that call what they're going to show you a miracle.It's definitely fat! I cut calories and I'm losing weight. I just thought I can do something more for my inner thighs in particular.
And I'm not aiming in thigh gap :) I just want this part of my body to be less flabby and soft. wikipedia defintion:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_exercise

old article that focuses on its definition:

http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kelly22.htm

Aside from that, I've seen isometric holds in a lot of different programs while browsing around bodybuilding.com. Isometrics are more common in calisthenics programs than standard gym programs. It was a debit card that I could not check from India - they mistakenly put a hold on my internet account. (Plus, I was getting married, so things were pretty chaotic).

Also, where I'm at the gyms are not all that cheap - I don't drive, either.

Though now we are trying to coordinate our lifestyles a little better and go a little further afield.There's a scooper in there somewhere. Put the cap on, shake, open cap, look. repeat until you find scoopI'm 5'10 male and weigh 160 pounds. I don't think I'm too fat for the jeans. I just have large thighs.What about an adjustable bench for both, as well as seated shoulder presses or some such?I do that. But I don't know if it's working, seems pretty easy. I use kettlebell when I lay on my back and on my stomach (as I can put my foot inside the handle). With some additional weight it works better, but I can't do it with kettlebell while on my side. Do you think I should buy some weight that you can wrap around your ankles or wrists for the suggested exercise? Or just do it without any load, just making more repetition?Consider that proper squat form includes getting up from the bottom of the squat. To improve the movement, think of the muscle group working like a rubber band. Once you hit the bottom, "spring" up. It will be more beneficial to improve your core strength and technique if you add "duck walks" to your routine along with proper stretching, rather than sitting at the bottom for an extended period of time. Especially, if you are sitting at the bottom with a weighted bar.  There is nothing wrong with sitting at the bottom for an extended period of time without weights, but consider what the functional purpose of that would be in terms of developing your strength and flexibility. For general purposes, I do not see the benefit.I go with the roller too. It hurts more than before if I use the lacrosse ball. Step 1: chop off leg at knee

Step 2: get in this position

Step 3: ????

Step 4: Yoga!Those muscles are your quads.  Leg press is a machine that will help.  If you want to try free weights, front squats will target your quads. Best if you work up to doing high volume, medium intensity. That's awesome. I'm calling my belly muscular fat from now on.Don't worry about it. Body Fat analyzers (especially the one you posted below) are not accurate to 1%.

The takeaway: you are making great progress.  Keep it up.But he's also resting between each set. The calculators are looking for what is the maximum number of consecutive reps you can do with a given weight. If he's not lifting well below his potential, his work set weights should be right at this point.

If I'm blatantly wrong, though, someone please correct me.Are your plates bumper? It's possible that he was trying to do "deficit" deadlifts by using smaller plates instead of standing on a platform.

Still an asshole obvsI don't work out on my legs. I usually go for  30 min jogs. Will stopping this reduce their size?&gt;I eat over recommended calorie levels every day.

And what are these recommended calorie levels you're referring to?

Because guess what the answer is going to be: eat more.With a slew of gyms costing 25 and under a month, why would anyone pay $50. And do you not check your credit card statements?I feel like yoga doesn't have that appeal of using gym equipment, like in OPs video.  There's some kind of built-in feeling that you're accomplishing something, if you use a tool vs. if you're just using your body. You should check out the [wiki](https://i.imgur.com/NFUMcah.png).&gt; I started gear with around a 1200 total. Looking back, I coulda gone much further as a natural. Strength wasn't my only goal though, so I don't regret it.

This is exactly the crossroads I'm at right now. 1200 total, I know I could be *stronger* but strength isn't my goal at all. I'm just scared shitless of "what if I got caught".&gt; pain in the ass.

heh, heh, literally and figuratively, IT HURTS SO GOOD! Does anyone else tear up when doing this?I googled muscular fat, to see if I could find something, and I came up with absolutely nothingEat and lift. If you are eating and not gaining then you are NOT eating enough. It is NOT rocket science.

Read the FAQ.

Also, I call bullshit on the "I dont want to be ripped". EVERYONE wants to be juicy.I'm doing it. That's the main aim, but I thought I can do something more just to help my thighs get slimmer.Wiki?

FAQ at /r/gainit.You should maintain exercising your legs just to maintain your fitness.  Focus on endurance training instead of strength and size.  Strength train your upperbody and that may even your body out visually.  Losing fat will make the most difference in reducing size.

He just did a video on paused squats.....with like 525lb, or some ungodly amount of weight, kids a beast.This might sound weird, but the thing that did the trick for me when i was having som srs pain in my hip, was my stance when i squatted. Make her jump off a box/bench/ something that has some height and see how wide her stance is when she lands. Use that stance for squatting! I was squatting to wide, now i do a narrow squat with low bar, and my hip problem is soooo much better :) also did 5x5, good luck!

My membership was like $35/month for LA Fitness and they wanted a $150 initial fee. I told them there was no way I was paying that and started walking out, and they eliminated the fee.

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_HAXan1wSQ)That question is way too subjective and has been asked [384 times before] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=best+protein+powder&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

That being said, ON is probably the most recommended brand in this sub. Right after work (4-5pm, typically). On crossfit days I bring clothes to work with me and change at the office. It's a lot harder to talk yourself out of going when you're driving in your gym clothes. I literally drive past my gym on my way home so... not going when I'm dressed for it is pretty much inexcusable. :)

On running days, I change right when I get home and get it done. I pretty much have to in the winter, because it gets dark so early and while I love running at night, there aren't sidewalks on a lot of the streets in my neighborhood and people... well, people don't always pay attention when they're behind the wheel. On weekends, I run around 2-3 in the afternoon after brunch has digested.

When I used to go to an Anytime Fitness I always went around 8-9pm because nobody else was there.

I've tried the morning workout thing, but I am just not myself that early in the morning. I hate it. I feel like I perform better in the afternoon.I went home last year for various reasons. So, I of course cancelled my membership. I wanted to get a lower rate anyway and I wasn't going much. I then received a call from from a sales rep asking me to come back. I told him I wasn't in town and would consider it when I get back. I get back and talk to the same rep and ask about pricing and he quoted me a reasonable price so I told him I would be in as soon I get paid. I went in and talked to him. It was off from the start. I had talked to him at least three times before I got back home but he acted he didn't know me. He proceeded to quote me a higher rate than previously on the phone. I was irritated and left. Fast forward a couple months later to Black Friday. I got a call over the phone from another sales rep and she informed me that I could get a deal if I come in that day. I was already around the area so I stopped in a hour after. I asked for the rep but she was at lunch. So, I talked to someone else that gave me a much higher rate and seem to know nothing about that promotion. I was again upset and left. I wrote a email and called to explain this situation but they only said sorry and justified this by saying that their prices change all the time. I finally get a email a few months that was lower without a initiation fees. If it is muscle, stop exercising and they'll atrophy.

If it is fat, lose weight. (Can't spot reduce).

Can you tell us more as I can't use youtube at the moment.Whatever tastes good to you. Most of your protein should come from your diet. Chicken, beef etc, and if you don't eat enough to meet your daily goal then drink a shake.You cannot make your inner thighs slimmer by just exercising your inner thighs.  You cannot "spot reduce" fat.

If you want your thighs slimmer, you need to cut fat and your calorie intake is the first place to start.  Check out the Wiki (TDEE section)Cold Turkey is always the best way.  I can convince myself to eat anything.  I can't convince myself to buy that thing.Thanks bud! I made the change!Good for you!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTq87JB3YFM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su8g9efk5McYes! Err on the side of caution, get things in Writing, confirmation in e-mail. Don't be a thesuninmyheart! :-/Thanks for the critique, I'll work on it! I got a free container of BCAA powder when I had a big order somewhere, so I gave them a shot.  It was just BCAA, no flavor enhancers or anything.  Tastes like shit (which is to be expected).  I used them before, during, and after workouts.  Saw no difference in anything so I never ordered any.  Some people swear by them, for me they were useless.Three main:

* Fork and spoon put downs
* Plate push-aways
* Stand up walkaways from the tableMuscle and fat are 2 different things. "Muscular fat" isn't. You're likely just too fat for that pair of pants.

You can't choose where to loose fat. You've just got to burn more calories than you take in and your body will burn fat from where it wants to.

You really need to read the wiki. Look for TDEE and eating at a deficit. Everything you need is in the wiki.Thighgap?

No offense, but it is either muscle or fat. You lose muscle by not exercising it and lose fat by cutting calories.

Exercises do not make muscles smaller.
You'd be surprised at how much weight you lose by NOT drinking soda. I avoid that shit like the plague.What I do is lay on my side with one leg crossed over in the direction im facing and lift the leg on the bottom up about 8in and lower it in 20 rep sets on each side.Gotcha.  Apologies for the confusion.Weight is always relative. Imo body fat percentage is what you should look at.They *tried* to screw me over with magic algebra, i.e. misleading price calculations, when I was considering signing up. I walked out and never came back after that.Yeah I agree, I think I'll stick to eating and using whey to bump up my protein intake.1. can't spot reduce fat. You need to lose fat in general and it'll come off from everywhere.

2. What the fuck is muscular fat?

3. You'd have to not use your legs in order to reduce the muscles on them.This right here! I applied for life insurance and was asked my BMI. I have a little extra fat, by no means obese. But because I have lifted for 4 years and been athletic since high school my BMI is 31.5. Had to get an exclusion so they would except body fat percent instead of BMI.XanaxEat lessCurrently a member ,but I surely know I will need to cancel their membership sometime in future.So looking at the comments here, whenever I decide to that ,will send the form via registered Usps post so that there is a record of delivery Yeah... that whole work thing really interferes with my free time.try a 7 rep max for your 5x5Nope. All you can do is eat less and keep exercising. I guess we were lucky, it was never an issue to get him on the hill. We started ours at 3 yrs old in lessons for 60 or 90 minutes (can't remember) then there was an on-site daycare where he got a break to play and color for another hour. We would have lunch or snack ski a few runs together and that was a day. By 5 he was in a full day (9-3) lesson and by 7 in a full day race program. Now at 17 he races full time.

We have to opposite problem to you. With so many days of going to the hill for training and races we are glad to get away from it for a while.But he is not just doing 1x5I got a botched tonsillectomy which resulted in a second surgery which made drinking soda pretty painful for a few months. By the time I could drink it again, I just didn't crave it anymore, so I cut it out. :D To make your inner thighs slimmer, you have to lose weight/fatWorst case, you poop yourself. But that likely won't happen until 2-3, if ever.

Otherwise, it shouldn't have a significant effect on you.Did you burn calories: YES

Was this an effective workout: YES

As a man who was 320 lbs, feel free to message me any questions, but I'll leave a few tips.

1. Replace all drinks that contain calories in them with Water. To make things simple, drink ONLY water, black coffee (slash of milk if you REALLY can't do it), and green tea.
2. Check out / subscribe to /r/loseit
3. ANY workout is better than none.
4. Getting plenty of sleep (shoot for nine hours initially) and good diet is 70% of the battle and lays the foundation to a healthy lifestyle.
5. Set BEHAVIORAL GOALS over Objectionable Goals. Example: The goal "Go to the gym three times a week for thirty minutes for a year," is an GREAT GOAL. "I want to lose 50 pounds in a year," is a TERRIBLE GOAL. While 50 lbs in a year is obtainable, it's an objectionable goal, and you'll find much more success and fulfillment with BEHAVIORAL GOALS! i'm not sure, but it feels like you're overthinking it- just keep your protein levels up, keep lifting, and keep your calories down, and continue the grind.Thanks a lot for our the comments and replies. the reason I cannot accommodate it is because of what FrankRawL wrote. It is very difficult for me to get or schedule at airports or during clients visits. the only way to do will be if when I visit a client, I will completely skip breakfast instead of eating it at 11 AM. However, it is difficult to training a group of people with an empty stomach (9am to 5pm)&gt; I do squats and bends and lunches

Less lunches.  You can't spot reduce fat on just your inner thighs.Blender?Spot reduction is a myth, unfortunately. Exercising your inner thighs will not make them slimmer.Looks like I'm wrong then. I only see the stuff from tnation posted here or r/weightroom so I guess I just see the guest writers.

That's what I get for making assumptions. Regardless, OP don't do this programGood shit... thanksKeep going dude! My goal this year was to drop to a low enough bodyfat where the abs are more evident and defined. Right now im at around 14-15% and i have never felt better.Your 5 rep max is slightly higher than your 5x5 working weightFrom my experience some protein powders dissolve well and others don't want to as much or will even make clumps after being dissolved. I'd find a better protein powder and until you do use a blender and chug it fast.I'm not going to talk out of my ass here because I am not a SME on fish oil. Your best bet is to do some google searches. Just be wary of things that said "1000mg of fish oil!!!!" and have like 100mg of EPA and DHA combined. I think what I have is NOW Fish Oil- it was reasonably priced and had good specs in terms of mercury and EPA and DHA. There are better brands if you want to spend more. Ahh, that's the problem - I don't go to gym, I only exercise at home.Accrued injury. Torn rotator cuff (tendon pulled completely off the humerus) and torn capsule (primarily the GH ligaments). I knew about the rotator but my surgeon told me I blew out the capsule at my post surgery follow up. The rotator was the accrued injury with the capsule being torn due to a shoulder dislocation which thinking back I know exactly when and how it happened. I never knew I dislocated it and played two more rugby matches to finish my season before finishing tearing the rotator while lifting in the off season.You...work...in...Aspen...........

You can still understand everything he's saying and it shortens the video to a minute and a half.Good to see Cuban Press on that lift.  I learned it from BodBot and love the lift.  I think Arnold Dumbbell Press also works out rotator cuffs, but I'm not positive. You can only use it once though.the 5 rep calculation will be a little low. Most calculators I've seen only go up to about 12 reps, but even if you could do 25, the result would be way high. You could do AMRAP, or wait until you progress to a point where you can only get one set of 5.I came here to ask this.. Hoping for an answer. Shoulders pop every single rep and sometimes i get a little cringy toward the end of my setshttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index

Under limitations:

BMI is particularly inaccurate for people who are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 1015% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number. I sit like [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6S22IWtPzMU/UqcRXzFo23I/AAAAAAAADQ8/gr6Gjagfewk/s1600/Hip+Opening+Yoga+Poses+Garland+Pose.jpg) between sets, and use my elbows to push my knees out.

I also do volume squats on the TRX ropes [like this](http://www.chicagonow.com/get-fit-chicago/files/2012/11/TRX_WorkoutLanding.jpeg) and really work on getting ass to grass on each squat. Doing pause squats like this has made a world of difference in my hip mobility. Just put your working set. You're doing a weight for 5 reps. That's what it's going to use to calculate your 1RM.Uhh for the amount I bought (I forget the exact amounts) I spent 60, which included a scale and did not include the propel mix. I started using it right around Christmas and have been using it 3-5 times per week and still have plenty of creatine and bcaa'a.  Getting low on ALCAR, citrulline malate, and beta alanine though.

It is certainly cheaper than store-bought stuff. If you search r/supplements you can find moreSometimes in the morning I'm so weak I cant pull the charger out of my phone with one hand.

Anyway, I bought 5 lbs of the ON Gold Standard whey and it says the serving size is "one rounded scoop".  My jug didn't come with a scooper or anything, so is this just supposed to mean a spoonful or what?the second it happens next time you must chant the magic words: SHOO SHOO GAINZ GOBLIN! and suddenly he will recoil in terror at the gainz you were meant to receiveOh most definitely!For me, the recovery time from taking BCAAs and not were practically miles apart. Same exact diet, on the same routine, and I had run out of BCAAs.

Let me tell you, the intensity of your workouts will increase on a noticeable level. For that one week I was without BCAAs, the soreness per muscle group lasted for two days, three with legs. You bet your ass I went back to grab another batch after legs, because it was evident that either A: I would have to tone is down, or B: Buy the fucking BCAAs to keep going. Didn't help that I was on a protein that used ion-exchange so I had minimal AAs anyway.

Try it out man. I've tried ON BCAAs which is absolutely wonderful.Thanks for the advice! I do have a MyFitnessPal app, but have been neglecting it. I will start back up, I'm determined this time.I said this yesterday and I want to say it again. Lifting shoes are awesome and they will help you with this problem.

If you don't want shoes, there is some great stuff on youtube about how to work on keeping your back straight including squatting down with a weight held out in front of you. The weight acts as a counter to your balance and center of gravity. The more you practice with it, the closer to your chest you can bring it, and eventually you wont need it.

I don't really agree regarding the leg presses- these will build strength but will not help your stability lower in the squat or your ROM at all. The best diet is the one you stick with and IF is nothing but a tool to assist your diet - so don't let it wreck your intake if you cannot support it.

That being said - why aren't you able to do IF on the road? I'm a consultant and fly Monday mornings, return Friday or Thursday Evenings. I skip breakfast and eat 30ish% of my calories at lunch. Then after work I take my super lame rental car to a gym I googled and contacted to ask about daily/weekly memberships ahead of time,  work out and then destroy food after. On days I travel home, I know I probably cannot accomodate this eating schedule so I just push my eating window earlier in the day before I drive to the airport.This happened to me... Have never had my shoulders in such agonizing pain for so long. I quit crossfit, all is good with the shoulders now. It's just not for some people Cannot have wireless transmission capability of any kind whatsoever, to include Bluetooth, wifi, cellular, and any other kind of wireless communication technology. Why does this weekly thread exist if it's just a mix of people either talking out of their asses, saying "Creatine bro," or linking to Examine.com every single week? Why not just a part in the Wiki and a sticky directing people with supplement questions there? Any remaining questions would easily fit into Monday, Tuesday, or Friday's threads.

Not a mention a sticky directing to resources might prevent a lot of "I bought XYZ supplement and have been taking it for a month now. Can anyone tell me what it is and what it does?"Thank you for taking my comment in stride. I realise it could have been taken as a "well, what did you expect, you got what you deserved!" which is not what I was meaning to communicate!

I'm sure things will be resolved soon (maybe, haha) and I admit its a shame that we need to distrust businesses and engage in such skeptical thinking. Jym supplements yes or no?
This time last year I was hovering at 200lbs and 18-20% body fat now I'm hovering at 250 with 33-35% body fat. Ive been running almost daily and lifting a couple times a week for a few months now but haven't seen the progress I want. A friend suggested looking at Jym but I lost my faith in supplements after being with a supplement MLM for over 2 years and seeing how shady they can be.No wireless as in wifi or wireless as in cell phone?

If cell phone you're right.  If wifi, it doesn't matter.  You can use Bluetooth.  I'm thinking it may even work with iPads and iPods non-cell equipped.  I can't see why not.Definitely second the hatha. I used to go to a class twice a week at my gym, but stopped since I got a new job and the time didn't work for me anymore. Just found out that it starts an hour earlier now, and I can't wait to get back at it!

[Cat and Cow](http://www.creativesoulinmotion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cat-and-cow-pose-for-digestion.jpg) is my favorite lower back stretch from my yoga class. Start out on hands and knees with a neutral spine, arch spine up, then drop it down. Feels soooo gooooddddd!No! Hindsight....AAAH!I use sauna pretty frequently post workout, and have been doing it for years. I usually sit there for about 10 minutes, and hit an ice cold shower afterwards. I believe it to be beneficial for a great number of things (no source, only experience):

- better skin, getting rid of pimples.
- I tend to freeze a lot less in the winter.
- reduced joint pain and soreness
- helps make my body relax and generates better bloodflow. Around 4-5pm. It's after work. Then I can go home and eat dinner with a tasty protein shake while I raid in WoW.It's terrible when language devolves. - FTFY

DipsSo so so true! I am usually pretty vigilant with these issues - make sure I'm all good with credit cards, banks, cell phone accounts (I got a Cingular person to give me the unlock code to a then-latest iPhone when I traveled to Southeast Asia before the contract was up, because I was promised that), but this... I disappoint myself.

In my defense (my feeble feeble defense), this was my first corporate gym experience and THREE people told me I was good (they "called corporate" or something).

I work out 4 or 5 times a week, normally take the weekends off.Lol, probably should just find a new gymNah I'm just maintaining my weight

I've used the calculators that's how I know it takes around 3000-4000 to maintain my current weight.
Inwas mainly just enquiring on what other people think of omni mx range I just had reattachment surgery for my left shoulder supraspinatus muscle [MRI image here]( http://imgur.com/Brq6X1m). Bone spurs from arthritis(?) had cut the muscle until it tore. They also did a [subacromial decompression](http://www.sports-injury-info.com/subacromial-decompression.html). Started PT this morning. Just ROM movement for 6weeks. (49/m). Hey man, congrats to you and glad to hear the progress is still rolling! Everything is one step at a time, like a brick to a house. You'll be reminded the most of those who haven't seen you in so long. Your best bet to stay reminded is maybe take a bi-monthly progress pic to see the changes for yourself. I'd highly recommend climbing.  It's super fun and an awesome workout.

Good luck with the new baby!I take 5g of Cellucor Creatine with breakfast in the morning and then I go to work and have ~12oz of coffee. Does the caffeine affect how long the creatine stays in my system?

Consider squatting using low bar technique (as SL suggests), and going just below parallel, rather than trying to go ass to grass. I'm not particularly flexible in the hamstrings, but I can rep 315 barefoot and hit depth. I've found that the angles are better for less flexible people.Roughly what is the cost for a months supply doing it the way you do?Right after work - my gym is on campus, and its a 20 minute drive home.Long story short, been to a few Popeye's supplement stores and I've been asking around for which multi they recommend. I'm currently taking Orange Triad, and I've been to 3+ stores and they all refer to Progressive Active men.

Anyone know more about this brand and if their Active Men Multi is recommended?

(Would be interested to hear from any past employees to know if there's a particular reason why the product/brand is pushed so hard. Especially since on popeye's top supplements of 2014 page, where "Progressive" fits into a category, it will most likely be the highest rated product in that category.)I love this topic! Diet Coke is different from many diet sodas in that it isn't supposed to be like the full sugar name sake, it's a completely different flavor.

Flavor in general is interesting. Most people think they are true flavor experts, but that gets proven wrong all the time with blind taste tests. So much of perceived flavor is based on other things: smell and sight, of course, but also the environment you're in, what else you've eaten or are eating at the same time, what nutrients your body needs or doesn't need, your own body's minor allergies and uniqueness, and a TON of placebo effect.

It's hard to evaluate soda sweetness fairly, because artificial sweeteners aren't exactly the same as sugar. If anything, I'd say Diet Coke has a sweeter taste than regular Coke, closer to regular Pepsi. Most people who complain about Diet Coke not being sweet-tasting are feeling their own placebo effect from the diet name, or noticing the different taste and assuming it's less sweet.Just load. Its cheap and easy and has no condIt's actually a widely accepted method of training.  It's called a Pause Squat and many people use them if they are weak "getting out of the hole" (which is just a term for pushing back up when you're at the bottom of the squat).When I froze my account at LA I got an email confirming it. You never got that?Up to a certain point, I clearly stated that above.

The game is less about power and more about control.

If you think power is so important then why are professional bowlers not ripped? Why are they all just in moderate to bad shape?Overall, looks solid.  Your back remains consistent through the lift, hip movement is smooth, shoulders stay above the bar.  Two tips:

1. Don't look straight ahead at the bottom of the lift.  Pick a spot 5-6 feet in front of you and keep your neck at that angle.

2. Move the bar back slightly.  Should be above the middle of your entire foot.  A lot of people use the knot in your laces as a cue.

Again, that's a little nit-picking, as you're doing very well on the major areas of concern (back, hip dynamics). The two issues above aren't problems right now, but may present problems as weight increases.I dont think your heart rate should go any higher than 160, at least not for now.

Dont forget to keep hydrated, and dont train too hard. A steady diet, and i dont mean starving yourself, works really well with exercise.

Dont try to drop weight too fast, or what  may happen to you is what is refered as a yo-yo effect diet: you will gain all the weight back twice as fast.

I will be honest with you. A balanced diet is a lot harder than going to the gym. My advice is try to eat properly 6 days of the week and "reward" yourself 1 day of the week.

Try to find a way to prepare tasty healthy food (im pretty sure there must be a subreddit for that around here). I, for instance, am a sucker for sauteed veggies.

Im probably a bit late for this thread, but just wanted to leave my pat on the back worth of support.

They know nothing and are basically told to smile, nod, and say yes (within reason). I would be very surprised if they were aware of, or even cared about your account history.

The conversations to plan this, and to confirm before you left, needed to be had with a manager from the get go. The people at the front desk most likely just pretended to take notes then forgot all about you.

Is this your fault? No. SHOULD they have helped you? Yes. But think of it this way... if you were describing thins situation and it involved any business other than a gym, they reaction would be as follows: "Ugh... yeah... of course this didn't go well. You basically tried to make a deal with the receptionist of a company. What did you think was going to happen?"Actually, if you have a basic legal education it isn't as bad.

In a lot of jurisdictions they will have to prove that they did not misrepresent themselves in order to not be sued.

It has also worked really well for my friends that have elbow problems as well. Here is the video of him teaching the movement:

It might not work if your shake is too dense but at $2.50 its worth a shot.
I can't speak from personal experience, but for a cut like that maybe an EC stack? There's tons of info on it and now that I've mentioned it maybe someone else will chime in.

Supplements aside, you could just clean up dietAt my college we had exercise physiology degree and a health fitness specialist degree.  I completed the second one, a little easier, and am now working on getting a certified strength and conditioning specialist certification. Theres a few different ways but the more credentials you have the better. I got a sample of bcaa from Bulk Supplements, which is unflavored, and have been mixing it with concentrated Gatorade powder. The sample is empty, so I'm weighing my options.Yeah, I would be careful with this. 17 lbs over 6 weeks is a pretty quick pace, great job on that.
You'll probably find that there will be a week where you'll lose little to no weight, but your body is still changing.

If you are not doing any cheat meals/days, I would recommend one, as /u/Jerks_took_my_name noted, it can help your body lose further weight going forward.
** I am pretty sure the science on the physical impacts of a cheat meal is still split, but it will probably be good for your mental health as well.

Don't be surprised if your overall weight loss slows to 1-2 lbs a week. When I last dieted I lose 12 lbs the first month, and then 18 over the next 10 weeks, getting into shape is not meant to be quick!I'll look how to do those steps or if I can do the transition thanks.

I'm still low-ish at the end of the day, but it's way more manageable. The biggest thing I had to get over was that it's OK to have snacks, especially when trying to lose weight, so your body knows it's not starving. Good luck!!!Something I have found very useful in opening up the hips before squatting is to do 10 reps each leg of front lunges, side lunges, and rear lunges. Give it a try! I also had pinching and this alleviated it for me. Almonds are sneaky fuckers. I only really follow the intermittent fasting side of lean gains, not the caloric distribution during the feeding period or workout timing recommendations. It's just a well known example I used for clarity. I work out when it's convenient. Whether before work, during my lunch hour or after. My schedule is dynamic.I was taking bcaa's for a while and quit a few months ago. I lift fasted and really did not notice a difference from being on/off. For me, I just liked drinking something other than water in the morning, couldn't justify the cost and the lack of results (imo). I think it's a good thing.  I do it often during my warmup. doesnt it just increase the amount of air bubbles in the cartilage and increase the chance of arthritis later on?I was recently in a similar situation, i was also changing my routines and all.. How often do you work out? If you are going to the gym everyday, try taking more rest days. Also vary your calorie intake, for example if you should be eating 1500 calories, try eating 1700 one day and 1300 the next. Keep your body guessing on what you are going to doOkay, awesome.  Thank you!yeah LA fitness fucked me over to,The irony is that I really did not want to get out.

This works perfectly with respect to where I live and work. I would have been happy to call this "my" gym because the people are relatively unobtrusive, they are clean, I almost always get towels (in fact up until last week when they had issues with their washers, it was always), and I love the physical set up of Bakery Square - I use the cafes there to work and study, so this gym just beautifully dovetails into my life.

I just can't reconcile the really bad taste in my mouth after being lied to, however. Though you are absolutely correct in your assessment as well.Yes I do. Thanks!This is like a 3 minute video calm down.So really, no difference?Yup...Lucky! I was also wondering because if squat shoes didn't affect your mobility, then it may be because you had habits (or biology) outside of the gym helping you maintain it. Maybe not the case for people like myself or OP, unfortunately.It just sounds like you are underweight. Your body wants you to be 6'1, 210.

I don't think Starting Strength is right for everyone, but it is right for you here. Buy it on Amazon, read it, implement, eat/sleep/fuck/eat/sleep/lift, and look at the mirror again in 6 months.Meal prepMaybe you are right. Maybe you are an ugly sonofabitch. That said, you aren't going to look any worse by putting on a little muscle, and being stronger will feel good.I can imagine it would be awkward taking a client out for a meal and letting him/her do all the eating.As long as you keep your back straight and tight, you're fine.Just to add to what sacred-pepper said, if you're currently taking a multivitamin check if it's giving you any vitamin D already. The last multivitamin I was on gave me 1000 IU per day so I took 2x1000 IU vitamin D pills as well.

Also, many vitamin D pill bottles will say to only take 1000 IU per day, but there have been more recent studies saying even 10000 IU per day should be fine. I tend to stick to 3000 IU per day, and I take all 3 in the morning with breakfast. Don't take it at night because it has an effect on melatonin levels and could disrupt sleep.

You don't need any specific brand, I get mine at Costco for something like $10-$15 for 720 pills

Believe it or not, one can actually entertain ideas without nitpicking irrelevant details that add nothing to the conversation and have nothing to do with the subject at hand. "Grammar Nazi's" remind me of a politician that plans on cutting taxes for his wealthy campaign donors but campaigns only discussing abortion and the right for our kids to pray in school.
Fyi, foam rollers and lacrosse balls can make your tight knees feel better.  If/when you make rice you can put in turmeric, a cinammon stick, cloves and/or cardamom pods, or any combination.

I personally don't like it but you could try.

http://youtu.be/gx9h65E433M?t=1m54sOk great thanks. So just so I understand the time of day I take the creatine or pre/post workout doesnt matter as long as I take it everyday? Document your conversations with the employees and your understanding.  Do so in writing and as specifically as you can and provide copies ofthe documentation to LA Fitness and to your credit card company.  Make sure you make clear that you understood that the accounts would be inactive and that you never agreed to pay for active accounts while you were gone.  Dispute the charges.

e.g, On or about November 10th 2014 at approximately 12:30 PM, I and Mr. Thesuninmyheart discussed putting our account on with LA Fitness on hold with representatives of LA Fitness working at the front desk of the LA Fitness branch at 123 Fake St. in Pittsburgh, PA.  The latter representatives of LA Fitness included Mr. Incompetent_Agent_1 and Ms. Clueless.  These latetr agent assured us that our account would be placed on hold and that we would be charged only $X...  We relied on these latter assurances..."I have used LA fitness before, way too overpriced. Costco has the two year membership for 24 Hour Fitness for $370.Time for the Brofessor to go International....Wah the gym etiquette...If it isn't causing any pain I wouldn't worry about it.

Was a member for a year and went through hell to cancel my accounts no pain = no danger. it's called cavitation and it's just air bubbles popping.I went on the $10 hold as well for the sole reason that they wouldnt cancel it via phone. I was told I had to come in to cancel, but I had moved and wasn't near one. I finally ended up stopping the auto debit through my bank, which cost me a one time $35 fee. Hopefully they dont find a way around that.... I used to work there. Yes LA Fit sucks.. I'm sorry. As u/theedoor said, call corporate. Don't back down. It is extremely difficult to maintain IF if you travel a lot, at least for me it is.

Planes and airports aren't the most accommodating places for it. It's hard to find the right meal in an airport when you only have 30 minutes until you board your connecting flight. Living out of a hotel for a couple weeks doesn't make it any easier either. Going without food because it doesn't fit your macros is a bad idea imo.

I just try to stay as close as possible to my macros and try to maintain my excercise routine as best I can.

What else can you do?

If IF is working for you and you are enjoying it, you will find a way to make it work for you while you're travelling. I know it's pain :( but that's because they want you to spend more time on that page. Don't know about this video but professional video channel (Specially on YouTube) do that to earn more money.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness) if you have any questions or concerns.*Fuck man, I can feel the gains slipping out my fingers. Wait a minute why am I still typing this, I can feel the ga...Awesome thanks. I'll take note of that next time I deadlift. On squat, I've de loaded once or twice for depth but I'll try it one more time. Thank you. Muscles barely burn any extra calories, that said they will give you a better shape so do weights anyway.It isn't heavy enough to challenge your form. Also, it's hard to see your foot/knee movement from the side. Another angle from the back would help a lot with determining if your feet are at the right width and how your knees are tracking.

That being said, I can tell from here that you're putting weight on the balls of your feet rather than the heel. A good cue to fix this would be to do bodyweight/lighter working weight sets with 2.5 pound plates under your heels. Don't let your toes touch the ground when you do this stuff.

If all else fails, you can widen your stance and point your toes out wider. It will be easier to get depth that way.

You're going to get a lot of shit about butt wink. Shifting the weight to your heels will help alleviate this, but people wouldn't bring it up *every fucking time there's a form check if it wasn't a super-common "problem."*

...I wouldn't worry about it.

Also, you're stalling because you weigh 150 pounds and are trying to go for a 5x5 with more than 120% of your bodyweight. If you want to lift more, eat more.I went to an LA fitness branch to do a guest pass when I happened to be in the area a few months ago.  They gave me a guest pass and also told me another branch would be opening right by my office in January 2015.  I decided to join then because the branch I visited wasn't too far out of the way and the one by my office would be super convenient.  January rolled around, and it was apparent that they hadn't even poured concrete yet for the foundation of the branch by my office. I called them to ask about it, and they said it might be open by late summer 2015.  I cancelled my membership.

I think they, like many gyms, operate on a business model that's basically like a crab trap - easy to get into, impossible to get out of.  Combine that with what I assume are sales quotas for the sales associates, and you have a recipe for dishonesty and deceit.   In the first video, I was trying the Internal Rotator Cuff Stretch and every time I would raise my arms up, my shoulders would make a pop/crack sound. It didn't really hurt, but it happened every time. Is this due to a lack of flexibility or a more serious issue?You can be a weak fatass, is/was my point.What do people think about CLAs and L-Carnitine? I always see they promote this and that, but never anyone making solid claim to the products effectiveness. Or even why and how they do this and that.I think pull-ups are often overlooked. In my experience and opinion pull-ups are the most beneficial back exercises. What kind of help do you want? Meal prep, motivation, workouts etcI just posted this question to /r/Supplements last night but it might help to post to a larger subreddit.

Hey, I was hoping for a recommendation for when to take synephrine with my current stack of yohimbine hcl, BCAAs combined with intermittent fasting.

Right now I fast until 4pm, then I take 10g of BCAA and 2 scoops of Cellucor C4 preworkout and go weight lift. A half hour before I finish my weight lifting(usually an hour after I take the BCAAs) I take 10mg of yohimbine (I weigh 165lbs) and finish with a half hour of low intensity cardio and then feast(~1500 cal) 2 hours after I took the yohimbine.

I'm looking to add synephrine, in the form of Primaforce's Syneburn and asprin but I'm not sure of when I should take it. Does anyone have any advice on the matter?

Also, should I take caffeine with it even though C4 preworkout has quite a bit? Coffee? Caffeine Pill?
ohhhh i see yeah well some lil  chicken spots here count calories as well a meal was like 1700 calories i felt blah hahaWhy wouldn't you be able to do it while travelling?Too much for what? If the label says a scoop is 24g of protein, then that scoop has 24 or less grams or protein in it. When I got to about 240 i switch to minimalist shoes. All depends on how the sole of your current shoe is acting. Just start with the 5g/teaspoon. The loading may help it saturate faster but it is unnecessary in the long run.He would have saved you, but you typed out that comment, only slightly shorter. What a waste of calories man, you didnt have to do all that finger cardioHow did you get into the health fitness field? Is there a certain major for it?You should get 10g of fat with each meal.  It helps with absorption of nutrients and slows emptying the stomach.  A little butter or olive oil with your veg is enough, although fat isn't something you have to afraid of.

If whey shakes are causing bloating you may be alergic or intolerant of something in the shake.  Try different types of protein.  Meat, poultry, fish eggs and dairy are all good choices and vegetables, whole grains and legumes provide some protein.

Get some variety in your vegetables.  I can't image eating only kale. That's only one of several good choices when it comes to greens.  Your vegetables should be include other vegetables other than greens.  There are about a dozen other different categories and you should eat from all of them over the long term.  They also help fill you up. The mirrors are shockingly the cheapest thing there.  I think I paid $10 for 1 1.5'x6' mirror or something like that.First of all, good on you for making a lifestyle change.

It's always tough getting in the swing of things when it comes to meal prep. You could also snack through the day. Looking at your previous post it looks like you need to make up for it in the fat category. Keeping a baggie of almonds or nut mix would be a great way to fill this macro.

If you're struggling to hit your protein number, try this: mix in a half scoop of vanilla protein powder with 1 cup of plain greek yogurt. Not only does this make it vanilla greek yogurt, but it adds a ton of protein and almost no sugar (depending on your brand). Of course the idiot front desk people aren't going to be able to help you. All they know how to do is swipe cards.L.A. Fitness is horrible. They keep the place clean but the whole "can't cancel unless you send a written letter via snail mail to California where we will deny we've received it" schtick is just shady. Plus, their personal trainers seem to shuffle in and out - most just seem to have received their training certs. Boo. Boooo. I'm looking to buy fishoil,  Vit D &amp; K.  I've searched but the recommendations are overwhelming.
I am not from the states but i am going there soon, so if possible i would like to buy a large supply that will last me at least few months.
Could a get a few brands recommendations? Thanks!Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

I've been lifting on amoxxicillin or however you spell it since Saturday. Set a bunch of PRs. It shouldn't affect anything you're doing.Seriously. Small head and wide shoulders is good for bodybuilders, makes them look even bigger. But yeah overall OP sounds like he's got some issues that aren't actually about having "ugly proportions".I usually have a 2 hour break before class and work around 11AM-1:00PM. I'll try working out then to see if I have more energy.Fun fact, wearing a belt while squating isn't there so much to hold your body up as it is to provide your abs something to push against while your lifting. Take a deep breathe and imagine pushing something with your abs. It's the same thing you should do when you're squating!worked for me. but I'm not a consensusstir with a fork or something?Hey! I'll PM you in a few minutes. Thanks for reaching out to me!Then there you go. Beginner programs are just that, for beginners. They're meant to start easy and be simple. Then tailor and adjust to your specific needs/strengths and what not.You don't. Yeah, I'm familiar with IF but if you're traveling and can't fit it into that window you could also just have that single meal.

It's up to you.I'm not sure why you would replace a meal with a protein shake. You should be able to get everything you need with real food, and if you needed more protein drink a shake as well. Not saying you're wrong to do it, but how would it help you lose weight? 2 proteinsYeah they are different. Cable crunches allows you to progressively overload your abdominals to get the 6 pack everyone wants, while ab wheels can be replaced with unweighted planks to get essentially the same results. Theres no reason your core work should require shoulder extension.you might have tricep tendinosis. i developed an issue with my right tricep after cutting pineapples multiple times per week in a grocery store for 2-3 years while i was in highschool lol. just start light and work at a stimulus level that doesnt irritate the tricep tendon, eventually you will strengthen the tissue.Ideally, I prefer late evenings Monday-Thurs (9-9:30pm) cause the crowd has died down. Early evening on Friday (6:00pm) cause the crowd has died down already but you can still make it to Friday night hangouts, etc.  11am on Saturdays and Sundays because that means I get reasonable sleep but the gym isn't crowded yet.

Right now though, I have to work out in the morning before work because I am climbing in the evening. Not ideal since I am not a morning person but I have found working out/climbing three days a week is better for my recovery than working out three days and climbing on rest days.
Shouldn't neglect your obliques, especially if you're working towards aesthetics. It shouldn't "push out" anything, in fact it should just leave your core stronger and looking better.My left elbow starts to click and feels uncomfortable sometimes after a while, I have tennis elbow. What feels good for me is using cables, but put the height of the cable to a bit below shoulder height, stand a few feet back, and use this not as much as a tricep pushdown, but it moreso mimics the motion of a tricep kickback.Sorry, power rack. If you feel alright you should be good to go. TNation is still very reputable, compared to most websites. They do push bio test hard on a lot of articles though.http://stronglifts.com/wp-content/uploads/deadlift-grip.jpgThat was the plan anyway, I was thinking more of the next 6 days while I'm on the medicine.Hey I work there now and don't understand what could possibly have gone wrong here. Your request got denied? No, it sounds like somebody messed up and isn't willing to take the blame. There's no request to freeze accounts, you click a button, that's it. Any front desk employee can do it. The ONLY way your account wouldn't have been frozen is if you were past due on payments.

PM me if you have any more questions. Just don't over do it on Caffeine pills. Know the dosage, don't take the entire bottle, that's about it. I extensively used Caffeine pills during my Collegiate rowing career, still use Caffeine pills weightlifting. Yes, they're cheap as shit.There's a label on the tub.My idea is to eat in a window of 8 hours but only the days in when I am in town. During that window I will have my caloriesI am super late to this post! But first of all it is great that you decided to go to the gym, as an overweight person myself i know how intimidating the gym can be. I started at 240 pounds in December and very out of shape, i worked out for about 2 weeks without seeing any kind of results so i thought i would give counting calories a try (january) since then i am down 22 pounds. Working out is a great start but diet will take you the rest of the way you want to go. I am up to running 2 miles and have been lifting weights. Its is going to be a long process, but in the end it will be well worth it! Keep doing what you are doing, make sure to switch up excersises to avoid plateaus and eat clean!Call CORP. they are notorious in charging people unnecessary money.At the end of the strengthening article....
***Never perform a rotator cuff routine before doing shoulder press or bench press exercises***

And thats the only time I have ever done them for the past month... lolYup, currently working through my lower back pain and sciatica and the limber 11 is showing me how much tighter my entire right side is. That shit matters! a fantastic Playlist helps me and a hell of a lot of self motivation!!! Well, I guess it happened anyway.I think you mean a power rack. Squat racks are usually not height adjustable and would be too high for benching.Some people swear by EC stacks.  I have been doing it for the last month or so but I also started it at the same time as a cut diet and starting a hypertrophy workout so I'm not sure which one of those or the combination is what's working for me right now.

EC stack is caffeine and Ephedrine so you can take caffeine and any nasal pills that have ephedrine in it or you can buy blends for more money.  I heard cellucors fat target stuff has good reviews but I can't really speak for those. more water to protein ratio
Local news stations.  Go public.   Twitter it.   I have noticed that it gets me sweating and I don't have the painful aches from running I'll be doing that more.Any thoughts on Evogen EVP? I have developed a horrible sensitivity to caffeine.You should improve your fitness, first and foremost.  That means getting stronger, faster, and improving your endurance.  That inevitably means strengthening your core including your obliques.

Part of addressing your fitness is achieving a normal bodyfat level and that means improving your diet, reducing junk food and increasing nutritious food.

Also improve your sleep and stress management.

Once you have these basics under control, your problem will also likely be under control. I prefer going to sleep at 8-9PM because I know i'll wake up refreshed at 4:55 AM and at the gym by 5:05 AM the latest. Helps that my gym is 3 blocks away and open 24/7.

There are people at my gym that early but we all do different workouts and the power racks are always free. The luxury of being able to complete your workout without waiting saves more time in the long run for me.

It also sets the day right as I get something positive accomplished right away. I can say my day started on a high note and anything trivial throughout the day won't bother me. I totally agree. My father has had 5 rotator cuff surgeries from tearing them so I know have genetically weak rotator cuffs. My bench got so bad I couldn't do the motion without a pain in my left shoulder, so I had to stop benching for a month while I let it sit. After a month I started adding in rotator cuff exercises every shoulder day. I didn't notice a difference at first but it's been a year and the pain has never come back. I still work in rotator exercises on shoulder day because I also play golf which is a lot of rotation and I don't want my bench to suffer from my weak shoulders. Broken down into two different phases. Loading and Maintenance

Loading Phase: 20g - 30g of creatine Monohydrate a day for 5 to 7 days. Once done, move onto Maintenance phase.

Maintenance Phase: 5g of creatine Monohydrate a day.

When should to take it? Ideally during Loading you spread it out, take 5g in the morning, 5g before workout/noon, 5g post workout 3pm, 5g late afternoon, Doesn't matter when, you could even take 20g in one sitting. The problem is you might have some interesting poop, 20g spread through out the day and you won't notice anything different. During maintenance? Whenever the hell you want. Miss a day? Just continue as normal.

You only really need about 3g a day normally, anything extra will just get pooped out, so 5g is usually what's recommended and what I used in calculating.

Also; YOU WILL PUT ON WATER WEIGHT. For every 5g of creatine taken, expect to drink an additional 4-6 oz of water. Only things I drink are water, green tea, and black coffee so I've never had an issue with this. Yeah you might not want to drink a 150g protein shake in one sitting. Get it throughout the day from food and make a -25 or so g protein shake after your workout if you need some for the day. I take a heaping spoonful of creatine monohydrate everyday at dinner time, as long as you take the same amount everyday you will be fine. When I did IF for a short while it was just skipping breakfast and having an early dinner. That or you could just have one giant mega-meal and have all of your daily calories then?so, is it not even worth it to only do it during the weeks I am in town?2 weeks and 4 daysProbably just water retention. Ignore it and continue on. Doing a single meal carb load might help shed the water weight. Google "whoosh effect".You should be alright. Penicillin is just an antibiotic there's no reason why it should conflict with working out.You should probably rest for today. Nope never played, but I think I know what you mean. Yea I was going to take a guess around 2800-3000 for yours, 3300 seems pretty high.  I'd have a difficult time eating that much and staying healthy.Are different forms of creatine really more effective than others? When I first started lifting seriously, I saw articles saying some absorbed better and didn't have as much water retention as monohydrate, but now I'm seeing articles and posts saying that's a bunch of crap since monohydrate doesn't need to be loaded. &gt; I mean tnation is reputable

What? No it's not. Tnation occasionally will have guest writers who have worthwhile articles but most of TNation is complete bullshit designed to push their supplements. Jesus christ, you pay more for 2 months than I do for a whole year...Bruh you need to have 45 degrees from your elbows to your torso or you aren't focusing your chestSo, so, SO helpful. I have flexibility issues still and this helps a lot. Also the tip about bracing your core I saw on here a few days ago was a godsend.

I used to hate squats but now I kind of look forward to them.A little reminder for you when you have doubts
[link](http://i.imgur.com/KLizapH.jpg)1) You know how you see kids twisting their torso when standing around doing nothing. Yeup. You use your hips to "toss" your arms so that the hands hit the opposite shoulder and pect. Do it 100 times.

2) Bend over let your torso hang from your hips.
a) Let your arms swing to and fro together from front to back 10 times.
b) Let your arms swing to and fro from front to back alternately 10 times
c) Raise your shoulders wiggle alternately up and down so that your hanging arms and hands lower and raise alternately 10 times.
d) Swing your torso left and right so that your arms and hands swing left and right of your legs 10 times.

A flexible spine will give you a long life.

Your spine must be flexible for you to reach enlightenment.

No, sorry I'm bad at explaining. Like if you're not holding weights your palms are facing forward and you rotate your arms down so they remain in an L shape and your upper arm (above the elbow) is in the same position albeit rotated and your lower arms (below the elbow) are parallel to the floor aka your open palms now face the floor.I feel like all my energy has drained throughout the day and therefore I lift less. My schedule with my GPs makes me exercise at night.We've brought them a couple times but by the time you get them geared up for the lesson, then gear yourself up, take a run or two, then they are done because it's been a couple hours and they are hungry/tired/cold. Like most things with kids, skiing with them is not the same as skiing with other adults.Yeah I realise that this is not taking into account lower body and perhaps training arms four days a week will not result in gains but rather result in overtraining, due to little to no recovery time. However, I do see how this could be quite an effective routine if it was incorporated with other body parts and executed, say, two days a week.Bakery Square.It's 95$ ish for 2 people. We also had a very small (or maybe even a 0$) initiation fee as part of a deal.I believe the Beta Alanine can be taken as either a pre-workout (on lifting days) or whenever on non-lifting days. As for the protein, I always mix mine with water (dissolves way better). Right now I'm using a Body Fortress whey isolate protein, and it tastes good. I also used an EAS whey protein, which tasted good. N jutut vaan tulee kun niist alkaa kirjottaa.
LMFAO. Holy shit, I hadn't seen that one.

So let me get this straight. He's 5'10", 191#, presumably below 10% BF, has a 1560 total, which he doesn't have video of because he was busy "...working out and tracking my calories...", **and** runs a 5:18 mile all while following a bodybuilding routine. Oh, and the only cardio he does is 20 minutes of dancing 3x a week.

Cool story bro.I mean tnation is reputable and sounds pretty ridiculous... But this routine seems bananas imo. It'll make your arms look good but if the only thing that looks good is your arms you'll look pretty awful.

Thanks for help.When I saw the set-up I expected the worst but all things considered its not bad.

You do start with the bar over your toes, which means the bar must come towards you on the way up. You want it a vertical as possible.

Heres a super simple method to set-up your deadlift. If you combine that with your straight back itll be damn near perfect.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syt7A23YnpA

You will also find that your shins will be more vertical and your upper body will probably be more parallel to the floor when you start but thats fine.The gym I'm talking about is a Lifetime Fitness too.Here's how I view losing weight: It's like a row boat that is sinking and the water filling the boat represents the fat. You take a bucket and start bailing out the water. At first, it's easy. You're dumping full buckets of water out. But once you have the water level much lower, you're not bailing full buckets, you're bailing half buckets and eventually you're laying the bucket down on the bottom of the boat just to get water in it. You may be at that stage where you're not filling buckets easily. Stay with it and remember, as long as you're burning more calories than you're taking in, you'll get where you want to be but it gets slower and more difficult.  &gt; Some people, not myself, find it difficult to count calories and can't do it properly. There are a lot of people who have no idea how many calories is in any food that they eat.

That's why things like MyFitnessPal exist. You're at a restaurant? Say Applebees? Just punch in "Applebees Honey BBQ Chicken Tender Dinner" and boom, all the macros and calories pop up. You made something for yourself? Say it was... idk pasta with vodka sauce. What /u/rollollo is saying isn't false, you don't need to measure it to a tee. But if you had 1 bowl? Guestimate how much you just ate. If you're really lazy, when you're done eating take a measuring cup, fill the bowl with water and then pour the water in the measuring cup. If it's 1 cup, assume you ate 1 cup of pasta and guess randomly at the sauce as well. MFP exists to make calorie counting easier than having to pull out a food scale every time you eat. Unless you're trying to cut from 10% to 6% BF you have no need to be that specific. The main point in "counting" everything that you ingest during the day is simply to keep yourself conscious of the food you're eating.

Will cardio help burn calories? Sure, but even an hour on a treadmill is only burning 300 or so calories. If you're just eating the same way you always eat and doing cardio you'll gain weight because you're still not at a deficit of your TDEE. Realize, people that are obese (OP for example) are 'typically' that way because they eat way more than they're supposed to without realizing it.

OP didn't list her height, I'm going to assume an average height of about 5' 5". So at 5' 5" and 280lbs she has a TDEE of 2458 calories/day if she doesn't move all day, which is likely what she's been doing most of her life. Now, she's probably been eating closer to an average of 3000-3500 kcals a day her entire life which is why she is in the state she is in currently. So, if she keeps eating 3000 kcal a day and is burning 300 calories from cardio, she still won't be losing any weight at all. In fact she'll likely still continue to gain weight. Albeit, slower than before, but gain none the less.

Reddit is black and white because that's really the only way there is... if this girl tries to burn 1000 calories a day from exercise she's going to get burnt out and see zero progress because she'll stop working out. But if she takes the time to fix her diet first and starts eating at a deficit and consuming closer to 2000kcal a day, then she'll see pounds fall off before she starts exercising and that will help her motivation. Then, when she is still eating 2000kcal a day and burning those 300 calories via cardio a few times a week she'll start to get healthier and burn even more weight off. But telling an obese person that they don't have to fix their diet because "counting calories is hard" and that working out will help is 90% of the time false. As most Obese people got that way by eating a significant amount more food than they should on a day to day basis. Counting calories should be Step #1 for anyone looking to lose weight and you're helping nobody by telling them otherwise. Especially when MFP makes it SO easy to count them. It takes me 30 seconds to enter my meal into MFP, maybe a minute or two if I made the dish myself and need to think about what I put into it. But it's certainly not hard, you're just lazy.Discipline is the better way to put it. its been part of my routine for years and i have the want to make gains. its just that work drains me of all energy....what? You're like not even wrong.

Seriously, what's your full depth 1RM squat or dead?The bar looks like it's hovering over your toes. Bring it back a little bit so it is in the center of your entire foot. And try to keep your head in a neutral straight position. If there is a mirror in front of you resist the temptation to watch yourself until you're at the top of the lift. Yeah I hear you about starting light. I was thinking about starting in the second month of SS, which means Id bench 65 pounds instead of 45 -- which is still light enough to get the movements down but closer to a weight that is going to start to tax me.

(Of course bench is not what im concerned about.. That would be squats and deads.. I have squatted as part of bfl tho just not continuously)

Mmmmmm.... Waffles. What is it about soda you like? The bubbles? The taste? Try drinking club soda with lemon or lime juice if you can't quit cold turkey. I wasn't a big soda drinker growing up so it's easy for me to say no.I tried that haha, i woke up at 5 am, looked at my alarm and said screw that. went right back to sleepIt's tough to gauge. The evening is when you're not at work, so playing that game or watching that TV show is sometimes all the "living" you get outside of work. Coming home, eating, and sleeping 2 hours later can very quickly make you feel like a drone.

That said, my company just announced a bunch of redundancies coming soon- 1/3 of my floor, so that might not be an issue any more...I would normally never recommend it to anyone as food is generally enough to put on mass.  But I know when I was 19 I had the same problem and resolved it the same way.  I was 5'11" 170 pounds and couldn't put on a single lb to save my life.  Now I am 230lb but it took a lot of time and years to get there.  I sit around 15% body fat as I have no reason to be lower and I enjoy some b dubs and a beer.  Now that my activity level and metabolism has slowed 10 years later it isn't needed but it does the job when you need the extra calories.Thanks, I'm hooping on the food train atmOh its been a part of my routine for about 2 years now its just that now that i'm working i'm losing the energy to goKeep doing crossfit lol.12AM-1:30AM.

I have school in the morning, and work usually from 2PM-11:30PM.

On that note, is there anything bad with working out late at night like that?Squat - You're not hitting depth. You're about 8 inches too high it looks like.I've never been refused a spot, though I never asked those with super smug face. I know I know, don't judge the book by its cover.If you take note in the deadlift video, the bar moves towards you as you lift.

You want the bar to go as close to vertical as possible. In this case it means starting with the bar slightly closer to you, over the middle of your foot as opposed to over the toes.

This also may cause you to need to have your shins more vertical and so you might have your hips higher at the beginning. This is fine.

For your squats I believe that weight is too high for you. Your depth is really lacking and you are pretty unstable on the ascent.

You should deload a bit and try to make sure you get down a bit lower. You may lack mobility but its worth working on it.

You also tend to put your weight onto your toes about halfway up, which isnt ideal either. You want to keep the weight at least over your midfoot if not towards your heels further.

Good luck.If you look at the path of the bar, it looks like: /. It needs to look like: |. It's putting a lot of extra stress on his lower back.

You said the starting position for the upper arm (assuming bis/tris) is parallel to the floor.  After rotating, you said it is still parallel to the floor.  Did you mean you rotate your lower arm (assuming forearm)?

As in start like an 'L' (view from the side) and then rotate inward.A lot of these gadgets aren't very accurate to be honest. You can buy fat calipers for $5 that will generally give you a much better estimate. 7% body is really not much at all. If this is accurate, you're doing the right thing in trying to bulk. 2500-3500 calories is a big range, assuming you were perfect and ate the average over the course of a week, 3000 calories usually isn't enough to actually put on significant weight. Best recommendation anyone can give you.

EAT!I drive.

-The Driver, Drive, 2013Which Pittsburgh location was this?If what you want is big arms, this is a good routine to follow. It is not optimal according to current science but this is the kind of routine (rep range,drop sets, etc) that I see the best results with so take that bro science for what it's worth.It neglects the lower body but if you don't care then it is worth 4 weeks of your time.

Also, I would deload on the 4th week then run it over again. I'm gonna try it out. Thanks!Though it probably will work, the guide itself states that it's a programm for exactly four weeks. I won't go so far that your arm will fall off afterwards, but any extreme training programm like these will be severly unhealthy in the long run.

They are, like all these obscure named diets in the rainbow press, programms based on a limited timeframe and narrowed scope for shortterm effects that are either not sustainable in the long run or simply unhealthy/prone to injury. A guide like this reminds me of the good old popeye cartoons.

But if you want to have "them big guns", go for it. See what happens and dray your own conclusions.LA Fitness memberships cost $100 a month?  Holy shitballs Batman!I'm pretty sure bodybuilding ships anywhere.

Welcome!&gt;I'm the type of person that needs it laid out in front of me.

You might want to hire a trainer/cook.

&gt;Should I bump up the cardio and do less weight training?

This is backwards.  You want to build muscle and lose fat.  That means imporve your diet and your training.  If you want to get better at running, run more. Sorry. You said "....you drive?" instead of you would drive? Misunderstood the context.
Everything about it is terrible, starting with the bullshit claim that it will add an inch to your arms in 1 month and ending with the overly macho "hurdur don't worry about legs and overtraining" rant. Your comparing cable crunches to the ab wheel, two completely different movements.

It would be foolish to try to put 200lbs, hell even 100lbs on your back and try to do the ab wheel, 10-45lbs is more than enough.  I'm a novice but you definitely need to go lower on your squats.Thanks! I like to comfort myself with the idea that our house is built by wood as well, so im confident in its safety unless I light it on fire. Regardless it can easily hold up to 400lb. By 300lb I'm already gonna be looking at a more durable bar and rack.

If all is well this will all cost me about $400 total.. Which is perfect for my wallet right nowHi Beethoven. Yeah it's normal, same exact thing with me.Considering any nutritionist worth seeing would know your TDEE person to person of similar body type doesn't generally fluctuate more than 300 calories. Assuming you aren't suffering from a medical condition.I had a similar problem where they reactivated my account randomly and charged me for 6 months worth of membership. The local management said there was nothing they could do except cancel my membership going forward.

It took about 2 months worth of phone calls to LA fitness corporate (I don't remember where I got the number from), and plenty of voicemails, but eventually it was resolved.

It was IMPOSSIBLE to talk to anyone about it or have anyone do anything but if you're persistent enough, you should be able to get through.I have a question.  I went to my doctor who referred me to a sports physician.  He informed me that (after taking an X-ray), that I have a partial dislocation in my rotator cuff.  It's been like this for years, and has affected me a little bit in my daily work outs.  If I outstretch my arm all the way it "pops out then back in".  They then referred me to physiotherapy where the exercises did not really improve my condition.  Another option was surgery, but I am unsure if it is worth it?  Is there anything I can do without further damaging my rotator cuff and strengthening it?General health. Unless you work outside year round, you are likely deficient.


http://examine.com/supplements/Vitamin+D/#summary3Thanks, and yea it makes sense.

Jay Cutler doesn't run, why should I?

That should be on a poster or something.

My TDEE is supposedly 3100cals a day but i have lost weight in the past 3 months since i have been eating that much. I lift every day but it is hard to believe i need to eat more than that to maintain at 6'3 202 lbs. So it is kind of hard to believe you will not lose weight eating that little and working out as much as you do. LA Fitness is awful to their customers. I scheduled a personal training session and got paired with a really wonderful trainer. He was patient, friendly, and very helpful. He convinced me to sign up for a month to give it a real try, and then after that, we would reevaluate if I wanted to do an on-going program.
Well, the week after signing up, they paired me with a new trainer, which I was not expecting and not excited about. After one workout, I decided I was done and would not continue. He was rude and impatient; he spent more time talking to other people around the gym than coaching me. He made very condescending and discouraging remarks, such as "Really? You can't even do lunges?" I figured I was out the money for the month, but I wanted to try to get a partial refund after such a horrific experience and the bait-and-switch garbage they pulled.
When I talked to the management team on-site, I was informed that I had actually signed up for a 6-month, non-cancelable contract. They refused to do anything about it. I demanded to know how that was even possible, as it was not what I agreed to. Unfortunately, when agreeing to the terms, I had signed the electronic pad-- not a physical paper. They printed out that electronic signature on a 6 month contract and told me that is what I had agreed to. I was furious; it was going to be over $1600 total, and I was under the impression that I was signing up for 1-month. Sure, it was ignorant of me not to make them print the contract for my review, however, I was young and naive, not yet jaded by unethical business practices.
I, too, had signed up with a debit card. There was nothing that my bank could do to get me a refund, which I was OK with. They canceled the debit card to prevent me from facing future charges, but after negotiating with LA Fitness corporate for over a month, no compromise was made, and I am sure their records still indicate that I owe a $1200 balance.
It is really unfortunate, though, because I loved their gym. 100% agree with you! "Carb-loading" is definitely best left to days prior to running, but per her diet an increase would be beneficial not only for energy stores but also for the weight/strength gains OP is going forIt depends on what you're using to measure body fat. DEXA scans are the most accurate but still have error. If you're talking about an impedance tool like [this](http://www.joyzyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bioelectrical-impedance-analysis.jpg) then that has a lot of error. So if you measure 7%, lets just say it means you're between 6-8, so saying 6.7 or 6.9 is too accurate.

In this sub people usually go by visual estimates as most methods are very inaccurate. You may very well be 7% body fat, how do you look compared to [this](http://www.southfloridafitnessbootcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/body-fat-percentage-men.jpg).

A great article that was posted yesterday.Add some form of weight lifting to build some muscles. Muscles burn more calories.

Try adding bodyweight movements, squats, lunges, push ups, dips etc Same here 5 am is the magical hour.

Very very few people, and at mine only me and one other guy will ever use the squat rack that early. Basically no waiting on anything or dealing with people that make you write a Rant Wednesday post.

For me it gives me a good start to the day and I tend to have more energy throughout the day. By the time I get home though I'm wiped so the sleep comes easily. Helps with excuses too, no its been a long day at work or I'm too tired to go today crap.

Wake up, lift weights, enjoy the gains.... Repeat.Just eat, dude. I hate it when you skinny guys say "I can't gain weight" and then you eat half of your meal or skip meals. It's a legit problem if you're eating 5k calories a day and not gaining weight but if you're eating 2.5k and whining about it you're not helping yourself.

Butter, oil, french fries, ice cream, hamburgers, milk, eggs, etc. All calorie dense and all fine for a dude your age and in your shape (as long as you don't mind pooping).

Like Alan Thrall says, you don't stop lifting because it's hard, if you're serious about gaining weight you wont stop eating just because it's hard. Yeah but you said you'd drive 1 minute.read the wikiCan you get a cheap hotel for the night before?  I wouldn't want to perform after 2 hours in the car. Other than that, just warm up the same way you usually do.  CHANGE NOTHING about your routine the day that you have to perform.Words require clarity in order for meaningful communication.

Simply sit down with your legs straight in front of you and lean forward to stretch them out. About 20 seconds on, rest 5 sec, then 20 seconds on a gain. Then bend one leg in and stretch the other leg to the side. Then switch legs.

The scorpion stretch is also a good one. Lay on your stomach with arms extended to 90 degrees.  Take your left leg and try to tough your right hand, keeping your shoulders on the ground best you can. Then repeat with the other leg. Do this several times.

These two stretches will keep you from having lower back pain.  Your extremely soft hands need to become not soft hands.

I'm a professional editor, so people stop arguing something that you're clearly wrong about. There have been multiple complaints towards the BBB how they will lower your rating if you don't pay them money and raise it if you pay them. It might have changed in the past few years.

You did not hit a plateau in 6 weeks. Check your calories, but don't try to drop anything too fast, slow and steady fat loss is sustainable.

First weeks of a weight loss journey is normally water anyway rather than actual fat.I personally take MP fish oil, best ratio I could find for affordable price, for each 1000mg capsule you get 700mg of EPA DHA combined. I take 3 a day, 1 with breakfast, 1 with lunch and 1 with dinnerI take mega men energy and metabolism pills as my daily supps. They aren't pricey off amazon and was wondering if there is anything better. I run regularly and lift as well, i used to take the mega men ripped and got great results. That was too pricey though and was wondering what supps you guys would recommend. I'm just look for something that gives me a little boost and helps me stay in shape. Nothing too pricey though gotta pay for school.Well done OP on building it yourself but am I the only one who wouldnt trust a power rack made out of wood?Was about to recommend this!

2 miles would be a fantastic warmup jog and you drive?I read somewhere that its somewhere around 16oz = about 13 grams  &gt; as an Engineer and Chemist, I like to know what I put into my body specifically. Out of all the odd and hard to pronounce supplements there's two that I consider well tested enough to know they can give you enough of an edge while being entirely safe.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Caffeine and Creatine

amen my other scientifically inclined brethren (rhyme not intended)

Just to add for those who might not be aware - caffeine pills are also readily available at your local supermarket or pharmacy, and are so cheap you'll do a double take (especially if you are used to branded PWOs).You should have a letter that is just professional.
They respond better to it.thanks man
According to the LG guide, training 'fasted' (pre-workout BCAA's) is optimal and second best is training with a small pre-workout meal (larger meal post workout). These are just guidelines, do whatever works for your body and your schedule.Heh. That soccer practice sounds pretty familiar though luckily ours is more likely to start at 5:30 or 6. How the heck are enough parents out of work by three to get their kids there on time?

Anyway, I usually stick around while they practice - get cardio in running so I'm as sweaty as the kid is when we're done.  Gym time is after they're in bed.
Will do, and yea I see now that the body fat probably isn't correct.Just double checking, thank you for the help!Dude. Frankly, they're caffeine mixed with lots of other crap that have a hint of truth behind them, but no effectiveness in the real world. Examine.com has recommendations for what works (from actual studies).lol, yea I didn't realize how retarded that sounded until I asked you guys. Thank you5AM - Right as the gym opens. It completely sets my day to be great. Used to HATE each day I would have to work or be at home...the gym turned that around. Im smiling everywhere and so happy with myself.Triggered to cunt punch someone maybe. What BCAA brand/flavors do you go for?You're making some unrealistic assumptions.  Building muscle takes time, effort and planning.  You are not going to build massive traps accidentally.

Start with improving your fitness.  Become stronger, faster and improve your endurance.  Improve the quality of your diet, eliminate junk food and increase nutritionally dense foods.  get adequate sleep and manage your stress.

Pick appropriate programs (from the wiki) that address your fitness goals.  Don't worry about body proportions right now.  As you get fit, you will naturally develop the body that is right for you.  If after a year or two of this you find that you need a body part emphasisied or de-emphasised, you can use bodybuilding techniques to to that.  Oh shit, so I should stop using creatine?I'm going to second the notion of carbonated water, part of the addiction for me i found was carbonation something just so satisfying about popping open the can and hearing it fizz as it's poured over ice.

You still get that with sparkling water. However it's naturally flavored with no sugar, no calories, no sweetener, and no sodium. The brand i would recommend is La Croix lots of different flavors and pretty affordable. I will squeeze a sliced lime or lemon to add some additional flavor sometimes. It's worked great for me so far. It's been about 4 or 5 months since I have had one.

You are likely to start having some withdrawals heavy cravings after about a week depending on how much you are drinking per week. Just push through it and it'll be worth it once you've kicked the habit. Keep in the back of your mind that soda is terrible for your health, and your teeth. Reinforce that thought each time you start to crave one.I was expecting a completely different stretch. Ive found that doing standing psoas stretches throughout the day at work has solved all of my lower back problems. Thanks, yea I see that's my problem.Yes I am. I eat around 1650-1750 a day and do cardio and ab workouts for about 30 minutes a day.Use a loose grip. Don't hold the bar tight, just let it rest in your fingers. You're gripping the bar too tightly which is causing it to slide during your reps which is hurting your skin.

You just have to pull the weight up. Gravity will help keep it down.I hate cardio. Thanks&lt;3dang thanks guys i truly appreciate all the feedback. ummme, that's actually a pretty decent list of what i've got in the cupboards. my protein intake is controlled by my appetite,  lots of deer and antelope. nice, lean, good protein.   thanks guys!!Regarding your question, I'm not sure. Melatonine is the supplement I'm more familiar with. The problem with Melatonin is you need to be very careful not to overdose. You body only makes about 300mg of melatonin a night for sleep. If you start to take 1g supplements of melatonin to sleep, your body will stop producing melatonin. If you buy the 1g pills, divide them into quarters and you'll be fine.

Reason why I recommend melatonin is because it's something your body naturally produces to help with sleeping. It can be argued that things like Xanax don't actually inducing a sleeping state, but rather a more unconscious state of being. You can define sleep as what you want, but it's argued that you don't actually receive the benefits of sleep in this state.

Beyond even that, it can cause you to do some really messed up shit in your "sleep."You of course can tailor a beginning program like SS to your individual need. However, it would be wise to start light with any compound movement you have not done before. If you feel very confident, you can add weight faster than recommended until it gets harder. However, use the time at lower weights to really get your form down well, as it will pay huge dividends going forward.Definitely, thank youLifts are ok but chances are the problem is the volume of cardio you are doing. Just ditch that off and you should see improvements.

Try something like the stronglifts 5x5 and don't fo the cardio and you should notice improvements.I definitely will, thank youAre you counting calories? bro i just have questions based on the leangains method, is it really better to lift fasted? or is it alright to lift within the 8 hour period?This post has [too little content](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_3._posting_rights_require_minimum_qualifications). **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness&amp;amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2vnnhc/how_good_are_protein_shakes_for_a_16yearold/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

(I know BroBible isnt the best place to look for accurate information, but this site gets their posts from other sources aswell)
Also keep track of the creatine you have in your preworkout and possibly protein blend.  They add it to everything so you may not need the full 5g by itself.  My preworkout has about 2g or something in it.  Pointless by itself so i'm not sure why they add it. That's why they make vanilla and chocolate.So demo it first and then explain. In law school, we were taught to state your conclusion up front and then explain because people ain't got time fo dis shit.Only stretching and more squats. Front squats require less hip flexion, but hip flexibility is important.&gt; I am bodybuilding and a distance runner.

I'm a music producer and I'm deaf.I've also had a problem with them. I signed up for training sessions with them, trainer is awesome and I had no problem with the sessions themselves. When you sign up they lock you into a 1 year contract, which I agreed to. About 10 months in I get a call from LA fitness saying that they see my contract was about to be up and if I wanted to continue, at which I say no because I was doing fine working out by myself and wanted to move that monthly payment to other areas in my life. APPARENTLY LA doesn't consider that a cancellation, and that I actually have to talk to a manager to get that cancelled so I got another month of training. I know I could've fought it but they have these business practices in place to try to get money from people like me who aren't going to put in that effort.When starting on creatine, do I really need to go through the loading phase, or can I just start taking a tsp a day? Does it really make a difference?Yeah, *to waffle* is a great word to describe pusillanimous behavior.Myfitness pal is a great tool for that.

Keep some peanut butter in your room. It's cheap, high cal, decent protein, and doesn't need to be refrigerated. Is it the healthiest thing? No, but it's not terrible and it gets the job done. If you don't a chance to go to that spot on campus you like, pound a couple teaspoons at two different times that day to compensate.DOMS. Back is used for squats. Arms for bench. Maybe your form was off, your nutrition, your sleep.

When you see hoof prints, think horses not unicorns.Hell yea, I'll hop right on it. Thanksif your serious my brother dropped around 100lbs by roller blading, a low sugar diet, and only drinking water.

I think the best thing he did was dropping all calories that he drank.

Calories in and calories out, its simple if you put in less calories than than you use the weight will come off. You'll like the headline "British Left Waffles on Falklands".I do mine 7 in the morning and then around 1 right after lunch.  I read you should take it on an empty stomache but it doesn't agree with me when I do it that way.Yea I've come to realize that. Macros being tracked as of 5 minutes ago.

Thanks!I'd look into body dysmorphic disorder and perhaps consider getting into therapy.Leftcorner has suggested using a foam roller for loosening off the hip flexors and I agree that foam rolling can help. Having said that, I have had exponentially better results from doing the 3 minute stretch for the hip flexors found in this MobilityWOD video before my squats. I can easily hold a third world squat position after this and getting deep is more an achievable. Foam rolling feels a little meh when in comparison, I prefer to roll IT band/Quads/Glutes/Hams and stretch off my Hip flexors in this way.

http://www.mobilitywod.com/2012/01/episode-363-pre-squat-hip-opener-mob-rx/

Here is the link, happy squatting.

It does make a big difference from a foam roller, but using the lacrosse ball is a pain in the ass.Focus on your diet if you really want to be fit.  You could have an excellent routine and it would be severely handicapped if your diet was shit. Also try to focus on compound movements until you've built a solid foundation. This means dumbell press, deadlift, squats, bent over rows, overhead dumbbell press, all of these should be the basis for your weight training. Don't go super heavy on one workout and slack on the rest. You should build an even physique, upper and lower body. Removed. Please read the wiki before posting.I go to life time fitness and pay $150 a month.... I also feel like an idiot.I'm European and I do keep forgetting that people turn on the Super Bowl just to watch the commercials. I just found out I've been taking about 80 grams less protein than I should every day.

Thanks for the help, I haven't tracked them separately like that.Alright thanks I've already checked out plenty of other subs tho. Appreciate your response regardlessAlright thanks I've already checked out plenty of other subs tho. Appreciate your response regardlesscoffee and a nap.SS. :) Good to hear! Wasn't about to give up, but damn that shit was painful!Dang, that blows. I wish gyms weren't so crooked. I can't speak entirely about GAT. However I have a friend who lives off of GAT products (he's not a rep, although he wishes he was). And GAT has some great products with their pre and protein. Now when it comes to the other stuff I have no idea.

And with me, I never had any luck with GAT Pre Workout, but most pres I've taken don't seem to effect me at all.

As far as jetfuel t-300, no idea. Good on you for spotting it though, be sure to thoroughly do your research. It might be some kind of labeling they have to put on there.Yea with these types of things i'd much rather eat a chicken breast with some tasty sides than drinking a bulk supplement.   I understand if you are on the go but man if you have the luxury of eating more why would you not take every advantage of it.   You will miss it as soon as you go on a cut. I know that's how it works, but in all seriousness, I know for a fact that if I had to lose weight, I wouldn't cut calories.  At all.  It's tedious, it's annoying, it would make me obsessive.  I would likely skip entire meals simply because I'd rather not eat than count the calories (which would be effective, but not calorie counting).  I'd also rather eat lots and spend loads of time burning it off, because cardio makes me feel *awesome* and lifting is really just a task for me.  I get no joy out of lifting, but I lift so that I can do even *more* cardio without hurting myself.  I did once have to lose ~7lbs to get back to my ideal raceweight after spending 5 months in a place where it was very unsafe for me to run outside but I kept eating the same amount I've always eaten because eating is awesome, so I started running the amount that I used to run (30-90mins/day of varying intensities, 6-7days/week), then added in 30-60mins of swimming or cycling 3-4 days/week after the runs.  1-2 hours of straight cardio is mentally easier for me to handle than spending 10 minutes determining how many calories are in a meal I'm going to consume.

Everyone's different, I know.  Counting calories works for some people,but I'm certainly not unique or special in my preferences.  I know a lot of people who would spike up their weekly mileage instead of going on a "diet" if they had to drop a few pounds.Keeping it real here.

Your bodyfat percentage is probably a good bit higher than that.
You probably don't consume as many calories as you think. No matter what, you're not eating enough. Since you asked what macros were somewhere in here, I'm guessing you don't track calories/macros, so that furthers my idea that you think you're eating more than you actually are.

I will investigate that. Since my cut is 700 calories (0,2lb a day). But what do I do with the water weight? and thanks for the linkRemoved for rule #2, sorrySize is everything. Are you an idiot? Lol? We work out to either get slimmer or bigger.Dude, you weren't fucking kidding. I popped over, figured I'd get at least a light workout in, just to maintain the routine if nothing else. Started on the leg press...soreness was almost totally gone by the third set. Squats and DL were on the lighter side but I fucking did it! Legs are jelly now, but not super painful. :)Sounds about right, and your progress is about where I would put it over a 2 month span. Over an hour of rigorous weightlifting can burn upwards of a thousand calories. 3-4 times a weeks yields roughly an extra 500 cals a day above maintenance. I'm 6'5" and I sit about 2500 - 2700 a day, so 3000 sounds reasonable. My new flavor of whey pretty often doesnt't fully breakdown when I shake it up. Leaving chunky whey occasionally when I drink... :(

Thoughts on a remedy? Shaking harder/longer has -not- worked. I would rather stay with water to avoid changing out my calories throughout the day.It's bad and any site called brobible.com is also bad. You get used to it

Source: [My hands](http://i.imgur.com/fKefy2r.jpg)One occasionally reads about sarcoplasmic hypertrophy versus myofibrillar hypertrophy where the latter is associated with high intensity and is better for powerlifting and the former is correlated more with size and how much lactic acid your muscles can handle.

Is there any reality in this distinction?I recently have injured the muscles in the shoulders. I have been doing crossfit for about 6 months and recently have developed tendinitis and scar tissue build up around the rotator cuffs. I have been been doing better the past few weeks with really watching what I am doing, warming them up and cooling down the shoulders every workout.

I didn't know it was touchy.

Thanks though, I'll definitely be tracking everything much closer from here on out.I never use a sauna, but I live in an area where the summers are often hot and humid. I can see what you mean, it is nice sometimes to just sit outside and sweat (as long as I have water and an a/c'd building to go back to). YouTube's algorithm favors long form contentMacros are short for macronutrients.  In most fitness conversations, that means the breakdown of how many grams of carbs, fats, and protein you are taking in.No that's not how it works.  The BBB is pretty strict in regard to who responds to complaints and who doesn't.  Take a look at them on the BBB for yourself.  They had 2300 complaints in the past three years, and resolved all of them.

Also, it is worth mentioning here that she has nothing to lose by calling the BBB and everything to gain.I know you're joking I just wanted to be a dweeb hahaRead the other comment. Promise that it works 100%. You go back to the gym and keep lifting.I'd say ground flax seed is still worth supplementing with despite this. But you are 100% correct in that Flax seed doesn't contain the DHA Omega-3's you look to find in fish.Thanks! I need to find a chart with our Uni's food cals on it or something Just keep lifting.Fap gainsWell you obviously get your mom to talk to his mom and they'll straighten this whole thing out.

Seriously, get over it.  Some people are dicks.  You aren't required to pay attention to them.Foam Roller may help. Unless your school's rec doubles as a top-of-the-field research laboratory, no form of measurement device they have can be accurate to that degree.  If anyone has told you that this device is accurate to even 1% accuracy, they grossly misunderstand what the device does.

It's not the variance in calories that's the issue, it's that you're not sure what you're taking in each day.  Are you sure you're even getting to 2500? Start keeping track of your calorie intake.

For advanced pull-up progressions, there's a few options. Muscle-ups should only be pursued if you've achieved a good deep ring dip, and one-arm pullups are a huge step beyond pullovers. I would suggest progressing to weighted pullups, or archer pullups if you don't want to buy a dipping belt.

Box HeSPU are definitely more of a shoulder exercise, but PPPUs should hit your chest. Dips with a forward lean are a good bodyweight exercise for your chest.

Hmmm, your L-sit does seem to be lagging a bit - are you very tall by any chance? L-sits are much harder for people who are significantly over 6 feet. You might want to post a form check video on Friday and see if people can spot any problems with your L-sit.

Hope this helps!WutAnd increase the difficulty further by doing these:

ps: learn2readAlso depends on your goals. There are people who take nutrient tracking to the next level. These people weigh and track everything to the gram. Or you can be more casual, tracking cals for a bit to get a handle on ballpark numbers and proceed with living life.

I like to eat. If I'm hungry, I will eat delicious food. Sometimes it's that biscuit with gravy. You just have to practice some self control so that you don't eat 5 biscuits. I never said anything about your doctor. I'm sure he's seen plenty of injuries. Also, I'm not giving you advice; I'm disputing your statement "a bad exercises in long term."

[Third comment of this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2t47s0/my_doctor_told_me_that_squatting_is_the_stupidest/)comment of this threadYou are right, but honestly the only time I clip while on hanging from one hand is when I'm doing a route I know very well, and just feel like showing off.  also the rice 150g, two toast and some veggie and fruit..but yeah aint muchThis is awesome, I think I might forego the Pavel fighter pullup routine for this one. I especially liked the pushup routine at the start, as well. Sounds like a very classic manly thing to do; bang out 3 sets of max pushups between your various morning activities and finish with a shower.This is a relief.
More biscuits is always the answer.Maybe.  Depends what sort of diet you're eating.  It could just be a natural effect of burning more calories than you're taking in.As many as possible / till failure.Going to failure.Not always. If you can get a good heel/toe hook, it'll help keep you in close to the overhang while taking pressure off of your arms. That way you only have to support a fraction of your body weight.You do realize there is a difference in stress on the knees between powerlifting squats and bodyweight fitness squats right?   Generally "stress on knees" in concern with squats is degradation of the cartilage due to weight amplifying the friction.  Things like pistol squats don't stress the knee joint in the same manner as loading 4 plates on a bar and powerlifting.We have the real Macus Bondi here on reddit?

oh boy...I deload when I stall out hard. Deloads become more frequent as you leave the realm of novice, unfortunately. I probably deload every ~2 months using a step-back so I can bust through plateaus. take it slow dude...As someone who grew up with doctor parents [hell, my father is an orthopedic surgeon] and knows a lot of doctors, you don't seem to understand how doctors think when they give people advice. 'Should I do x?' 'No, it's bad for you'. You wanna know something really funny? Doctors automatically assume you're stupid and reckless. And because people are usually both stupid and reckless, it's honestly a smart way of doing things.

What's the best way to avoid a car accident? Don't ever leave your house dude, 100% success rate. Also, unless they specialise in it, they have very limited knowledge of exercise science.

Can x be bad for you? Most definitely, if :

a. you don't do it right or

b. you have a pre-existing injury

You don't have to squat but you don't need to explain yourself, either. 'I don't like squatting, fuck that' will suffice. If you're a healthy male and you don't fuck it up really bad then you won't get hurt.

And the funny part is I don't squat or deadlift. Because when I was 15 I fell off a balcony and fractured my L4 by landing ass first. I gave them a good try, but I couldn't even get to a 1.5xbw squat and 2xbw dead without my injury flaring up/ Because if you're not progressing, one way or another, you're basically masturbating. I can do heavy rows, shrugs, standing press, you name it, but squats and deads fuck me up.

I don't really care what you do. And I also have no personal investment in promoting squats, either. But don't fucking tell me 'lol my doctor said squats r bad'. You don't need to do squats, just like you don't need to do ANY exercise. If you even read the post, he says you don't NEED to squat. Why do you need someone to tell you don't 'need' an exercise? It's common sense.

His post assumes you're not smart enough to work on mobility, flexibility, proper progression, or even eating enough. If you do these things and choose a very moderate stance width, parallel depth etc you're not going to get hurt, period. But he assumes you don't care enough to do any of that. And, no offense, but looking at your post, you're EXACTLY the kind of person his post talks about. Your routine is random and has numerous obvious flaws and not only did you not put any thought into it, you also refuse to follow proven routines. If someone puts a bar on your back and tells you to start adding weight on the bar, you probably are going to get hurt. You're getting your information from a reddit post that's trying to tell people that he shouldn't be 'shamed' into doing squats.

Again, I don't care if you squat or not, but having people spreading 'something my doctor told me' kind of half-truths is part of the reason the fitness industry ended up this deep in the gutter. The squat is a great exercise, not because reddit told me so, but because it's a uniquely amazing leg and core builder. But you can do a million other leg exercises and get really great results.

The fact that you're trying to convince me that I'm 'brainwashed' while using someone else's opinion is pretty ironic. I'd just suggest that you read the relevant FAQs, the information there is very reliable. Compare that to something like t-nation, which is 50% garbage, and you get a great starting point.

what is a "maximum effort" set..?The weight could be from water your fat cells are storaging, if you are sure you are not eating above maintenance the water will go away at some point (you will piss some pounds overnight). My advice is: make sure your diet is on check and be patient, maybe reduce your sodium intake and skip cheat day for a couple weeks. My arm position was somewhat to the side but tucking them in does have the same effect. I do believe that some conditioning is needed before attempting them in the future. I really do not want to injure my elbow. "What? Your doctor is obviously a quack, you should be squatting. Here's a bunch of unsolicited medical advice."

... Your comment is exactly this. Broscience.. it worth nothing. I prefer to take advice from people who studied in medicine over random guy on internetCan i do this in addition to the recommended routine? I'm at 8/7/5 dead hang pull upsIn a proper squat most of the weight is carried by the hip joint, not the knee. Doing them bodyweight shouldn't cause any issues if you've never been injured before.They're probably fine. People recommend the MDUSA ones because we know they're solid because a bunch of people bought them when they were on sale, not that they are necessarily better than anything on the market. I've also heard good things about the rogue rings as well.It depends what dish you're making exactly, rice is great, especially brown rice! As long as there is variety in a diet it's fineIt's usually on overhangs where I can do a dead hang...better than overexerting my core and legs to keep myself horizontal.I like this guy comment:

Here's the standard Fittit response to any question regarding medical advice:

   &gt;Person: "I get a weird pain in my shoulder when I do overhead press, what does it mean?"

   &gt; Fittit: "Go see a doctor. We don't give out medical advice here."

But when it's about squats...

    &gt;Person: "I have bad knees, and my doctor has advised me not to do squats. Any sort of alternative I could do?"

    &gt;Fittit: "What? Your doctor is obviously a quack, you should be squatting. Here's a bunch of unsolicited medical advice."

Also my doctor told me squat was the worst exercises possible because of the pressure you put on your knee..  but yea Doctor don't know shit, squat is a godly exercise because r/fitness and r/bodyweightfitness tell you so.What questions specifically?Thank you for this! Will definetly include in routine. You should update the FAQ more often. There are some questions that pop up frequently enough that warrant a post on the FAQ.Do them on your knees or the wall to condition yourself. How is your form? Make sure your elbows don't splay out, and they're tucked into your side.Strict form summersault.As long as you eat rice aswell... otherwise your aminos aren't complete.Casein is inferior to whey protein though when it comes to bulking.I think that going to L Sit pullups next would probably be better than jumping all the way to assisted one arms.It a great program - I did it for 4 weeks (not nearly long enough but I got bored and went back to just doing PPL 6 days a week) and it was great.

I went from a max of 8 to a max of 15.

My week totals were: 155, 189, 222, 210 - week 4 was tough and I was getting bored so decided to know it on the head but I can still do 15 if I need to.I'm currently following the beginner routine quite strictly for 3 weeks or so. I've noticed progress but since the pull-up is the most challenging exercise for me, I might focus on this program for a month or so, keeping some stuff from the beginner routine such as the planks/skill work for rest days.15-20.

You want to develop the tendons to deal with the massively increased strain found in one arm pull up related movements.

What exercises are you using to target your lower abs?Awesome, thanks!&gt; Not packing the shoulder hurts like a motherfucker.

If it hurts like a motherfucker, you're not ready for it and you shouldn't be doing it.It's not perfect, but I can hold it.oh boy...If you can't get upwards to the high teens (17, 18, 20+) on a consistent basis I would definitely stay away from training for it as you probably wouldn't have the strength for it.

Once your there, give weighted a shot first then proceed to weighted and negatives.Is that all the food you're eating every day? 6 eggs and 600g of chicken, etc? Doesn't seem like much. Try increasing your protein and fat intake a little, and add one interval sprinting workout a week. Nothing fancy, something like 30s hills with a couple minutes rest.Ross Enamait is great. He's like the fairy godfather of inexpensive, diy training equipment.Plus, if you can have 3 points of contact, you're unnecessarily pumping out that arm. Until that one time where your hand blows off and you take a 25' whipper with the 4 extra feet of slack you pulled out hahaCheck this out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q59ZvPhpySMYes, they suggested pull-ups and push ups. I think I can manage thoseWhy? Why?Yes, it came with the carry bag.  Very easy to put up and take down, and pretty light as its made of aluminium.

One word of caution - I bought the Elite XL version and it was too tall for my ceiling, even though I thought it would fit.  You have to assemble it mostly lying down, then tip upright.  This adds a little to the clearance required.  Wasn't a major problem though, as I just took a hacksaw to it and made it a couple of inches shorter!Hanging from one hand while clipping a quickdraw can look pretty cool.  Really bugs some of my friends that I can do it and they can't :)ahh.. Well, I don't really like the beginner routine. For now I can't use a pull-up bar and I consider squat as a bad exercises in long term.I can vouch for this, I did it for 6 weeks and went from 3 pullups to 12.

The Mondays are magical.Thank you. Will look into it.Also curious about this...On mobile right now,but yesterday I saw a video for a better veriation of the lunge for the knee, the reverse lunge.
There is less pressure on the knee and more on the quads.In my case I can do close to 20 pull ups, and I can do a one-armed pull up. I'd say you should do something similar. Seeing as with much more than 15 you're training more endurance than strength. Those are fine. Here is a cool progression for you to try:
http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/pull-up-progression.html

Weights and negative are ideal, but this would work to.No, I mean follow the routine on the side bar, with a little imagination there is nothing to buy.yea.. I should buy oneHere you go (was on a mobile before): https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2s25pe/people_who_can_do_a_one_armed_chin_upspull_ups/What results did you see, if you don't mind me asking? Were they aesthetic or just functional?I browsed your post history and didn't find it. Care to link?What about archer pull ups? I don't have 150 lbs of weights just lying around. SeriouslyNice video of progressions for bodyweight curls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-udHJtfdvYIt's been scientifically researched how much you put on in certain time periods you're either mistaken or an anomalyHave you tried looking at the beginner routine?i started weighted and negatives once i could do 30 pull ups in one goGet up to 3 sets of 8 before looking into training for one armed pull-ups. There are lots if ways I move towards it after that. One if the posts I submitted asked people how they got there as I am working on it at the moment. It would be worth a read.i would say just wear a bagpack and do pull ups and negative reps. do until you can't do anymore. and then remove the bagpack and do some pull ups and negatives.&gt;Well.. you know the guy who eat a lot but stay skinny? Thats me.

You've defied the laws of thermodynamics? It's not how many pull-ups its how heavy you do 'em. Once you can 3 sets of 8, start adding weight with a set-rep scheme of 5*5. Once you can do about 65% bodyweight pull up, do negatives.Use myfitnesspal to count the actual calories, see how much calories you intake every day. And as you lower down your BF, start changing those "cheat days" into one day in the week "cheat meal". My suggestion.All kidding aside, you are better off trying something closer to the sidebar than messing with weughts you need 80 reps for.It's because you're weak.


edit: I feel I should point out, that while weak, you can still easily take up rock climbing. A lot of it is technique, and nothing will come close to the open hand grip conditioning that rock climbing provides.seconded. I vigourusly trained gymnastic movements, swimming, and athletics for a test at a sports university. I did way too much, way too fast and suffered from forearm splints/inflammation.
I'm very experienced in different sports and fitness, but the tendons and small muscles involved in many bodyweight exercises weren't as developed as the larger ones i trained doing compound lifts.
Time for adaption is key.Like it, but I'd love to see someone do L-sit to planche.Assuming you kip into position, how about a strict muscle up (or a muscle up as I call it)?

As for flags, and so on, I'd already be training them anyway. Can you do front levers? If not, then start training flags and front levers. And back levers if you want.

Oh, and planche.Being tired is a good indicator as long as you aren't sick and get enough sleep.In the UK and protein is MILES cheaper than Quark in terms of protein /. Proof on requestONE ARM ZOMBIE HANDSTANDnah man just keep doing 3-5 sets of max reps 2-3 times a week for the next 4-6 weeks. After that do 6-8 weeks of Armstrong pullup program. so in 10-14 weeks you should be at +10 atleastNope, doesn't happen.

As you lose weight your BMR goes down, so you need to decrease your calorie intake to continue to lose weight at the same rate as before.

Your body cannot magic up more energy or suddenly become more efficient just because you're not eating enough.

If you starve someone of all food, they will continually lose weight as their body will metabolize everything to survive. Your energy needs to come from somewhere.I got the exercise from the GB foundation program, it's the bridge between dragon flags and starting to do actual front lever progressions.
I dont have a computer and use reddit via phone app which doesn't show me sidebars or subreddit rules.  So I apologize if I broke any of them.You've probably got no clipping mode on. Type IDCLIP to turn it off again.drsgon flags   *can*   Be done with straight arms, but it's definitely way harder than putting your hands behind your head.

Even harder than that is trying to do them just by pressing off the floor.  Think reverse locust.  Good luck finding anyone who can do that, although I've seen a few.Human flag took much practice - and really hurt every part of my torso - but it is worth it - now I can do Human Flag 'horizontal push-ups' and Human Flag on a rope, check it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQJw6-BXVB4

Best advice - when you go for it and fail, DO NOT PUT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND - just hang as long as you can, tucking your knees up. It will serve to speed up the way you acclimatise your arms/shoulder for the tensions it must soon endure. Supinated muscle-ups - palms facing you! The most 'powerful' muscle up!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCWbVW4HqyY

If you can, try to replicate hanging leg raises on a stall bar.

That is, do not let your arms and upper body help with the movement.

The best option is to do them against something such that you can't move, but having a friend holding your back in place also works.

[Like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqhnbFkcNE4). They become much much harder.Your elbows flare because it makes the exercise easier.  Also it doesn't 'hit the chest more' like the bros think it does.  Admittedly the increased alignment of muscle fibres is sweet, but a diamond Pushup would activate more muscle fibres, so....

I digress.  Keep your elbows tucked in.Dan John has a great que for packing the shoulder!

You know those little labels sawn into the neck of basically all shirts?
Raise your arm and reach for it *boom* There you have it. Shoulder is packed.hmm you can try :) It hits my lower back pretty hard.what i meant was your metabolism will slow down, if you cut down on calories to fast. And its gets much harder to burn fatHow's your handstand?The first part in no way validates your retarded claim that spirulina contains pure AA's.

 Dried spirulina contains about 60% (5171%) protein. It is a complete proteincontaining all essential amino acids, though with reduced amounts ofmethionine, cysteine and lysine when compared to the proteins of meat, eggs and milk. It is, however, superior to typical plant protein, such as that fromlegumes.[2][9]The U.S. National Library of Medicine said that spirulina was no better than milk or meat as a protein source, and was approximately 30 times more expensive per gram.[10]

I'd like to add Power Clean after OP has learnt to do deadlift properly.

I find it really fun and, my god, it has made my traps grow like never before even though I do it only once a week.

The only problem is finding a good resource to learn it. I found Starting Strength's method very effective.Thanks for pointing me to that, Didn't quite understand it all, so I may be back with some more questions soon, thanks for that though :)
Sounds fun. I'll try this but with Elsa!Read the FAQ. All the information you need is in there! :)Packing the shoulder is different to locking the arms at a slight bend, which I am vehemently opposed to.

What I meant was: scapula depression.  It's the difference between hanging off your last and hanging off your serrated anterior.  Not packing the shoulder hurts like a motherfucker. Presumably you can work up to it, but I'm not concerned much with one arm hangs at the moment.Starvation mode does not exist.

If you eat too little, your body has no choice but to metabolize fat and muscle. If you eat at a moderate deficit and work hard with sufficient protein, you will minimize muscle loss, while losing fat.Not sure if I am mistaken here, but all I found about the exercises you suggested where done with weights. I don't have a gym membership and exclusively train doing body weight exercises at home, but in case there was a misunderstanding on my part, pls tell me.

Thank you for your help anyways.

Surprisingly I was able to do one hand hangs before 15 pull ups. That being said just hang with both hands then alternate between slowly letting go of the other hand. Or decrease the number of gripping fingers on one side while doing your normal pull ups.Thank you for your informative reply!You are going to struggle to build muscle running 30 miles a week unless you are eating huge amounts.

Eat a fuckload, monitor your weight and work from there.My biggest issue is my hip flexor are really strong and my lower abdominal are super underdeveloped.

Just found this out and now I'm trying to fix it. :-/Spirulina is a nuclear plant. Nuclear plants are those which are borderline between plants and animals. amino acids are basic building blocks of the body. Of the 22 amino acids that you require, only 14 can be manufactured by the body. The other essential amino acids must be derived daily from the foods you eat. They must also be available to the body simultaneously in the proper ration or they cannot be properly utilized. The cell walls of the most vegetables are composed of cellulose, not digestible by humans. Spirulina cellulose is composed of mucopolysaccharides which are complex sugars, easily digestible, thus freeing considerable energy. Digestibility tests have shown spirulina to be 83 to 95% digestible. The usable protein in spirulina, therefore, because of its digestibility and amino acid balance, is about 90% the highest of any protein other than casein, and that by the way, is the standard by which all protein assimilation is scientifically evaluated.
**For a comparison**:, an 8 ounce steak is about 1.8 ounces of protein, whereas only .27 ounces, or 7.6 grams, are actually usable protein. When we take niacin to get the flushing reaction, a lot of times we're releasing trapped antigens because the steak and the chicken that we eat today are so full of all kinds of different hormones used to make the animals grow faster and bigger.
Spirulina, on the other hand, is 70% protein, 90% digestible and provides 5 ounces, 140 grams of usable protein in each of 8 ounces. That is 18 times more protein than a steak, with a little, if any, waste. The body's easy assimilation of spirulina protein facilitates the assimilation of the entire vitamin formula. Also spirulina has chlorophyll in it, another essential that assists in the development of healthy red blood cells in the body. The carbohydrates found in spirulina provide energy in several different forms, including a rare sugar known as rhamnose. Rhamnose is more biologically active than other sugars because it combines more readily with other nutrients.Milk is still cheaper and contains free calories on top. Tastes nice and can be bought virtually everywhere. You have no fucking idea what you are talking about. Muscle doesn't grow by mitosis, spirulina doesn't contain free amino acids, you don't waste most of your protein intake and DNA doesn't only consist of amino acids.

I mean come on, get your ass off those stupid ass vegan websites and think about what you learned in high school. The reason muscle is rich in protein is because of the myofibrils: actin and myosin.If I'll post a picture would you be able to guess how much am I? I will order what you suggested. Just want to know where I stand at the moment You get used to it, I kinda build it up. Jusy like your lactase production slows down when you stop drinking milk, it will go up once you start drinking more of it.I can't see why Scheuerman's disease should prevent you from weight lifting once you're past puberty and your bones have ossified. I believe conservative treatment of the disease includes some resistance training?Climbing is all about your legs.  15 pull-ups is plenty for most any route.Listen to this guy! I started doing a bunch of one arm hangs because I saw it in a youtube video to increase shoulder flexibility (which I need to do). I worked up to it over a couple of weeks, but obviously not slowly enough as I then had to take 4 weeks off the bar to let my finger joints recover.hey man I use a Caliper, standard one from amazon for 5usd or so. I think its the best method, considering cost/effectiveness. Just measure once a week to have insights May be I'm too late and you now have another test coming up, but do you have the time to post it? *fingers crossed*A question. How do you know how much body fat are you? Did you check or just used the images that show each percentage and figured it out?
I'm with the same goal right now and I'm not 100% sure how much am I. Maybe you will be able to tell Just remember in calories counting not to over do it.
Don't reduce more than 700 calories from your daily need or you will lose lots of muscle in the progress. L-sit to handstand. [example](http://youtu.be/0ZbmssIoKSw?t=6m24s)http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_what_do_you_think_about_x_workout.3FRule 1: read the FAQ from the sidebar before posting.Yeah maybe youre right. Thought you would be getting complicated, like to little calories - body goes into starvation mode.

Maybe ill try my fitness pal :) Thanks for the help for sureForward roll, backward roll and pullover are next logical progressions on rings.Both might be. I will check them out.!! Sorry! I meant the exact opposite as I'm sure you figured out &gt;.&lt; I misread weight loss as weight gain!

Right so you should eat less :) but either way counting the actual calories would be the best next step imo.

Edit: lots of people use myfitnesspal to track what they eat and count calories. You can give that a try if you want. You can input your targets and your particulars and it has a formula or whatever to help. It's one thing you could tryI can hang with one hand, but I did not get this way from doing bodyweight exercises. I did deadlifts. Deadlifting is a killer way to increase your overall strength. I found it is the only exercise that bodyweight fitness cannot properly duplicate.

I mainly do bodyweight fitness exercises, but in addition to that I do deadlifts, and (for fun) bicep curls.

Thanks man.
Eat more to loose weight you mean? sounds counterintuitive...If you're stalling you simply need to eat more I guess. One thing that could help is counting the actual calories instead of the specific foods you're eating and comparing that to your TDEE etc. OAPU and OACUHMMM :)

Go for Tiger Bend Handstand Pushups - Thats Beast.I have done dragon flags, I don't know how many I can do though as (dumb as it sounds) I can't find anywhere in my house to do them. Those are a good idea though.Dragon flags, at least the core component, is easier than standing ab wheel IMO.I guess you could wear ankle weights on the hanging leg raises...?

Have you done dragon flags? I don't know if those are harder or easier than where you're atThe same [PVC-webbing pull-up handles Ross Enemait uses for pullups](http://rosstraining.com/blog/2011/08/25/doorway-pull-up-handles/) could be used as anchors for dragon flags. Just slip them under the door instead of over.Milo is a chocolate malt milk additive we get here in Aus, I thought it was everywhere.  It's good.

Metamucil is ground psyllium husks for some extra fibre, I also thought is was widely available...It looks like the only thing stopping you from doing these unassisted is balance, try just going down without holding the pole, steadying yourself with your hands on the ground and pushing back up. Believe it or not.
You'd normally not use your musculature like that in climbing. In fact, we rely heavily on the passive tension of our tendons and ligaments to hang on the wall.

When you're hanging from holds in climbing, you ought to have straight and locked arms. Your grip is the only muscle activation in play.Honestly if all this came about from squats and lunges (both exercises which should engage the hip abductors), it could be the onset of IT band syndrome (I described towards end of previous post). I've battled it a bit in my soccer career and it's normally associated with runners who don't activate their glutes and rely on other minor muscles to stabilize the knee... but I imagine large repetitions of any kind could aggravate it. Im by no means an expert so please still reach out to a professional.

While you're resting it (avoiding squats and lunges), try using a lacrosse ball or tennis ball to loosen up the [gluteus medius](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Posterior_Hip_Muscles_3.PNG) in the posterior hip. From the center of your but, this will be upper portion of the muscle and towards the side.  These muscles can get exceptionally tight from sitting long periods and even if they aren't causing this mystery sensation, it's good to be proactive since they are a very common issue.

[Heres a good article talking about some of the dynamics](http://breakingmuscle.com/mobility-recovery/your-it-band-is-not-the-enemy-but-maybe-your-foam-roller-is)This is anecdotal from what I've experienced in a decade or more of climbing:

For 95% of all climbers, the best training is more climbing. With proper rest, most people are not climbing as hard as they could. It's only a small number of climbers that really need to diversify their training in order to better their abilities.

You should still cross train because it's good for you. Just don't thinking something like, "I can't go climbing because I can't do 40 pull-ups."

I've been out-climbed by people that can't do 2.Yep, when I started rock climbing I couldn't hang by one hand. Just wasn't strong enough. Then one day on a boulder problem I hit the finish hold and in the process of bringing my second hand to the hold both my feet blew and for a split second I hung free by one hand. Then I realized I could actually do it. Not that it has many practical uses. Not like I need to stop to chalk on an overhang on a boulder problem, and most the sport climbing I do is not severely overhung.Here's a typical day for me.

Breakfast: Cheese and ham omelette. 3 eggs. Half a tub (300g) of greek yoghurt with crushed granola. Fruit. 900 calories, 40g of protein.

Dinner: 2 Sandwiches on whole bread, meat filling (beef or chicken usually) + nuts, some type of sweet like cookies or chocolate.

Tea: Brown rice with salmon or chicken and some green vegetables. Or kidney beans, peas. etc. 40g of protein.

I snack on fruits and nuts throughout the day, and drink a glass of milk with breakfast and tea, which all together take me up to about 150 - 160grams. I should probably be getting more considering I'm 6'7 but I'm making very good progress as is. For caloric surpluses and deficits, think in terms of weekly averages. Day to day doesn't matter so much. Eating more on your training days might give you the energy to exercise more intensely, but it probably doesn't make that much of a difference.I don't know if there is carryover, but PPPU elbows are usually tucked and not flared out. PPPUs are one option after getting proficient diamonds.

Another possible consideration is that the more your elbows flare out the more your shoulder internally rotates. Maybe fine for people without shoulder issues and maybe not great for people with issues. Good points.Yes, please do. And does the back lever relate to the planche that much? I keep hearing that but they don't feel similar to me at allMb front lever, side lever, planche, manna, leg strength, 90 degree pushup, rope climb, handstand and press to handstand. Or muscle up w out kipping, if you're kipping.Front leverAs a heads up, probably don't go for 7/30 if you haven't done much hanging before. That's a lot for your connective tissues to deal with suddenly.

That said, I went from never dead hanging to 3 or 4 sets of 1min every other day for a few months and saw Great results.Someone told me, "the only way to get better at rock climbing..is to rock climb".  So start there!I sincerely doubt that they're all that shitty. Probably more than good enough for what one would do for at least a couple of years, certainly for strength moves.R/griptraining I got downvoted. But peoples...do  some research I know its considered as a Godly exercise, but it is not. ..  [The first comment of this thread explain it well](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2t47s0/my_doctor_told_me_that_squatting_is_the_stupidest/) I had the same problem. I ended up putting the pullup bar between the door on the ground and put weights on the back of it. It works pretty well.Not sure why this is happening. 15 pullups is a lot. Unless you're kipping a lot, there should be enough strength there. At any rate, Awareness is right, I'd do exactly what he suggested. Also, just go climbing now. My gym has tons of newbies who can't do a single pullup and are able to climb. I have friends who do V9s who can only do like 5 pullups. As a climber, do yourself a favor and go climb!One, check form and decrease weight and keep at it for low weight high reps. Also try front squats I noticed that personally I feel my upper quads and hammys firing more on front squats.  Also smith machines can help up the weight and restrict you movement if you are pushing off one leg more than the other. Romanian Dead lifts are a solid leg workout and it helps me to think pushing my feet through the floor.

Def talk to a Dr see if there is scar tissue or ligament damage.  I have an old knee injury that will cause my knees to fill up with fluid if everything isn't perfect.  An ice pack on the knees immediately after legs day helps with that.HI Josh - agreed - nutrition is everything!

I am mad into raw ginger for the last few years - eating a raw 10gram chunk every day 20 min before training - it ensures excellent bloodflow... and a really positive muscle energy for the duration of your training. probably thoracic kyphosis, chest caved in, head juts forward, rounded shoulders. lots of youtube vids on how to open up chest. but yea visiting a personal trainer or physical therapist would be a god ideaRock climbing will give you the strength to hang from one hand if you stick to it. Just work on climbing, it will do immense work on the muscles in your forearms and will lead to holding smaller holds too. No need to train to be able to start climbing.I think that's a poor viewing angle for analyzing how "tucked in" his elbows are. It looks like his might be a bit more flared out than you may think to me.

I do mine with about a 20-30 degree angle (that is to say, my elbows stick out slightly) and that's comfortable for me. It's still working the intended muscle groups.

It also has to to with hand placement. I.e., if your fingers point to the outside of your body while doing push-ups your elbows will tuck in and vice-versa of your fingers point more to the inside. Try wanking twice a day. Worked for me. Awesome. Looking forward to it.

Thanks for all of your hard work on these!I'm not OP but I'm guessing they meant keeping your shoulders pulled down and away from your ears and your scapula pulled back and away. Did you happen to see the beginner routine on the sub? It has lots of progressions, so it's likely you can find something at your level. If not, you can read some of the FAQ and the concept Wednesday posts and make an intermediate routine. As part of that you can look through the progressions lists on this subreddit or elsewhere on the Internet.

To recap: do the beginner routine, and if you find everything is too easy for you, then do some research and create an intermediate routine.The same thing I thought when I found them. Not as cheap as using chairs, but better in my experience. They're sturdy, padded, and made specifically for dips.Knee doesn't really feel stiff and can be bend and extended without problems.

When I'm sitting at work all day I feel like it gets worse when I keep it bend at about 90%. It sometimes hurts a tiny bit when not under load but nothing compared to when I stand up, and the stinging is really only at the one certain angle. Apart from that its almost nothing.

The feeling on the outside is no pain, just a weird sensation that is similiar to warmth and beaming out a bit, the knee doesn't feel warm to the touch tho, i think.
you found the fucking answer.. it made me realise I was lifting my dumbell when I was on the balance.. I'm doneObviously, see a physician to discuss further and be sure to rest it well.  A lot of issues can come from eager beginners who jump straight from sedentary lifestyle into overuse injuries of particular motions due to extra enthusiasm about their new regiment.

For sake of side conversation/brainstorming, I'd be curious for a bit more description than just stinging.

Does the joint itself feel stiff when this stinging occurs?

Is the stinging only during load bearing moments?  Or while relaxed at 90 degrees too?

Does extension or flexion change the pain you feel (either flexion past 90 degrees or extension past)?

Is this stiffness feel like it's swollen inside the joint and can't bend any further than that 90 degree point (likely being meniscus related then)?

Does it feel similar in terms to tendonitis on the outside?  A rubbing or almost knifelike piercing pain on the outside of the knee can be associated with your illiotibial band (a tendon that basically runs from a glute muscle all the way down the side of the thigh and to the knee) which if your glutes are excessively tight, can rub against your femur's condyle (little outside knobby part of your thigh bone at the knee).
What do you mean 'packing down your shoulder'? Thanks. Its free!

3x this routine each day except sunday (Jesus Day) . I started with lower repetition and added ~10 reps when I felt it was too easy. I alway do a 10 min of stretching afterward.

Also, I'm poor so I only have two 10 pounds dumbells.. that why I do 80 repetitions.. Sounds like a form of autoregulation, a very powerful method of periodization IMO. If you are keenly aware of how you feel and your limits, it can be a great way to manage fatigue and progress.

Next week will be all about it (hopefully) and ways to further optimise it.If no bench, floor press is decent alternative, and may be safer if no spotter.

idle thought: where am I, r/powerlifting?Squats are good exercise for athletes doing sports. For the average guy trying to get some muscle or loose some weight, they tend to be bad in long term .. Its just my opinion, but replace it for goodOr keep going and sell your miracle program : )get you to some physical therapy STAT!

I've never taken a planned deload.

I am constantly adjusting my sets/reps/intensity in some way to keep pushing progress without hitting a wall. Sometimes this means I sit at similar sets/reps for a couple weeks while tweaking form, or I may be pushing weight/intensity up more aggressively but dropping volume a bit. I mostly just play by ear, I guess. If I am feeling less than 100% or I know that I'm not sleeping/eating as well as I could be, I may reduce the number of workouts that week. Of course there will be times when life gets in the way, and I don't stress over that either.

I'm sure it's not optimal, but so far it seems to be working okay for me.yes.. Also for half-banana, I just didnt know the name of the exercise, so I found a similar on internet that was called [half-banana](http://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/2014/05/06/948/n/1922729/46b78832a9d25aeb_half-banana.xxxlarge/i/Circuit-Three-Half-Banana.jpg)Well , I did take 20 pound in two month and when I look at the mirror, that clearly not fat that I gained. I don't count the calories, because my goal wasnt to loose weight.. but now I might need it to balance my gains because I might just found the recipe for unwanted swoleness. :PThe way to get stronger fingers for climbing is to climb more. Simple as that. I don't know your level, but just climb your ass off. It's the fastest and easily the funnest way to get better. Don't use the hang board, don't use the campus board, don't use the system board. Just climb climb climb. Ya, I take more than 7 minutes worth of rest during my routine. This isn't legit.Why is everyone downvoting this guy? Your back muscles and core are what is holding your body up off of the floor and is what this exercise is supposed to work. The grip seems pretty much irrelevant. I can't try one right now so I don't know how it's going to feel but lol at the downvotes. I've never heard of this or thought of doing them like this so I'm gonna try it tomorrow. Did you ever sit down and count calories before and after?  I mean really pin down the amounts?

Working out makes you hungry and if you aren't monitoring it closely you more than likely ate more.
 You are asking people to believe the likely didn't happen and you stumbled upon a recipe for swoleness...
Best thing to do with posture, exercise your core and BE MINDFUL! Are you slouching now? Sit up straight! When you're walking, are you standing up straight? No? DO IT! That is ALL it takes! I'm 2 inches taller than 2 years ago, because I'm now mindful. Not to mention the social benefits of good posture (making you look more confident and attractive)Get someone to hold you in a handstand on a trampoline (preferably not inclined) and tell him to bounce up and down ever so slightly, gently shaking the trampoline while holding you.

Fully extended shoulders, start with 30 sec. Works wonders for my kids. Thank you very much for your help. Will google everything I don't know how to do."7 minute workout"

Nope.You mean my fapping isn't homoerotic?!

In all seriousness, though, I don't think this was homoerotic, but I certainly wouldn't call if bodyweight fitness, either.It's likely that some of that is muscle, but considering it was gained in only two months, most of it is probably fat. My advice would be to cut down on your eating, slim down, and then try again, at a lower caloric surplus this time.Definitely see the physician/physio asap. It's misty likely 2 combined with 3, plus if you say you're overweight, suddenly doing exercise probably did you in. Perhaps it was also bad form, because that can put lots of pressure there.

Unfortunately, nothing can really 'replace' squats or lunges. Continue with bodyline work e.g. pushups, planks, chin/pullups. Tricep dips, sit ups should also be fine. Maybe get a hoolahoop for cardio.

For the legs specifically, do standing leg raises or hanging if possible. Standing to train balance (+ easier), hanging for core strength. This will work quads kinda, mostly core.
Another front thighs is you can extend your leg to straight while sitting, and just tense as hard as you can. Do sets of up to 60 seconds.
No idea of what to do for hamstrings, but maybe back leg swings can help.
Do calf raises for calves.

Can clarify if needed.
Whoa! Seems like a lot but I guess at your size your caloric needs are decently high. And if it's working for you don't change it!You don't need to be able to hang with one hand to start rock climbing. Most of the time in climbing you are trying to keep most of your weight on your legs. If you want to climb, go climb. You will probably find that a one arm hang comes along naturally if you do.oh. well. I tried.

wait, do you have an outward facing corner somewhere? that could work, it wouldn't be ideal but it could work.I think the key question here is this-

Will deloading allow you to train significantly enough harder than training at a level that doesn't require deloading that it will more than make up for the fact that you aren't training for a while, in terms of progress and muscle gain?

I'm inclined to think "No." but I'd like to hear other opinions.I would say that a bigger issue is your extreme self-consciousness and depression. Maybe posture is a problem, but, there are people out there with bad posture and no serious adverse psychological effects. See a therapist if you could, they help.You need to train finger hangs in addition to hand hangs and pull ups. Your fingers won't get strong enough to crimp from just pull ups.Thanks for your interest.  Here's a typical day:

Breakfast:

2 bowls of cereal with whole milk

an orange

2 cups coffee with cream

2 eggs

1/2 cup oatmeal


Lunch

Spinach salad with shredded chicken breast and cannellini beans with sesame oil dressing

2 tbs peanut butter on whole wheat bread

2 pieces fruit


Snacks

2 scoops whey protein with 1 cup whole milk and 1/2 cup oats; add 1 tsp. creatine

1 serving walnuts or peanuts

1/2 c yogurt

1/2 c full fat cottage cheese.
Click bait? Confirmed. BWF? Not even once. Next time, mark this as NSFW before subjecting the community to ambush homoerotic imagery and (and music). The "problem" is that you're eating more fuel than you're using as energy. So you're gaining weight.

Try tracking your calorie intake for a week and then make an informed decision about what to do. Alright, thanks for your insight.I know you touched on this briefly, but how important is it to keep a full grip during the whole motion? Perhaps I have tight forearms, but I find it nearly impossible to keep more than two fingers touching the bar when it hits my butt.

I tried moving my grip wider. That actually makes it *more* difficult for me to keep my hands on the bar. Since this exercise primarily targets the shoulders, am I ok letting my fingers roll out of a full grip in order to get the best range of motion for my shoulders? What do you eat for breakfast lunch and snacks?Make a clamp or an alligator with your hand. You're right, probably fine. Yup, I'm trying to find a video to show you and right now [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4JwPmq745Q) is the best I can seem to find. Instead of using a smith machine you just use a pole and a door frame. You do dragon flags with a bar at shoulder height? Im talking about this exercise http://www.t-nation.com/training/dragon-flagI'm not sure what you mean about triangular grip but as long as it doesn't hurt, you're probably fine?At least OP is honest! Nope, I hold the bar out in front of me at shoulder height (think almost like a front lever) and pull it into the door frame.Those who don't want to get salmonella

it doesnt move up?I cant fit my fingers under the doors in my house : /Make sure to give tendons the proper rest!I use a bit of conduit (really a broom or any kind of thin pole will work) and do straight arm dragon flags on the door frame.That settles it, I'm using the back from now on. Does the differing grip have any bearing on effectiveness? They're very different, circular vs triangular. Any difference in the wrist? I just do them with my hands under my bed, but anything heavy enough should be good. Unless it's too dirty down there, you could get away with using a good bookshelf if there's a gap on the bottom. I'm the least picky person about where I manage to do them though, so ymmv. &gt;An advice or tip would be more than appreciated.

Lots of good advice in this thread. Here's a quick 30-second video I made on [how to sit down with perfect posture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDoKPeZu-o8) so you don't immediately enter in a slouched position. (The original, longer video is [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSyw8yOyEnk))Use a door. edit- for clarity, close it and grasp under it.Being in one position for long periods of time causes hysteresis, or changes in tissue length. The muscles/ligaments that are being stretched will get longer, and the ones that are are being flexed will get shorter. Typically, with long hours of sitting the hip flexors get shorter. When you stand, they want to stay that length and since you don't have the core strength to oppose it, they will pull down on your pelvis. This causes a chain reaction up your spine, leading to increased lumbar lordosis, among other things. Most people feel low back pain as a result. You're very fortunate though, you're young and you're changing your habits now!

To improve, I'd suggest core exercises like planks and glute exercises like the glute bridge. Add that to some psoas and other hip flexor stretches and you're headed in the right direction! Pair all this with the beginner's routine and you're gonna be looking and feeling fantastic. Like others said, it's still good idea to see a physical therapist or sports chiropractor to give you care and support as you work through this. Good luck! I drape some folded towels over the backs of the chairs for a more comfortable grip. Just gotta get creative. :)Work up to a 120s two handed hang before you go for one handed dead hang.Have you used chairs? I'm a couple weeks into support via the beginner routine and my hands hurt a lot as I use the curved metal arms. Edit: forgot the picture. http://imgur.com/RCOtQnG

I weigh them down with 4L water bottles and bags of sugar, so I can actually use the back of the chairs instead with a different grip, it hurts less. I don't really know what I'm doing, I wish it wasn't winter. There's a park nearby that has what I need. So, like if I fall asleep at 7:30PM after working out that day, is my intensity in the appropriate range?Don't be like that.  Sure, you may never do a back limber, but you can still achieve a press handstand.  You'll just have to planche it.

Don't let it stop you from getting strong as shit.Typically when I'm doing the routine, I'm doing 30 seconds at a time with 90 seconds rest, works out pretty well to have enough energy to get a strong hold for the entire time.

Ultimate goal in my opinion is probably the ability to do freestanding handstands, at least that is my ultimate goal. :BTry the chest pec stretch with your arm internally rotated. You need to stretch out your biceps. Assuming you know the chest pec stretch where you rotate over the arm? If not I'll find a video.Sweet. I can pull off a back lever but it feels too strained. Can't wait!Sure. Just note that it'll take months to get to this point even w previous weight training. Thanks again.

I've been training legs with weights for awhile now so I will definitely try these next time I don't have access to weights.Hey,

I too recently got really fed up with my posture. I've had back pain for years and have been to several Chiropractors to try to fix my back pain. I finally started to do some stretches for my hip flexors and psoas and found them helpful to a point. I finally started seeing a Physiotherapist who made a bigger difference in a few sessions than I had noticed (via side profile photos) in one month. I had to stop my sessions though because I broke my leg which makes doing some of the work in the sessions difficult/impossible. However, once I'm healed I will be back. Make sure you find someone experienced in posture correction or you will end up wasting your money for subpar results.  I have the same posture problems. Almost exactly but mines also because im tall and ive spent my entire life bending over so i can hear what people are saying aside from computer and all that.

To answer your question i dont feel like its helping ive been doing it for two months now. Today i discovered that a back bridge will help. Its sonething that i havnt been focusing on but i will now.

I will mention though thatdespite not feeling like its helping my posture my girlfriend commented several times last week how i look taller and broader than usual.Thanks guys, these are all very good ideas, I'll try them all :)Do weighted hangs with two arms and you will get strong to hold on one arm overtime.Yes, but the cost of falling goes up as you get older. Also trampolines are fun. You're not strong enough.

Try hanging with both hands, but one has X fingers still attached to the bar.

Work down to middle finger, then ring, then pinky, then hang by one arm.

Be careful, as the tendons in the fingers are fragile and need proper recovery.Given enough time (I'm talking months), you wouldn't need to do so anymore. This guy does them pretty well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70TLeRfK75o
Your grip strength isn't strong enough. Thanks for the link.

It seems pretty normal that people do a kind of half-knee push up to get off the ground. I was hoping maybe there was a better way to do it.You can train and do flips without the aid of a trampoline.So your goal is to lose weight?A back flip. Anecdotally, when I started the beginner program I had bad posture, pain in my lower back when I walked to much, and hunched shoulders.

The beginner routine, supplemented with some shoulder mobility and just reading about how to orient my hips (i.e. keep my glutes tight) made that pain virtually disappear. I haven't kept up with it as much as I like, but everytime I stop my back pain gets worse slowly over the course of a month or two as I just sit around, and then it starts getting better in the first week that I begin exercising again.

So yes, I think it does.I tried to fix my own posture. It landed me a shoulder injury I'm still recovering from. Go to the doctor, complain about back pain or something, and get a referral for a physiotherapist. Those people work magic.

You can't google your way out of this one. Self diagnosis of problems like this are nigh impossible. Get actual help.It doesn't hit the back much but thanks for the insight into the quality of your back. I have a crappy back and that looks like it would hurt my crappy backLevers and planche are strength work. Not skill work He does a lot of kicking while pulling himself up. I'm no expert, but that seems odd. Whatever he's doing is working for him though, so whatever.This is why I workout at home and not at the gym. Start estimating your body fat percentage. Weight is only one variable in your appearance. Lower BF% at the same weight will make you look very different.

I use the ymca calculator. All methods are imperfect but all you need is something to track change over time.I think that SS method for finding first weights is quite good: start with a an empty bar, do five reps. And 5 kg, do five reps. Repeat this process until bar speed slows down. You then use that weight for your your first working sets.No worries. My advice is don't change a thing. Keep your diet in check and keep progressing with those exercises. Right now you are going through body recomposition (losing fat and gaining muscle). Enjoy it while it lasts.Would you say do front/back lever, planche work on skill days or strength days?  I agree with the hanging leg raises I do those after my skill work when I have the timeI don't see how it could do anything for you that hopping down the sidewalk couldn't.Yes, the beginner routine will help your posture in addition to general physique. Scale it back to comfortable reps/hold counts in the beginning. It should feel easy the first couple weeks.

Find someone to train with who knows the movements and is able to guide you into proper form, and go do it. From your description, you may want to medically rule out scoliosis, but I know plenty of very competitive athletes with it so even that shouldn't stop you.You're me two years ago, except I didn't know I had bad posture. I've seen physios for low back pain but none of them told me "hey dude, you gotta stand straight".

Only good posture will help your posture. Bodyweight fitness, notably planks and core work, will help you getting strong enough to keep a good posture. But it won't happen on its own, you have to consciously remind yourself to stand straight with good posture. I found good YouTube videos on how to correct  excessive anterior pelvic tilt (APT), look it up! At first, as you experience, it'll feel like shit: changing your lower back position will get your neck out of alignment. You'll then have to correct your neck posture, and so on...

It took me 2-3 months to adopt a subconscious proper form, so worth it.If your goal is get more pull ups, you should be fine with doing them almost every day as long as you don't feel pain the next day.

If your primary goal is to increase reps or hit a certain amount then I would def. recommend doing it at least 5x days a week minimum.  Pull ups are generally slow to progress but it all depends on the individual.  How long did it take you to get to 3/3/3?Routine looks pretty good man, I'd say you could throw in some BW pull ups and dips in there too, maybe on Tues and Thurs?

Maybe include a few more ab exercises such as hanging leg raises or windshield wipers.  Can't hurt to have some sprints in your workout too.

Throw in some skill work (handstand progression, Planche progression variations, back lever progression, front lever progression) and you're all set.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjeWYMfjTQYou do know this is one of those motivational / progression type videos right?

Regardless of whether those are legit pull ups the guy is pretty strong.YesWhy didn't I think of that ha. So it seems I push-up about 70kg. Don't see myself pressing 70kg tho. Or maybe I should try first.And while you do this, watch for any sign of tendonitis.  If you can only do sets of 3, they may be high intensity for you.  If you get some elbow soreness, not a problem, but if it starts to persist or become a burning, back it off.The "planche" is in the default details template:

**Goal: Vague or specific (get bigger? Or master a planche by December?)**

I only do planche leans for like 5 min anywayWould you happen to know of a good video of this exercise?I found support holds to be super rough on my elbows, so I kinda skipped them.  I'm not worried, because I never plan on doing planche.

All that being said, start with ring pushups.  Learning to turn them out at the top of each rep wol give you a massive chest pump, as well as allow you to conquer the instability of the rings.

Ring dips have a very quick learning curve.  I went from 1-8 in a couple weeks, because I literally just needed to learn to handle the instability.  But you need a surplus of strength to begin with.  If you can't do multiple P bar dips you're not going to get your first ring dip.

To clarify: I find ring dips easier than p bar dips.  But when you first start doing them, they are much much harder.  I know you don't have the equipment available to build up your p bar dips before jumping on the rings, but ring Pushup progressions should do you just fine.Thank you for fixing that.**Just in case someone wants to read it :)**

I have been working out consistently for years but not just calisthenics. Most of 2014 I spent doing 5x5 stronglifts with weighted pullups/dips. A couple months back I decided to go back to body weight exercise to freshen things up and maybe help lean out.

I've also been eating a mostly paleo diet while also doing intermittent fasting. While I've leaned out a decent amount my weight hasn't really changed much for some reason. I do however weight down lots of my movements so it's not pure bodyweight. My routine is essentially the beginner routine Mon/Wed/Fri. I do 3 push, 3 pull moves instead of 2 of each because I have the extra time and I seem to handle it well. Rest days I do the skill work. I'll swing kettlebell for 10 to 20 minutes after my routine everyday for cardio endurance.

Right now this is what I'm doing Mon/Wed/Fri:

* weighed pull ups 3 of 5 to 8 reps depending on how heavy I'm weighing.

* Weighted dips 3x5 to reps.

* Weighted pistols 3x5 to 8 reps.

* L sit holds (very beginning progression I suck at these).

* Bodyweight tuck rows 3x8

* one arm push ups 3x5 to 8 reps (gradually elevating legs for more resistance).

The extra moves are assisted one arm pull up which I use a towel with. I can do 3x 8 reps with a towel but without it I can barely do one. Thinking about weighting these as well but sure if it will help. And my last movement is handstand pushup up to 3x8 reps. I like to weigh the movement s because it builds more strength but I suspect it's keeping my weight from going down.

I guess it isn't really and issue because I'm not really fat at all, just figured due to my diet my actual weight number would have dropped much more by now (I'm 5ft8 174ilb). Should I be doing this much weighted stuff or should I do other things to make these exercises harder? Anything else wrong with this routine?

TL;DR: I'm dieting and doing weighted calisthenics in hopes of having better control of my body weight without the weights.not really losing much weight despite diet. Need to know whether I should stop weighing my stuff or change anything else in my routine.It's true I find a greater level of ROM if I stretch after I'm warm.  But if I stretch at the end of a workout I'm all tight from residual muscle tension, so I can't access the same ROM I can at the start of my workout.  At this point, I'm trying to get as deep into my stretches as I can.  After I hit my flexibility goals, I'll work on doing the same thing under more difficult conditions.If you've leaned out and your weight hasn't changed you're literally building muscle and losing fat at the same time.

You're living the dream bro.  Keep it up!Sorry about the wall of text. I typed this on a phone.&gt;What weight should I use for bench press, to equal a pushup?

Do a push up on your scale.I have no idea what degree of power is lost if you start with static stretching. I would guess it's a marginal amount. However, I prefer static stretching with warmed up muscles. If there's one thing I've learned, it's to not force a planned workout when there's a fuck about session in progress.

Fuck about sessions are amazing, and one of the best bonding experienced you can have with your bros.  you get to see how you all measure up to eachother strength wise and try out new exercises you might not have done otherwise.

Treat it like a one off special occasion and go ham.  Have fun with it. yoy can always go back to your structured training later, and missing one day isn't going to hurt in the long run.Can also confirm, my hammies are huge and I still have plenty of room to progress natural leg curls without adding any weight.I cant do either deadlift or squats because i have problems with my back, i was strongly advised not to to them. However, i can do anything else. And believe me when i tell you ive made super good gains, aesthethics, and strength wise.Dude Rock climbing is going to do so much more for you than trampolining.As far as aesthetics, it's ~90% diet. Get really lean, then bulk a bit, and doing just the beginner routine from this sub will be plenty. You can look like a fitness model if you eat perfectly.* I plan deloads every 4-6 weeks when its convenient.
* I find myself MUCH stronger after a deload
* I generally still run and some skill work if i'm not deloading because i'm too busy
* I usually just do some short work on easy progressions or i don't workout at all if i'm deloading because life is getting in the way (vacation, something comes up, etc.) Just looked that shit up.  It could cause you a lot of trouble with advanced calisthenics.  Depending on the severity of your condition you may not be able to achieve the perfect body line during handstands, so that will limit you somewhat.What do you do for your leg work?Human flags are an excellent spinal erector exercise.  Combine those with Glute ham raises and you should be able to do a pretty awesome pull from the floor on your first try.

Don't worry bro, bodyweight lends itself to a more athletic look than weights anyway.  You won't miss out on anything.Do your bodyweight workout at the gym. Simple.I would bro but frankly they wouldn't be impressive.  At the end of the day, I'm only one year into this.  I went from really skinny-fat to slightly fit but you won't see any shocking progress.  I however can tell a big difference.  Also, since with me it isn't all about the beach body I am still a pasty-white hairy dude in my 30s.  I figure in 4 years I might hit that "wow" type of progress.Oh. This is actually the video that inspired me to get started about 2 months agoI basically did chinups until I got to 3x8 and then transferred to 3x5 pullups. I am now at 3x6 pullups as progress is alot slower after the noob gains haha.
shit, how have I never seen these before?Why do you care? U mirin some kid's gains?I'm also pretty sure that cheaper than iron and able to use similar plans would be to replace PVC with wood, and just create anchor holes for the supports into the base so that tear down is still a possibility.  A few anchor pins can hold things securely in place, but putting it together may be a pain if humidity fluctuates too much and causes expansion.  Properly built with supports, though, a wooden rigging system wouldn't add too prohibitively to the cost, and would still allow sturdy support and easy teardown.

Then again, I've been working out on SCH 80 PVC for quite a while, so long as the pipe doesn't become brittle, and body weight isn't too high, the danger isn't high.  If you are willing to accept the risks like I am, my advice is to always start every workout by load testing the pipe.  Just put a bit of body pressure on it bit by bit, if you hear crackling from the pressure, its getting brittle, don't work out on it, and replace it.  Know your risks and accept them on your own.Personal anecdote for you: I'm female (in case that matters) and had decent posture, I thought. I had back surgery for some ruptured lumbar disks 5 years ago and after recovery, got busy losing weight and exercising to hopefully help prevent any future problems (my back is kind of a mess). I did bodyweight for my strength training, mostly because I was so afraid of reinjuring my back with weights. So, I can't compare weight training because I've never done it but bodyweight fitness has improved my posture and balance and improved the severe strength imbalances I had in my legs (one has a lot of nerve damage from the disk issue). My whole adult life I have measured 5',6" but after about 2 years of bodyweight exercises, I measured 5',7" at my last two doctors appointments. I questioned this and measured at home too. Yep, I stand a whole inch taller now. My posture was clearly not as good as I thought it was.I have some slight anterior pelvic tilt however, when I started the beginners routine, It has been getting progressively better over the months, just my experience though.Awesome, thanks for the thorough answer.Thanks. Sometimes I forget that people have other goals.I'm not super concerned with a 1-3% decrease in power generation.  I'm hardly training near my 1RM anyway.I'm pretty sure that stuff still screws into eachother in the same way.  The main problem using galvanised pipe is that it's really expensive.It certainly helped me! Others have commented here with advice so I'm just going to leave an anecdote: last year I had the opportunity to meet with a bunch of friends who I hadn't seen in about a year and a half. I had been doing the startbodyweight.com routine for a couple of months, and pretty much everyone asked me if I was taller. I did not grow a single centimeter, it was just better posture (and I think having broader shoulders make you look taller).

I've also eliminated my back pain and shoulder pain from using a computer all day.Working out in general has improved my posture tremendously. You force yourself to use good form while lifting or performing other exercises, and in time it helps you keep that form throughout the day. Currently in the process of a Back Lever article :)Also, the little rental stand right there sells chalk which comes in real handy. Can confirm, have been doing natural hamstring curls for the better part of a year, people tell me my legs look like tree trunks.That is not true.  It is not water weight like what they say, but you do need to consume enough water to not get dehydrated.  I also would not recommend creatine in pill form, as I've heard bad things from it.  And I have never lost much, if any, weight after stopping creatine intake.  And to clarify - take it post-workout.  Pre-workout won't have the strength/size effects that you want, as it is used for endurance (kind of confusing, but taking it before working out is supposed to help you workout longer, along with the stimulants in it).That sounds tight! I may be there in a few weeks time. Next week, I may be at an ANW event in San Antonio, but the following week I'll probably be free.Check out [Strength Unbound](http://www.strengthunbound.com). This guy doesn't use weights except for dumbbells when doing pistols I believe. He also hangs out on this subreddit sometimes as /u/waldo56.
Check out his comment on this very subject [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/28mwy9/a_general_comparison_of_pistols_to_barbell_squats/cicgpts)yes, thank you :)yes, thank you :)I do presses and HS balancing pretty much everyday as a work capacity kind of thing. Probably should have mentioned that I already have the straddle planche for 2 seconds, I'm just looking to improve it, and 5 seconds seemed like a solid benchmark for 4 months.

Edit: Also I just saw your post, you're strong as fuck man. When did you start training for OAHS?Hooray for cholesterol!

I supplement with eggs, tuna, and peanutbutter. I like this idea a lot. Will try implementing thisI mix and match, I do pullups to failure and then finish my set to 8 with negatives. It's been working well to get me close to 3x8 real pullups quite fast, I've gone from all negatives to 3 pullups per set in just over a week.

Mind you, my lats and traps have felt like a forest fire. Do handstand pushup progression (pike pushups, box pike pushups and so forth) as well as ring support hold. This should get you triceps to the point that you can do ding rips.

You can also do normal dips between 2 chairs.If you mean by 0:56 then no those arent proper pull ups.I mean at the start, when he mostly just moves up a few cm with his body not with his back and arms.
I skimmed and didn't see many pullups. Saw some kipping muscle ups and some archer pull ups. But not really any pull ups. He did this thing where he moves his feet around while he's doing a pullup like he's walking. That was controlled. What do you mean by this?Thanks, but you should be telling him, not me. ;-)

I'm into calisthenics and gymnastics, not weightlifting.damn this looks sweet but no android version :(That mostly depends on diet, you got your back checked by a doc or? If you do heavy compounds with proper form you should not have any pain unless its first time you touched the barbell but then its soreness.See a physiotherapist.

It's unlikely anyone here can help you properly, a physio will find things you would never have guessed about, imbalances and such you would never have considered.If you add in natural hamstring curls you'll be fine for a long time from an aesthetics perspectiveDo pyramid method for pull ups and yea do negatives too, when you get to 15-20 consecutive pull ups then you can start adding weight unless endurance is your goal.Make sure you go easy playing tramp dodgeball. I threw my shoulder out years ago throwing those damn gator balls as hard as I could. It is satisfying nailing a bratty, Bieber hair cut teenager in the face, but the months it took to get my shoulder back to 100% probably wasn't worth it.

On topic: jumping, flipping, and twisting are good for your core strength and agility. Do 100 back flips in a tramp session and you're core will be sore for sure, possibly your legs too, depending.&gt;mostly just an excuse to play dodgeball 10 feet above the ground

That one.dope,  I'm down south.  Wednesday there's a group of parkour/gymnasts/acroyogis/acrobats who get together at Platinum Gymnstics up north.  $10 open gym from 8-10.  I won't be there tonight, but maybe in the future we can meetup.  How? Increase volume. More negatives? Great. More pull ups? Awesome. Added another set? Good for you! Squeezed a 5 lb weight between your knees? You're a champion!

Just every week or two add a little bit more and you'll get better. Saying you want a plance and a tuck front lever is kind of like wanting a 405 pound squat and a 95 pound bench press. A tuck front lever should only take a few weeks to months, a plance is many many months to years...
But I do agree with everyone who said there's no reason not to start working on the appropriate progressions now. also try pushups on rings, you need a lot more tension in your whole body, specially shoulder. could help for ring dips.this.  food primarily.  Thanks for the feedback.  I think we probably will end up going on a Saturday to play some dodgeball - don't think I want to actually work through one of their structured fitness classes though.  An hour is a pretty long hike to do something on a semi-regular basis, especially when we have a pretty awesome rock climbing gym about 15 minutes away.  I made a post a few days ago somewhat chronicling my experience with posture issues. Maybe it will help you

I find that I'm able to open my shoulders a bit more and I have a little more play room in finding that sweet spot for sticking the FSHS.

Do a search for "journal" or "log" and they'll pop up.I saw my GP today. He says it's tendonitis and put me on steroids for the next 2 weeks (I'm allergic to NSAIDs). I'm going to rest my shoulder for another week or two, but once this injury is resolved, what are some good alternatives to dips?

I'm assuming dips caused the problem but I'm also wondering if it could be diamond pushups. I recently added them to my workout and can quite easily do 3x10&gt;Do trampoline gyms provide an effective bodyweight workout?

Nope. It's fun cardio though. Most people don't find cardio fun so...

If you're weak then it will probably strengthen some of stuff like jiro jiro is saying, but there's not much that will make you significantly stronger or bigger.From what I've observed in my life and from my friends - an hour away means you won't go.

Great write up. I usually deload every 4 weeks. I don't worry about "losing strength" during a deload, cause that's literally not going to happen just cause I took a week off. If anything, I come back super strong.  I just focus on doing yoga and walking and swimming or riding my bicycle during the deload.Food.

Greek yogurt. Cottage cheese. Other cheese. Whole milk. Meat. Nuts. I should eat more beans.

I try to make sure that every time I snack on something, other than just a straight up fruit or vegetable, it has protein.I like doing the [Landmine Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCfcGei-NqM).  You can do it kneeling as well.  I also like [Anti-Rotation Barbell Rainbows aka landmine ab exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk7RksvqGQs).  I would also consider doing [Romanian Deadlift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCXUYuzwNrM) for additional leg work.  Finally, instead of doing just back squats, try doing [front squats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzVCqLyGVd0)

I would consider these exercises all supplemental work and not direct replacements as others have mentioned the main lifts for thoseAnyone follow a deload regime for the beginners' workout?
I've endured only two weeks and feel like I might already be ready.The only real way to get shredded. You thought it was a coincidence that it's called *trampolean*?

On the real though, you won't get stronger by much. Good cardio, though.Meat and fish.I replied to parent but I'll say it to you too. In your case the problem is most definitely shoulder strength and that's okay - it'll come with time. But for now you should try and do them on your knuckles or fingers and try to keep your legs up, straight and toes pointed.

The butt is now behind your shoulders but you'll naturally bring it forward/straighten your back as you get better at the position.

I really don't recommend using books or anything like that because it allows you to cheat with height/shoulders.

Btw about the hostile community - that's just Phi - he's "Mean Mod" for a reason - helpful but too honest sometimes. It's all with good intentions though... I hope.If anyone's interested, here's my workout log from Saturday:

    At gym:

    3x5 @ 75 lb             High bar back squat, ATG.
    1x5 @ 150 lb            Deadlift.

    20+25                   RTO support.
    Ad lib                  German hang practice - feet on floor.

    6+6+6                   Horizontal rows, pull-up grip. Feet on upright box, high bar.
                              Chest to bar. (Last rep doesn't count method) :)
    6+6+6                   Rings pushups, straps stay behind shoulders. :)

    20+20+20+20             Tucked l-sit. (2min set-to-set)

    3/1+3/1+2/4             Chinups/negative chinups. Deadhang, chest to bar.
    4/0+4/0+3/3             Dips/negative dips.

    At home:
    Ad lib                  Lying straddle leg raises (MN/PE2 prep). No jefferson curls.
    Ad lib                  Compression - straight leg and straddle.

    60s starting stretching + Shoulder dislocates (10 over 10 under).

    Notes:

    * Putting down the bar for deadlift didn't feel good. Investigate form.
    * Squat/deadlift much more draining this time.
    * Holy shit L-sit still hard as fuck.
    * My body felt lighter than it ever has when doing dips :)
    * Straddle compression is fucking tough.
I'm just going to cover the lack of muscle since I have recent experience with it. I was purely sedentary for years, so much of my muscle atrophied, combined with malnutrition it left me at 5' 9" and 98 ibs. I was stick like.

I can assure you that if you put forth the effort and EAT PROPERLY your initial gains will astound you. It's something we call noob gains. I started a 5k training program and a month later my calves are 3x larger. 3 weeks of bodyweight exercises(beginner routine) and I'm firming up all over. This doesn't mean my muscles are good, just means they're increasing in mass. They'll slow down and then become better at lifting weight while not increasing mass as much if I just keep at it.

I agree that you should definitely consult a physician before taking on a new routine, especially in your current condition.

Lastly and most importantly:
Nobody that belongs in this subreddit is going to react with disgust. You obviously have issues, but you didn't give up and have the capacity to improve. All fitness and anxiety levels are welcome here. great tip regarding 4th &amp; Bay. also, if you get down there early enough, the meters are free and the rings are unused for the most part.I've been trying to deload about one week out of each month. Usually these correspond with "life deloads" - when I'm visiting my girlfriend, etc.

I can definitely feel when my body is ready for a deload - when I'm sticking to my schedule and hitting all of my workouts, by the 3rd or 4th week of this I'll feel some systemic fatigue accumulating: usually I'll notice it as:

1. Stalling or regressing on one or two of my exercises.
2. Markedly decreased performance on endurance holds.
3. A little bit of twingeyness in my elbows at the very end of my workout.

Luckily, after a deload week all of these symptoms go away. I don't know if I'm stronger per se, but I'm able to continue where I left off with improved energy and momentum.

As for what to do during a deload, ideally I try to follow my normal schedule, but doing everything at a much reduced volume. Unfortunately, because my deloads are scheduled to coincide with life events, I often will only get one such workout in during the week, so it's mostly a rest week.Yeah.. 174 reach at 179 height here and his arms are definitely not too short(my arms are ~5cm above butt/chair line) as I can hold a flat hand L-sit just fine.

But if I get on my fingers my back is straighter and I find it more comfortable, so I wouldn't just flat out say "your arms are not too short".
If I find someone with shorter than average arms I would make them do L-sits on fingers/knuckles as opposed to flat hand just to be sure that length is never the limiting factor.

That being said it made me try V-sit faster so I can do V/L-sit -&gt; handstand transition (I have to hunch a bit to squeeze my legs cause handstand on my fingers is scary and I do them flat hand).Neat, you one of the regulars?You could do the same design but way sturdier if you find the right lengths of galvanized pipe.

edit: couldn't be taken down easily though. nevermind.you should see a physiotherapist, they'll be able to diagnose which muscles are tight and weak and will give you exercises to help correct posture.

sitting infront of a computer for long hours typically gives a 'poking chin' posture which usually means sternocleidamastoid (amongst other muscles) is tight. [here](http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=15253) is a fairly food introduction on it.

the article mentions deep neck flexor strengthening. but it doesnt seem to be a particularly good way. doing an exercise using a pressure biofeedback device is more beneficial. and [this](http://www.physio-pedia.com/Deep_Neck_Flexor_Stabilisation_Protocol) website is extremely informativeUsually I just let the "deloads" happen when I skip a workout for weekend travel about every 4th week. Most often this means I do Monday, Wednesday, then skip Friday and come back Monday. Is 5 days from Wed. to Mon. enough of a break to function as a deload?

go see a physio.

I don't think I've got anything as bad as the pictures when I googled "lumbar lordosis" but I have got bad posture.  Stuff on here helps but only in a fairly general way.  Going to a professional who can specifically identify what is wrong and give you some daily exercises is the best option.  I wish I'd done it years ago!

It's incredibly complex as pretty much every posture issue is not local to where you see the problem.  i.e. you see curved lower spine, but it's probably your hips, ribs and spine that are the problem.  Then the reason your hips are out of whack can be because of anything from the bottom of your foot and up, and so on.  It's a whole body issue

as for the self-consciousness... no-one looks at you in the same detail you do.Good tip, I always park in the lots and walk down which takes about the same amount of time.My posture improved with some of the exercises in "Foundation" by Eric Goodman, though admittedly I did not stick to it and I am no expert.  BW exercises like the L-sit and planks also helped me with my posture (L-sits helped me body-sense how I could lengthen my spine, and planks will strengthen what I think is the core).[This](http://muscleevo.net/calorie-deficit/) balanced write-up of a study shows that it's possible, especially if overweight or a noob.

Also, you're the one making ridiculous overarching claims.  The burden of proof is on you, you jamoke.I had an arch in the lower back and the back of my neck and both of 'em got fixed after I started working out(not the beginner routine, but I believe any good workout would fix your posture).

The best part of my posture fixing has been my shoulders, they're so fkin awesome naturally and I don't even try to "square" them, people keep asking if I go to gym.This is a terrible argument from a logic standpoint. If the price value proposition of a gb seminar isn't high enough for you to consider it valuable then cool, don't attend. Why take it personally?Go 5x5 with bench, OHP, Squat and Row. Only deadlifts are 1x5, when you cant lift the same weight after deloading and 3 workout sessions then you drop it to 3x5 (all lifts) check here for more info:

http://stronglifts.com/5x5/6'4", 205 lbs here.

I run into the same problems, even if I use .8 grams/lb of body weight it is HARD to hit my protein macro without powders.Yet you dont have any studies proof about it, its broscience...Think of it this way: You get stronger, and your muscles grow (if your diet is up to it) when you are in *recovery*. If it takes 24-48 hours for your muscles to fully recover, and you re-stress them after 23 or whatever, you really don't achieve any benefit whatsoever. Except maybe mentally from the good feeling you get from working out.

If you work out too soon you basically restart the recovery cycle and negate the first workout. But if you actually allow yourself to recover you reap the benefits of the first workout, second workout, and all subsequent workouts.

Allow yourself to recover, even if you're pumped and want to be strong all the time.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/evJGKEN.jpg) was included in today's Concept Wednesday post.

[This](http://www.mariliacoutinho.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/idealcurve.gif) is theoretically what should happen with a properly structured routine that allows adequate recovery. The [opposite](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/193031/overtraining.gif) is (again, theorhetically) what would happen if you train the same movements/muscles too often; you don't recover fully and you get a negative feedback loop. That's "overtraining."

And waiting [too long](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/193023/supercompensation.gif) basically means you never progress.

The recovery times are highly dependent on the individual and the training stimulus. 24 hour or 48 hours isn't a hard rule, just a rule of thumb. Every other day for the same movement/muscle group, maybe every two days, and from what I've read it seems that every 5 days is the *most* time you want to leave.

You'll see some people who suggest training hard every day, even this sub, but they seem to be the exception rather than the rule.Do you have the carry bag for it as well? Is it easy to take down and set up again? I live in an apartment and this seems like a perfect thing to slide under the bed when not using, take on vacation, or take outside on nice days.1. Yes, when you can one handed hang from the 5cm handles will be a perfect time. Also, if you stall out for a while, you can use that as an excuse to switch things up.
2. Thickbar training is a bit different, kinda similar to deadlifts in how a body responds to it. Doing high intensity for low reps, you just get fried after a while... it creeps up on you. You get an intense pump if you do low intensity for many reps. Takes long to heal too.
3. If you feel like your grip is healed on friday, you can climb. Healing time will decrease next time, since your body is used to it.
4. Great question. Thickbar and ADM holds would take the longest to heal, so I would recommend one of those. If you climb every week, that should come first or should replace one of the exercises.
5. The PVC itself will roll so the bar's rolling doesn't matter much.Sweet.Being thin has nothing to do with your posture, and having thin wrists is fine, nothing you could be concerned about.

My approach to diet and exercise, which I believe that would be beneficial to you, is that it's just another part of your life, like work, pooping or sleeping. Whenever I eat, I estimate roughly how much I should eat and what kinds of foods; for example, I figure a slice of pepperoni pizza has about 350kcal, so if I'm trying to lose fat, I limit myself to two slices. If I want to gain muscle, I'd eat three, and it has plenty of protein due to cheese. I exercise a few minutes after I wake up as part of my daily routine. I do have goals that I wish I could nail right now, but everything is fine as long as there's continuous progress.

The point is, just make diet and exercise an enjoyable part of your normal life, and as long as there's constant progress you'll get to where you want to be, so it's definitely not hopeless.

You should go check yourself with a doctor though, since you said your right and left side look different on the mirror.
ATX! Let's start a group here sometime, I live on the east side and have a friend or two over for gymnastics and grip every thursday.Go to the santa monica rings (the original muscle beach) in Santa Monica, just south of the Santa Monica pier. (Not the venice muscle beach.)

If you don't wanna pay meters ($2/hr) or the lots ($8/day), and don't mind a 10-15 minute walk, park on 4th and bay street (on 4th, anywhere east of pico) in the residential area there and walk to the rings.Wait until my breathing is less heavy. Smoke a bowl. Shower.Yeah, it's pretty strong.  I am 6'4" and 210lb and have no issues at all.  Very light as well.  Solid for pullups and hanging rings from.  I have it indoors, so I have never attempted a muscle up.These are the basics, as far as makes sense to me:

- Handstand push up &gt; overhead press
- Push up &gt; bench press
- Bodyweight rows &gt; barbell rows
- Bodyweight squats/pistols &gt; barbell squats

Pull ups don't have a barbell equivalent. Dips don't have an equivalent. But you can add weight to either. I typically deload every 5th week. I keep my number of training sessions the same, but I only do 1-2 sets of each exercise. I have found that continuing to move with just less volume makes the transition back to the regular volume much smoother.You've taken the first step, so good job on that! There's some good advice here. Start with whatever seems manageable - a daily walk, a short routine of some exercises. Just start! Also, please consider finding a Feldenkrais class, in addition to whatever you decide to do to build muscle. The classes can be done by anyone and will allow you to reform your movement habits. You'll learn that your brain/nervous system is actually your best ally, improve your posture, and develop a habit of improvement that will serve you in all sorts of cool ways. Best of luck!From his description, I don't think so.I use pen and paper on a ruled notebook. I divided the page into days, like a calendar (good for weekly scheduling and calling yourself out on any missed days) and record workouts using my own shorthand code that no one else would ever understand. Not that I don't want them to, I'm just saving time and paper space. One regular school notebook lasts me several months up to a year and is great for reviewing progress. Though I need to get more disciplined about setting rep goals and progression goals.I'm logging on paper in the gym as I go, then keeping track long-term with a free app called FitNotes (Android).  Works for me!To add on to this, foam roll. You'll correct a lot of posture problems by loosening up all your tissues. You can just foam roll your entire torso, and that should help with the issues, but I agree with /u/abdada below, check with a doctor. You don't want to injure yourself rolling out a genetic disorder.A lot of what you're saying seems focused on the body (and it looks like people are offering some very good advice from that angle), but I also just wanted to chip in and remind you not to forget your mind.

Issues like self-image, confidence, self-love are psychological, and while getting your body in better shape can certainly help you there, it's very hard to fix the mind with the body alone.

As you work to achieve your physical goals, remember to set some time and energy aside to work on your thoughts and mindset as well.

Best of luck!I can second this, if you hang from a bar every day for 7 minutes total across sets it does wonders.
I'm going to start again next week once I finish this training cycle.Rings Turned Out: http://antranik.org/support-hold/I live in the area. Swift Cantrell also has workout stations, pullup bars, dip bars etc. It's set up for the general person, and as such is a little tightly packed, but definitely more than enough. Going before 3 o clock on the weekdays is the best for not having to many people nearby.


You will also be near stone summit the indoor rock climbing gym, and if you have a car there is a specific ninja warrior gym about 45 minutes north. http://lilburnflexfitgym.com/

Have fun!Seems like a pricey alternative to two chairs. I like rings better for a doorway pullup bar accessory as they're way more versatile.&gt;lumbar lordosis

Have you had any scans to confirm whether this is an actual bone issue?

Pilates might be a good option to consider if you're having trouble with other exercise forms...&gt;For example, you get more protein from an egg than from a powder-
This is not true. An egg has 6 grams of protein. 1 scoop (roughly 1/8 of a cup, IIRC) of most protein powders has 18-24g of protein. I would suggest yoga - start with 5 sun salutation A's every morning.

This will not immediately address your concerns, but I think you'll find over time that it will begin to correct them.Cool. Is it sturdy enough? Seems like it might be a tad flimsy for heavy stuff like muscle ups.I use a door frame-mount pull-up bar, and attach one of these for dips:  http://amzn.to/16S2ub1I let deloads happen. When I have tried to plan them I invariable either have to deload early or arrive when I should deload and feel I can push for another week or two. I don't know my body intuitively enough to predict deloads before I feel beat up.

My workouts look a bit different at the moment as I am on a push/pull split for the first time ever and using weights more than in the past. My approach to deloading on the new workout is going to be to drop volume and maintain intensity for a week or week and a half.

I think that when my pull-ups hit 15kg for 5 x 5 mid next week I will do three workouts of 1 x 5 to give my body chance to recover while not dropping strength. This will be a partial deload as I will only be significantly dropping the volume on that exercise. It is the only part of my workout where I am really pushed up against my limits to recover at the moment. OHP (10kg with a DB at the moment) is hard to get through but I recover from this fine.

I am also trying to improve my sleep, eat more (getting back into the habit of breakfasting) above all protein, and I just bought some vitamin d and fish oil as I think they will both have good health benefits for me. Basically I am upping my general recovery game too.

In the past, when I was doing purely bodyweight stuff, typically I would gradually build up the volume, feel beat up and then take a week off and go do something else (hiking, etc). This worked really well for a year or so and I saw solid progress when my training was consistent.I was obviously over estimating the number (although big guys 200lbs+ would need it), but the point still remains that it's hard to eat so much and easier/cheaper with powder. :)Hanging from a bar has done a lot for me. Nothing fancy or complicated, just loosening tight shoulders.Yeah... that doesn't prove your statement ("you cant lose fat and gain muscle at the same time").  You can, it's called a recomp.  You're not converting fat into muscle, but you burn fat while also building muscle. I use a Google spreadsheet. Basic form...



Exercise | Progression | Rep Goal | Reps Performed | Notes
---|---|----|----|----
Handstand Pushup | Wall Bent Waist Handstand Push Ups | 4/4/4 | 4/4/4 |

It makes for a rather long-form log that I archive about once a month, and I could condense it, but personally I do find the rep goal being there helpful.
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PExMvVPSfeo) video really helped meI think it is largely cheaper because it is a mixture of different proteins and soy is cheap. Apparently it doesn't dissolve as well, that won't be an issue for me as it'll go in my daily "pancake" but if you're drinking it then it may not be so nice.

Honestly, this is the first time I have seen protein powder that is a sensible price. Even on Amazon.it most of it cost about 20-30/kg. I can buy steak for that kind of money!!Trampolines are great for handstands/handstand shrugs.
Glad to be of assistance. &gt; Eat everything for your goal weight, not your current weight.

Thanks for clearing that up!&gt; Let me add that creatine and glutamine are very good in gaining strength/size.

I thought that size increases partly because creatine lets your muscle cells hold more water and that size goes down somewhat (but not all the way) during the off-cycle? I'm not trying to say it's bad, just find out what the truth is (the internet seems pretty scarce on treating creatine neutrally... it's either a miracle or the devil to most people). I've been to the trampoline park near me and I thought it was a great place for a workout.  You aren't really going to get much upper body, although I usually find my lats/delts/traps tired from swinging my arms and it's great cardio.  The place near me has a huge foam pit next to some of the trampolines which is great for learning your first flips too.

I don't really play dodgeball or use their basketball hoops.  I just like to throw flips on the trampoline floor and try out new skills over the foam pit.  It's definitely worth a go if you want to see what it's like.Posture is complicated. Luckily for you there is an entire sub /r/posture. It's a combination of weakness and tight muscles  from your neck down through your thighs.

Look up anterior pelvic tilt and cross syndrome. It will take time to correct.

Edit: just read your edit and watched the vid. Pre existing shoulder injury complicates the picture. The problem with rehab could be that the PT wasn't very good or you were not a good patient. Most of the rehab happens on your time, not in the PT's office.

If you stand, flex your ass and squeeze abs, you may notice the arch in your back/belly pooch disappear. It looks like anterior pelvic tilt. While you may need professional help with sorting out your upper back related postural issues(limitations of shoulder), you might be able to work on strengthening/limbering the appropriate pelvic/thigh muscles. Since you withheld the shoulder history, you might not be telling us about other problems that might complicate lower body work. Swift-Cantrell park has a big skate park and playground. You could probably get it done there if you are creative.Thanks! I'd been wondering if all my fiddling was contributing to my stagnation or not... I had been following CC, but the rep ranges are too damn high. I need a better progression plan.

PS, maybe posting some before and after pics will keep the haters at bay?There's another thread about this on our front page right now, check it out:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2vfav8/journaling/Its recommended that you start with dynamic stretches and finish with statics. Getting too loose can decrease power generation. That's what I've read at least. &gt; Is that your routine only 2 days a week cause if it is then its bad

No it's the same exercise every other day. Part of my question is, if that's too much. Especially training legs 3.5x a weekI'm trying to avoid for mounted pull up bars because, as far as I know, I won't be able to do muscle ups. I also would like something portable so I can set it up outside when the weather is nice. Wow that's awesome! Thanks for the links. Once I'm done with my current tub I'll give the second one a go, it seems very good.You might want to see a physician, personal trainer, or physical therapist. They can help accurately diagnose your weaknesses and provide you with specific bodyweight or weighted exercises to help address those weaknesses. Perhaps most importantly, they can help you avoid injury.

The bodyline drills in the sidebar program are great for core strength. You can search google and youtube for more progressions on those exercises if you want to make them their own routine. You probably want to add some stretching to that as well to keep your spine limber.... Yes. I had a coworker suggest textbooks under my hands. I've got plenty of those lying around!It depends on how hard you are training. In general i agree with /u/xatim that you are probably not training hard enough and would benefit from upping weight, reps per set, or reps per workout but everyone is different you have to figure it out for yourself and take care of yourself.

However this weekend when i was resting for half marathon i did bar muscle-ups 3 days in a row, but the whole workout i did like 15-20 total reps of muscle-ups and nothing else so it was more along the lines of skill work, and when i woke up the fourth day my rear delts and lats were a little sore which normally never happens (even training close to failure).

As a side note i think this is how olympic gymnasts can train 5 days a week on the rings. They are so strong that doing 2 second iron cross holds and other strength static positions 5-10 times a day is not anywhere near failure in each set or in total volume (failure for them would probably be more like 20s holds or 2 minutes of total hold time a session). I just put everything on a spreadsheet organized thusly:

    Date       Date
    Exercise   Exercise
    Rep/Set    Rep/Set
    Exercise   Exercise
    Rep/Set    Rep/Set

I use my phone or a piece of paper to remind myself of what I am aiming for for that workout and also to write down what I actually did.Thanks, I guess I'll just have to work on that.Bent-over rows are not painful for your back if done properly. Google it and YouTube it to see how it's done.

For bench press, use the plates you have and do 3x8. Too easy? Add more plates.

Check out /r/weightlifting.Nothing, it's additional.Amazon.de has Vanilla powder for 8.36/kg. It isn't pure whey but I don't think that overly matters. That is as low as it gets.

Start doing beginner routine and do this stretches after every workout and on rest days: http://phraktured.net/starting-stretching.htmlThere's no disgust in what you wrote.  It is very much the new normal.

I was never skinny-fat myself.  First I was skinny, then just fat.  Now I'm fit again.

The beginner progressions will help you get strong -- but you need to eat clean as well.  The posture should get better with strength, but it never hurts to see a doctor to make sure you don't have any birth or genetic issues to manage.

There are so many great progress photos here by regular folks who made amazing physical changes in a matter of months.  Motivation is tough to get, tho.

Remember that your brain is your worst enemy -- start a calendar for scheduling, stick to it for 6 weeks and you should also help reset your brain.Great advice, great post.Not a budget option - but I have one of these and they are fantastic:

http://trapezerigging.com/collections/free-standing-portable-pullup-barsIn the US eggs are prewashed and require refrigeration because of it.

In the rest of the world, eggs are not prewashed and are not refrigerated.  So you need to wash them first.My diet has been pretty flawless, and that's made a huge difference.  I eat the same breakfast lunch and snacks each and every day, with dinner being the only variance.  I don't track calories each day because there is so much consistency, but I know exactly what those snacks and meals generate in terms of calories.

I also make sure I get a tight 8 hours of sleep every night. Every single night.  If I miss out on sleep, I can't hit my dietary goals.  I just lose the motivation.  You might take a look at your sleep and see if it helps your diet.  Remember that willpower is a finite resource, and lack of sleep uses up much willpower.It definitely isn't big, but I wouldn't say I look super skinny.  Now when I weighed 160, that WAS really skinny.I'm actually not sure where I'm weak in the pull because I only started deadlifting two weeks ago. Nevertheless, I will still think about it.That's great news, online classes for UK peeps like myself are great value for money not to mention invaluable information resources :)What does deadlift replace then, squats?No bench...yet. Bent-over rows look painfull for my back?
What weight should I use for bench press, to equal a pushup?How about diet? I literally just started the beginner routine yesterday, as the bodyweight model appeals to me. I'm pretty overweight and not terribly strong, but diet is my weakness.

What sort of dietary stuff did you have going alongside the exercise?6'6'' with 190 lbs ? That's really skinny isn't it?

I mean I'm 6'7'' and 220 lbs which amounts to around 12% bf.

Just checking, no judgement or anything.Hi Eguanlao, the reason I do 4 sets is simply because I have the time and I feel I can - not because its too easy at my current progression, for example for HESPU (wall assisted) its 6 reps first set, 5 reps second set, 4 3rd, 3 reps 4th.... I plan on going up to HSPU's once I can do 8,8,8 on the first 3 sets.... the 4th set is really just to push my self the extra mile :-)

I am 6 weeks in and plan to put up my before and after pictures at the 14 week mark... seeing some great progress so far and loving BWF! Wow, awesome. Thanks. :)Journaling at the begening is good .but later on you will find out that working out  and enjoying it without carring for progress will mentally release you from stressFirst post! I've been doing my own BWF stuff for about 9 months but started the Beginner Routine a couple of weeks ago because I wasn't getting good results.

**(Male, 24, 1.82m, 79kg)**

**Goal:** Good shape, solid set of handstand pushups, 6-pack

**Routine:** Beginner routine. For the pushups slot, I'm having trouble finding a good progression. I've started doing wide push ups while wearing a 9.5kg backpack.

**Diet:** I need to up my protein intake. Read something from a mod in another thread about quark, so I'm going to the store to check that out soon.. It might be cheap in Germany. If that doesn't work I'm going to foot the bill for some supplements.

**Energy:** My DOMS seem to be subsiding much faster now. I used to have two off days between workouts but now, for the first time, I'm going to do a workout after only one off day. I still feel like my body is kind of tired, though.

**Questions:** As mentioned, I've been doing 9.5kg backpack-weighted wide pushups for my pushup slot in the Beginner Routine. My chest has always been small so I'm trying to focus on it some more. I considered diamond pushups, but they were too easy, and I thought they probably don't hit the chest as much. Thought about chest dips also, but I already do normal dips, so would that be too much? If anyone has any suggested exercises I could do that wouldn't require added weight, they are welcome.

Edit: Also, for legs I've been doing pistol squats, but since I can't manage to go all the way down on my left leg and still stretch my right leg way out front, I've been doing them raised on a chair, but still full range-of-motion I guess.. Is that okay?Yeah, beginner routine.  Very consistently, 3 times a week for the last year.  You get bored doing handstands?  I practice them until I have to stop for some reason...Again: I think before the deadlifts would probably be fine.  But it really depends on where you are weak during the pull.  If it's grip or glute/ham complex or even thoracic extension, doing L sits won't hold you back.

If it's core, as long as you do the L sits under the right parameters, they should actually improve your bracing as well.If by max you mean that to failure. I would only train each exercise to failure maybe once every 2 or 3 weeks.To dirextly answer your question: if you aren't doing heavy weights, i don't think you are at any great risk here although technically you are going to overtrain.

Let's flip this around.

What is your goal? Add muscle? Lose weight? Stress relief?IIRC the difference is simply that the bar gets returned to the floor after every rep.It's just a method to get more volume into a workout, particularly useful if your goal is hypertrophy.
Yep, I've been thinking about this. I might add them in after deadlifts but before the other exercises. Thanks for the input.Cheers.It's more like the other way around.  Advanced (professional) gymnasts will train like 8 times a week.  I've heard of professional handbalancers doing 10+ shows a week, and training a whole bunch of times on top of that.

Best in mind that these people don't train at their absolute limit.  It's more about repeating a skill that they can perform quite well already, or learning a new skill, or shoring up weaknesses/imbalances.  If they were training with the definite goal of increasing strength, I'm sure their training would be structured differently.  So it's more like their monstrous strength is a  *byproduct*  of their extreme work capacity.Thanks for the tips! Did you do the beginner routine? If so, for how long?Pendlay rows are much better then bent-over.What about shoulders? Is that your routine only 2 days a week cause if it is then its bad. Key to get bigger is on diet, eat 500 calories above your TDEE and you should gain 0.5kg per week. I would suggest you to start doing beginner routine from this subreddit.* HSPU progression &gt; Overhead press
* Push-up progression &gt; Bench press (got a bench?)
* Row progression &gt; Bent-over rowsThe class was more of a free for all with mainly 16-20 year old lads practicing free running. You could use what ever equipment you wanted and the people there were friendly. I'd recommend going to try it out. I enjoyed it. I wondered that also. If you are able to do 4 sets, shouldn't you progress to something more difficult?Rings Turned Out Support. It's a lot harder than a normal Ring Support and you want to be in this position at the end of every rep you do. To all those who downvote me, read this cause you guys are funny:

http://examine.com/faq/will-lifting-weights-convert-my-fat-into-muscle.html
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21558571The only tip I can give you is that there is tremendous progress to be made at each progression step.  If you can focus on having willful determination but not being as concerned about results, you'll find you make progress most when you aren't paying attention!  Constantly tweaking things, changing things up too much etc. always leads to stagnation for me.  And just remember, you're a big guy too so don't think the progression standards you read are gospel.From what I have heard, cardio / mobility work / extra skill work is fine to do on off-days, but not more strength work.You don't have to start at the lowest progression for anything. I believe you are supposed to find the hardest progression you can do any reps of, and then back down one step and work on that till you are comfortable with 3x8.

While working on a progression, it is ok to go for 4 or 5 smaller sets to increase volume (i.e. working up to 5x5 then 3x8).

But the important thing is that you need your rest days so your body can recover properly in between workouts.I have no idea what those second two things are...un-flavoured whey + milo + metamucil + milk FTWI use Day One. http://dayoneapp.com/cool thanks alot allwhat is rto?Thanks!nah.. quark and cottage cheese are different thingsHe oversells the program for sure. It's insane to assume that a single program will work for every adult in the world.

However, it helps for me that I don't really care if I obtain any of the fancy skills by the end. It's about the journey not the destination for me. I'm becoming stronger and more mobile and that's what I wanted. If it slows down at some point to the point where I'm not happy, I'll probably change it up.wow, thats pretty sick for 1 month progress. i envy you, dude. say, mind you reveal your secret? :)No. Quark and cottage cheese are two different things.Yeah, but then you get to go spend money on eggs or egg whites.

But more than anything when you're bulking it's easier to drink a quick glass of protein than have to make eggs and force yourself to eat them. The CC program is not that intense and definitely leaves room to learn some skill work or do another sport on the side. You do progress though.

I used to do CC in addition to BJJ twice a week and that was a very reasonable total workload. Lately, I've had to quit BJJ and that leaves me with enough extra time and energy to try to learn some of those cool moves you can see on the bar on the top of the page.

However, if you feel that CC is not enough for you, perhaps you should consider the reddit beginner program to the right of this page.Interesting. I thought my muscle soreness *might* come from not cooling down, but apparently I'm just very out of shape.

I wonder if instead of cooling down, you could also just put your legs up in the air on a wall for a few minutes? Generally after working out, I'm too exhausted (and lazy) to do cool down.I'm doing the beginner program, only in my second week. I can easily do some of the base moves, so starting to progress already (eg squats and push-ups), is that ok? Is the beginner routine supposed to be for people whom are starting at zero? I can only do 5 clean strict pullups/chins, so that will take a while to get to 8. Sometimes I feel like in the same day I could do another set of these moves though... Surely that is ok, so long as I'm logging this and then giving myself a rest the following day? Yah you will have to scale some of them back a fair bit, but it's definitely doable.  I recommend including some bent arm work as well tho, just for the sake of balance.Will do! Dude, you need more than a teaspoon of anything for your gainz...Do you have fists you can do your L sits on?  Worked for me before I leaned out.  I mean, it hurts, but it's easier than trying to depress your scapula....Damn, seriously? That's a lot of milk... Not sure I'd be able to stomach that every dayWell that's great - congrats. But that still doesn't mean it's going to work for every adult out there the way Sommer insists it will. There is just way too much variation, physically, among them.Alternatively, you could try for archer pullups, one hand (so grab your wrist) pullups, or muscle ups.If you do find a good place to order from, let me know! I kinda gave up trying, since they all had pretty similar, ie expensive, prices. Training fasted used to work fine for me until doing intense stuff. One session of weighted pull-ups fasted I nearly fainted. More fun than handstand push-ups?Deadlift.  There's no clear bodyweight alternative for it, so yeah, deadlift is a must.

Good mornings are sweet for mobility training, but don't go heavy on them.

learn to power clean?  Really depends how much you love your floor...

There's not much  *point* doing barbell exercises for most things, but they are fun from time to time.That's entirely possible.  Also being as tall as I am makes it difficult to measure using the mirror.  I now own calipers but I didn't at the beginning and I mean, I'm not a pro or anything.Thanks! I often get stuff from Amazon.de as it has a much better selection. Will do some homework later. In the shops protein powder here is insanely expensive. I'd end up spending about 30 a month for a daily serving, or something around that. Well, I went from no pullups to sets of 6 dead hang pullups.

Kneeling pushups to sets of 10 ring pushups.

zero dips to being able to do ring dips and wall-supported handstand pushups.

falling on my neck to doing a handstand.

10s foot supported L-sit to 20s tuck l-sit.

other stuff like 1 arm hangs and such, but I mean for me I was impressed.Maybe.  I mean I didn't get it professionally measured, but I had to buy a whole new wardrobe.  This is designed for Sommer's to get more money off of a monthly subscription. It's the next step from the one time products sales.Try doing a [wrist warmup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE) beforehand.

Also, you can alternate between doing them on your hands to doing them on a closed fist or barbells/paralettes, which changes the wrist position. If doing it on a fist, be sure to do them on a padded mat or it'll hurt a lot.I used to make a kind of pancake thing using a banana, two eggs and a handful of oats. I would flavour it with cinnamon but I guess a couple scoops of flavoured protein powder would turn out pretty tasty too. Yeah, also check the .es, .de or .fr since they list prices in euro, so you don't get screwed over with the exchange rates from the . They somehow all list different brands, so shop around. I recently found iHerb, which has lots of choice, and just placed an order, but I'm worried I will get taxed at the post office. If there's no tax it'll be much cheaper than anywhere else I could find (that ships to the EU anyway). Have you used it for cooking savory stuff? I'm wondering if I can use it for pasta as a substitute for ricotta, or even make some sort of burrito with a bunch of it inside.To be honest, when I accidentally ordered plain, I ended up using chocolate nesquik to make it palatable.

I alternate monthly between "natural banana" and "chocolate smooth" flavours from MyProtein. On their own, they can leave a nasty mouth feel from the flavouring, but when you add oats, it leaves a nice malty taste, which is much nicer.I use myfitnesspal for tracking food - the app and the site have different views, so a combination of both is handy (app is quicker for adding food with barcodes/automatic recognition of previous items and the app lets you see daily and weekly nutrition much easier).

For tracking exercise I have monthly plain text files on my dropbox; I set them up in advance on the PC and plug in the numbers while i work out - e.g. tonight's workout is planned as:


11th

handstand

pull

lsit (feet)

tuck lever

stretches

ring dips

rows

statics - plank, hollow, glute, super, reverse plank

planche

legs

push Amazon.it sucks balls but I will have a look. If not I may be able to get it from the UK. There are no additional taxes between the UK and Italy. Viva la EU!

I am looking at ways to get 50g of protein for breakfast (makes getting another 100g through the day easy). Eating that many eggs makes me want to jump off my balcony. Once you start training harder progressions and leveraging your body in new ways, you'll find more stress on your tendons/ligaments is a limiting factor. You don't want to over work these or you will get injured, so take is slow.

Also, the other guys are right; if you feel OK to work out again the next day, you are not training hard enough.Did you have any luck masking the flavour in something nice? Like banging it in pancakes or something.Amazon has them, at least the .co.uk one. Also iHerb, but you may get extra taxes since it's from outside the EU.Unflavoured tastes fucking vile btw, especially mixed with water.Yes, I know what the slash means.One quick question. Is that 0.82g/lb of lean body mass or total body mass? Yes, I know what it means. I was wondering why you choose to do an extra set when the recommended number is only three. Just curious. No big deal. :-)I will have to have a closer look at the packet when I get home. Not sure if I even like it! If I do and it is reasonably priced in Italy (isn't really a big thing here) then it looks like a pretty solid breakfast option with a banana or something. If I can eat my way through half a kilo of cream cheese.

I seriously need to up my breakfast game if I am going to gain weight. This morning I had a big glass of cocoa and a coffee with cream. That is a big step up from nothing mind. Eating a lot consistently is hard :/Can we not recommend people train on pvc pipe please?  That shit explodes under pressure and fucks people up.  Worse case scenario we're talking about severed tendons and arteries.  It's not the sort of thing it's easy to come back from...Can you use a doorframe Pullup bar and a set of rings?  That shit never lets me down, as long as I can find a fucking door the bar fits in.Didn't realise unflavoured powder was a thing. Will try and see if I can get some for a reasonable price in Italy.&gt;  I think they're mainly designed as a 'Foundation trial' so to speak. If a beginner to GST wants to get into GB, but doesn't want to lay out 80 bucks for F1 plus a potential hundred more for H1, they can pay for a month or two of classes for much less.

That's exactly what it is. They said as much on their forum announcement thread.11% in weight is normal. 500 grams of quark, 45 grams of protein. Look at the macros.&gt; For what it's worth, I also know a guy who has attended 2 seminars and has been following F1/H1 religiously for almost 2 years. He still hasn't 'mastered' F1 and cannot hold a handstand for more than 4-5 seconds. This is despite his alignment being quite good - point is, there is more to learning a handstand than endless reps of mobility work.

For what it's worth, I bought F1 and H1 last September. I've mastered 4 out of 7 of the F1 elements (with approval from the GB forums) and can hold a 30s freestanding handstand even though I have yet to move off the wall in my H1 training.The Quark in my fridge is only 11% protein. I guess that isn't normal?Sorry, I was trying to be funny.

I do a fair amount of mobility work, but not at the end of my workout.  Generally I just step down the intensity of whatever exercises I'm doing, until im done.  So I might finish off with a few sets of pushups or whatever.  I do the important stuff first, so that I can pretty much skip out on the later end of my workouts if I feel like it.

I've never considered cooling down to be important.  It might have a very slight mitigating effect on DOMS or flexibility, but I doubt it.Yes lol, sorry this is what I meant.Someone would need to be over 250 lbs, lean. Not a whole lot of people.See I do all that at the start of my workout, so I can get into high flexibility strength positions better.Cottage cheese is different from quark. It has similar macros, but it is a different food.Talk to your doctor about this.This isn't bullshit at all. I'm currently 185 at ~15%, and OP's got 6" on me. I'm not big at all, so OP being a tall motherfucker, would've had virtually no muscle.Deadlift, obviously.

Overhead press is fun.He means 3 or 4 sets of 8 reps. 4L whole milk daily.Probably. If I want flavour I add it myself though.http://www.crossfitignitesydney.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Guy-L-Sit-2.jpgOne from ON Gold, and then two local powders. I don't like them because they're so goddamn sweet, and they don't fill very well either (only time I really need extra protein is when I'm eating low-cal).I eat 500 grams of quark in a sitting, but it's often within a single meal, so I might also have other things.It's in the sidebar.jumping jacks?

if you go hard enough I imagine you'll tire yourself out
Thanks for the update.

I am considering doing the same for programming advice and access to the thick mats to get back tucks again.Should I be?Door mounted pull up bar and hang rings on it for dips and rowsIMO - if you feel you are capable of performing an exercise for a second day in succession - you need to re-analyze your intensity or volume or both. Esp for strength exercises like weighted dips. Work hard enough and **you will want that next day of rest**.

For beginners more rest is better. You are attempting to work opposite of reason. You are either going to burn out or get injured.Thanks for the link I'll check that out.Are you accusing me of stretching?[You don't do anything like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTmZdU93ejY)[Cool Down?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTmZdU93ejY)Thanks for the suggestion, but my bedroom or apartment is not that big :) - I was looking for an exercise I can do in my bedroom, right after getting up. I need this as the trigger/action routine in the morning.Perhaps I'm not using the correct term. I consider static stretching after my workout as cool down. What about something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTmZdU93ejY)Congratulations. I don't think you're on roids, but the measurements seem off.

Maybe increased muscle mass improved your definition and "decreased" your lack of definition more than the dramatic fat loss you described?I actually found this very helpful myself. Stumbled upon it a while back. http://youtu.be/FTV6UCh-yhsOver a pound of muscle per day?  I doubt that is physically possible, even if you are juiced up to the eyeballs.Food. Any and all of itNice! You look a wee bit like superman, good jobSo - how much stronger did you get?I do all free standing work in straddle. I stack much better when closed but straddle is easier to balance. Last week was the first time my trailing arm has left the ground. Ever. Only 2-3 seconds but under control rather than a slow fall out of handstand. A very exciting time.

Also wall runs have made the biggest improvement in my handstand strength and scapular elevation. Get on them as soon as possible.The other high intensity cardio exercise that's big around here is of course sprints. You can do those on your alternate days. You're lactose intolerant. Get lactose free stuff.It would have to fit in my living room, I live in a small one bedroom apartment. I have enough room to workout but not enough for anything that I can't put away. That looks awesome, I was looking for something like that but with a pull up bar. I think I can modify that design to fit my needs. Thanks for the link!

Alexander Technique

1. Let go of the muscles in the back of your neck.
Your head will slightly rotate forward, and the crown of your head goes up.
Feel your sit bones go down into the chair, while the rest of you moves up. Better posture ensues.

2. Better Posture-Out of a slump.
To come out of a slump, release any neck tension. Head rotated slightly forward, let the crown of your head go up. Let your head lead your spine up.
In opposition to your head moving up, let your sit bones release down into the chair.

3. Posture, Breathing.
Slowly let your jaw open like a yawn, and make a whispered ah sound, breathing out. Think of something that will make you smile.
Then, with your lips together and teeth apart, breathe in through your nose with no sound.
Your torso expands fully.

4. Lessen your Tension
Let go of any extra tension in your neck and jaw.
Free your neck, slowly lower your nose. Your crown moves up.
Notice, and release tension in your neck, jaw, shoulders, and legs.
Re-release neck tension. Whisper ah.

5. Alexander Technique Rest Position
Take 5 or 10 minutes out of your day to lie on the floor, on your back, with your head resting on a few inches of paperback books.
Knees bent, and your feet on the floor. Release neck tension, breathe slowly and fully from the top of your chest to the bottom of your torso; front, back, and sidesI just practice until I get bored of it honestly My understanding is that Tim Ferris's gains are only possible when you are regaining muscle you have previously lost. Something he doesn't mention.Ouch. And wow. Canada is freaking huge.Chicken, beef, fish, greek yogurt, milk, cheese, turkey, shrimp, and sometimes porkI'm only doing 4 upper body exercises and sprints for legs at the moment. It's not like im doing a bunch of exercises. I don't do the sprints the same days as the routine.

Now that I think about it more, what I'm really wondering is if you can train again if you FEEL like you can, if you feel good. What if I don't feel I have to recover from yesterday's session and I feel like I can do it again today? What if I feel fresh and energized?

There are times of course where I feel I have to rest and that I shouldn't exercise. I am of course not asking if you should exercise when you feel tired and fatigued.TBH I don't see too much use for these courses for most people. I think they're mainly designed as a 'Foundation trial' so to speak. If a beginner to GST wants to get into GB, but doesn't want to lay out 80 bucks for F1 plus a potential hundred more for H1, they can pay for a month or two of classes for much less.

That said, at the promotional price of (I think, based on reading it) $5/month, there may be some useful exercises in there that are worth the five bucks. I'm as yet unsure if I'll sign up.This is correct. The post I found explaining this is 18 months old.

Reportedly, R2+ has not been released because people haven't reached the point where they can actually use these courses yet, Movement has undergone a large amount of revision, and Stretch was not part of the series detailed in the post.

[This is the protein powder I buy](http://www.amazon.com/MLO-Super-Protein-Plain-Ounce/dp/B0011DMV0M/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423629038&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=super+high+protein+powder).  It's $11 at the store while a dozen eggs are $2.

That means the powder is 35g protein per dollar while the eggs are 36g protein per dollar.  Very little difference, and the powder has a mix of egg, milk, and soy protein (I'm not on the anti-soy brigade, YMMV) and is easier to eat.

I still eat a lot of eggs though.Prices are increasing across the board recently and are projected to continue to adjust through spring. Once they're cooked, if you stuff them in a thermos, they'll last for many hours. I used to eat eggs as lunch every day and they were packed at dawn ~6am. And I still love the smell and taste of omelettes. I commend you OP for dialing in your own personal training idiosyncrasies. I'm jealous! I still feel like a blind man in the dark sometimes, especially when facing a plateau. Any tips for developing this skill?

Edit: I'm not quite as big as you, 6'1" 175lb.As you sustain exercise for longer continuous periods, you start to go into  other energy systems. The efficiency of which can be improved through training, largely due to the rate at which you can turn secondary "waste products" back into viable energy substrates. "Waste" probably being a bit inaccurate by me.

Good starting info on [Energy Systems](http://www.brianmac.co.uk/energy.htm)I'd let that muscle group recover for a few days and work another group. I don't know the exact science, but I fail to see the point of not switching muscle groups. Instead of A A B B C C do A B C or A B C D E REST REST. check out /r/posture for suggestionsI, too, am working on my L-sit.  I'm stuck on just regular pull-ups for now, pretty much just perfecting them, until I get my L-sit looking great.  Then, I'll move onto the L-sit pull-up.

I found the core exercises in the "exercise wiki", which I found in the right panel.  http://i.imgur.com/bI6e3rh.png

You will find more core exercises at http://antranik.org/bodyweight-training/, which is by one of our redditors here, /u/Antranik.

Also, to improve my L-sit, I've been doing the compression work (also in the exercise wiki) after every workout.

Edit:  Added compression work.You have planche as one of your goals however all I see is one day of planche leans. And for 10 minutes?- covenience: I work over 50 hours per week and lead a busy life. I don't have time to cook most of my meals.

- health: I try not to eat meat produced in a commercial feed house. Mostly for health, but I feel better ethically about it as well. I get my meat and eggs from a farm. It's more expensive and I ration it.

- low calorie density per serving

- personal preference: I can't eat that much eggs and/or chicken in a day. My body functions best on ~165g of protein per day, and 50g comes from shakes. While protein powder may not be the best option, it's better than nothing at all.

You give setxreps for everything but handstand.Where did you get "3/4 sets of 8"?  I have always done just three sets.  I re-read the beginner routine and I couldn't find "3/4 sets".  Just curious.You will need more planche work if you plan on reaching your goal by summer - even then you will be hard pressed to reach your goal by fall esp if your adding weight to your legs.

No handstand work?60sec RTO Support first, then negative ring dips.Go to failure, and 'fast' squats--this is helpful.  Thanks!Who the fuck cleans an egg. Eggs also have more cholesterol. As someone with a small appetite, it's hard to get enough protein keep other things like fat and cholesterol in check in my diet and still get enough fruits and vegetables. Protein shakes don't fill me up, so it's easier to satisfy all these constraints by supplementing.Exactly how much room do you have total?  You could likely do the setup in the link, or modify it to fit your area...
http://bit.ly/16PNFpm[*This*](http://i.imgur.com/zW9TidE.jpg) is pretty much a years worth of haphazard planning.Egg whites are virtually pure protein.Oops, so you guys don't recommend to do burpees every day? I would be glad to hear some suggestions how I can alternate my morning routine.

I started a couple of months ago with doing burpees every morning right after getting up from bed. I got inspired by Mike Rowe's introduction to burpees I stumbled upon on the Internet (http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/dirty-jobs/videos/burpees.htm) and decided to give it try.

He suggests to start with 10 reps, 60 secs pause then 9 reps and so on down to 1 rep. That makes 55 in total and for me it's the best rep/set range possible to just do it every morning.

My primary goal is not to gain muscles or lose weight, it's about having it as a part of my morning routine. So far, it's really great because I get some boost for the entire day.

But now I'm a little concerned based on the comments in this thread. Do you know some similar exercises I can do, which also require no equipment, take around 10 - 15 minutes and can be done right after getting up from bed?

Thanks in advance.Also- use some weight when you squat - hold a dumb bell/kettlebell/bag of sand.

And try to replicate your 'skiing speed' - i.e. - fast squats - alternating emphasis from leg to leg. Some deep, some high, some jumps too! And go to failure - not just full reps - it will enhance your stamina and endurance.Am I missing something?  I am not huge and by that calculation should be eating 162g of protein.  Plenty of people should be eating well over 200g if this calculation is accurate.No one ever thinks they got a bad tattoo.My No1 top tip for strong front-lever pull-ups is to grip the bar like CRAZY! Wrap your thumbs right around &amp; place your 'thumb-pads' on top of your index finger-nails. If you are chalked, it will work like a clamp.

The harder you squeeze the bar, the more muscles you will activate throughout your forearms and shoulders - crucial for maintaining a strong FL/FL pull ups.

Train totally - cheers!First of all, work on holding your posture right. IMHO bad posture is mental as often, if not more often, that it is physical. Straighten your back and square your shoulders against a wall to get an idea of what it should feel like, then practice holding that posture during your day to day life. This is key.

Now as for the physical stuff, a few different things can cause bad posture. Among the more common are 1. a weak core and 2. strength imbalances in favor of your pushing muscles. So in your workouts, make sure to focus on exercises that are demanding of your core [luckily for you, most bodyweight exercises fit into this category] and doing plenty of pullups and rows. The beginner routine in the sidebar is solid on both accounts, so doing it would likely do your posture a lot of good.Hey guys - add a small weight belt - 2/3kgs to your waist to really strengthen your FL strength e.g.: Check out these FL pull ups please:

1. Don't get injured
2. Have fun
3. Consistently improve6'4", 215lbs checking in. Not saying I'm the norm, but I don't think I'm that uncommon.

200g is not impossible to eat without powders. I just try and eat 20+ ounces of chicken a day. The Walmart around here has family packs of chicken breasts for ~$2/lb. If your only source of protein is chicken then you'll have to eat ~2lbs of chicken, which isn't that hard (it does get a little boring). You can try and get your protein through red meat, which tastes better, but it is going to be a ton of calories (same with eggs). Canned tuna/salmon is also good, although I rarely eat it.

Getting 200g gets hard, if not impossible, when you are not cooking for yourself. There is almost no way to get it eating at restaurants without lots of fat and carbs.

tldr: 1) lots of chicken, 2) you will need to cook for yourselfEven just get ups. Weighted or not.Well strengthening your core will improve your posture, but I don't know if only doing core exercises is advisable Sommer said he'd finished filming every product in the series except parts of H3 and R4 when they released F1 (2 years ago?). It's pretty well documented in his book,he also does a case study of a body builder  that gains 60+ in 39 days.

He's a bit of a freak for body experiments, and he doses on supplements brutally but even if it's a little exaggerated I still think it helps bring credibility to OPs post and his gains over a full year.I hope so too!

If it makes you feel any better, it would take me about as long to drive from where I live to Squamish as it would take to drive there from Texas :)

I also don't have benefits at work, so although my doc visits, hospital visits and such are free I still have to pay for prescription medication. My meds are about $300 a month right now. Congrats on your progress, and on finding out what kind of training works best for you. I think what you're saying is definitely true - once you know enough to listen to your body and make the adjustments it needs, it's good to not get stuck on any particular dogma.

As for all of the accusations people are making, let's not jump to conclusions about someone we know nothing about - 32 lbs of lean mass in a year strains credulity, but it seems a lot more likely that OP misestimated his % bodyfat, which is after all extremely difficult to measure or estimate. For example, if we assume that he was actually 20% when he started and 15% when he finished, then that's only 20 lbs of lean mass, which is well within the range of what a beginner natty can accomplish in a year - especially since OP is 6'6".AMA request: Al Kavadlo! Sorry if it's been suggested or even been done already. (Link?)I need to be Canadian. Here in the US I have to pay ~$400 a month on meds as it is. And you have Squamish in BC for climbing! No fair!

I'm really still not okay with having asthma. But I've gotten significantly better at controlling the symptoms. Hopefully some day soon I'll have everything in check.

Thanks, I really appreciate the reply!

I'll try to incorporate this into my HS work even though I don't really do much back to wall and see how it goes.Being Hispanic I eat alot of black beans and rice. Eggs, milk, yogurt, and peanut butter I usually intake everyday too. And you can't go wrong with meat, I try to eat that as much as I can.You're very welcome! I've dealt with this a long time, I know how frustrating it can be.

I'm familiar with BT. At this point I have my asthma under good control most of the time with medication. Occasionally I get flare ups during allergy season as I mentioned, but I've learned how to manage it quite well. I've also stopped beating myself up about having it, I used to get really frustrated and angry that I couldn't do certain things.

BT from what I recall is a one time thing, and isn't a permanent treatment and they don't recommend repeating it once your five years of effectiveness is up. I think at this point I'd want to reserve it for if my lung function decreases further as I get older. I'm also Canadian, so although it would be free I don't think I could elect to do it unless my doc thinks that my asthma is really poorly controlled and sends the referral. It is but you can put in custom exercises. I also use the weight function to indicate what progression level I used. Wow! Thank you! That's terrific information!

My clients have had great results with the nose only breathing. I think expiration through the mouth makes it too easy to dump all the air at once quite quickly. The exhale in my experience is actually the more important part because CO2 sucks.

Get it? Sucks? But seriously. The exhale is more important. Most people have probably seen it but don't realize how good a drill it is. [The head-in handstand (first pic).](https://www.facebook.com/yuvalonhands/photos/pb.265157370252730.-2207520000.1423617856./316361545132312/?type=3&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Ffbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net%2Fhphotos-ak-xfa1%2Fv%2Ft1.0-9%2F150635_316361545132312_968783765_n.jpg%3Foh%3D0a7c47a3c604a88cd006dc2fc0561033%26oe%3D555E0610%26__gda__%3D1432349358_79a642a3759d13866beb6c7931aabaee&amp;size=800%2C600&amp;fbid=316361545132312) Do a regular back to wall handstand, then look at your feet. Activate your 'hollow' position using whatever cues you normally use (ribs in, push out lower back, engage glutes etc.) and peel your feet off the wall. The act of tucking your head in will shift your balance forward and you'll tend towards overbalancing - your aim is to basically try to counter that overbalance by 'pulling' back into a tighter hollow.

The other usual cues apply - keep the hips open, feet pointed, shoulders somewhat protracted and elevate the shoulders.

It's much easier to hold a well aligned handstand with your head in because it gives you a bit of leeway with shoulder mobility. It will help you get an idea for what a properly aligned handstand feels like. Once you can hold this freestanding (it's okay if you use the wall to help get into said freestanding position), you can start trying to hold and maintain that same form, while slowly rotating your head further and further out.

It's a bit hard to explain over words, but play around it and see if you get the idea. PM me otherwise. You'll need a decent amount of shoulder mobility to begin with, for which I recommend [this drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhhaK3nDbbA).

Edit: And yes, I can hold a freestanding handstand.If you're interested in knowing how this works, when asthmatics experience bronchospasm the burning sensation can be caused by the inability to completely exhale due to constriction of the airways. Airway inflammation also makes it more difficult for oxygen in the inhaled air to reach the alveoli where it can be used, and a buildup of mucus in the airways further blocks the passage of oxygen.

Asthma attacks are often identifiable by a telltale expiratory wheeze, so the person is wheezing when they breathe out. The wheeze gets worse, and can become a wheeze with inhale and exhale. If they panic (which is understandable), they start breathing in those little gasps which keeps filling up their lungs with air, even when the lungs are close to capacity already. This additional lung expansion causes more burning, causing more panic.

Breathing in through the nose helps prevent those heavy gasps which can push the lungs over capacity. It can also help filter allergens, and warm air before it hits the lower airways. Breathing out through the mouth can actually be a bit better, since a larger volume of air can be breathed out through the mouth compared to through the nose. Ideally you want your exhale to be twice as long as your inhale during an attack, to blow off that extra air in the lungs. Diaphragmatic breathing is commonly recommended as a strategy to assist in breathing control during asthma exacerbations. Cardio should help your asthma. I grew up with it as well and still have it today. I did long distance throughout high school and it ready helped keep my long health up.You can always lower the rings so that you can assume dipping position whilst having your feet on the floor to give you an extra assist in the movement which is nice because you can easily control how much help you receive from your legs.Unless he's a god damned wizard and cast some super gains spell on himself the dudes lying to sell some snake oil. Or those numbers aren't accurate.34 lbs in 365 days.

Mark Rippetoe puts that much and more on to noobs in their first 6 months. i was previously told to put deadlifts in front to help lift more, so I'm a bit confused on that. What are your thoughts on that?

And I enjoy the barbell rows,  I would try body weight rows but the space I have around my bench is actually limited so I'm unable to do it.  Weird right ?


And for barbell squats I'll definitely look into getting that attended to now. Everyone seems to be on edge that I said I couldn't do the squats so I'm guessing it's extremely important.

Also should I do deadlifts one workout day and squats the next? Like Monday I do squats and Wednesday I do deadlifts and Friday squats again? I'm not sure what else you mean by that


Edit: I also planned to turn deadlifts to 1x5 , so if I did that would I still need to reevaulate the deadlift and squat conundrum ?34lbs in 30 days? Sorry bud, I'm not buying it unless the juice is involved.

Even then...over a pound each day...unlikely. No problem! Good luck and hang in there! Cool! Thanks! I would say you have ample time for handstand skill work -- always work on this first before strength, because it can be neurally draining. planche and front tuck lever would go well together too, and flags you can do at the end of the workout.

I would also highly recommend that you do some strength training for the lowerbody, especially given that you were injured before from running. You don't want to finish the marathon with injuries this time around. THe best thing you could do while training for the marathon, is to include at least 2 times a week of leg training a week. I would do split squats (make sure your knees go forward and down, so they should go past the toes),  paired with some leg curls, and then some posterior chain work. Is that it? I'll change the order on that then. Thanks!&gt; Also realize that very few people who have spent 500 on such a thing, will have it in them to kill their ego and admit it was a waste of money. Most people will tell you it's the greatest thing ever, regardless of the experience because well, they paid a shit ton for it.

**[Disclaimer: I am not saying GB seminar is a scam. I am just talking about people's possible reaction to having fallen for scam]**

This cannot be said often enough. In fact, it is even worse, people will actually believe the lies themselves rather than just pretending, because of the flaws of human mind.

I wish more people read up on **"cognitive dissonance"** (and other biases).

You totally can but not reliably and only if your an absolute beginner who's diet is on point. Otherwise yes you would have to be on roids.Still not possible, you cant lose fat and gain muscle at the same time.Lol, guess I missed that part. My keen detective skills at work, see.Thanks man, really appreciate it :)  I'll check the sidebar.Why? In TimFerris' four hour body he outlines, with pictures, how he gained 34 lbs of muscle in 30 days? Why is 32 lbs of muscle over a full year hard to believe.

EDIT: So I'm getting a bunch of downvotes, but no one has actually answered my question. Why is 32 lbs over an entire year, on a 6' 6" frame unrealistic.Yep you can easily use two chairs of the same height, put your hands on the top of the chair and do dips that way. Work on 10 second negatives if you dont have the dip yet. So this would mean lowering down in 10 seconds. I'm genuinely curious. What would you say is the most effective drill? I'm not trying to pick a fight or anything (I don't even own H1), I just wanna improve my HS line, and am open to all kinds of ideas.

Also, can you do freestanding HS?How did you find an adult gymnastics course? I'm not a gymnast either but like a lot of others on here I use the rings a lot and I would love to have access to a gymnasium...Totally. Sometimes I run with only my nose breathing and... Well, it can be a little snotty-flingy but it forces me to keep my breathing slow and mellow. It's literally impossible for me to gasp or suck wind. Then you realize "Holy shit! I really don't need all that air I'm gasping (inefficiently into the top, more useless part of my lungs)!"

Remember to imagine you are breathing down and back toward your kidneys. That's where your lungs have a surprising amount of space for expansion. Just keep your mouth closed and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Better suggestion? I got some fantastic advice from /u/circumspecktor.

But I'm all about getting more advice. I see. Yeah, stress alone can cause asthma issues. Keeping a level head is key in any excersise I do.

So deep, controlled breathes rather than mouth breathing. You are correct, gasping only worsens an attack.Thank you for going in to so much detail. You completely described my symptoms to a tee. I guess I'll need to figure out some other forms of asthma control. My doctor assured me that I was on the strongest stuff he could give, but looks like I need to dig deeper. Have you investigated brochio thermoplasty? Seems like a viable option. Although it is NOT a cheap option. &gt; I'm over 30

&gt;this diesnt seem like it was written by a teenager.

Really, what set you off?Not sure why you'd ask this on a sub about what are mostly non-cardio exercises.

We are not medical professionals, and you should ask one of those instead.I returned H1 once I saw what it consisted of. Hundreds of different shoulder mobility and pelvic tilt drills plus a dozen or so ways of doing wall handstands all arranged into arbitrary sets and reps. Completely superfluous. You only need about 2-3 other drills in addition to the run of the mill wall work to develop a good handstand. But you can't really sell that for $100 can you. Quality &gt; quantity. What I'd say is probably the most effective handstand alignment drill isn't even in H1.

Lots of fish (usually cod, halibut, salmon, or tuna fillets) and steak. I only eat chicken once or twice a week at most. Thats about it for home cooked meals but will also snack on cheese and nuts throughout the day.one thing I forgot to mention - adding in a long warm up did wonders for my symptoms. I started doing a slow jog for at least ten to fifteen minutes prior to really revving up and it  improved the pace and length of my run, as well as making HIIT style sprints easier. tea spoon of Spirulina with tomato juice everyday is all the protein you need.. most of protein doesnt get digested and wasted. For cell devision to happen, chromosomes gotta split. Chromosomes are made of dna and dna consists of amino acids so if you dont have enough of one type of amino acid the whole production stops and you are soar for days. Protein breaks down in to amino acids. So skip the the step and go for aminos conveniently, I'm also a rockclimber. I don't have issues with climbing either. I also don't have issues with weightlifting. My asthma flares with anything that gets my heart rate up to over 180bpm. Running, fast swimming, fast cycling, running stairs, jumping rope. Climbing is difficult, but it just doesn't shoot my heart rate up as high as cardio does.

to judge how well your asthma is controlled, doctors look at how often you are experiencing symptoms and using your rescue inhaler in the context of your lifestyle. If exercise is a part of your life and your asthma symptoms are interfering with that on a regular basis, then your asthma isn't well controlled. With the exception of using your rescue inhaler as a preventative, if you have symptoms that require you to use your ventolin 2 times per week or more (or in your case based on your other posts, symptoms that require you to stop the activity entirely - I assume that if you didn't stop the activity you would end up needing to take your ventolin) then that is an indicator that you need a change in your regular med regime. The goal of medication is to control symptoms, and that is entirely inclusive of symptoms during exercise.

As for the lung burning, when I first started running I was with a group of total beginners. there were a number of folks who had barely ever exercised in their lives and were severely overweight, but they could run much longer than I could despite me being at a healthy weight and a regular exerciser. Their lungs may burn but they can usually push through it without it getting worse, or maybe just need to slow down a little bit. For me, my lungs crapped out well before my legs did. For them, their legs crapped out well before their lungs. If you were to keep running and try to push through it, I'm guessing you would need your ventolin.

When I have an attack out of nowhere (not exercise induced) it does feel different than an attack from exercising. An exercise induced asthma attack feels more like a burning constriction, some burning in the lower part of my throat, and that I can't empty my lungs entirely. A random attack from something environmental is more coughing and weight on my chest feeling.

Regardless of what is inducing your symptoms, if you want to run but can't due to asthma that means its affecting your life. During allergy season I add in serevent to my usual med regime, it takes about two weeks to really kick in but works wonders. During the winter when I'm running indoors I do fine without it, I just take flovent twice a day and a preventative ventolin dose prior to cardio.No I'm not saying breathe shallowly. It's just that you can't gasp through your nose. So it has to be slow or it won't work. Only so much air can travel at a time so your lungs stay relaxed. My schedule in the same mon-fri so it goes like this; Eggs in the morning. Deepening on how hungry I am 2-4. Greek whole fat yogurt and granola when I get to work. Greek whole fat yogurt and granola until lunch time. At lunch I visit the same places each week, either Chipotle or this taco stand next to my house. If I go to the taco stand I get like 6 chicken tacos. Then it's Greek yogurt for the rest of the work day. Then when I get home I have a real meal; chicken, hamburgers, whatever other common dinner time meal. Also usually have a salad and some veggies. I hate the fake sugar in all the protein powders I have found. I would definitely be using it if I could find a good one without any of the fake sugar and no flavoring. Any recommendations?

Edit; Also I work in a warehouse that sells food and chocolate so I often times eat cliff bars and other protein bars and shit. Usually take a bag of nacho cheese doritos with my lunch too ;) You can start working on your support hold on rings. 30-60 seconds is a good prereq for ring dips anyway I'd sayHe could be young and made mad puberty gainz, but this diesnt seem like it was written by a teenager.Do you have H1 yourself? It is more than just endless mobility work. The balancing comes after there is adequate strength and flexibility for proper muscle activation which will all play a role in your end balancing position. With opened shoulders your balance point will be different than if they were really tight.


 You can't blame H1 for your friend for not being able to do a handstand when he's doing mobility work. That is like boxing and expecting somebody to throw a really strong punch just because they can bench a lot or something. There is technique that has to be worked on when throwing a punch just like there is balancing work that has to be done for a handstand. Beans and chicken tenders!!My math, based on your numbers, says you gained 32lbs of muscle.

Bull. Shit. Some people are more immune to that. I drink a good bit of milk like a couple gallons a week almost and it doesn't make me shit. I'm lucky enough to digest it fairly well. If I drink way too much it will get to me but I can drink a half gallon in 10 minutes with no issues. Elli quark. check them out. you can order online or find them in storesOhh really? I usually get Greek Yogurt and don't remember the last time I had cottage cheese. So will try, thanks a bunch!&gt; I fucking hate the taste of protein shakes

what brand did you hate? i have some french vanilla and i love it. Eggs need to be bought, conserved, opened, cleaned, cooked

Powder just need to be put in a cup or shaker also much easier to mix with milk chocolate etc

I have nothing against eggs but seriously you get tired of them and you need a shitload No protein shakes here. I usually drink a glass of freshly mixed milk with cocoapowder when I get home from the gym. And then eat pretty varied, lots of vegetables, beans-paste/daal, boiled/fried eggs and regularly fish or meat every other day.That's a really great point for the most part but...

&gt; going from 185 lbs with 23% bodyfat to 198 at 12%

Unless you are on roids, there's no way you did this in a year.

Edit: For the downvoters, this would be a starting lean weight of 142.45 lbs. and a final lean weight of 174.24. An increase of lean weight of almost 32 lbs. while losing fat... in a year. That's not happening without steroids.Like [so](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/advanced-l-sit-andrea-alborghetti-300x173.jpg?9873a6). Also [this](http://www.calistenia.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/L-sit.jpg).I will approach this with caution. Sounds a lot like the idea of shallow breathing excersises. Those have been effective for me before.One of those links was my question. I received great feedback (thanks xatim) which is helping me move closer to the press. I can say for myself, the mobility is where I am failing miserably, for now anyway, but I'm working on that now with a formal stretching routine. The other thing was I was not strong enough in my shoulders/traps. I had jumped to the BTWHS as it was closer to the "Real Thing".

Man was I wrong. I'm back to FTWHS for time and getting my hands withing an inch of the wall. It is humbling. I'm also doing negatives HSPU and Planche work to try to build up the required strength. That along walks and wall runs. In just a few weeks I am getting much stronger, but still have months to go which is cool with me.

If you can't pancake in real tight you have to be beastly strong to get those hips up over your hands from that far away. I'm not beastly strong yet or flexible enough, but I know I can get there with time.

The good news is all that work and advice is giving me a nice 15-20 sec freestanding HS. I almost never go over the top anymore and can muscle into a HS if I'm shy at the top. Thanks _mess_ . I can feel one of those 30sec+ "out of character" ones coming soon.I teach fitness classes. (I AM NOT A DOCTOR OR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL OF ANY KIND)

I tell my asthmatic clients to breathe exclusively through their noses. Breathing through your mouth triggers several "fight or flight"-like responses. And it makes the alveoli/capillaries dialate and expand which as I understand it is very unhelpful for asthmatics.

It seems to work for them. This was the kind of response I was looking for. If I don't have asthma issues while climbing, why would you say that my asthma is not well controlled?  It's only when trying to do something my body is not at all used to doing.

 I know that non asthmatics sometimes experience a burning lung sensation when they begin a run. This is what it feels like. It doesn't feel like a normal asthma attack.

My asthma is primarily allergy induced. When I go to higher elevations I have no issue with asthma because I am not allergic to the plants growing at that altitude, less polution, etc. Maybe this info helps?Sorry for weighing too much for your taste.

1g/lb is probably slightly over-cautious but certainly not unreasonable.There are some people that have exercise induced asthma that get it because they breath out of their mouth instead of their noses.  If that's your problem, be conscious of your breathing.  Also, if youhave asthma you need to see your doctor and get an inhaler. I use my inhaler prior to every workout session and I get a lot more out of it!Naterman was a huge contributor to GB for years, has paid for many seminars himself, and knows Sommer personally (more than anyone else on here anyway). Of course he's going to be biased.

For what it's worth, I also know a guy who has attended 2 seminars and has been following F1/H1 religiously for almost 2 years. He still hasn't 'mastered' F1 and cannot hold a handstand for more than 4-5 seconds. This is despite his alignment being quite good - point is, there is more to learning a handstand than endless reps of mobility work.

He's finally decided they're not worth it and that if he wants to make real progress, he's going to have to be smarter about his training rather than rely on a magic cookie cutter program that apparently works regardless of age, height, weight, limb proportions, joint sizes and previous strength levels.

The seminars would be useful if you were completely lost with the movements, I suppose, and had no idea which muscles to activate, what mental cues to use etc. Even then, you could probably find personal, hands-on instruction at a local gymnastics gym for a tiny fraction of 500.

Another thing to consider is that seminar attendees are divided into groups according to their 'proven' level on foundation. So if you've never officially tested beyond Level 0.5 (and paid for it), you will be placed in the absolute beginner group regardless of your ability, and will have limited, if any exposure to advanced material. This is what I read on the forums anyway (some of the mods were encouraging other members to go through official testing).

So yeah, keep all that in mind before spending such a huge amount of money. These are just the things that have put me off the idea of ever attending. Also realize that very few people who have spent 500 on such a thing, will have it in them to kill their ego and admit it was a waste of money. Most people will tell you it's the greatest thing ever, regardless of the experience because well, they paid a shit ton for it.I drank 3 glasses once and sat on the toilet with liquid shit pouring out of my arse for an hour.

Also 9/11.I have provided helpful advice given the details you provided, but I will stop posting.  Even this bit is concerning:
&gt;when I begin a strenuous cardiovascular excersise I can feel my lungs begin to constrict.

You must have a different definition of "well controlled" than I do.  This is why internet medical advice can be dangerous.  No one gains 20kg fast and if they do it certainly won't be mostly muscle. It takes about 1.5 to 2 years to gain 20 kg of muscle if you're doing everything right.Likely an overstatement. Restated to Internet safe vernacular would be "when I begin a strenuous cardiovascular excersise I can feel my lungs begin to constrict." I can stop excersising, and the symptoms subside. I don't need a rescue inhaler to control the issue.

In any case, if you aren't going to even attempt to be helpful. Please stop posting. As you said before, you don't know enough about me to offer up advice. I know enough about my physical ability to know that I can safely participate in any form excersise  I put my mind to. All I'm doing here is looking for the first few steps. If you don't want to help, then get out of my way. I tried it, but it looks suited to weighted exercises. It was difficult to find some of the bodyweight exercises in the beginner routine.Can I ask how many grams you eat in a sitting? 45?I have severe asthma, so I can speak to this. If you are being hit hard with asthma symptoms when you start doing cardio, that means your asthma is NOT under control. You need to speak to your health care provider about it. Personally I've noticed that my asthma has become worse through the years, and has also become permanently worsened every time I have any sort of lung infection such as pneumonia. Just because you could do strenuous cardio previously doesn't mean your lungs are in the same condition.

After you see your provider, discuss your meds and symptoms in the context of your goals and get the go ahead to start back, I have some suggestions for you. For running, I did a prolonged C25K program where I did each stage of the program twice. It took me twice as long to get to the end result, but it worked for me. I also take one dose of ventolin about 20 minutes before cardio as a preventative.

When doing cardio, the moment you start experiencing symptoms just dial down the intensity until things feel under control, and then slowly scale up again. So if you're running and get symptomatic, slow down to a walk, get things under control, then jog, then run if feeling good again. Once you start trying to push through the symptoms and your lungs get inflamed, your workout will be done until that inflammation gets under control again. For me, it can take a full day or two for my lungs to feel back to normal if I push it too hard. Give yourself the rest that you need.

Asthma doesn't mean your weak or out of shape, it means you have a medical condition that needs to be respected. It wasn't that long ago that an asthma diagnosis was deadly. In a supermarket close to my house you can now buy it per Kilo, so happyMEAT!!!!Can you get flavoured quarks in your country? I love me them Icelaneic Skyrs!Exercise-induced asthma here as well... totally anecdotal, but for what it's worth I found that using a (good) rowing machine was my sweet spot for providing a good cardio challenge without immediately closing up/shutting down.  &gt; But when I try and just go for a run or swim, I am immediately hit hard with asthma issues.

If this statement from your OP is true, then your asthma is not under control.  When you make statements like the above, it's impossible to give safe advice.  People may not understand how severe asthma can be.  That being said, it is absolutely true that asthmatics can be world class athletes, but their asthma is under good control.

If the quoted statement is not correct AND you meant to say that you are deconditioned AND you have discussed this with your doctor AND your asthma is well controlled, then by all means go ham.  If you have acne protein powder is bad news. Not to sure why but the first thing the dermatologist said to my boyfriend was "no protein shakes". I got a load of butthurt and rustled Jimmies from that post.Uh, well I guess I'd be curious as to your success rate at 1 inch from wall with none of those engaged --- I guess for some anatomical structures it is possible (not mine though). But yes.Hi there! As you can see, on the PT I've posted above you'll do 300 repetitions of one or more ab exercises.
To hit the core I mainly mix 4count flutter kicks (the quintessential Navy SEAL ab exercise, it is fundamental because it simulates the movements you do when you're swimming), some sit-ups (not too many, I've red that they can be extremely dangerous for your back if done in large repetitions), good morning darlings, knee raises from the pull up barChicken(or any other meat) and eggs should give you enough protein for the whole day. Pasta has some protein in it, beans, bread, milk, nuts, cheese, all contain protein and help bring the total over the top.Let me ask you a simple question. Are you willing to risk about $1200 for the **extremely slim** possibility of learning some inapplicable skills you'll never use in your life? How sure are you that you'll learn a manna, planche, front and back lever and human flag? Are those skills worth that exorbitant amount of money? Ask friends and family.

The reason why you haven't heard any negative reviews about the seminar is because the people who feel ripped off are too embarrassed to talk about it.Hadn't thought of jump rope. That could be good. I just need to do things that really get my heart rate up.It's true that no one can know exactly where I'm coming from. I'm looking for insight from those who have had a similar struggle or have first hand experience on the subject. If you don't have either of those things then that is okay. I just want some advice. Every doctor I have spoken with just says "start slowly and build in intensity as you progress". That is helpful, but I dont know how to start slowly. I'm looking for excersises to begin with, or even some sort of workout plan that has been effective for others.
rektNo one here has examined you.  Asking for advice on Reddit makes no sense.  Maybe you will be fine, but no one here can give you any safe advice without knowing more about you.  Jefit app is the way to goBurpess are a good exercise, but doing solely burpees would be a very, very suboptimal way to build muscle or lose fat. To build muscle, do a balanced routine, at a high intensity, consistently over time. To lose fat, find your TDEE and eat at a caloric deficit.I think he said something similar in his AMA, but I'm still not holding my breath hahaAccording to a recent forum post, he is finished with all of the filming and editing, and is preparing the final package for the online publication.Dude seems like he's got a problem with GB for some reason. I think most people go to a coach to get some hands on instruction, the better the coach the better the results.

I still think the seminar might be too expensive for me but I don't think the price is unjustified. Yeah, when I wrote this I was trying to think of actual exercises I could recommend, and I was having a hard time coming up with anything.

You could maybe try a stationary bike or something, it's easier to change intensity and it is for sure lower cardio than running (running is IMO some of the most intense cardio you can do). You could also try light stairs, or maybe jump rope, those are both more HIIT than endurance but it might help to start with.You just linked yourself getting ethered by Naterman....Could I get a picture of a straight backed l-sit? I can hold one for a few seconds, but always with rounded back. I've been able to do very strenuous cardio in the past with no issue. Why would it be different now? I haven't been hospitalized for more than 6 years. It's pretty well under control with the meds I'm on. I'm the same, actually. I can only drink plain milk with something or if I'm in the right mood. Aside from that it's chocolate milk and I go through at least a half gallon a day. &gt;Stretch 1,2,3 and the three introductory Movement courses will still be coming out very soon

I'll believe that when I see they have been released. Exactly how much protein do you think you need, for powder to be even vaguely necessary?Its not cheating if you do the whole rom, keep doing sumo squats and   progress to make stance shorter and shorter.IMO, get your asthma in check before you push yourself.  Having asthma is not just an external load.  Exercise induced asthma is a thing.  Yes it's hard to breath, but it can be more than deconditioning.  Bronchospasm can go from bad to worse to dead.  protein bread and meat make up the bulk of my protein needsYou should never flex your spine during a loaded movement such as the back squat, since the amount of shear compressive spinal force will eventually end up with injury, such as a disc bulge or herniation.

For unloaded or bodyweight movements like the single leg squat, it's ok to flex the spine as long as you don't have any back injuries. It's actually hard to complete a full depth SLS with a neutral spine. But I wouldn't advise loading it up unless you have superior mobility and have slowly worked up with perfect form bodyweight reps first. Even so, you would only load them up slightly and progressively. Cardio with a weight vest indeed. That is a very apt description for how it feels.

I don't really know a good way to ease back in to running. Obviously walking is so easy it's retarded. I hike a lot for climbing, but that doesn't even feel like cardio. It's almost like the shear intensity of running is what throws my lungs into an attack. Maybe using an eliptical so it's not so high impact?I can down a whole glass of chocolate milk in seconds, but the same glass of regular milk takes me at least 3 drinks to finish. And since i'm underweight, don't really have to worry about the added caloriesI can do it with a wider stance, and with my feet a little more turned out, but isn't that cheating? One more thing that you can try is to have a wider stance when doing squats so its more like sumo squats, that could solve the problem of rom.Go with a resistance band for now, and move to an unweighted stick once you can maintain your thumb and index finger.

It doesn't sound like it's your forearm or wrist that's causing it, but a combination of things.

You could follow a wrist stretching routine, such as the Gold Medal Bodies one for the mean time if you find that your wrists and forearms are specifically immobile. Yeah, I will be doing plenty of assisted squats, as well as trying to progress to goblet squats.  I am going to stay away from barbell for awhile because I just hurt myself every time I try, and it is extremely frustrating.
I just hate that I have to wait 6 months for flexibility to be able to do all this stuff I want to do.  Oh well!  It's my fault.I have a lot of asthmatic friends, many of whom do significant amounts of cardio, and I have a little bit of insight.

Basically, think of having asthma as doing your cardio with a weight vest, you can certainly get to a fitness level where you can run/swim etc without trouble, but at any given point it is going to be harder for you than for someone without a respiratory condition.

If you find that you cannot jump straight in to running for example, start with something lighter to build up to it; without asthma you could just jump in to running and develop your base cardiovascular fitness that way, but you'll need to build a solid base beforehand because its just that much harder for you.

I'd suggest trying something which is very easy to adjust the intensity of so you can adjust to where you are at.I'll add bulgarian split squats. Thanks.From what I've seen, there are *NOT* too many folks &gt; 200lb on this sub. Also as /u/Bojangles010 mentioned, that rule is outdated and silly.

edit: whoops, left out a crucial word. I'm fine with big boys/girls.You mean from here? http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine

Also you could add few more warmup excercises for legs.Thanks for the reply.
Was that just  passive holds or holds with the shoulders to the ears, elbows turned out, stomach tight, butt tight, legs locked out, toes pointed oh and pelvis posteriorly tilted?Okay, and would a good warmup essentially being the starting bodyweight program warmup?  Like the dislocations and what not?One egg has 6g of protein so I'll need 4-5 eggs to substitute for one protein shake. It's a lot quicker and easier to drink the shake.That stretching routine should be done after workout, warmup before workout and stretch after it.Are all of these okay to do before a workout session?  Or should I do them separate as to avoid injury.&gt;Burpees are excellent for conditioning. Unfortunately, great cardio and strength aren't the same thing. Mind you, they are awesome, and I love them.
I recommend you do 100 for time. It's rough. If you're under 10 minutes, you're in great shape. It's pretty much that simple.

Excellent advice.  Also a great movement for high intensity interval training.Why do you train fasted?  On the off days I hit the gym without a meal first (I am a weightlifter, plan to switch to BWF over the summer once I am impressed with my lifts) I am miserable every minute of the workout.  I have never tried fasting with aminos though, I typically load myself up with greek yogurt to hit the + nitrogen balance.Then you need to stretch hips and the back too, here is the best routine for to begin with http://phraktured.net/starting-stretching.htmlI imagine you would plateau pretty quick in terms of strength gains.  They are pretty good cardio though.  They're kicking my ass right now, but for example there's a couple guys at my gym who could do burpees until their limbs fall off  just because they're already at the top of what burpees can do for them.

It all depends on exactly where you are right now, what destination you have in mind, and how fast you want to get there.

Another exercise worth doing, occasionally because there's serious possibility of injuring yourself, is breakfalls and getups.  Who would have thought that lying down and standing back up could be so exhausting?  Seriously though, if you do attempt it go easy on the breakfalls and keep your arms at a low angle or you'll blow out your shoulders.  I just got over this angry purple bruise on my ass from doing some the other week, and then I tore it open doing some more two days later because I'm a glutton for punishment.  Don't be like that, you don't want open wounds on your ass.Are you saying you can start at an L hang and do the pullover at that height setting?

If so, that sounds perfect.Thanks for linking that, I couldn't remember where to find it.I've done that, I bought olympic lifting shoes.  Nothing works.  Can barely go down a couple inches.  It's horrible APT, hips, and ankles.Try chia seeds and hemp seedsThanks. A few follow-up questions:

Do you use barbell or kettlebell (or two dumbells)?

Is it supposed to be difficult? Like, did you select a weight and then work up the sets and reps gradually?  I'm just not clear on what a plateau would feel like when it's an exercise to condition your spine and progress very Gradually, as opposed to upping it 5lbs every week.

It'd probably make more sense to me when I actually try it out. Will start tomorrow.I'm allergic to eggs, is there a good alternative for me?Well I used to eat a whole lot of greek yogurt, but that was costing me around $5 a day, just for that one item.  Nowadays I'm mostly replacing that with some delicious cheese sandwiches, and still drinking a lot of milk as well as eggs, ham, chicken.


My diet is the opposite of balanced though, I pretty much eat whatever I want whenever I feel like it.  On Sunday I woke up at 8, had a hot chocolate and some cinnamon buns for breakfast at about 1, had a cheeseburger and milkshake at about 7, went home and made some stew for the week and had a bowl of that at about 10pm.

During the this week it's usually bowl of granola and milk, snack of cheese sandwiches, lunch of stew, snack of apples and almonds, dinner of whatever catches my fancy.  I'll switch out things when I get bored.

I don't count calories or macros or anything, and I'll never use supplements if I have a choice.  I know I'll never have the perfect body, but life is for living, not for just repeating a routine.  I'm in better shape than I was last month, and that's the important part.It's a massive waste of money. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2d04gk/experiences_overcoming_gravity_vs_gymnasticsbodies/cjx9xr2) is why.

TL; DR: This is what my friend had to say about it:

*Think of it like an ido portal seminar but with an old  wrinkly man who no longer practices what he preaches.*

Any other questions, let me know.Yes.Where I live it's pretty expensive too. Generally it's imported.Why does everyone seem to do curls before rows?  I though compound before isolation was a standard concept?Someone who weighs in at 200lbs?Burpees are excellent for conditioning.  Unfortunately, great cardio and strength aren't the same thing.  Mind you, they are awesome, and I love them.

I recommend you do 100 for time.  It's rough.  If you're under 10 minutes, you're in great shape.  It's pretty much that simple.

Don't do burpees every day tho!  They are awful for overuse injuries.  Because each rep is broken up between arms and legs, you can easily wreck tendons and joints in both because the muscles don't get pumped out as fast.  It's the same reason I don't recommend a bunch of low rep sets.  You want to overload muscles, not connective tissue.

Also, you need to include other things in your workout.  Do some pullups as well.  Great for abs and a wider back will make your waist look smaller.If you don't mind spending a few bucks you could get GMB's rings one routine or buy Overcoming Gravity and make yourself a custom routine.Daily total protein: ~202g of protein

This is my bulking diet template. Even without dinner I'm getting at least 200g of protein. If dinner has at least a bit of protein I will get at least 220-230g.

Hope this helps.Its ankle flebility, do it like [this](https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/arnold-squatting-2.jpg) and you should be doing full rom then And wrists and elbows as well.  At least if you do them every day.I always prefer real food, but

1) Convenience. Just scoop and mix. You can take a shake on the go, etc..

2) For anyone who is bulking, it's an easy way to add more protein and calories to a meal without adding more food, because you were probably going to drink water anyway.My recommendation would just be to do your L sits at the start of your workout.  As long as you keep good form on the deadlifts it shouldn't do you any harm.Eh, honestly as long as I have it in something even vaguely insulated I'll let it go for a really long time. Plus I go by smell a lot. If its questionable I'll toss it.Wow lol where do you live? Do they fly it in by plane or why is it so expensive?I'm not going to post my full (current) routine, because if my ADD has taught me anything it's that my workout will have changed by this time next week.  Instead, here are a couple observations.

Partial ROM headstand pushups are a totally valid exercise.  They might not have as much pushing benefit as a full ROM anything, but there's a lot of core activation involved which is just as necessary to build as raw pushing strength.

Headstand leg lifts are severely underrated.  I've been attempting to work up to a solid 30 reps, before I add ankle weights and do it all again.  I feel like forcing myself to maintain good form under exhaustion is doing more for both skill and strength than if I only practiced my balances fresh.

Question time!  If I really want to get serious about my balancing, should I scrap most of my workout and have total focus on balancing?  I made a list last night of like, 20+ exercises that would improve my balancing, and while it's lacking in traditional push and pull work I feel like it would still build a lot of stength.  What do you guys think?Meat--see /r/keto.  And sometimes bugs--see /r/entomophagy.The goal is wrists 1-3 inches from wall (3-8cm) or 1-3 finger-widths.

As for time that's up to you and your training goals.

I have practiced some places where the warm-up was six 1-minute belly-to-wall HS with 2 min rest between for stretching.

At other places, the session will start and then end with 60sec, or 90sec, or 2min belly-to-wall HS.Low fat cottage cheese costs ~$5 for 300g in my country.

The struggle is real, especially for a student on a budget, like me..I write in a daily journal (pen and paper), and after starting BWF there is a section I devote to just recording any exercise done on one particular day. Right now doing beginner routine so there aren't that many exciting things to write.

Calorie counting is done on app on the phone, making sure I document everything that is eaten. I use the default exercise list to track my net calories for each day.I use powders because often I find it difficult to eat enough in a day where I work out a lot. I found drinking the extra calories and protein was easier then eating it. When it comes to drinking something I would rather drink milk, chocolate protein powder and peanutbutter then I would eggs. I already eat 5-6 eggs for breakfast. Additionally prep is easier. I love scrambled eggs, but I really hate hard boiled eggs which brings down the portability of eggs.If you're getting sick of pushups, I've heard of people getting good results with a 100 pullup, 100 dip workout.  All you have to do is hit both those numbers.

Personally, I would add core work as well, but just a suggestion if you feel like pushups aren't building enough strength for you.You should definitely do more than 2-4 squats total in your workout.  It's just not conductive towards making any progress at all, and if you're doing it without warmups it could even be dangerous.

Try adding some Cossack squats or rear foot elevated split squats to your routine.  Pretty much this.  It would take twice as long to do everything if you did each exercise before moving onto the next one.

The added conditioning doesn't hurt either.Anyone know if any chain grocery stores or similar sell quark in the US? I tried it when I was in Germany and like the taste more than Greek yogurt. I have only seen them once at a farmers market in America...Not to mention they're hell on your knees. Or at least my knees. They're a pretty great warm up IMO though.What is your time limit on hard boiled eggs being out at room temp? FDA says 2 hours, which is up there in BS-level with having steaks cooked to 145F and calling it medium-rare...I like quark but after two weeks eating it for breakfast i am a bit tired and looking for options. Besides the obvious meat / fish / chicken I usually down something like this when pressed for time:

Milk + Eggs + vanilla + banana + oatsUnless you're doing burpees for several hours at a time, you probably wont lose weight.

Unless they're at your upper level of strength, you're probably not gonna put on muscle doing them.

You probably cant have both of these things at the same time.I mean as far as eggs go yeah, but lets be real if I pack them at 8am and go to work and go to eat them at 1pm during my lunch I am less inclined to eat them than I would a protein shakeSimilarly, I vomited cottage cheese as a child and haven't eaten it since.That was a great read and I think it hit exactly on the issues I've been having.  Thanks for sharing.well...i'm still on knee pushups really, and am still having trouble making it to thirty.who the hell needs 200g??He really is a [hero](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/281hw7/z/ci6mtyx).

Edit: spellingGrass fed and pasture raised beef, pork, chicken, eggs, organs, lard, and tallow, plus green vegetables and plenty of salt and butter are the majority of my diet. My only supplements are vitamins D3, K2, C, iodine, and magnesium.

I'm sort of anal about where my food comes from and who knows what's in those powder and shake supplements.Hardboiled are pretty portable Use fruit. I also like a walnut/honey combination.

Also just suck it up, quark is great.Yeah.As a kid I drank milk, and then threw up for some reason (probably mildly sick anyway).  My dad thought it would be funny to say "look, that's cottage cheese".  I've never been able to eat it since.Why are you trying to get 200+ grams of protein in a day though? The study posted throughout many of the fitness based subs concluded that there isn't a benefit past .82 grams/lb of bodyweight. Why not take some of that protein and use it to restore some glycogen through carbs or toward hormonal production through fats instead?If you set it on the highest dip setting, it's very steady even when on top. Depending on your height, you may be able to start from an L hang. I'm 6'5" (but with slightly shorter arms than normal) and in my starting position I have to sit my ass, raise my legs, and only slightly bend my arms. It's still fun and covers the significant portion of the movement.It is sort of the similar but not quite. I like the taste and texture of quark better than cottage cheese. http://www.functionallymad.com/journal-your-training-dont-log-it.html

It's a decent starting point and gives lots of ideas. How do you keep your quark tasting interesting? Any tips to not get tired?The name is low fat cottage cheese.  So doing some assisted/weighted chins after having done the negatives?My go-to mix is greek yogurt, oats and berries, with a drizzle of honey. It is delicious.Not to my knowledge. Are you thinking of lactic acid?

Lactose is hard for some people to digest. I do alright with it and milk has pretty solid macros, provides really easy calories, and I enjoy it. It's the only thing that got me through my recent bulk. I though lactose was bad for recovery?Sure you can, just scale it back. There are plenty of detailed progressions on the internet so I won't go there but you can always start with frogstands, chest to wall handstands and negative pistol squats.Don't forget Gaston...I haven't supplemented w/ powder* in a year maybe?

I grill/broil:

* chicken breast
* steak tips

I slow-cook:

* pork shoulder
* chicken thighs

and I'll throw a fried egg or two on top of anything. I can pretty easily get ~150g of protein per day on two meals like this, w/ varying fat. For example, I'll skip breakfast (training fasted), eat an 8oz chicken breast for lunch (~50g of protein) w/ a sweet potato (another 10), then throw ~10-12oz of steak/shoulder/thighs (~100g protein) into brown rice for dinner. Easy and delicious.

I buy my meat at Costco where I pay between $2-$5 a pound (pork cheapest, steak most expensive). It's also much more satiating than powders and doesn't spike my blood sugar so I can keep better control of my appetite. Every Sunday I spend an hour or so grilling everything and then just store it in tupperware for the week. Economical, easy, nutritious.

*I do take BCAAs if I am training fasted. (Gender, Age, Height, Weight [kg/lbs please]) Male, 25, 60 or 183cm, 174lbs or 78.9kgs

Diet/Mood/Energy/Anything else relevant to your training:

Plan on cutting @ 2000 cal or less for at least 4-5x days of the week to get my diet in check.

HS is getting much better, I feel like within a few weeks I should be able to hold a consistent handstand for at least 10-20 seconds.

Pull up endurance feels like it's decreasing, can only hit 20+ on certain days but I'd rather work on higher pulls ala chest to bar pulls to better my MUs.  I was able to get a few dead-hang false grip MUs on the bar so that's cool.

Dragon Flag progression is actually getting somewhere, candle sticks are much easier now and I can lower fully (w/ both legs) with almost full control, can almost get back up.

Weighted Pullup PR currently @ BW+90lbs x 2

Weighted Dip PR currently @ BW+135lbs x 2

Weighted Chin up PR currently @ BW+90lbs x 1

BW Pullup PR @ 23 reps

BW Chinup PR (havent tested)

BW Dips (havent tested, know I can get 30+ though)

Longest holding HS is about 12 sec

http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_i_usually_train_with_barbells.2Fdumbbells.2C_how_do_i_integrate_that_with_bodyweight_training.3FMeat (where I live, sardines are the cheapest kind); eggs; milk derivates like cheese; legumes combined with rice.

I do take protein powder, but only when I haven't hit my protein target for the day, I don't want to cook, and there's nothing else available that can be eaten without cooking, as protein powder is the most expensive option (even more expensive than cheese) where I live (Dominican Republic). However, where my brother used to live, he did the math, and protein powder was cheaper than eggs or meat (he lived in Logan, Utah, USA). I don't use protein powders frequently, the last time I had a protein shake was like 3 weeks ago, about the 5th time in a year.

There's nothing unhealthy about eating protein powders, if you the powder ONLY contains protein, not those mixes more commonly sold (through some mixes, like mass gainers, have specific proper uses). Just go with the cheaper option."Shouldn't" is not the right term. It's okay if you're a bit rounded at first. Then overtime you aim to straighten out the back.Rule 1.Rule 3.Please review the sidebar on the right before posting.I browse this subreddit purely for my interest in Bodyweight fitness, I work out solely in the weights room. Regardless of that I would like to say FUCKING GOOD ON YOU for choosing to get motivated, the right way.

Also read up on the old side bar, great source of info for well rounded progression.

Final point, your current pics are somewhere I want to work towards. You have a great foundation to start from. Stay motivated. Stay hungry. GET FIT!

Best to you mate.&gt; Since handstands are a primary goal for me, should I switch to HSPU progression instead of dips for strength work?

Nah. You can add more HS work (maybe on off days) though.

&gt; Is doing both Ido's shoulder stability and Emmet's ER strengthening too much?

Depends on the intensity.

&gt; Where is a good place for me to put them in, and how often?

End of your workout or in mobility sessions. Do a couple sets with a longer hold at the end (currently Emmet has me doing 3 sets of 10 with a 15-20s hold at the end). Slow tempo.
I started out with 15 kg, and am still using 15 kg (it's been a couple weeks). Philosophy is to only increase weight if you're at a plateau.That's [Arevik Seyranyan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cStSBZPIY6k). She's a circus artist, third generation iirc. Wouldn't it be better for him to distribute the weight towards his knuckles too?Oh jeez, maybe one day. Glad that we cleared that up! Having dandasana posture with a flat back is called an "Advsnced L-sit" and is monstrously difficult. In an L-sit we are working on strengthening the shoulder depressors. It will make holding tolasana easy as pie! &gt;My goals are to lean up. Some extra strength would be nice, but primarily I need to trim the fat. I don't care how much I weigh, I just care about how I look and feel.

Eating less and doing the beginner routine is definitely the way to go. The routines you have been doing are too high rep for strength or mass. And yes make sure you get more than 1 day of rest (at least per muscle group). Traveling as well. Easier to pack a few servings of powder than carry eggs... Quark is quite common in Europe. It's similar to Greek Yoghurt. I buy mine non-fat. Costs about 70 cents for 500 grams of it, which will give you 45 grams of protein for about 250 calories.
In terms of cost-effectiveness, this is almost the exact same price as 45 grams of a high-end protein powder would cost you, and additionally I fucking hate the taste of protein shakes, so I'd rather down this.you're so fking amazing jesus christ&gt;  For example, you get more protein from an egg than a powder

This is patently false.

Furthermore, eggs also contain more calories relative to the amount of protein contained within them, so they're not your best option if you need more protein but don't have a lot of calories to get them in.Rly great answers, thx.

I dont know yet if i will go full bodyweight or not, but pistols sounds nice. Do you have a link to the post u did talk about?

Nope i cant do a L-sit, so i guess i will do some normal pullups, and weighted.

EDIT: Found the video.. :)







i use it, but if i didnt...chicken, turkey, pork, fish, beans, milk with some steak on the weekends.  oh wait, i already do that.  id just need to eat even more without powder, and i get so full already....I have the trapeze rigging. It is awesome for everything except "above the bar" work. Even if you get the version with stability bar (highly recommended) and use sandbags for extra stability, it still may sway if you kip too hard or apply torque above the bar. I also have the same equipment issue, especially in the winter (rural New Englander living in a rental house). Muscle ups have to wait for summer at the moment. I just use a weighted vest to make progressions more difficult until I can get back outside to do workouts in the spring. Not ideal, but it's what I have to work with. Eggs, lots of eggs... Also cottage cheese, greek yoghurt and different kinds of meat. You know, the usual...That makes a lot of sense to me. I think the difference in postures at different levels just wasn't really clear to me in the beginner's guide for those of us with short arms and large behinds, though maybe I just needed to look even harder.Ahhhhhh that is totally where all of my confusion is coming from! Thanks! And totally didn't mean to insult your posture with that statement ;P. I do A LOT of yoga so I'm used to "expanding the rib cage." A pose that you're actively not supposed to do that in the beginning just was outside my understanding.Breakfast; Greek yogurt / eggs / sardines

Lunch; Chicken / eggs / tuna / sardines

Dinner; Chicken / salmon / eggs

If I'm consuming high carbohydrate I get additional protein from rice, beans, lentils, peas, whole grains etc etc and adjust main protein sources as necessary.  I occasionally drink milk but my dairy is usually cheese (with eggs) or greek yogurt.  I'll incude nuts with meals, string cheese, etc

Not even including trace protein sources from other food items, I've never had a problem actually hitting my protein targets (150g, give or take, depending on present goals.  I don't usually snack, so I pretty much split it up over the course of 3-4 meals and have never felt compelled to supplement with protein powders.  I can definitely see the convenience being a big factor, but I also enjoy eating real food which many will advocate over consuming protein supplements, at least 'excess' amounts.I try to get it in my meals (ie. meat, legumes, nuts, eggs). My standard protein supplement if I'm feeling short is plain non fat greek yogurt with some fruit,  seeds, some maple syrup or jam.A couple quick points:

1) I wouldn't recommend doing both squats and deadlift in the same workout. They're both fairly draining exercises that hit fairly similar muscle groups. I used to try to fit both in and quickly realized that it ruined my form on the second exercise. There are some dudes who double up, but they've often been lifting for years. In general, for a beginner, split em up.

2) I would reconsider the way you've ordered your exercises. For example, I'd put plank earlier in your workout, if not incorporate it into your warm up. I'd stick deadlifting last or almost last, because it wrecks your posterior chain. Again, order is something that you have to play with and find your own balance, but putting deadlifting near the end of the workout is generally a good idea.

3) Consider changing barbell rows for bodyweight rows. They're easy to do on a bench rack and a better exercise, IMO.

4) Find someone to teach you how to squat. Seriously. Barbell squats are *so* much easier to progressively load than bodyweight squats. You only need to learn the form once and you can squat forever. Also bodyweight squats are just as dangerous to your joints with bad form. Watch [Alan Thrall's squat video](http://youtu.be/bs_Ej32IYgo), find someone to spot you/critic form, and just start light.I vaguely recall some study showing that protein synthesis was affected most by alcohol consumed in the period from 24 to 48 hours after lifting (or some similar time frame).  It was not strongly affected by alcohol consumed only a few hours after lifting.  Drinking before lifting would also not really affect protein synthesis, but would also mean you are lifting drunk, which is probably not the smartest thing one could do.

Two things I also remember: 1) the reduction was on the order of 20% or so, so it wouldn't render the workout useless, it's just suboptimal, and 2) it was a pretty considerable amount of drinking, something like 10 or more drinks, so having a beer or two after a workout probably isn't a problem.Eggs; nuts; deli meats; canned fish; pre-cooked chicken, steak, ham, etc.Cool Hand Luke ate 50 eggsOh sorry, I meant the exercises not listed in the beginner program. I just assumed that I can't straight up jump into progressions for my goal exercises.For OAC you can try adding some auxiliary work and get extra volume that way.No down votes here, but the reality for me is that access to water and a cup and spoon is easier than preparing items ahead of time and eating.&gt; you get more protein from an egg than a powder

Well, one scoop of powder is about the volume 1 - 1.5 eggs and has 4 - 5 times the amount of protein.

&gt;for a comparable volume eggs are much cheaper

With regard to price, I haven't a clue as we keep chickens so I don't know what eggs cost.  That said, one serving of my powder has the protein of 5 eggs, and - if the internet is to be believed - eggs are about $.20/each, so $1/serving would be the equivalent price.  You can find supplements that are cheaper and supplements that are more expensive than that; but, overall you don't get more protein, and it's not "much" cheaper to eat eggs.

That's all irrelevant to the original point of discussion, I don't use protein powders because I don't like the flavors, but I have recently ordered an unflavored powder to try.  That being said, I do find eggs to be the simplest real-food way to supplement protein intake.  Edit to add: oh yeah, and greek yogurt - I'm one of those vitamix weirdos and use greek yogurt in my green smoothies.M, 26, 193 cm, 88 kg
I do a pyramid PT three times a week (at least two days of rest between each workout)
It is from a Stew Smith (former Navy SEAL) book.
Here's the full description

http://www.stewsmith.com/linkpages/ptpyramids.htm

At the end of the workout, you'll have done:
-100 pullups (wide, shoulder width, chinups, commando, neutral grip)
-200 pushups mixed with dips
-300 4count flutter kicks mixed with sit-ups or whatever ab exercise you love.
After some months this routine is still a real butt kicker. Chrono times vary from 28 to 34 minutes for this PT.
Would recommend.

For the legs I mainly run plus do bodyweight squats, charlie Chaplins raises and lunges.I do 10-15 minutes of foam rolling and then 20 minutes of static stretches with yoga elements, to work on my flexibility and mobility. This is after a weightlifting routine though, I've not done bw in a while but I imagine it'll be similar just shorter.If you're trying to get 200+ g of protein in a day then don't you think its rediculous to eat 20 eggs a day? It's definitely **not cheaper**, it's really inconvenient and really hard to eat THAT much eggs or chicken. A lot easier to just drink it.

I use whey protein and this is my side of the argumentIs that a daily calorie limit? Yea. The constant no rest will make your sweat and build up your cardiovascular potentialWhat do you mean by non-basic exercises?I am working through the same progressions, and the recommended rep range for normal, full push ups in CC are 2x20 before moving on to close (diamond) pushups.  You need to cut the reps and move on.I am going by convict conditionings suggestions.100 pushups? I thought the general recommendation was to increase the difficulty after you can get more than 3x12 or so? Have you tried diamond or one handed pushups?

How about working the pistol squat progression?Your back shouldn't be straight in an L-sit. You should look like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUZJoSP66HI). Point your toes.

I keep most everything in my head, with the exception of some weight/rep progress when I start a new routine/cycle so I can know what I should be lifting the next session.But wouldn't you flex your spine during regular back squat?

I've always had back/spine issues with deadlift, clean, and other overhead lifts but never single-legged squat.  Most I've done is 5 full reps with 80lbs on my back.Thanks. So less rest then.  Make it more cardiovascular then you will sweat. Those high reps break them up into sets of thirty for example and go from one exercise to the other after each rep.

Rep pushups, then immediately rep squats then immediately abs, thrn then back to pushups etc.I'm new to this sub so may get down voted for this, but my doctor friend said you're much better off not using powders, even just thinking financially.
For example, you get more protein from an egg than a powder and for a comparable volume eggs are much cheaper, so why would you use a powder?
I'd be interested to hear both sides of the argument though.The old school method...eggs, cheese/milk and meat (mainly fish/beef/bison). The occasional beans and rice added in. Plenty of protein to go around....meat?The squat progression starts out very easy, but the recommendation is that once bodyweight squats are easy you will replace that portion of the workout with squats and deadlifts, as described in the section you quoted. If you really want to do pure bodyweight, though, you could look at some Pistol Squat progressions. /u/Antranik made a good video about these.

As for the L-sit pullups, can you do an L-sit? If you can't it's likely that you need to develop strength in your hip flexors by practicing L-sits before you can do an L-sit pullup. In the meantime you could work on weighted pullups, wide grip pullups, or just trying to do more pullups.

The L-sit is a beastly core exercise, and you're also getting core exercise by doing the bodyline drills, especially the hollow body hold. If you want more core work, you could integrate dragon flags or ab wheel rollouts, though.Any wooden rod/dowel should be strong enough. And then you could just slip over any weighted plates over it for a bar or adjustable dumbbell.Chicken, lentils, eggs, beans, nuts, greek yogurt, chickpeas.For some reason I still haven't found apps that I like using consistently. For fitness tracking I use a pen and paper notebook - each week takes up two pages so I can always just flip back a page to see what I lifted last week and make sure I'm working on incremental growth each week. Pen and paper feels like old-school work tracking which keeps me in the grounded mindset I need for lifts.

I use GoogleSheets for food tracking. I will usually eat consistently for a month or two before I change my diet, Sheets makes it very easy to track macros and setup/mod new diet plans while not having to re-enter macro details. I think you're just worrying that your hands are not directly underneath your shoulders, but it's totally normal to place the hands ahead of the butt so the butt is behind the hands so the shoulder blades are protracted.  You don't have to lift the chest up proudly in an L-sit.  That's a very advanced version of the L-sit that you could tinker with after you get the regular L-sit, which you are calling "bad posture L-sit" which is totally the normal one.[Last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2umgrk/training_tuesday_post_your_routine/co9p5x8)

**Stats:** Male, 25 years old, 165cm/5'5", 59kg/130lbs

**Goals:**

For 2015: One armed pull ups, front lever, slow and back conscious build up with climbing

**Strength ~ calisthenics** four times per week/two day split working AB-AB--

*Warmup* is typically a handful of push ups, and pull ups before general limbering and movement. Shoulder dislocations. Then I alternate these two workouts.

**Workout A**

5 x 5 weighted pull ups (+12kg currently)

3 x swings (7kg) (very attentively at the moment, new movement for me so working on form)

3 x 12 push ups (my back still disagrees with more unilateral variations, I I will get some resistance bands for these as I really like the idea of adding resistance that way)

**Workout B**

2-3-5-2-3-5 pyramid of one handed OHP on each side (11kg) (new movement for me so form focus) (building up to 2-3-5-2-3-5-2-3)

3 x 10 goblet squats (5kg) (still working on form a lot)

3 x suitcase carries around my apartment on each arm (15kg)

Tucked front lever work (not really bothered about hold times at the moment, I am getting back into doing the movement again)

*Note:* I dropped the weight on my swings and squats for now.

**Rehab**

I am continuing with extension exercises and doing additional stretches depending on what feels tight that day. I am working on my squat form to eliminate any buttwink.

**Grip accessory work**

I am working on crushing strength from the Adamantium guide posted on /r/GripTraining and will work on open hand and pinching strength once I have set things up on my pull-up bar to do them. I will do one day of each type a week at the end of my workouts.

**Other stuff**

My finance is getting stronger. My resting heart rate is 70 which I will do something about over the coming months. Its pretty common in the US among free software advocates and junkies like myself.  Really a nerd/geek kind of thing, it was out of place, I apologize for the ambiguity.I use a folder full of plain text files, one for each workout. Every day before I exercise I copy the previous workout's file, and then I adjust the numbers as I exercise.Ton of whole milk and chicken. Beans, Nuts, Seeds, Legumes in generalMilk. Beans. Some cheese.I emailed the people at trapezerigging, they said the bar isn't suitable.  It's too light for what I'm hoping to do.  Nice to get a fast honest response, makes me wish it did meet my needs so I could buy from them.

Has anyone else had success on home equipment for pullovers?That's an advanced position, the end goal. You have to work up to that. It's not really "bad posture" as you are not loading your back with any weight, but as you get stronger you can work on bringing your butt forward. The main things to focus on at this stage are really pushing yourself off the ground with your shoulders, keeping your arms locked, and compressing your abdomen to bring the legs up. You'll find that after you get good enough at the other stuff, straightening your back is not so hard.a mixture of grip training, jump roping and ab wheelingwhat are the daily five?

edit: nevermind, [found it](http://kitlaughlin.com/forums/index.php?/topic/374-the-daily-five/).Yeah, generally, whatever feels comfortable is OK. You can always vid it and post it up for a check.The day after? I thought you shouldn't drink the day of lifting? Now I shouldnt drink the day after to?Male, 24, 5'8'', 150lbs

My goal is just to continue getting stronger and move along the progressions.

I have 2 workouts, an upper body and a lower body.

Upper Body Workout:
mobility
warm-up

3 sets of handstand practice using the wall as little as possible

3 sets of L-sit/compression work

3 sets of Ring support/ L-sit on rings

3 sets of weighted pullups - 25lbs x 7

3 sets of weighted dips - 15lbs x 8

3 sets of archer rows - x 5

3 sets of ring pushups x 8

A few sets of tuck planche progressions

Grip work

Stretching

Lower Body Workout:  (what it typically is, have a knee injury holding me back currently)


mobility

warmup

3 sets of dumbell squats x 12-15

Pistols

3 sets of weighted lunges

3 sets of hip thrusts

3 sets of shrimps

stretching


Starting to plateau a bit so ive been mixed up the routine a bit. For example, switching weighted pullups with archer pullups or L sit pullups. Hoping that will help me break through the plateaus.


It's just to speed up your workouts. Since you're alternating between push and pull, you're recruiting completely opposites of muscles allowing a greater rest time between use of each individual muscle.

Supersets cut your time in half.Yes. I'm eating at a caloric deficit and doing HIIT sprints 2 times a week. I already walk to and back from work 3 days a week (1 hr per day total).

I think i injured my shoulder doing straight bar dips. Too much strain for me.I think I'd be able to do that for HSPU, something like do 2 every minute for 20 minutes (probably do a set less of dips though) or just increase sets. But with OAC negatives I just feel way too fried to be able to do more than 3 sets with decent form. Plus I don't want to fuck up my elbow too much, so I don't really know how to increase progress with those other than light/heavy. Any ideas?Maybe keeping your muscles a bit fresher? Pull ups and rows have some muscle overlap, so doing them sequentially might hurt the intensity of whatever is second. Kinda like doing squats then deads after.I view static stretching as part of my routine and it happens at the end.  I do it for improved mobility not for a cooldown.  Glad to help!Google docs spreadsheets for each movement.  I don't track food.  Shouldn't you be doing more cardio, plyometrics or anaerobic exercises if your goal's to lose your belly?

Those exercises you mentioned are strengthening your legs, not exactly burning enough though to lose a belly. (Sorry if you're doing those things too, but if this is your only routine you need to try to add in something else if you're trying to get lean) Good luck with the shoulder too. Shit's frustrating, I'm just getting back into the swing of things after an injury myself. Don't rush back into it!That's exactly what I was thinking of doing, but didn't know if people would suggest to get more rest time.
I have been lifting for over a year now, 6 days a week, so I do pretty well without rest periods.Thanks. That makes me confident about spending the money.Well, squats for me will actually be the last thing I switch to a barbell for.  It's the reason I want to do this bodyweight stuff honestly.  I LOVE squats... but I can't go even CLOSE to 90 degrees without falling on my ass.  So I really want to be able to do that.London.Which is why I'd love to go. I've never had proper coaching.Where you based in the Uk?You can totally do it.

Squats and deadlifts are recommended to be done with barbells.

I'd suggest you to have something like  ABA/BAB weeks A bodyweight, b weightlifting. Just an idea, but you can totally do both!**From the beginner routine:**

Integrating Barbell Squats and Deadlifts

The basic process works as follows:

The first workout of the week, you replace the squat progression by squats, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.
The second workout of the week, you replace the squat progression by deadlifts, 3 set of 5 repetitions.
The third workout of the week, you replace the squat progression by squats, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.
So every week, you will be squatting twice and deadlifting once

Before you do your "work sets" it's a good idea to warm up with less weight for squats and deadlifts: first do a bunch of reps with just the bar, then add weight and do another (slightly smaller) bunch of reps, then add more weight and do another (smaller still) bunch of reps, etc. until you are at the weight you want to be squatting at.

As for actually selecting a weight: the first time, start with just the bar. Then add weights in increments you feel comfortable with. Try to add some weight every workout at first.

Btw deadlifts should be **1x5**I like pen(cil) and paper for the flexibility. A table with exercises along the top and a row for every day is how I do it, filling in my results in the boxes. I don't personally keep track of diet but you could add a column for calories.

I would advise this method for anyone who wants something quick and simple and doesn't feel the need to accurately plot progress over a long period.

Also, I get some motivation from the idea of an empty box that needs to be filled in. But that's different for everyone.Yeah, that's how I was trying to respond.  Elite personal training is awesome, and better than a ski week.  Every time I've had hands on training from a leader in the field (any field) I have felt it was worth it.**Stats:** Male, 23 yrs, 5'8"/174cm, 158lb/71kg

**Goals:** good-ass freestanding handstand, fix Anterior Pelvic Tilt, rehab knees so I can run, prevent further injury in general.

**Routine:** Mostly just the beginner routine with some tweaks. Knees hurt so my leg work is limited. I do full body strength work MWF and shoulder mobility ([Emmet's handstand post](https://emmetlouis.wordpress.com/2014/10/04/fixing-arched-back-in-handstand/)) / skill work TuThSa. Some things I do daily.


**Daily:**

Dedicated to rehabbing knee valgus (due to weak hips and VMO) and fixing APT via the recommendations in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1prg6b/update_to_the_anterior_pelvic_tilt_fixing_thread/).

* walk my dog 30 minutes

* handstand and crane pose skill work (always do wrist prep before)

* foam roll / myofascial release -- especially for lats, psoas, and thighs

* giving horse stance a shot for the month -- usually just a few minutes

* Phrakture's [molding mobility](http://phraktured.net/molding-mobility.html)

* APT and knee valgus fixer exercises: light psoas stretch, planks, dead bugs, [PPT glute bridge](http://bretcontreras.com/wp-content/uploads/Band-Bridge.jpg) and [bodyweight squats](http://bretcontreras.com/wp-content/uploads/Band-Squat.jpg) with band (like pictures except just below knees). Using the bands to strengthen my weak hips so my knees don't turn in so much, also doing clams and lying abduction for hips. Lastly for knees, doing light VMO strengthening exercises.

**Strength MWF:**

Warmup

* cat/cow
* body circles
* leg swings
* cossack squats
* lengthy shoulder limbering from Kit's Master Shoulder Flexibility
* wall slides
* dowel dislocates
* wrist prep
* bodyline drills 60sec each
* jump rope to get blood flowing

Skill

* ring support 2x40sec
* chest-to-wall handstand 3x30sec
* single leg L-Sit 2x20sec each leg (I know this is strength technically but I don't pair it with anything)

Progression pairs

* pullups / dips (close to 3x8 for both)
* feet-elevated rows / decline diamonds (at 3x10 for both, will change these soon)
* [back extension](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/47/Male/m/47_1.jpg) / abwheel rollout on knees (3x8 for both)
* leg work is tricky due to knee issues, so I usually just see how I'm feeling that day. Often this is careful split squats and lightweight goblet squats. I fucked up my knee from running hard and getting overzealous with pistol/shrimp squat work.
* dead hang for 3x60 at end of workout
* Phrakture's starting stretching after everything with a focus on lats/chest for handstand mobility

**Yoga / mobility TuThSa:**

This is mostly the daily work plus a few things.

* 30min vinyasa flow yoga
* light stretching if I feel like it
* external rotator strengthening using Emmet's recommendation: cuban rotations, trap 3 raises, and band pull aparts. all 4x10.
* [Ido's shoulder stabilization routine with light bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YHIV4a81Os)

**Sunday:**

My heavy stretching day. A bunch of the stretches from Kit's Master Shoulder and Squat flexibility series.




**Questions:**

* Since handstands are a primary goal for me, should I switch to HSPU progression instead of dips for strength work? The pike and box pushups didn't really appeal to me, but I would switch if it would make a big difference in handstand improvement

* Is doing both Ido's shoulder stability and Emmet's ER strengthening too much?  Doing both isn't too taxing but I wonder if it's unnecessary or too much volume.

* I really want to start implementing Jefferson curls into my routine and need advice. Where is a good place for me to put them in, and how often? What weight should I start with and what is a good (safe/conservative) way to progress? My hamstring flexibility sucks, and my pike with locked knees is somewhere between fingers and fist touching the floor. Should I wait until I have a little more ham flexibility?
Classic pen and paper workout log. Also, somewhat unique from others in my experience, I use a calendar-based log. I divide one full page of my notebook into 7 days ahead of time (each week), and my workouts go in their corresponding days. I used to do 2 weeks per page before my workouts got more extensive.

Programmed rest days are noted as "REST" and I list any stretching or skill work I do. This way, any missed workouts or rest days where I didn't do anything are left blank. If I fall off for a while, it's blatantly obvious as a string of blank days. I can't fool myself. This is a great visual indicator of my workout schedule and I highly recommend it if you have scheduling problems.I've just started working the OAHS. Do you usually use straddled leg position during your practice or closed/full position? That's awesome to hear, thanks for the advice! Do you know when and how I'll add in progressions for the non-basic exercises?There are always advantages to having someone work with you, especially if it's on more complicated movements. Even if you are filming yourself all the time, you can still miss some things that someone with more experience will notice. I was just trying to make a comparison as to what else can be brought for a similar price. I can afford the seminar, it's whether or not it'll feel like money well spent, after all it's a lot of money to spend on what is essentially a hobby (one I am passionate about though).I use myfitnesspal for food tracking, as they seem to have the best database of stuff if you want to scan (from EAN/UPC codes).
For fitness tracking, I use fitnotes irregularly and it works well (After you add the exercises that you are doing).Thanks for that. Interestingly, he also wants to do track.op plsIf a week ski holiday is something you can/would afford, the seminar is worth it.

If a week ski holiday is financially of reach/unjustifiable then the seminar probably is too.For outside context, we were allowed to do weight training in school in 7th or 8th grade.  Fit 7th graders were invited to the club, any 8th grader could take the class.

I was a wimpy asthmatic 12 year old.  Doing the weight training class gave me the confidence to do track and field the next year.  It didn't fix my asthma, but it helped me stop using the asthma as an excuse not to be active.Redwood 33 male, 175cm, 85.6 kg before the weekend, 88.8 after (!?)

[Previous Tuesday](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2ttr9w/training_tuesday_post_your_routine/co2dl6k)

**Short Term Goals**

* weight down to 70kg
* freestanding handstand for &gt;30 seconds
* get my hamstring flexibility up to the point where I can touch the floor in pike

**Long term goals**

* Lower body fat until I have a visible six-pack
* Do a pull up with my wife hanging off me

**Routine**

* Beginner routine basic mobility warmup
* 10 squat-jumps
* Handstands, I'm up to 5 seconds freestanding

* Pull-ups: Just got an effective bar, I can do a couple full pull-ups and then have to switch to negatives for the rest of the set, so it's about 3x3 full + 5 negative. Trying to up the number of full pull-ups by one every day.
* Dips: I haven't yet found anything stable enough to do true parallel bar dips so I do a horizontal dip, basically like a backwards horizontal row, between two chairs. Got too strong to do this with my feet out so now I'm elevating them on a stool. 3x8
* Squats: Have been a huge problem, I put up a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2ut6pf/squats/) about it. Currently doing 3x10-15 cossack squats and 3x10 sandbag squats.
* L-sits: I hate these things. I'm on one-legged L-sits for 3x20 seconds now though.
* Pushups: Trying to get the hang of pseudo-planche pushups as diamond isn't cutting it for me anymore. I find the pose really awkward though. At 3x6 of them.
* Rows: I don't have anywhere to do anything but horizontal, so I am starting to up my reps of horizontal to 3x10.
* Cooldown: Using the stretch set on /r/flexibility, thirty seconds per stretch, except pike stands which I do 2x60 seconds.

**Diet**

I went on a weekend work retreat and relaxed my calorie counting to about 100-200 below my TDEE instead of 750-1000 below, and seem to have gained a ton of weight. I think it's mostly from eating salty shit and not drinking much water though. We'll see what happens over the next few days.

**Other**

I'm moving in a few weeks and in my new house I'll have space to put up some real equipment. Hurray!I'll have to give it another read.

I've never had a personal trainer or been to a class, for the most part, working out doesn't cost me a thing. I suppose I'm trying to find a way to justify the price.Let me add that creatine and glutamine are very good in gaining strength/size.  I would recommend those in a protein shake most days.Like an ash or mahogany?I have read some good replies.  Let me add this:

Eat everything for your goal weight, not your current weight.  And, while some sources say that 1-2g per lb is necessary for protein, it has only ever been proven for about 1g per kg for protein (minimum).  I personally always find results with calories and protein monitoring, with a daily multi-vitamin (pretty much what the first response posted says).  So, if you want to be 220lb, use 100g of protein (minimum) as a reference.  And, use a BMR calculator, along with all activities done (literally everything), and remember that 3500 calories consumed is +1lb, and 3500 calories burned is -1lb.The smokable kind &gt;One of the most important functions of the post-exercise cool down is to prevent dizziness. Strenuous exercise causes the blood vessels in your legs to expand, bringing more blood into the legs and feet. When you stop exercising suddenly without taking time to cool down, your heart rate slows abruptly and that blood can pool in your lower body, causing dizziness and even fainting.

Holy shit. Thanks for this share. I got dizzy and felt light-headed for a few moments last night, driving home from my martial arts class. Thankfully, while stopped at a light. I didn't cool down afterwards, I just left. I thought it was an electrolyte depletion--felt just like it--but I'd been solid on my sodium and potassium all day and throughout class. Today, I Learned. I asked Sommer how important they were in his AMA. You can probably figure out what he replied :pSo long as the center of gravity isn't past the mid point between the bar and the end of the legs, it shouldn't fall. Just a note, additional leg work may not have been included because it adds weight in the legs.I am at around 1.5-1.7 g/kg at the moment, no protein supplements of any kind.

Pretty happy with that.  My date last night told me I had a hot as fuck body and I am barely even getting started, so :)That's exactly what I'm looking at. My best guess, with trains, accommodation and food, is it will cost around 500 for the two days.

I'm just hesitant as for the same price I could have a whole week ski holiday, 50 climbing sessions, Movement 1/2/3, Stretch 1/2/3, etc etc.

If it made a tremendous difference to my GST I'd think it worth while but I'm having a hard time imagining just how much difference 2 days training will make.  Hi guys i have learned already so much. There are flaws in my routine i believe. For rest i usually rest only around 15-30 seconds since i believed that it would work your muscles unless you fatigue them. I will implement more rest so i can do pull ups.
I have also looked into pike push ups. They are mainly a shoulder exercise? Is there any more pushing exercises that you feel i should incorporate in my workout? Im excited for my next workout!!

Btw in case youre wondering my height is around 5 ft 5/6. 19 years old and im skinny like when bruce lee before he got so ripped

EDIT: Also i am reading the reccomended routine. I want strength and aethetic gains. if i pair pull ups with dips do i need to rest since its a pulling and pushing? resting kills the moment!About keeping a full grip on the stick... I can't keep a single finger over the stick when I try to bring it down behind my back; no matter how wide I go (The stick I'm using is taller than I am). I don't get any stretch worth mentioning in the wrist or forearms either since it's the grip I cannot maintain.

I can get comparatively narrow width throughout the motion using a resistance band. Should I just resign myself to using a band or is there something else I can do to help with the required forearm/wrist mobility?What kind? &gt; There's cool down for weightlifting programs

There is?Joshua Naterman said that the earlier you can go, the better it is since it will fix any stuff you might be doing incorrectly and therefore set you up better for future work.

I was going to go to the UK one this summer but it falls on the only weekend in July that I know I won't be able to make it. So I will have to wait until 2016.

Just an FYI, if you own F1+H1 and manage to get the super early bird special on their seminar, you can almost half the price of the seminar.You can also buy or make [parallettes](http://www.endofthreefitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/parallettes.jpg) for that sort of thing.You are meant to be 'hollow', which means your back is curved somewhat and your shoulders press down. Unless you have a serious birth deformity there's no way your arms are too short in the correct position. When you stand up, do your fingers reach below your belly button?

My wife had major problems starting out because her shoulders were not strong enough and she wound up raising them, which lowered her butt. I had problems starting out because my core was weak and I couldn't compress my belly high enough. Both of these make it seem like the problem is arm length, but you'd have to look like a t-rex for arm length to actually be a problem. Take a look at proper posture and see the position of your back. The butt is going to be behind the shoulders.[Last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2umgrk/training_tuesday_post_your_routine/co9t1d0)

**Stats:** Male, 22 y/o, 5' 10", 171 lbs.

**Goals:** Freestanding HSPU, 2x squat, control my weight and avoid stretch marks. Long term: planche and cool shit.

**Routine:** The only major change to my programing was adding a four set of pull-ups, and negatives at the end. My pull up work now looks like 4/4/4/2 + 10 of the slowest negatives I can manage. Hopefully the extra volume will help me push through this pull-up plateau I'm stuck at.

Also I'm pushing my squat up too quickly. I'm gonna slow down and hold myself at 2.5 plates for two weeks or so to get my form rock solid and let my abs catch up. I still have a bad tendency to rock onto the balls of my feet at the very bottom of the motion and it sucks for my back.

My biggest problem right now is my weight's been fluctuating all over the place. When I weighed myself last week, I was a pretty steady 175-176.5 all week. Around Tuesday I started actively counting my calories and eating at a deficit to prevent the kind of absurd mass gain I've been experiencing these last couple months. This was motivated in part because of a small stretch mark I found on my left pec.

So far, I've averaged about -20% of my calculated TDEE over the last 7 days. Yesterday when I weighted  myself, I was down to 172 lbs. That seems like a rather excessive drop over a single week.

I weigh myself daily immediately after working out (~5:30 pm) to stay consistent. This rules out confounding factors like an inconsistent schedule, large meals immediately before, etc. Although 3.5 lbs could definitely just be water weight, I wasn't feeling dehydrated yesterday, and 3.5 is a lot of water to lose without noticing. Will update with today's weight to see where we stand.

**TL;DR:** Lost a bunch of weight, tryna figure out why.Here's a good resource on power training for athletes: http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/power-training.html

Basically what people do wrong is doing something that falls into the conditioning category(high reps, low rest) and thinking they are somehow improving their explosiveness. I did watch that which is why I was wondering if bad posture l-sits are ok. Everything but that video seems to indicate to do them with a straight back, butt under shoulders. I'm going to try blocks under my hands. Ok blocks sound like a great suggestion, I'll see what makeshift hard things I have around the house. Thanks. yes, they're strict pull-upsDid you watch Antranik's tutorial? Did you see his L-sit? It's quite hunched.I've always wanted to implement GTG, but it's not compatible with my work schedule

thanks!
I don't know of any in particular.  I know the calculator at IIFYM has an "athlete's formula" and a "lean body mass formula", where the latter allows you to put in your bf%; I think that calculator is recommended for people with higher bf%, and the former is presumably for people with lower bf%.  I would guess that bf% would have the greater impact than strength numbers, since it is muscle mass and not strength that would increase BMR.Yup, you'll have trouble with L-sits. You can try using blocks of wood or something to put your hands on, with your butt between them, essentially manufacture extra room for your butt. The beginner routine recommends 3 minutes and that's what I recommended. I know people who go up to 5 minutes since that suits them better and that's why I included the part in parentheses.I really did read everything, look at every diagram, and educated myself before starting this. Another user asked me to sit in a chair with my arms down and report back to him where my wrist falls. It's about a cm above my bottom bum. I really want to do L-sits (starting with the supported ones of course) but it seems like my only option for that is hunched over. Everyone told me this was a supportive community but goodness am I not seeing that in these comments. I'm in the same boat..I'm definitely starting with the supported L-sit. When I sit in a chair, my wrist comes to about a centimeter above the bottom of my bum :(. I agree with you on all of this advice except the rest period. 3 minutes is more than enough to recover. If you wait too long to recover, the next set won't be more difficult than the one before it, which should be the goal.

It's not that you shouldn't be able to complete the set, but it should require more effort. This should get harder until the last rep of the last set is failure.I'm really flexible, I'm not worried about that. I'm trying supported L-sits, so I'm not going straight to the hard version, but when sitting on a chair with my arms down, my wrists stop about a cm above the bottom of my bum. (User above me just asked me to check that)I make sure I'm not sitting anywhere idly regardless of how tired I am, just keep moving around doing stuff or take a bath, but not sitting: that's my cool down right now.My wrists are about a centimeter above the bottom of my bum. How long are you resting between those pull ups? You should rest such that you can give it maximal effort again, up to like 3 minutes (if not more). If even with a long rest, you can not do 10 again, do fewer reps and shoot for similar amount of reps for 3-5 sets. So, try to shoot for 3x8 or 5x5 pull ups with 1-3 minute rest between each set.

Sounds like you're ready for one arm but just need some balance and core strength to keep stable while doing it.

So basically for pull ups I can do 1 set of 10 reps then I get tired and I cannot do the same amount. Any tips?

I will try pseudo plan he push ups!! For diamond I can do around 25. Am I ready for one arm? When I do one arm I feel very awkward one side falling off (balance) is this normal? I also don't feel it in my arms muchWow this looks so silly and fun I love it. Here is a pretty good article on cooling down: http://www.livestrong.com/article/414362-why-does-the-body-have-to-cool-down-after-exercise/

The first paragraph sums up why I like to cool down. So, the pike -&gt; handstand push-up progression is different than just fooling around with handstands. [This](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2013/10/24/how-to-handstand-better-than-luke-skywalker/) is a fairly comprehensive guide to practicing handstands. Good luck and have fun -- and thanks for the gold!Thanks. Could you elaborate slightly on how people do explosive training wrong?Nobody's saying other routines give you size or strength, its just that people post "do beginner routine" on threads where that comment is not even applicable. It's like idgaf about the thread/ i didn't even read it but just do beginner routine.Yo!

http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/2usmog/serious_i_found_that_furiously_masturbating/I have never done a cooldown when training. I just do the heavy exercises like squats and deads first and finish with assistance/isolation workUPDATE: it is actually possible imitating a dual anchorpoint setup - mine looks like this now: http://imgur.com/lRBFuxd

You just have to roll up each of the TRX handles in opposite direction around the bar.Weight plus the bar.

Post to /r/weightroom, then link it in your TT or something.&gt; What are your thoughts on implementing light/heavy instead of adding more volume or doing something like rest pause or some density protocol?

For HSPU and OAC I'd try volume first and then intensify, and otherwise switch to light/heavy.

&gt; would weighted Bulgarian split squats or lunges (or even weighted pistols/shrimps) be a solid alternative for the traditional high bar back squat?

Definitely.I think TRX and rings are pretty different from each other, since the TRX work is usually done with feet or hands on the floor. Also that TRX is a great help for stability, e.g. when getting into pistol squat, plus I love the exercises with feet in the TRX, like atomic pike or [this exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj8VQZCJjHs&amp;t=4m47s) (which is something I have never seen with rings - correct me if I'm wrong)

Was looking for a way to advance into a floating training system wit hmy current setup, since I am not able [don't have room] to go for a ring setup (yet!). You could do rear leg elevated split squats(also called bulgarian squats) for further strength development, or use less weight and do them explosively. Sommer says to be careful with these, so procede with caution.

Another exercise is killers(IIRC): jumping lunges with weight; I assume these will be in one of the Movement courses.

 There are really many choices, I think one or two heavy leg exercises and one-two explosive ones will be enough. Make sure to read how explosive training is done - for some reason most people do it all wrong.**M/40/5' 7"/150**

**Goal: OAHS**

**Routine:**

I have changed things up quite a bit over the past few weeks after having decided that twice a week was not nearly enough to make progress in OAHS.



4 days a week:

3 x 1 minute sets of belly to wall - I spend 15 seconds on one arm then shift to the other.

2 sets of 1 minute wall walks.

12-16   30 second sets of OAHS  / 15 seconds per arm

5 straddle planche press handstand

5 pike press handstand

5 straddle press handstand

3x10 dragon flags

3x10 HSPU

3x10 Pullups

I alternate pullups with rows on alternating days.
Same with dragon flags - I alternate between tuck/straddle/pike or HLLyes, gonna try and adjust the TRX setup so it is closer to having two separate anchor points, I think this can work alright! Thx for vid.

Will also get more into the dips and HSPU with leg into TRX.
Was just under the impression that the advanced front/back lever is done in the rings, and I hoped some of the introductory exercises could translate to the TRX (probably only with two anchor points).yes, and I do L-sit on the floor already. Was looking to advancing that onto rings/TRX, which can be done and is alright. But it is not really optimal (since the straps is going under your arms, or outside shoulders). Gonna try and adjust the TRX setup so it is closer to having two separate anchor points to see if this works.I see, well you should incorporate both and start cleans early, even if with just the bar. It's a lot more technical than just a front squat, and doing front squats won't help you learn much past racking the bar. They also stress different muscles - front squats will work your quads and 'core' musculature and not so much your posterior chain. The "pull" in the clean is pretty much all posterior chain and upper back. [Last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2umgrk/training_tuesday_post_your_routine/co9qjo0)

**Male, 26, 183cm/6'0, 83kg/182.6lbs**

**Goals:** Get stronger, add muscle mass, better L-sit, get better at deadlifts

**Routine**

Warm-up

* 50s hollow hold
* Leg swings (10 each side)
* 5 x wall slides
* 60s side plank (right side)
* 10 x spidermans
* 10 x cat-camel stretch
* 60s side plank (left side)
* 10 x band dislocates
* External shoulder rotation (8-10 each side)

Main Routine

* 3x5-6 Deadlifts @ 90kg

* 3x6 Chin-ups *paired with*
* Side split holds (between sets)

* 3x6 PPPU *paired with*
* Front split holds/hip flexor stretch (between sets)

PLUS EITHER

* 3x1 L-sits *paired with*
* Pike stretch holds (between sets)

OR

* 3x6 Pistol squats @ 7kg counterweight *paired with*
* Ankle dorsiflexion mobility stretches (between sets)


**Routine Commentary**

I'm thinking of making pistol squats part of the "core routine" (ie doing them every workout) but I don't really want to drop L-sits. My L-sits at the moment aren't feeling as good simply because I'm doing them at the end of the workout and I'm already fatigued (I used to do them at the start and they felt great). I will think about this and see what happens. Ultimately, as long as I keep doing the DLs, chin-ups and PPPUs I'll be satisfied and I'll feel free to experiment with other exercises.

I experimented with support hold and dips today as I had a bit more time up my sleeve. I was able to get a 60s support hold on my first try which was pleasing (although, to be honest, I expected as much).

I forget to count my exact number of deadlifts each set but it's always either 5 or 6.

Yesterday I was a bit pressed for time so I dropped a set of deadlifts and the stretches and paired chin-ups with PPPU. Doing this I managed to get the entire routine (including the 10 minute warm-up) done in about 40 minutes which I was quite happy with.


**Diet/Mood/Energy/Anything else relevant to your training**

Diet is pretty much the same as last week. I've set a meal template for weekdays and I stick to that fairly well. Dinner is variable but I'm getting 190-200g of protein even without taking dinner into account so I'm fairly happy with it. I loosely tracked my calories yesterday and came in at around 3100 and this is without dinner (I didn't have dinner last night).

My sleep has improved a bit as I caught up on some sleep on the weekend, it could still improve it a bit more though. I noticed today that I was fatiguing a little easier due to undersleeping by a touch the past two nights.

I'm really enjoying my new routine so far which is great as it will help me adhere to it for longer.

Still haven't tracked my weight consistently or started taking progress pictures. Hopefully I will start soon.


**Questions**

When you quote a weight that you are lifting do you quote just the plated weight or the plated weight plus the bar? Because right now I have 70kg just in plates for my deadlift.

I would like to post a form check for my deadlifts. Should I post here in this sub or in /r/weightroom?


Edited post to reflect total weight of bar and plates used on deadlifts.
I've been doing phrakture's Molding Mobility ([link](http://phraktured.net/molding-mobility.html)) before working out, and Start Stretching after.

Static stretching is a nice way to cool down and relax if you have the available time. It's even recommended, though I don't have any sources right now to reinforce my claim.Thanks. To be clear, I meant start by only training F squats until I get good and comfortable before swapping them for cleans, not the order in a single workout.There's actually a slackline at my gym and I've been throwing in some SLSs on it. Perhaps I should do more of that.(M, 18, 178/5'10, Weight 70kg/155lbs)

 Goal: 5s straddle planche by the summer, hollowback press, FL, OAC, get fucking bigger legs

Routine:
Since I've been stalling on OAC and HSPU, I've decided to implement some kind of light/heavy alternation for those exercises. I do double progression for the barbell exercises instead of adding incremental weights (because I don't have them and because I like the bigger hypetrophy of the higher rep ranges in those exercises):

* Planche lean 5x10s

* 1 leg FL 2x5x6s

* HeSPU 5x3/3x5 alternating with OHP 3x6-10

* OAC negatives 2x3x5-6s alternating with weighted chinups or some kind of assisted chinup 3x6-10

* RTO plus leaning Dips 3x5-10

* Barbell rows (couldn't think of a bodyweight exercise to do instead of this) 3x5-10

* Some kind of squat/lunge/pistol/split squat


Diet/Mood/Energy/Anything else relevant to your training: Planche leans are the bomb.

Questions: What are your thoughts on implementing light/heavy instead of adding more volume or doing something like rest pause or some density protocol? Also since I'm limited to squatting the weight I can clean (around 50kg) would weighted Bulgarian split squats or lunges (or even weighted pistols/shrimps) be a solid alternative for the traditional high bar back squat?

First Full ROM HeSPU got done last week, but not consistent enough yet to move away from negatives completely.

This Steady State Cycle on FL work will come to an end, have to test my new max on friday.

Will work on building up volume on Cossack Squats as per advice of Emmet, who had awesome progress in depth with doing sets of 50.

Recently included Ring Curls as additional bicep tendon prep, don't know if it's doing any good yet.

Diet has been inconsistent the past two weeks, so weightgain has been minor. This week it's back on track though. Woo.

**Questions:** -[Last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2umgrk/training_tuesday_post_your_routine/co9qv64)

**Stats:** Male, 21 years old, 183cm/6'0", 83kg/182lbs
**Goals:** Solid handstand, build work capacity, git gud

**Routine**
Work capacity has much improved. The short rests aren't quite as bad now, except for maybe unilateral work, which has double the sets with the same rest, basically. Quite happy with my progress here.
I had some knee issues with cossack squats where I couldn't fully lock out the right knee, but that's doing better now. Still can't get it everytime, but it's much improved and should be good in a couple weeks.
Shoulders are doing okay, I guess. I need to find a good massage therapist because shit is tight.

**Diet/mood/energy**
Overate a lot over the weekend, so weighed in at 84kg today and yesterday, but for the most part my weight has been around 83 kg, whereas it was hovering just under 82.5 kg last week. Quite rapid, so it's a good idea to be a bit more strict about tracking and stuff. Should be easy because I have not many social events coming up.
Feeling fine overall, but I'm tired a lot. My new schedule forces me to get up early 3 days a week, and I've never been good with that.
Extremely high rep training has a place in the training of the musculo-skeletal _system_.  We are talking about a system here, after all, consisting of muscles that provide force that acts upon bones which ultimately produce movement.

The minute we introduce bones into our thinking, we need to talk about points of articulation, where bones meet a.k.a joints, and means of attaching muscle to bone, a.k.a tendons and ligaments.  This is made painfully, very painfully in fact, obvious when we start talking about RSIs, or repetitive strain injury, which is not a muscular injury, but rather mostly damage to ligaments.

If you're into bodyweight fitness, then you must have come across joint prep exercises.  Nobody that does joint prep expects those exercises to produce muscular hypertrophy.  If you do, then you should probably spend some more time considering your training approach.

All of this is to say that if you are doing extremely high volumes of low intensity work, then you are categorically not doing hypertrophy work.  The research literature on this is unequivocal.  What you are doing, however, is pumping synovial fluid through your joints, and this is crucial to joint health ( up to a point, as always ).

Ultimately, then, such accumulation training is much more likely to produce adaptations in joint / ligament structures which are much less visible to the eye.  It is hard to see a strong stable joint, although, boy oh boy will you know it when the opposite is the case.

So if /u/travelsnake's friend is mindlessly performing these accumulation sets expecting hypertrophy, then he is bound to be disappointed.  If he is diligently attempting to improve his joints, tendons, and ligaments, then he may have a point, although there may be better ways to go about it.  I would assume that you are like me, everything you eat goes thru without leaving a "mark".
I started to work out a year ago, im 30,177cm and start weight was 65kg....
I suggest to first get sack of "gainer" (high carb/ semi prot) and take it after workout. You will gain ~20kg fast, but that will mostly come from muscle gains.
Do not count anything for love of god, just look what you eat and eat!
I didnt eat breakfest before and well my luches were crap. Now i est healthy breakfest and also i try my best to eat healthy on lunch and so on.
(Oh and i weight kow 82kg with bodyfat on around 22%)

Until my shoulder heals this is what i'm doing.If you can do 50 push ups in one set, they're too easy for you. Move onto a more difficult progression such as diamond push ups or even PPPUs. This is all the in sidebar.I don't have time to cool down. I shower, have a shake, and leave for work. Yes thats it! So basically i can do around 50 push ups at once if i wanted to. Would there be any point in doing normal push ups 3 sets x 10 reps? I dont think id get much tired from doing 10 reps.Get used to working out! You really have to like it or you will end up doing half assed excercises.

If you want to start, /r/loseit will help
and as usual go for the beginner routine.

and dont forget to work legs!Please repost without starting your title with "training tuesday"Have you looked into a suspension trainer? Have a look at a few youtube videos, you can do bodyweight stuff with them.Depends, if you're already able to do pull-ups I'm not sure this will help you progress.I'm not flexible enough to do pike pushups but I'm extremely interested in doing hand stands. Are there any other alternative progressions you can recommend for getting into being able to becoming a handstanding badass?Stretches and maybe some foam rolling. Definitely need the rest! Try doing running or yoga or messing around with skill work like hand stands / crow stands / elbow levers or whatever on your off days.Alright I will be subbing Pushups with OHP. I definately enjoy benching more than push-ups since I feel like I'm in more control of my progression with that. Thank you for your advice! Also I do have one more question if you are able to answer it: If I do not feel sore, is it safe to do this work out daily? Would it speed up my strength progression or hinder it? Right now I'm doing it every other day and I feel as though I can definately do all this daily.One thing I forgot to mention in the other thread is that you also don't have any vertical pushing; you could swap out either push-ups or bench for a dip progression/pike progression/over-head press.Thank you for answering.Yes.Well yeah, focusing on diet is very important and takes a lot of time, at first.

Once you figured out and are able to handly a clean(er) diet without much stress and have time start working out.

But if you have the time and mind it, the beginner routine is there for you to add to all your efforts.

Make sure you have good form and don't get hurt by pushing too hard too soon.I dunno maybe.  I just kinda... stop." but just his ability to clear waste products"

Thanks for your comment, please could you provide more information/links on this aspect? I'm just starting bodyweight fitness and I'm complementing it with 30-40 minutes of rope jumping 3 times a week. My weight and strength gain goals are secondary to generally feeling fitter and cleaner but I'm struggling to find information that isn't centred on the hypertrophy/strength side of things. Thanks :)Aren't we? There's cool down for weightlifting programs so I thought BWF would require it too. Static stretching or something else?Need to update or flesh out the Press Handstand Technique Thursday.These are shiiiiiiiit.Hi Xatim, please see the update. It went well. Lousy routines.I moved my squats from floor to rail/fit ball as a progression. In a way it is similar to moving your pushups/dips to rings. But maybe it was covered already in foundation, I don't know.It can definitely work. While you listed five gymnastics goals, in reality you'll have to work only on three. By the time you learn planche you'll have a rock solid tuck front lever as well as a dragon flag. If I were you I'd start a 6-day marathon training program and add in 3 days of bodyweight training. That should be enough to advance on both fronts without overly stressing your body. My 2 cents: Working on front squats and cleans seems like a sound idea to me, but you need to work cleans first - they take way more skill and you will have to be fresh to learn the technique. Weightlifters usually finish off with squats.

If you're only doing two leg days, then keep them the same (cleans and squats on both days). Ask /r/weightlifting about programming and technique. They will be far more knowledgeable on the matter than most people here.Thanks a lot for all the info! Will be sure to add them in after each session.

Also, if you ever plan on doing one of these articles again... a planche one would be very appreciated :)Trees180See if you can get some rings.  At your weight, you need every advantage you can get, and rings are infinitely adjustable.

You may well have to scale back a lot of progressions to things people don't generally consider.  You fit into the category of people tha might actually benefit from things like bird dogs.  I don't mean to be insulting, just making you aware that if you can't do something, further research will probably yield a version you CAN do.

Never be afraid to ask us questions! We're here to help.  We're also creative people, so if you're genuinely stuck for ideas, we might be able to offer a different perspective. Vi know I wish I asked more questions when I started.

Basic workouts break down into push, pull, legs and core.  If you can't squat, put your hands on something.  If you can't do pushups, raise your hands or even use a wall.  Bodyweight rows can be made easier by just bending you legs, but try to reduce this over time.  Core work should probably be scaled versions of planks for now.

If you want some sick nasty conditioning, try just lying down and standing up for time.  Shit, gasses me out if I do it long enough.Oh I'm sorry I didn't realize this was a repost. So the consensus is to ignore and keep doing the straight handstand work? Sandwiches obviously. You can also add carbs to tuna by adding saltiness crackers. Canned fruit is also very high carb.At this level, I would say pick a plan that you feel you can work with.  Any plan.  There is no "best or perfect" one for you right now.  As you progress, you will get a better understanding what works for you, but right now, don't paralyse yourself with over information.  Good Luck!This is a dumb question but where can I get a stick like the one he has in this video? Also is it safe to weight something like that with plates?Food and a shower.the hardest part for me was getting time set for a workout, it was too easy to say "i dont have time". my solution was to fit minor reps when i could. cooking by the counter? do some leg lifts. waiting for my tea water to boil? plank on my elbows for a few minutes. my favorite is still to do the tip toe raises while brushing teeth. i got to the point of no longer feeling the burn even after 2 minutes, before i had to do a break.

not to say you should not start on a routine, but even a beginners routine can be hard when you are just starting out. don't give up. just remember, every leg lift, every push-up, no mater how small moves you closer to your goal. :) good luck!JESUS CHRIST. Get the fuck out of here with Herschel Walker. I am so fucking sick of hearing him mentioned as a justification for ineffective or harmful training methods. The guy, for whatever reason is LYING a shit ton about everything he does to stay fit.

["Herschels diet is also a bit on the unorthodox. He does not eat breakfast or lunch. The only meal he eats is dinner which consists of  soup, salad and bread. He does not eat red meat but will have chicken on occasion."](http://theathleticbuild.com/herschel-walker-bio-workout-and-diet-plan/)

He is an AMAZING athlete and has AMAZING genetics. No one disputes that. But the laws of thermodynamics still apply to him. Yet he claims to eat something that barely amounts to generally recommended amount of protein. He obviously eats different. It's impossible to be his size with this type of diet alone.

So I somehow don't buy his bullshit sounding training routine either.

My theory is he's trying to sell a persona in his interviews. But that doesn't even matter to me. Also what works for one genetically exceptional person is no valid basis for the average human. That should be clear just if it wasn't so blatantly obvious that he's bullshiting us.

 I apologize if I am emotional about this but I heard that as a justification at least 40 times since last year. It gets really old and surprisingly it's always Herschel, he's literally the only one who claims such asinine nonsense.

"Free as in beer" is pretty common in the US. I rarely ever hear anyone say "Free as in speech".

Kind of along the same vein is the phrase "[Freedom isn't free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_isn%27t_free)", which people fucking _looooove_ here.Anything where you are above the handles will be a problem, as you have noticed.  Can you not L sit on the floor?It was posted to the sub and got torn to shreds it the comments.Two hands, just like the first five times. My arms were simply tired.More pullup bars = more gainz, right?A fat ass complicates things, but your arms are not too short. This question is answered on the specific exercise page.Have you worked out yet?If you never plan on doing advanced hand balancing, go for it.  But you'll be shooting yourself in the foot if you ever change your mind.

Why do you believe that?Bring mace and a panic whistle with you from now on.* A few years ago, there was a problem with assaults and robberies along the American Tobacco Trail near me (note: it still is a problem just a much smaller one).  It runs over 20 miles just south of Durham and just west of Cary and is heavily wooded.  After enough complaints and bad PR, the county/cities finally stepped up active patrols and cleared a lot more brush to make visibility better, and added lighting in some areas.  They were nicely responsive, actually, and this is now the course of the USATF NC state marathon championship.As it's not always possible to run with a buddy, I have self-defense skills. It's about learning how to recognize situations and being prepared to do whatever it takes to get yourself safely away. dont ever run with a knife if you dont know how to use it! Most people who get stabbed get stabbed with their own knifes!! 20 years ago, a female track teacher at my high school was raped and murdered while running by a guy a who escalated to such behavior.  While your report probably won't lead to an arrest, it can help work towards ID'ing the guy and putting him away when he goes further.


Yes that is what I'm talking about and no they are not heavy my very weak girlfriend has no problem with it but hurts like hell to get hit with. On accident? I think you meant: 'by accident.'Well on the back of low mileage I wouldn't describe what your experience will probably be like as enjoyable, not till after the pain and misery wears off anyway :)I really hate hearing stuff like this. This is so much worse then the typical verbal bullshit you hear. "eeeeeeeey girl, you wanna have my baybays???" or "EEEY YOU LOOKING GOOD MAHMEEEE, come here, come over here, OH YOU TOO GOOD?" What the fuck is wrong with people? If someone grabbed me, I would love to think that I would be overcome with rage and break the fucker's wrist, but fear is paralyzing. I would be the one dropping the pepper spray then spraying it in my face on accident. To all the men out there, its SO nice to have a male buddy to run with because this shit just doesn't happen when your around. Always carry mace. I never leave home without it. Different shoe. Similar but more cushioning supposedly. Nike lunar glide was the old shoe. Asics gel nimbus is the new one. For the first one, I am not at all focused and worried about time. I just want to (hopefully) enjoy the race and finish the crossing line. #####&amp;#009;

But otherwise rather [normal](http://instagram.com/p/yQPpRVg7IJ/). Idk he's not mine. Maybe he's mixed Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP,_Inc.) what you're talking about? Are they heavy?I'm 30 and you got me by about 6 minutes and we run the same weekly mileage.  I'm jealous, good job. Shoulda kicked him right in his old man nuts!&gt;The one caveat I'll mention is that submitting proof of time is essential. I would not want to start one of their races from the back corral. Check out the event page for the event you are interested in for proof of time requirements.

I can't agree with this enough! Because these races typically attract a lot of new runners, getting stuck in a corral farther back can be incredibly frustrating. Even at the Star Wars Half last month, the qualifying time for A Corral was 2:05, encompassing a spread of paces that was way too wide. The Disneyland Half last year was set up better, with 1:50, 1:55, and 2:00 for A, B, and C Corrals. So definitely make sure you submit your best allowable proof of time, but also be prepared for a lot of people dodging early on. If you can get past the crowds, the pancake-flat courses are fantastic for PRs!

I'm right there with out. Should be 135, but I'm going to try 140  this spring. :)Not sure I totally agree with this. Running every day, mostly at easy effort, works very well for me, and there are some people with very long "run streaks" who quite enjoy it without injury.

I understand your concern but feel like you're a little too categorical here.As a female runner, I sympathize with you and hate that we (women) need to worry about being attacked physically for who we are. We should be able to run / walk outside without worry. I probably don't do enough to protect myself as I usually run with music and alone as I don't want to run with someone else. I won't run in an amazing park near me if it is getting dark because you never know who may jump out from the bushes at you. Agreed, per kicking, biting / punching / scratching will leave marks if the person is caught. I was told to carry keys between my fingers pointed out while walking around at night in the city (when I was in University) but that's hard to do while running (and annoying). And yes, tell the police.Hi all,

My cousin had CEO of Spartan Race, Joe DeSena, on his podcast. It was a great interview, but I'm also sharing with r/running because a few of you had questions featured on the show and r/running was mentioned on air!

Also Joe offered a prize for the podcast's listeners -- TWO FREE CRUISE TICKETS on SPARTAN CRUISE to a private island in the Bahamas!

Just thought I'd share... perhaps one of you might be headed to the a fun run in the sun! lol
I have certain shirts that rub, or sometimes a seam just catches wrong, or...I don't know, maybe armpit hair? Something was rubbing on longer runs.

Body Glide got rid of it immediately. It really is amazing stuff. I typically feel weird towards the end of the taper. I usually run less than my program would indicate and have always hit my goals. I wouldn't really worry too much about running less than your program indicates, at this point your primary goal should be to remain healthy for your race.

Did you get the same model shoe as the old ones or did you get a totally different shoe?Get an ASP they are easy to care and no matter how strong you are it can break a leg or a skull in one hit. Also can be quickly deployedI think I put Body Glide on head to toe before my last marathon.

Barely chafed at all, compared to my first marathon where I was basically unable to move the next day. You're running too quickly. Slow down.Prepare Race 2: 3rd Winter Series, 10.3km, 28/2/2015 (sub-50)

If you are a coach I highly suggest picking up a training book. [Jack Daniel's Running forumla](http://www.amazon.com/Daniels-Running-Formula-3rd-Jack/dp/1450431836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423760494&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=jack+daniels+running) is an excellent training guide.I honestly think it's at least as much that when people convert, they tend to start slow (as you should with any workout routine) so you build up endurance without overtraining or burning out. The other huge benefit is that people concentrate on form. Most people in traditional running shoes just go out and run. In minimalist running, you spent more time concentrating on holding yourself upright. You rely on your core more, which takes stress off of the rest of you body. You take more intentional strides and avoid banging down on your heel over and over.

Bodies are incredibly varied, so I'm sure they work better for some people than others, but I think the best thing to come from VFF/minimalist running (and this is coming from someone who tried it and went back to traditional shoes) is that it has caused people to really consider form, to run with their eyes up, strong core, quick strides, etc. instead of the painful eyes-down, hunched over shuffle you see so many people running with. That's a great thing, no matter what's on your foot. So its basically easy pace that relies on heart monitoring?I'm so sorry.  This worst thing that happened to me was when I was running at night, alone, on a fairly well used path (I'm an average sized female).  There was a guy sitting on a bench who, as I passed, both spat and growled at me, like a real aggressive, hateful growl.  The look he gave me, too, was chilling, and as he started to get up and move towards me, I put the rockets on and bolted faster than I've ever run in my life.  As I came to the path head, I met another woman just out for an evening walk, and I warned her about the guy, so she obviously just turned around.  I didn't call the police, but I should have.  I would second at minimum filing a report so that in the very least the police know that that's an area to patrol a little more frequently.  Totally sucks, though, and having also been sexually assaulted one time in my life, I empathise with that feeling of lack of control and vulnerability.  If you find that it begins to affect your life (ie: you don't want to run anymore, etc.) please also consider seeing a therapist, if only briefly.  And my best to you.  Awesome. Thanks!Awesome. Thanks!Haha. I think they lean into people because they just can't get close enough. All of them I've known and one I lived with and trained did it, even when someone was standing.

Is yours maybe mixed with border collie or Austrian shepherd? I've never heard of a Berner with blue eyes. Must be beautiful. Also, you're lucky your isn't lazy! especially with something that actually pertains to the sub that I posted in: RUNNING
wow, no shit. I'm pretty sure if I posted in /r/runningmusic someone would have the same opinion as you as well. So you're point is what exactly? I thought this was an open forum where anyone can state their opinion just as you had. Fuck me, right?
Well I don't know what the hell the dog is trying to do then. Truth is, he'll stop you from running.

And he's not lazy, but then again he has blue eyes. That's extremely untypical for the breed. Maybe he's just weird Are you familiar with the French Revolution? The French military have fought and won vicious conflicts throughout history. The American military hasn't won a conflict since WW2,  and they didn't do that alone...My wife used to often.

Check your iron. That wasn't the whole story, but it was a part of it for her. Low iron means your blood isn't carrying oxygen efficiently, which can make it harder for the body to function when it's under duress. &gt; Didn't talk to anybody the entire time.

If I feel the need to start a conversation at a race I usually go with "do you know what the course is like?" or "do you know whether the course is hilly?" or something like that. Or ask them about their shoes. All runners seem to love talking about running shoes.
http://imgur.com/Pc9RcQ2
Crazy bad people do bad things everywhere. Report him for your sake and others'. Yeah, definitely this. It is extremely normal to feel weird during a taper.

A few things are happening. One, our body runs on rhythms. It's pretty well established science. You have a certain rhythm of escalating difficulty (i.e. getting into better shape) while training. Training plans are built on a rhythm of push-then-recover. Basically during a taper you remove a part of your rhythm, and you're just in recover mode. The body isn't quite sure what to do.

So you're burning less calories, but probably making the same hydration and dietary decisions, and it's really common to feel bloated, sluggish, and a general malaise during a taper.

It wil be okay. The science is sound. Get that body recovered all the way, and once you start pushing again come race day, your body will snap right back into go mode. I don't think you've really thought this through, and if you're carrying a knife you really need to examine this a bit more closely.

* Knives are lethal weapons, which have different legal and psychological ramifications for their users.

* Knives require a great deal of training to be effectively used.

* Knives require agility and strength to be effectively used.

* Humans have a psychological aversion to stabbing other humans which must be overcome.

* Knives require that a wielder be in close physical proximity to a potentially larger, stronger, and faster opponent before it can be used.

* If she is disarmed, she has provided her opponent with a lethal weapon that can be used against her.

Can knives be effective self defense tools?  Sure, with proper training.  But given their inherent limitations they're rarely going to be the best option, and it's particularly ill suited to a novice with no training or experience.I really recommend a few counseling sessions to process too. The feelings of fear and powerlessness are real and if you work through them right away, they are less likely to grow and be really disruptive.I'd say to always bother racing - it's (imo) the best motivator for getting fit, and lets you actually see yourself progressing and getting better!As awesome as it is he's getting fit, I hope it doesn't encourage other people to go for runs every day. Running regularly to get fit and race is awesome and cool, running every day unfortunately leads to injury and will just demotivate people.Some tend to herd when bored or not properly trained. But if you're running them and keeping them tired it wouldn't be an issue at all. Most herding dogs will be the best running buddies.

Berners aren't known as well for herding. Most of the typical herders are shepherd and collies. Berners are pretty lazy. GOD that effing sucks. And is super unfair. Being a woman is awesome, but it also really sucks sometimes. For awhile I carried pepper spray, and now I'm really intentional about what time of day I run. Earlier mornings and before it gets dark seem to be the safest times. I also actually turn on the tracker of my running app and share my location with friends/family, *just in case*.

Also, run without earbuds/only with one in, and be sure to have strong posture and to look over your shoulders/take in your surroundings. It decreases the size of the target on your back.

Also: Having to take all of these measures sucks, and it's not your responsibility to take them or report anything...it's the responsibility of assholes to not attack runners (especially women) who are vulnerable and often smaller in stature. But because that's not a realistic expectation, I suggest coming up with some precautions to be safer and to FEEL safer on your runs. Good for himThis, and also, carry pepper spray with you or run with others from now on. Is mace legal in all cities in the area? I'm out in Santa Monica. It's generally pretty safe here, but very early morning runs and a lot of homeless/not-so-stable people around...This is exactly why some people prefer to run on a 'mill in a health club: safety.

Sorry this happened, and good luck to you OPNot that's it's likely realistic for you, but thought I'd chime in anyway. I run with my German Shepherd. She's so sweet and gentle, but strangers don't know that. I feel safe running at night with earbuds in because I'll notice if she hears something and she would hear it way before me even if I didn't have earbuds in.

I don't expect you to run out and get a dog, but it might be something to consider in the future. They make great running buddies and help make the home feel safer too.

to expand on this, knives really are the dumbest form of self-defense.

1. very few people know how to use a knife effectively.

2. even in an ideal situation, knives have no stopping power at all--its not unusual for people to not even realize they've been wounded with a knife. adrenaline masks the pain and even deep cuts are not particularly 'catastrophic.' even a mortal knife wound will not stop someone immediately.

3. in a self-defense situation, you want to stay as far away from your attacker as possible. using a knife requires the opposite. you have to get very close to use it. this puts you at risk of being grappled and taken down. it is impossible to use a knife effectively while being wrestled.

4. escalation. pepper spray is not seen as a deadly weapon. if you pull a knife on a mugger, you are seriously escalating the situation and putting your life in danger. i think we can all agree that being robbed, beaten, or even raped is preferable to being murdered.no, but could it be due to layering in your case?
[Oh No!](http://i.imgur.com/VmrQR75.jpg)I feel so safe when I'm running with my pit bull mix. Everyone thinks she looks terrifying. Her appearance is enough to deter creepers from approaching me. Little do they know that she is actually a lovebug who wants to be best buddies with everyone :) &gt; Unless she has training, a knife is hands down the worst option you can recommend.

Why do you think is it a bad idea? If you stab them with a knife, most people wouldn't pursue a sexual assault any further if they are unarmed.I'm often an idiot, so the math still works.People often feel tired during their taper. I think it's mostly mental, a combination of excitement, nervousness, and fatigue. It goes away when the race starts and adrenaline hits.

As for shoes, if they're the same model, they should be fine when they break in.  Sometimes it takes a 'dick' to make you realize that your music choice isn't shared by the billions of other people on this planet.Indeed...

1. run barefoot
2. not run
3. run in shoes the wrong size
4. fuck the sponsor

Still, if I were to sponsor an event like that, I'd bring shoes in all sizes, just in case...Ohhhh so that's what I'm doing wrong.
Just because you are suppressing a family member touching you at a young age doesn't mean you can show up to this sub and be a cunt! Op asked a reasonable question and got a good suggestion before your whale ass squeezed in.I woke up in the hospital after running a full marathon last march... I don't remember anything past mile 24... the official race video shows me stumbling to the finish line and being place into a wheelchair by race volunteers. I wear a Camelbak (marathoner) and had never experienced any sort dehydration. It took me several weeks to get back to full strength after that... I am extremely careful and slow down anytime i feel like I'm straining... My ex has a Bull Mastiff who is also soft as shit but, as he packs 58kg of solid muscle, he scares the shit out of a lot of people. He gets very weird when he sees other dogs fighting and always goes hurtling in to break up the fights. Seeing him run at them the other dogs tend to run like fuck rather than risk that he might actually do them harm..Parkour. Somehow I knew that slight was unlikely to get laughs, but did it anyway. Sorry.Had not thought about thatIt still gets into the air. Not to mention the splash back from him getting hit.  The stuff is super potent. It would fuck up the rest of her day. Better than the alternative, though. [Hmmm.. ](http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420748733005/French-police-012.jpg)I'm sorry that incident happen to you it really sucks! My wife is an avid runner and happens to be 5 ' ft tall as well. When she's out running and I'm not with her she carries a mini taser. It's the size n shape of a lipstick capsule.

Also report it to the incident to the cops, for your safety and other runners as well. The longest I've run with my dog (Australian shepherd) was 18k and he was happy the whole way, with a few short water breaks. It's on a trail and he's off leash though, which allows him to go at his own pace and stop whenever he wants. But we'd worked up to it, he started off the couch to 5k with me so he had time to build some endurance like I did.

Also depends a lot on the weather: that 18k was on a cool fall day, in the middle of summer I wouldn't go more than 4-5k.Friend zoned againI (m) used to run in the Rampart district at night and my strategy was to run slow enough so that if I needed to break out into a full sprint I could do that at any time.  It wasn't a very effective way to train, but the added adrenaline really ramps up the runner's high.  This is my favorite sort of achievement!Hope you're joking. If you're really coming to the home of 35-minute 5k PRs, you're way out of your depth. Thanks everybody for the nice tips. I will try them and see what is best for me.Whenever there is trouble, run the fuck away.

-All French People.  Ever.Probably getting down voted because that sub is a jokeThis is the stupidest, most short-sighted argument in the entire fucking world.  ***BY DEFINITION,*** people who assault others don't give a shit about laws.  It's fucking axiomatic.  There's got to be regulation, sure, but an outright ban?  Get real.

&gt;My goodness, it's illegal to own a handgun without a permit in this city, and they won't issue me one if I tell them that I intend to mug people with it!  And of course I can't lie when I'm filling out the application form, where would we all be if everyone lied to the government all the time?  Shucks and fiddlesticks, I guess I can't mug people anymore!

...said no crook ever.  How are you allowed to drive if your brain is so defective as to let you think that banning things is a way of keeping people from having them?  Have you ***HEARD*** of Prohibition?  Have you ***HEARD*** of the DEA?I really don't think marijuana advocates are helping themselves here. It's a drug that a lot of people enjoy, and that's cool. It's plausible that it could be a painkiller, I can see how someone could enjoy it on a trail run, and so on... But can we stop acting like it's magically different in these ways than other drugs? No one's suggesting it's a good plan to do cocaine during a run for the energy spike or heroin after for the relaxation. The pepper spray I have is a gel. Supposedly, you can spray it straight into the wind.  Also, make sure you get some with UV dye in it so the police can easily id the guy later.I felt this way. Loved the second one and each race after.I will add to the report it to the police calls. It's important to let them know about this. He will keep doing this to others until caught.

I personally have never been assaulted but in the past my friends told stories about a homeless man in Piedmont Park in Atlanta who would chase female runners with his pants pulled down exposing himself. They were laughing about it because they thought he looked funny trying to chase them down with his pants down. We explained it really wasn't funny and just because they were able to run faster than him doesn't mean someone else could. They never thought of it that way and filed a report.I am so sorry he did that to you.  I've been attacked too (not while running), and it's horrible and scary, especially when it's not something you feel that you could have prevented.

I wrote this comment last time someone posted about being attacked.  In that case it was also a small woman, and she was chased.

1) Eye injuries are very painful and very easy to cause. Hurt someone's eyes -- poke them, scratch them, etc -- and they will not be thinking about you anymore. We have an awful taboo about hurting someone's eyes, but if they're attacking you, you don't need to fight fair. That guy was already not fighting fair, coming after someone so much smaller.

2) A chop to the windpipe takes very little force, and again, it's going to stop somebody in their tracks. ONLY DO THIS IN A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. It could kill someone. Use the outside of your hand. Do it hard.

3) Punching someone in the temple will knock them out, and also takes very little force. You can also claw someone in the face.

4) In some places, it's illegal to carry things on you for the purpose of using them as weapons. But think about the items you carry on you while you're running anyway and how you could use them as weapons. Keys make excellent weapons. You could put out someone's eye or stab them in the throat. Your phone is pretty hard, and you could hit someone with it.

5) Think about situations like this and make a decision NOW that you will fight to save your own life, so you're not caught up in "Should I or shouldn't I?" when you get attacked. Be decisive. If someone comes after you, be ANGRY that they have the gall to put you in that kind of position, and LOOK angry. Yell and scream at them. It is not your responsibility to give the benefit of the doubt to someone coming after you. Your own safety is more important than the safety of anyone attacking you, or the opinion of anyone who might think you're crazy.

6) That fear you felt today will serve you well. Remember it! I have problems with this sometimes, because I don't want to be scared and paranoid, but I also have no doubt that being rude to someone back in November prevented me from winding up in a bad situation. Always be looking around when you're running, and keep your music low enough that you can hear. It's okay to cross the street to get away from someone, even if they're probably perfectly nice. Even if they get offended. I was robbed a year ago, and as far as I'm concerned, they did me a favor, because I am far more wary now. Use what happened today to your advantage. It's a gift, and it might save your life next time.    I'm so sorry. I'm the same size as you and always scared about these kinds of things. I have no experience with anything of this enormity -- I've been harassed on runs in other ways, but not assaulted. It might help you to talk to a therapist. Tazers are bulky, heavy, and affected by heavy clothing.  They may also be regulated in many jurisdictions.I believe a lot of people run with a folding knife, pepper spray and in some cases a concealed handgun. Luckily I run in a nice area so I don't have to worry about this too much, plus I'm a 6' 2" male. But I have considered running with my handgun for some of my random runs where I'm not in a safe area. Get some MACE.I run with pepper spray.  It's mainly for dogs, but can definitely be used on other animals as well.  Be safe.

Edit:  [This](http://amzn.com/B0007VM8UC) is what I run with. Not bulky or heavy, clips nicely to a running armband for your phone, or to your waist, easy to deploy one-handed.They actually make different kinds of pepper sprays just for this reason. Such as the stream pattern, which police use.Run with a dog, terrible people like this are much less likely to approach you if you have a canine companion.

And please report to the police, sadly if he has done this once then he has most likely done it another time.  The guy needs to be taken off the streetsQ'est-ce que "la defense franaise"?My dog is similar, super laid back. Lawn guys came into our backyard and were moving some mulch bags to the front, after the first one she got between them and the remaining bags of mulch and would not back down. She thought they were stealing our mulch.

Also, my dad was making funny arm movements and faces at my new niece, my dog immediately jumped in between them and squared off for a rumble, thinking he was accosting the new baby. Dogs are funny like that. Depends on the dog!  I've got a friend who regularly does 10k with his "pack" but my dog starts slowing down around 5k.  It also depends on how long you've been training with them, dogs will build endurance just like people.I was unaware of the sub. thanks for being a dick about it.Yes!  Some breeds are just not cut out to be running buddies, and even if they are, go slow.  Pups need to ease into running just like humans - and they need to be full grown!  I get really sad when I see somebody out running with a 6 month old puppy, poor little guy's bones are just not up to that yet.Can I still bring up the owl attacks? I'm going to bring up the owl attacks! I'd fight a giant kitten any day. Screw those swooping scalp taking night pigeons![I'll see your skunks and rabid animals...](http://www.ktvz.com/news/big-cat-big-fright-cougar-caught-behind-se-bend-home/31020166)That is shitty.  Will do, thanks!  I want to add a marathon to my goals :)Then I agree with the other posters. You should be fine. A 5k won't affect you for a whole week if you're already running distances farther than it in training. Runchaku.I think people were going in and editing other people's goals which is extremely fucking immature. I think they locked it due to this. Send them a message and see if they can let you in.

I'm realizing now that I don't know who "they" are so if anyone can answer who created the 2015 goal sheet...that would be the person to message.Tazers aren't super effective especially in the winter months. If one of the barbs gets caught up in a coat, then youre shit outta luck. Mace will effect her as well (hence why cops have to be maced in their training so they can deal with it) but it shouldn't incapacitate her to the point she can't run away.No signs of mal ware? Good to know! I love my Merrells!How long can you run with a dog? I've thought of this before, but I've always wondered how long the dog could keep up.Good but a little bulky to run with.2X has a bad reputation, I guess some ridiculous posts went viral from there.  But really, there are a lot of reasonable people on there with experience to share and help. It's just a big sub so there will always be a few extremists/crazies.  Haha, awww. I love playing with my dogs in the woods and fields - it's not a serious business kind of run, just a "dog jog" where me and the dogs chase each other around (there is also an outdoor obstacle course thing in the woods near my house, so me and the doggies like to play around that - I try and walk across the balance bars whilst the dogs use them as hurdles - 110 lbs of golden retriever leaping half a metre in the air is a sight to behold). Dora mostly loves playing fetch and football - dogs can go fast when they want. I always feel like they're slowing down to my pace, heh ("Look at this silly slow human puppy, we must be gentle with it").I wish I could up-vote this more than once. I only took KM for a year before funds got tight, but it was an amazing experience. In addition to the self defense aspect of it, the training is a hell of a good physical workout. Two one-hour sessions/week and I was spent at the end of each. So many benefits.That really sucks. Consider running with a friend/group, running with pepper spray, and taking a Krav Maga self-defense course. I know the studio near me has women's-only courses/classes. KM is pretty much all function, limited form. It's designed to get you out of a bad situation ASAP. And it's designed to be easy to learn/get the hang of/recall in a stressful situation.

Edit: By "limited form", I mean there's not a lot of ceremony/Zen/meditation stuff with it. There's plenty of form in moves/strikes/counter-strikes. Just not a lot of other stuff. Which is what makes it effective.Oh I know...my old old dogs, Todd and Jess, were a rescue flatcoat/collie cross and a black lab, and they were the softest things ever. One day we were walking across a field and this huge rottweiler came out of nowhere and started growling at my mum, getting closer and closer before jumping at her. Todd went into full-on protect mode, leaping at the other dog and fighting it off. It was insane! Such a big change in such a gentle dog.

My old dog Ted was also a gentle giant, and very quiet - he didn't like to bark very much (I heard him bark maybe four times in his life - at things like feathers, balloons and paper bags!). I remember walking along the path with him near where I used to live and this man was walking along towards me, giving me a seriously weird look. Ted let out this brutal deep growl - I didn't even know he could make sounds like that - when the man was passing by us. Something about that guy really freaked Ted out (and me too to be honest), so I was glad to have him with me!

I think Buddy (the golden retriever) would surprise me less if he tried to protect me - he's quite hyper already, and likes to follow me around and keep me company. Dora is such a chilled out little girl though, and quite submissive with other dogs - not sure how she'd react.

I hope your kitty was ok! I'm super paranoid about standing on animal's tails - only did it once but the yelp she let out was awful, I was so worried I'd injured her badly! (She was ok though).Choose carefully, though-you don't want to find you've gotten yourself a big furry bundle of hip dysplasia as a running companion.Please report this to the police.  Like immediately.   Don't even reply to this comment just call the police right now.  But second you need to learn self defense.  I'm not saying you will ever need it again but it is a powerful tool.  It will also help you mentally heal and give you confidence to run again.  I live in the south so all weapons are permitted but i just don't feel comfortable carrying them.  I know extensive hand to hsnd combat and that is my weapon.  Is it perfect? Nope.  But its what i use.  Find a way to build your confidence up and get out there again!!!&gt; folding knife

Unless she has training, a knife is hands down the worst option you can recommend.

Airborne irritants are far easier to use and aren't lethal if misused. Yes, please report it to the police. A similar thing happened to me a few years ago. It creeped me out but I decided it wasn't "that big of a deal" and didn't report it. A few weeks later there was a story in the newspaper about the police trying to track down a guy who had been sexually assaulting women all over the city. I regretted not reporting it immediately - it could have helped them track him down sooner.

And I'm so sorry this happened to you :( maybe find a running buddy or a group until you feel comfortable again. That's why places with strict self defense policies like New York, California, and Puerto Rico are among the safest in the world, right?Sorry that this happened. It's total bullshit and something no one should have to think about when they are out minding their own business. Was there anyone else around who could see what the guy looks like for future identification purposes?

In addition to calling the police, if you are a member of a local running club I'd put out a note describing what happened, when and where and to let other people know that this happened to you. It 1) helps other people identify what's going on out there and 2) might get other people to come forward if they have had similar incidents with this person. This way, when you file a report you'll have more people backing you and it doesn't become a you vs. them situation.

Again, really sorry that this happened to you.Knife is always a bad weapon without skills. I think they make a pepper foam that's less susceptible to wind. Add in a cell phone and air horn, maybe? Keep the earphones out so you don't get surprised, and keep practicing the French defense.How tall are you?  Sub 20 min 5k at 250 lbs is pretty awesome.  I'm 6'-1", 205 lbs and would love to break 20 mins.   I was starting to think it would be really difficult without cutting further, but maybe not.
Edit:  This got me a little curious.  I made a few assumptions and plugged your numbers into a VDOT/VO2 Max calculator.   It may get messed up at higher weights, but it looks like you'd have a crazy high VO2 Max.  Your VO2 Max would be higher than an elite marathoner.   See [here](http://imgur.com/a/QmzeT).   Maybe someone can chime in that understands the Jack Daniel's formulas better.  Note, I probably have something goofed up, and I'm not saying you can't run a sub 20 min 5k at 250 lbs.   Nuts, eyes, throat, nose.

In that order.They sell multiple types:

* Streamers, which basically spray a liquid stream out in a straight line like a squirt gun
* Misters, which shoots a finer "mist" outward in a cone
* Gels, which shoot big gobs (think like a hand pump soap dispenser)

Which type you use depends on your comfort level, but I'd recommend that anyone who carries mace make sure they get a refill pack and *test their mace* before they're carrying it with them.  You don't want the first time you use it to be the time you need to use it. Starting the program is tough, more on the pride than anything. The fact that you feel like you've just been on a walk for the distance is good, you shouldn't feel tired from an easy run. With enough training this HR will require effort to run at as you'll actually be able to work at that rate.

Your HM time is not in line with your 5k showing a weak aerobic system proving further that you could benefit greatly from a plan like this. According to McMillan calculator you should be looking at just under 2 hours for a HM, and I believe that is within seconds of what Hadd would suggest as well. I try to think of it as an investment that will produce lasting long-term results. Keep with it, in time it will be worth it!Supplements have to prove that they are "safe" for consumption, not that they "work"Better not get a herding dog though. My friend has a Bernese mountain dog. That fucker will try to herd you when you're running. This means, he'll gently push you sidewards into the woods. If that doesn't work, he'll run through your legs and make you fall.

That dog is dumb though. Maybe he's an exception. He doesn't do it with malice. He just loves herding shit.Hehe, your dogs are super cute. I have Great Dane, and a big one at that. Gentle giant. Well, gentle most of the time as he's completely unaware how strong and big he is.

I'd love to be able to run with him, but he always takes it as a play and starts cutting me off and pushing down. :)Exactly. Here is where she came, why second guess her?

If I were to guess, she came here because she's a runner and was running when it happened and wanted to get the perspective of other runners.I'm pretty sure I know the stretch you are talking about. I remember running by a real creepy building off the left hand side of the trail (heading out of town), and just thinking "yea, someone pokes their head out of there I'm going to be hitting a PB on this run no problem".Yea, a knife makes you run faster, everyone knows that!You should call out to people, I'd be ecstatic to beat and subdue a potential assaulter til the cops arrive. I know others would too.Or maybe that giving people the means to assault others is a recipe for violence.keep in mind that if it's windy at all, using pepper spray can go horribly wrong.I use to gift [these](http://www.eurasianet.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/galleria_fullscreen/NATO%20Spray_0.jpg) to my female friends. It's a small and handy thing to have and solves issue quite fast. I am a guy with long hair and goatee and old geezers tried to grope me as well. Being the main street doesn't mean guy is sane. But I don't think you should create some sort of fear out of this.His previous post: "Im super excited to announce that I have been selected to join the Asics Campaign"

Yeaaaaaa surely it's completely unbiased review.

I think you'd be surprised at your dog's reaction to seeing you be in a threat. I've never been in that situation but my dog was really laid back, used to be hit for punishment by previous owner, and was BFFs with our kitty. One day a guest accidentally stepped on kitty's tail and the dog jumped up and growled at the first and we had to calm him down. Only time he ever did that.Carry mace. Continue running. Be safe out there.That's her. woah, you run with a knife?!?  Where?  I'm happy to try to look it up for you.&gt;relatively healthy


I'm curious what you mean by this.


[Check this out.](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/MyHeartandStrokeNews/All-About-Heart-Rate-Pulse_UCM_438850_Article.jsp) There's a section about causes of high blood pressure and I guess lots of Thyroid meds can cause it.Sounds like you're thinking of the stuff police use on crowds, not the handheld kind, which is... more like a pressurized squirt gun.I am a 6' 1" male and I always run with a knife on me for this reason.

You should buy a folding knife or tazer or pepper spray, the best option would be a concealed handgun.

Sorry that this happened to you, unfortunately every human has the choice to do whatever they want to any other human until force stops them, so you have to be proactive and protect yourself. Bring force with you, so you never have to worry!An avulsion injury is SERIOUS. Get to the doctor.They call it a "marathon" because it's one of the options. They'd be two separate races.In addition to seconding the suggestion to file a police report, if it ever happens again, make as much of a commotion as possible immediately.  Start screaming and try to get anyone anyone who may be within earshot to help.  Not only may you scare him off, you may actually draw some people in who'll detain this guy until the police arrive.  Society looks down on this kind of person, and does fight back organically.Wow, that's intense! But, it's good to know that it's possible to do multiple races in a week.

I'd say I'm pretty fit. I run about twice a week and I'm to 7.5km, but I also do parkour and I think I'll be picking up rock climbing soon.I didn't get that implication at all. I thought it was clear that /u/32154234325 wasn't implying that they're mutually exclusive. I'm sure Runnit has users that can relate to being assaulted while running, and I'm sure many 2X users can relate to being assaulted in general. It's not too bad unless you go to the far north end (north of the Farmer's Market, across Rogers). The stretch between the bridge at Grimes and the Rail Trail can be rough, but as long as it's light out I feel pretty safe. The only time I'll run there alone in the dark is this time of year when it's freezing and the creeps stay indoors.Simply because you inferred it doesn't mean s/he implied it. I didn't realize why the comment was getting downvoted until I read the edit.Good to know! The risk of injuring myself is always there since I'm a huge klutz, so here's hoping nothing happens!My co-worker designed these:

http://www.amazon.com/Fury-Tactical-Kuba-Kickz-Defense-Control/dp/B00ETPGP3S

They are light, comfortable, and easy to wear on your running shoes, great to give you some distance to get away.  Just a swift kick to the shins, he would regret his decision pretty quickly.This is exactly why I enjoy my 5am weekend long runs. The chances of being bothered are zero. And if I see someone, they are typically running or up to no good. Easier to figure out, especially when you can mind-fuck them with your headlight when it's pitch black out. Engage ninja stealth mode.

I'm more worried about skunks and rabid animals than I am some junky or thug.Oh my God. I'm so sorry this happened to you! I'm a small female too and am terrified this would happen to me. I was attacked in college walking back from the T after pulling a long barista shift, and I just went medieval on the guy, stomping on his toes and smashing his noes with the palm of my hand.

Definitely talk to someone, preferably a therapist, so you can work out what you're feeling. You can't let that "gent" take away running from you, or he wins. If it's legal where you live, get a small can of pepper spray to bring with you on runs and carry it in your hand.

Sending healing thoughts your way. That's so scary.Hmm, really? My mace doesn't spray like a mist, it's like a stream. Hard to imagine that affecting you as long as you don't run in the direction you sprayed it.Should be exciting to watch!  There's so many big names, I don't even know who to root for.  I hope Lagat destroys the master's record.First, I'm sorry that this happened to you, and as others have said, this is not at all your fault. I'm very glad that you were able to get away as safely as you did.

I concur with everything that others have said. Pepper spray/mace, running in a group, with a dog, etc.

Would also like to throw out a recommendation for Krav Maga. This would, of course, be a longer-term solution, and one that would be in addition to shorter-term solutions like pepper spray or running with friends.

But situations like this is exactly what Krav is for. It's not a traditional Eastern David Carradine-type martial art with wind chimes and meditation. Ironically, that's what I was looking for when I found Krav... but I digress.

Krav is about defending yourself on the streets. Protecting family or friends that might be around you. But mostly, it's about getting home safely to your loved ones. And doing whatever it takes to get home safely. It's not about fighting fair. It's about fighting for your life. In a situation like the one that you described, I'd imagine a number of groin strikes (knees/kicks) and/or elbows to the face.

It's very intense, but nobody has the right to get in your space and certainly not to put their hands on you. Once that happens, you have every right to do what's necessary to get away. Krav teaches you how to do that.

I'm a 46 year old man who's been doing it for ~4 years. Absolutely changed my life. My 12 year old daughter started doing it recently. And in a couple of years, so will my now-10 year old daughter.

Happy to answer any questions about it.Wow, I didn't know this. It's been a few months since I've run the B-Line, but when I last did it was right after Ferguson. I bet you probably saw the grafitti, but there was a bunch of "pro-murder of white people and/or cops" grafitti on the trail. Didn't exactly make me feel super safe at 6 AM.

I always just hope that being out that early is too early for the crazies to still be awake.Sometimes there isn't much you can do to prevent an piece of shit from being a piece of shit. To increase safety and piece of mine you can carry mace, a small taser, or keychain weapon. If those things are illegal where you live (shootout to shitty laws of NYC) you can get things like Kevlar knuckle motorcycle gloves (similar to brass knuckles) or other creative solutions.Yes! Pepper spray has a 15 foot reach, as opposed to a knife where you have to be all up on the guy.I started running last Sept and I generally run twice a week at an avg pace 5'40"/km.There are a lot of US cities with stupid officials that think preventing people from defending themselves is a good idea.How is that?This is why I figured it made the news after /u/slacksonslacks mentioned how in Bloomington it happens often. I assumed it happened in an area where the better-off folks were. Something happens like this in Terre Haute and it makes news regardless because they'll find anything to report on that gets people feeling uneasy.The issue with mace is that as soon as it's in the air everyone, including you, is effected. I wonder if a tazer wouldn't be a better plan. How is tazer technology these days?Angeleno here. It's the only way to run.The Fishers/Carmel area is pretty affluent with million dollar homes and such.  Goes to show that you have to vigilant regardless of where you live.  Crazy folks are everywhere.  That's pretty vague. Depending on the country in Europe it could be from "no knives allowed" to "open carrying assault rifles is ok". Saying Europe is very, very vague.Probably a crazy or homeless person. Just a crappy, random encounter and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.I have been followed several times. One guy had a knife. My strategy in these situations has always been "find people" and to run straight to where there will be witnesses. Stores, busy streets, once I ran up to a woman on her front porch and pretended she was my best friend in the world. Once I am with people I reassess the situation and decide whether to call the police. I was lucky with the knife guy because a SWAT team just happened to be running drills next to my house.

Try not to let it put you off running and continue to be aware of your surroundings. I'm sorry you had to experience this. Dogs make running better! Dogs make everything better :)

My dogs are two great big softies (golden retriever and labrador) but they're also fairly large, which is enough to discourage people from trying anything. My golden also has an absolutely ear-shattering bark, which probably helps. My lab girl will drown any attackers in saliva, whilst golden retriever boy will coat them in a thick layer of fluff to slow them down!

Plus they are good company :) The only problem with taking them for a run is that they will invariably stop and pee on things, or catch a nice scent and stand there for five minutes just...sniffing things... :p

[Buddy and Dora](http://i.imgur.com/VUzyoIX.jpg) hope you feel better soon though!

Another bonus: they will [carry things](http://i.imgur.com/epGzbxN.jpg) for you. Also they're [really smart!](http://i.imgur.com/9SqcsKC.jpg)
And seriously, I don't know why.. I guess my comment was a bit cold regarding the situation. But it's not a reason to insult me!kinda, I've had someone aim their car at me and I had to leap out of the way of certain death. I had a guy take a swing at me because I ran up behind him, a dog chase me and bite my foot, and a kid chase me down the road with his buddies. When I had long hair I was called gay and faggot also had trash thrown at me. As I got older I've learned to read the people on the sidewalks. Giving a head nod and a wide berth or even moving to the road to avoid city crazies.Sure, but /r/running hasn't set itself up specifically as a support sub in the way 2X has. They get a lot more of this over there and they might have more resources to help. A situation like this isn't about proving that /r/running can be just as supportive as 2X; it's about helping the victim.

The fact that your parent comment is sitting at like -80 just for giving an alternative option for support is nuts. It will get better, promise.

One tip I have is that it's not just about conditioning. Part of it is learning how to run more efficiently, and part of it is learning to run slowly without introducing "braking" to your stride that wastes energy and makes the whole thing worse.

Also, use the fact that you're less tired after runs to increase either distance or frequency. The volume is part of the benefit of training easier.Also, run with pepper spray.Seriously though, why the fuck are you being downvoted so much? /r/running is a great community but it's not a support sub. 2X sets itself up as a safe place for people who go through stuff like this. I don't understand how it's inappropriate to link there at all.I'm 6 weeks into my maffetone trial. At first my pace was barely tolerable, but it has increased by about 30s/km so far. Stick with it, your pace will improve! It can be traumatizing, maybe she wants to talk about it and /r/TwoXChromosomes is a great community!What a fucking joke! Take that bullshit over to /r/runningmusicIf you put the first slash in there too, it autolinks the subreddit: /r/advancedrunning/r/music or /r/runningmusic would be much better for this.Generally speaking, an indoor track is "fast" if the surface is newer technology (Mondo, I believe, is the name of the surface), and the curves are "banked". Indoor tracks are also faster if they are longer- a standard indoor track is 200m, but some schools/facilities have over-sized 300m+ tracks that tend to be faster than shorter ones.I'm a guy, and I'm 6'2", and there's rarely anyone else where I run, but I always run with a knife just in case somebody tries to do something, or the coyotes come after me. I'm really paranoid though. I also tricked myself into thinking that zombies were chasing me one day (which was fucking terrible) so if that ever actually happens, I have a weapon on me.I bet later on he went to a forum and wrote,  "why won't she love me, "type postI think it's just blogspam.Get some mace, I've known city girls that run with it in hand...I'm curious what runners mean when they call a track "fast". What elements make one faster over another?I'd recommend posting in r/advancedrunning as well they might be of more help.Are you in the US? There are very few states where pepper spray is illegal, and fewer still where it would result in a prosecution if a woman running alone used it do defend herself.

I live in Massachusetts, which recently eliminated the requirement to have a firearms permit to own peppery spray. For years before that, maybe a quarter of the women I know carried it anyway with no regrets.That could be helpful against aggressive animals as well.This. Plenty of people here and elsewhere will act as though self defense requires magic powers or is too difficult for most. If you have a fighting mindset, you've covered the prerequisite. Pepper spray is easy to carry, and while not foolproof, is infinitely better than nothing in the face of an assault.

Consider carrying some in a way that keeps it handy.[There's always something more.](https://www.sabrered.com/pepper-spray/3-1-runner-pepper-spray-adjustable-hand-strap)I run with mace in my hand. Thankfully I haven't had to use it. I started doing this when someone blocked my way then tried to follow me home.Can't tell if ad or review...

Obviously sponsored by Asics. try using your HR monitor for brisk walks, hiking, etc and see if you're able to get above 60% maxHR for that, if so then I'd recommend that as replacement for some runs as it can be more enjoyable than running so slow that your form breaks down

It'll help you get more volume in, and Maffetone/LowHR training seems to require some sort of volume (4-6+ hours, people are different) to notice the effects from month to month.

after 4-6 weeks you should see some changes, so just try to do lots of volume for a month or so and do a controlled test every month so you actually can get some confidence that it works. For me it was the only way to convince myself that I wasn't getting slowerI got chased by a lot of street dogs the other night (live in India). I think that guy was a regular creep you should have definitely reported him. -a break-in at a liquor store

-a wild goat

-a pile of headbands (30 or so) still packaged, dumped in the snow.

-saw a construction worker get an arm nearly severed. An ambulance zoomed past me minutes later.I've found shortening my stride takes faster leg movements and makes my HR rise slightly over a slower stride at the same forward speed. By the way, what is the MAF target HR? I guess I'm lacking context here.

Edit: Oh, wow, just googled it  he's the webpage I found that lead me to my current target HR (155). Oops, forgot his name. Yeah, it feels really slow (now). 155 keeps me around 10:45-11:00 min/mile.H&amp;M! I'm a big fan of their sports bras, especially for the price (9.99) I have similar proportions and these have been the best I've tried so farIn addition to this maybe find a running buddy or group, people are less likely to be approached in pairs or groups especially in a situation like this. I always run with my cousin or girlfriend and we're almost never approached by anybody. Terribly sorry that this happened to you.I envy you for being 24. My MAF rate is supposed to be 135. I tried it at 140 (because I look way younger than I am ) and I needed 8 minutes per km. My PBs are pretty much in your range. I did. Shoes were the devil for me my whole life, so I wouldn't doubt that having a huge effect on why the Vibrams worked so well for me.Definite possibility, but the VFF made the transition feel much more natural. It felt odd doing the "barefoot" gait in more conventional running shoes and I couldn't get it to stick.I'm picking up what you're putting down, but I'd been running for three years beforehand and hit a flat plateau.I ignored a nagging groin injury going into a 2014 marathon. The first half went great! Then it started to come back and blew up by mile 18. Those last 8+ miles were the worst. It took me all summer to recover. Be smart about it and accept that you might have to skip this one, or drop out.Here in the Haute, I feel safer on the Heritage trail than I do running  in or around ISU campus. Then again, due to my build/size I can see why I've not had many problems. As my SO says, I look like a lumberjack with runner's legs. There have been so many people busted over the head and robbed on campus that it's getting ridiculous. Mostly people out walking/"jogging". I ran through campus once and never will again. My buddy got jumped and punched by a group of thugs while running in Baltimore. It was near his house, which isn't a great part of the city, but certainly isn't the worst part.  Neighbors helped him and chased the kids away. I love my city, but unfortunately this time it lived up to its stereotype. Expensive, but top notch. If you're a Disney fan already I highly recommend their races. I've done the marathon, Tower of Terror 10-Miler, and the Wine and Dine Half Marathon.

With the exception of freezing my rear off at the WnD all were great experiences.Agree you should report to the police.

But for the future, you may want to consider finding a running buddy of some kind, you might be surprised how many people would be up for it, keep each other motivated and safe :) Oh don't worry about it! I was just mentioning that because I don't want OP to think that he has to run 50 MPW or he'll be screwed. In fact, OP's times are really close to what I ran senior track season (down south there's no such thing as "indoor" [minus the 1 indoor meet we were allowed to run per year]) and I had run 55-60 the summer leading up to my senior cross season.  Unfortunately, a poor decision to not air on the side of caution with an injury cost me my entire senior xc season.... but that's a story for another day.  PM me if you ever want to talk about how your college running experience.  I'd love to know more about it.  I fear I made a mistake of not trying to walk on my freshman year.Bloomington has a really large homeless population, and the B-Line has become pretty unsafe at certain points. Someone was attacked and nearly raped (she got away somehow but he dragged her into the woods) at like 7:30AM this summer- sun is up, trail is fairly active, and it didn't matter.

The good news is, the police are increasing their presence and I think it's getting better. I see two or three guys in cars or on a little golf-cart cop mobile as early as 4:45-5:00AM sometimes.I had to ask myself what the hell the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had to do with this comment until I back tracked and realized my mistake.I know the local running store here organizes twice weekly group runs. If it was me, I would find it difficult to run alone again for a while, and it would help to have a group.

Not saying you *should* run in a group, just saying if you *wanted* to run with others for your own peace of mind for a while, you have options.That's crazy honestly. I didn't know it was that frequent down there, I never hear of these things happening around us. But then again, I'm not surprised either. I can say I've noticed an increased amount of female participants are using gu/gels.Amazing that it made the news- someone on the B-Line Trail in Bloomington (about an hour south of Indianapolis) gets attacked every month or so. I don't think it even makes the news anymore.That is definitely worth a thought. When I am able to get a dog a nice big one is my plan :) &gt; Hey thanks so much guys, very helpful stuff!

Exactly how helpful was it? Was it:

A. Very helpful

B. Quite helpful

C. Slightly helpful

D. Not helpful

E. Very unhelpfulIn addition to suggestions others have mentioned, running with a dog may be helpful. I run with a big black dog who looks scary to people -- a boxer or lab or similar dog makes a pretty good running buddy. You don't have to have your own dog. In my city, the animal shelter will let volunteers take dogs out for exercise -- or a friend may have a dog who would enjoy it as well.As someone who lives where none of your self-defense options are legal (technically "bear spray" is legal here, though pepper spray is not...there aren't a lot of bears in a city of 2.5 million) sometimes I just have to avoid certain areas (or only run there with a friend), curtail my early morning/late evening running (so I'm running where there are more likely to be other people around), cross the street if someone looks like they might be blocking the sidewalk on purpose, etc.  Self-defense sounds like a great idea but without training/practice, a person is likely to freeze and not be able to handle a threat even with some kind of weapon.

It isn't a perfect world out there, be safe, be careful, but don't let that stop your running if it is something you love.

I have had similar experiences running. Used to go to the fields at varsity and run around them in the evenings when it was cooler. There are usually people around, but the one day I got there late and it was a bit dark and there was only myself and a guy there. When I ran past him, he was sitting on a bench and started calling to me while jacking off. I ran to my car and he followed me, but fortunately there were people around and he disappeared. I was determined not to be put off by the experience, so went again a few days later, but with a friend. He was there again, and followed us to our cars, but once again there were other people around and he vanished. A few months later a guy chased me around the field there one evening, same situation, there was no one around.

Fortunately its never got further than just those few scares, but if there's anything I've learnt from the experiences, it's to go running somewhere where there are people around, and go when it's light. The place I go to now is near an old age home, and there are lots of people walking there dogs there in the evenings, which helps, and I make sure I'm not our there once the sun has gone down. This sucks.

Report this to the police. the odd are you are not the first to experience harassment in area that you were. Its worth your time.

The other thing is be prepared. Pepper spay was invented for just such an event.

I am a 6'2" 200 lbs man. I carry and have used non lethal deterrents in the past. I It's not a sign of fear. it just how I have learned to live.

Well time to go out and patent the pepper spray arm band attachment for runners.

I think this is overly cautious.

4 months is more than adequate for someone with a starting aerobic base. I've run strictly at maffetone heart rate now for almost a year. I think it's the perfect heart rate to have you run forever. A trick is to really focus on shortening your stride. Like everyone said first things first the police. If mace is legal where you are consider that as an option, but make sure you know how to use it and can get access to it quickly. Nothing worse than accidentally macing yourself in a panic situation. Consider a rape alarm as an option as well.

 The best solution is to find a group to run with if you can. It also makes training more fun and you go FASTER.

Also never forget the pod shot option.This is extremely common.

It takes a couple weeks to get to what you used to consider easy pace. Then more to get more efficient.

Clearly you do not have to do it, that is your choice. Can confirm effectiveness; have been sprayed ear to ear with it.Jumping on the "file a police report" bandwagon.  You were assaulted, this is absolutely imperative.  You know where you were, you probably can give a good description of the perve and what he was wearing.  The sooner the better.

As for what to do, I'd suggest avoiding that street for a while.  And, as always when running: safety first (wear clothing that can be easily seen, if running in the dark, wear a small light somewhere on your person so cars can see you, try to run in well-lit areas, if possible when other people are around - though I know they clutter up the sidewalk, etc.).  If you can, consider running with a friend for your next couple of runs.  I'm the first person to say that the world should be a place where we can be safe wherever we are, doing whatever we want to be doing and wearing whatever we please....but this is the real world, not a perfect one.People are awesome, just look at how many people are trying to help right now!That is true, thanks :) I was just thinking now how scared I am of people but you make a good point. Thanks. Funny thing is it was in the afternoon on the main street of my city. I couldn't have done much more to ensure my safety. I think that's what is concerning me. I don't blame other people for startling me; I just bristled at the thought that people who have passed me think I was ignoring my environment and think negatively of me. I don't look disabled, and even after talking with me for five minutes, a stranger probably notices something is different about me, but unless they're autistic or an autism expert, their mind doesn't jump to "disability" or "autism", but rather "she's a bit daft" or "she's smart" or "she's rude" (when I don't realize someone is talking to me and so don't respond) or "she's stoned".

I just wanted to alert people that not everyone who appears to not be paying attention actually isn't.Pretty sure its not legal here unfortunately. It would be a good backup. My SO is similar. She's 20 yrs/old &amp; pretty healthy, yet her avg. HR is regularly above 170 on her runs, sometimes reaching upwards of 185. While the 220-age is a decent metric for your average person, every heart is a bit different. If you naturally have a high HR, that's fine. I would, however, consult your physician to see if he/she can identify any connections between your health, medications and your HR that I cannot.This is awful, i'm sorry you had to go through that. Don't lose hope in people though; when your out always remember that for every bad person, there are dozens who will help you out. Be cautious, but don't let this ruin your faith in peopleFile a police report. People who do stuff like this can, and often do, escalate to rape. If the guy was very old, like 70, he may have dementia, but that doesn't give him an excuse to hurt you or make him less dangerous.

If legal where you live, carry a pepper spray or a knife when you run. Try to find a more populated place to run.It was during the afternoon on a busy road in the area. Dude was pretty drunk and was part of a population considered to have social problems in my country. He kinda turned up all of a sudden. It was a really weird situation. #####&amp;#009;

&gt;__Crohn's disease__, also known as __Crohn syndrome__ and __regional enteritis__, is a type of [inflammatory bowel disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease) (IBD) that may affect any part of the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) from [mouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth) to [anus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus).  [Symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptoms) often include: [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), [diarrhea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea) (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), [fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever) and [weight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss).   Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include: [anemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia), [skin rashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_rashes), [arthritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis), [inflammation of the eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis), and [tiredness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical\)). The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as [pyoderma gangrenosum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyoderma_gangrenosum) or [erythema nodosum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_nodosum). [Bowel obstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction) also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of [bowel cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_cancer).

It's a really rough disease and we're still not quite sure what's going on. Here's a [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease) for you. Thanks for this discussion, juddbagley.   Chondromalacia ended my running career several years ago, although I'm not symptomatic as you.  I run about five miles a week but wish I could do a lot more.

The link you provide is from 2009.  Betcha there's been further advancement in the technology and surgical technique since then.

Sounds like you've already spoken to more than one orthopedists on this subject, and all said that running again is out of the question?

Hopefully we'll get some other contributors to this thread with some personal experience in partial and total knee replacements and if they were able to run again. I just got the one with the hand strap as well! Now to test it out and to start carrying it with me!I'll be hitting 45 this summer and I know I can run faster. It just takes time. Hang in there and keep running.Thirding. Don't leave home without it. Safe to use on loose dogs too.People improve with Maffetone's training. So, it works.

People improve without Maffetone's training. So, it's not the only thing that works.

You have to choose what you want to do.She could also find support here.I actually assumed people would read the article because I thought it was interesting. Crazy assumption I guess.I just wanted to let you know that what you are experiencing now, I will be doing this spring. Starting over and running based on HR. I know I will have to walk at times, but people say that this is better than running too fast (which I've done by the way and over trained and not gotten faster just more injury prone). I'd say keep it up and see how it works for at least a few months and keep us posted on your progress.As others have said, report it to the police. He may have done this before/plan to do it again.

Second, research the legality of it in your area and pick up something for self-defense. Knife/pepper spray/stun gun, whatever you prefer. You shouldn't have to carry something like that to feel safe, but there's some pretty awful people out there.The hell is wrong with people. Go to the police. Report it. Carry a little clip on mace and rock that asshole if it happened again. Don't give up running.Seconding the pepper spray. I got some with that hand strap after I got out of an abusive relationship and it made me feel a lot more confident about running alone.
Foremost I feel for you. You should not have to experience this for doing what you love.
Please don't have fear to run, please don't fear all men. Sexual assaulters are, after all, very rare isolated cases.


On a sidenote: a friend of mine moved to a big city that is somewhat less safe then were we came from.
I gave her a pepperspray and blinding flashlight. It makes her feel safe while she runs. Fortunately she has not had to use it.Or shoe companies have more money.  That's one thing about lawsuits -- if the company or person doesn't have any money, you're not going to get much for all the time and money spent on the suit.  Lots of companies get away with shit because they have nothing to take in a suit.  The fly by night contractors who pop up after a storm are famous examples.  Suing is pointless because it's a guy with a truck and a few tools.  Sue him and he declares bankruptcy and changes the name of his company to something else.Without telling us how fast you run, it's not easy to say. What's Crohn's? Also, is your thyroid producing too much or too little?First, this was not your fault at all. Doesn't matter if it was at night, or anything else. This is 100% not your fault. I am so sorry that happened to you. What that man did is totally wrong and unacceptable.

As others mentioned, if you feel comfortable, you should contact the police. The man who did this needs to be stopped. You can think about self-protection later, but for now, be safe, and contact the police. I've always heard how dangerous a place Cape Town is, I never realized it was so beautiful.I'm so sorry you had to experience that. 2 women were sexually assaulted last year in my city (Milan, Italy). Now I only run that same route to make sure something like this doesn't happen again (Runner Vigilante?)
Keep running and keep getting stronger, nothing will stop you! Call cops. Let them know about it. He may have done it to others in the area. Let's hope his behaviour doesn't escalate into a worse outcome for someone else.I'd recommend keeping your heart rate lower.  Maybe do a longer slower run or just do less in general.  Maximum heart rate for your age is supposed to be 200.  85% is 170.  Maybe try to stay around 170 for now.Yeah they force a runner to have impeccable technique. With bad form in minimal footwear an injury is a given. Did you run around a lot barefoot as a kid? Some people do seem to have naturally strong feet and calves, and natural biomechanics for barefoot running. Personally I was flat footed and a little bow legged (both improved since barefoot), and there was definitely an adjustment period. If I wore running shoes I could run faster for longer than I do barefoot. Shoes store energy and push back off like little trampolines attached to the feet. They totally alter the experience of running. lol..you know it is going to be $8 - $9. Not much to wait around for.

Oh, and did they really damage you or your feet? (If so, TMTS) Or did you just want to try to get some money back for the sake of it? Yes, please report this to the police.
Also, you can find support on /r/TwoXChromosomes

Edit: No idea why I'm getting downvoted.. I just wanted to help and redirect her to a more relevant subreddit (I read similar stories and the community was very supporting). I hope she's ok and I am sorry this happened. Also, running with pepper spray, a dog or a buddy might resolve the problem BUT NOT the cause. This guy needs to be arrested!This type of thing happens to people, regardless of whether they were running. You should not give up on running, or going outside as a whole for this isolated incident.

Like others said, report this to the police, use whatever details you can: time, location, clothes etc. Try to write them down or such as soon as possible to best accommodate the police.

If you feel not safe running there again, just pick a different path, freshen up your repertoire, don't let this get you down. Glad you got away.. what a terrible thing to happen!  I just found this pepper spray online designed for runners.  Maybe you could take something like that with you for when you don't run in groups.

http://www.amazon.com/SABRE-RED-Pepper-Spray-Protection/dp/B00Q6RTPMUugh, awful stuff.

I should say that I have no training or experience or credentials on anything like this.. but my general recommendation would be to immediately report this to the police. From what you have written, it was clearly an attempted sexual assault from somebody that could easily strike again.

Second, I would recommend talking to a therapist/professional ASAP.


That's purely from a layman's perspective. More generally,  I'm sorry OP-- so unfair that something like this should go down when you are doing something so associated with good health, exercise and overall well-being. Hope  you can get through this and eventually are able to lace up and get back out there.. safely.
I cured my flat footedness wearing minimal footwear and running barefoot. That's all the evidence I need. Slower, yes. More injury prone? Not really unless they run through the pain. Have you reported it to the police? If not, go do that.

And sorry that happened to you. That is disgusting. Sorry you had to deal with assault like that. Any chance you can run in a group or at least when there is more people out? If you think you might be able to overcome your social anxieties if you had a supportive training group, you should consider looking around for run clubs, especially ones that offer "intro-to-running" type experiences for newbies.  Unless you really don't plan on enjoying running and are only considering it for health purposes as the easiest cardio option you can think of.  I have never run with any training group (I *have* run with social groups that don't fit this mold) that wasn't extremely polite, friendly, welcoming and helpful to folks who had never run before but wanted to give it an honest go.  This guy is a member of my run club, to give you an idea (he can only run about 3mi @15:00/mi pace right now): http://support.smiletrain.org/site/TR?px=3539047&amp;fr_id=1480&amp;pg=personalAnother option, if he/she has a car, is to go to a rural area and get into trail running/hiking/walking.  Few people, hooray nature, and a lot more fun than a treadmill.Sweet thanks Both of you.By comparison, my "normal person" workout yesterday not at altitude was 7.5mi very easy (8:20ish) in the morning, then a 1mi warmup in the evening followed by 6x800 in: 2:55, 2:52, 2:57, 2:53, 3:13, 2:43.  I simply cannot fathom what they did.  I also can't fathom being an olympic medalist, though, so.........In fact he's gonna get there in slightly less than fifteen minutesOP meaning the person who wrote the article and headline? I'd recommend shock absorber bras. They're pretty much the only ones I'll buy. Really good quality. Can buy them off Amazon or sometimes sports shops sell them too. Try posting in /r/ABraThatFits they might have some good suggestions as well A granola bar and half a cup of water.
I like these: http://www.walmart.com/ip/24017595?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;adid=22222222227017328721&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=40888268912&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;wl6=78818346272&amp;veh=sem

In general, I wait 2-3 hours after a full meal before running.  You are eating way too much and only giving yourself an hour to digest it.  Since it hasn't gone away for 2 weeks, maybe you should see a doctor...Ah okMaybe that headline isn't directly misleading, but OP knew damn well what everyone was going to assume.OMG JUST LIEK CROCS RITE??When it comes to racing I believe it does. That's why sprinter's spikes are nearly completely rigid, mid-D spikes less so, distance spikes even less. But all are more rigid than a pair of normal trainers. Yeah, normally lawyers are really loose lipped about clients involved in cases they have nothing to do with.So wait, you claim that the rigidity of the sole affects the power of your stride?Probably something like 2-3 miles jogging, a few strides, and some dynamic stretching drills. I was saying that racing flats are more rigid and responsive, not minimal shoes in general.It's not that Adidas fucked up, was Bikila was filling in for someone who dropped out lat minute.Since Adidas didn't allow him to run in his own shoes because they were the sponsor, and they didn't have a right size, Bikila didn't have many options.Thanks for getting back to me, and sorry for the slow reply, works kept me busy the last few days.

When you say up my milage slowly, what can you recommend? I was running between 3-7 miles per sessions before injury struck...three times a week.

Ys, running on asphalt and concrete requires padding.I'll come too to throw my 10 pair at you.Yeah that's what I thought months back and so I consciously try and keep virtually all of my runs at a very slow pace, doing speedwork once per week at absolute max and only after several weeks. Perhaps even that is too muchJust a matter of time before someone to claims they're a descendent of Greek Gods and sues Nike.  That's the thing. I start off with a very low weekly mileage (15 miles) and I only increase by 1 mile per week at max. Furthermore I seem to be the only person in my club who actually consciously tries to go slow and easy for most of the miles...
In terms of speed I was pretty much at the same place I was before I got ill last time...It sounds like you are training too hard trying to make up list time for injury. You will make more gains if you are consistent and don't get injured than trying to push the pace all the time.I'd recommend spending longer building up a base of mileage before doing a marathon and do more halves, but if you just want to get round and don't care at all about time it will be doable.Too-mer-ick is correct. The hardest part for me is lacing up my shoes. Once they're on, I tell myself that I've gone too far to turn back. And I'm out the door!Nah man, it's probably cancer.Welcome. Glad I found it. I've been looking for a new place to run so I can get off the pavement every now and again.No, you creepy shit.What kind of warm up do they do prior to a workout like that?There was a band from England called throbbing gristle.Yes. I did.  It was in the 5 fingers, or figures.  My name is Abebe Bikila, and I approve this message.What happened? I've never heard of this?  Did a 20 miler on the treadmill while watching 4 episodes of Breaking Bad.Well you asked:

FUCK YOU GO RUNEveryone has a different reasons that their running gears tick, but certainly none of us are perfect and few of us feel that it is effortless. I like to train for races to challenge myself, and I skipping days might mean that I will fail to improve on previous results. As I run more and more, the enjoyment becomes something I always look forward to. Recognizing your drive can be very important - whether it is completing a race, improving a result, becoming a healthier person, or even just beating those winter blues. Canadian here. I've braved some -25 degree Celsius runs so far this year. Start with a good base layer on top and bottom. I add a pair of running pants on the bottom. On top I add a running technical Tshirt and a fleece sweater. All breathable and close to my body. Light gloves and balaclava to keep extremities warm.


Most nights, it's the first 10mins that are cold before my body heat warms me up. Don't strip down as soon as you get back since you lose a lot more body heat than you'd think. I probably ran 15 5ks last summer, some were a blast, I helped set up, socialized, raced awesomely, felt great after, loved every second. Some everyone kept to themselves, event volunteers/staff were cold, the race was grueling, I hurt the whole time, couldn't breathe, overheated, they were hell. My first race I felt really out of place and awkward, my last race prior to getting shin splints was great and I felt like I knew what I was doing. Don't judge yourself by where you place right now, go for PRs or fun, that's what I do.It was just whichever ones were at the REI in my town, I couldn't tell ya.I ran the Goofy Challenge a few years back. I went with a large group and we ended up having no time to go to the actual park between the two races for Goofy, plus we also did the 5km on the Friday.

The races were amazing. Super well organized and the cast members and crowds were really supportive and cheered a LOT. The races seem to go fast because there is so much to see, but you can also stop for pictures with the characters so don't expect to get a PR. My half marathon time was 3 hours!! (I stopped for pictures though, and danced with the Genie. I was there for the experience, not to PR.)

I had a blast, but you have to look at these 'races' as another way to experience Disney and not as a serious race. There are lots of walkers and lots to see and do and enjoy along the route. Just don't straggle too much or the sag wagon will scoop you up off the course.  I think I'd be OK with that
The miler.  Well what are you running currently per week?

Cross times differ, but it still gives everyone a good idea of what your potential is. Don't worry about the fartleks or tempo runs quite yet, just work on miles. If you're starting from ground zero then you've got a lot of work to do right now by just getting out and running!Nothing.  Just coffee.  You'll be able to FINISH.  But you won't be able to RACE it.  Well he will be a junior come cross season, but you're right, my advice was a very general statement and 50 could easily be too much for him. I was actually very under-mileage in high school averaging around 30 MPW, while still in the top 20 for my state.

After running at the D1 collegiate level my entire idea of mileage has changed based on my coach, whether that be good or bad. His philosophy is miles upon miles and while it's difficult it seems to be what the top teams are all doing, and succeeding. Take Oklahoma State for example, their top runners average 100+ MPW and they're dominating. Sorry I know this is an extreme example, but if I could go back to high school there is so much more I could have done to further my success at the collegiate level. It really bothers me that I didn't try that hard and see my potential, and then when I got to college it kicked me down over and over and I kept having to push through.

All I'm trying to say is that if you plan on running in college there's so much you can do in high school to prepare and you have to take advantage of it while you can. Sorry for the long rant, I just don't want others to make the same mistake I did!RunDisney events are nothing short of top notch in terms of participant experience.  I can't comment on planning a trip around it, because I live close enough that I don't have to.  The entry fee is comparatively steep but worth it, in my opinion.  They are not highly competitive events. There will be many run-walkers and walkers on the course, even for the marathon. Average finishing times are typically slower than other similar events.

The one caveat I'll mention is that submitting proof of time is essential. I would not want to start one of their races from the back corral. Check out the event page for the event you are interested in for proof of time requirements.  "tempo"Heat stroke is when you don't even sweat anymore. Your body's cooling mechanisms pretty much are saying "fuck this; he's not even trying to get somewhere safe. I quit".It's what plants crave!Supplements are regulated. Not to the degree that they should be and certainly not to the point of pharmaceuticals, but they are regulated (scrutiny depends on the state tho).

For example, someone I know is the head of r&amp;d at a respectable company that produces (among other things) herbal supplements. She's a scientist but 50% of her job is working with legal to make sure products meet regulations. Guidelines are strict, especially in a state like California. The products are backed by legitimate research too, which may surprise those that think it's giant snake oil industry. At my last 5k race, I think at least 10 guys over 40, including two guys over 50, ran sub 20. And that race was in frigid December weather so it didn't even have all the top local talent there. Not sure if you tried the first or second generation but I had problems with the first gen but not the second.&gt;  I suck at long, gradual hills,

Everyone does.  Which is a good reason to run them as much as possible.  Same with running on grass.  If you start to get a lot miles on those, it will pay off in XC.

Look into "summer of Malmo".  It is a great base building program structure.

Building a big base plus puberty can lead to huge time drops.  Good luck.I'm glad someone had a good experience with the trail gloves. The weird stiffness of the sole combined with that little arch support thing built in made them quite probably the least comfortable thing I've put on my foot. They are very rare here, but I think the lack of more forgiving or even running surfaces is to blame more than the shoes.

That said, they're still feasible. I've run up to 5 miles on them on concrete on random occasions without injury and I rather enjoy tossing them in the mix. I like the idea of being able to run with more "natural" form (able to push off with spread toes), although it is negated a bit by the downside of concrete running with little padding. Check out r/runDisney! Its not as active, but I'm sure it has what you're looking for. 50 MPW might be a tad steep for a High school Sophomore.  I'm not completely disagreeing with this bit of advice but I try not to tell people  what sort of mileage they should be running unless I know what kind of mileage they've run in the past.  Some people can take high mileage while others can't. It's the same way with EP.  A couple twins that were two of the top kids in the state had an incredibly slow EP compared to what they raced, but it worked. Just my $.02Drink water 2 hours before run for an hour. Empty bladder over hour 2. source: lunchtime running in Australia. Run outdoor. It'll keep you in racing shape, and force  you to stay consistent with you training.  You could probably talk to your coach about running more 1600s or even some 3200s during outdoor season.  As far as summer running goes, I could only give  you estimates.  I ran similar times in high school, but that doesn't really matter when it comes to giving you advice on mileage, because each person's body reacts differently to mileage.  Respond here or shoot me a PM if you have any questions.
All I know is, inhaling anything into my lungs makes them tighter on inhalation when running, so fck that. (And it doesn't matter house "clean" or "pure" the weed is.)That guy is right, unfortunately you won't find a good treadmill for that money. I understand not wanting to run outside as well. What city are you in? If there's a TheGym location in your town I would recommend joining it. Membership is about 12, it's open 24 hours and entry is by pin so you won't have to see staff members everyday. They also tend to be massive with an abundance of treadmills that are often unoccupied. If you're uncomfortable with running even in a gym, they have a general usage tool on their site which tells you when it is busiest/emptiest so you can go when there is hardly anyone there. Not that anyone cares about people running in a gym anyway.

Good luck. (http://www.thegymgroup.com/find-a-gym/)I don't find minimal shoes rigid at all, but rather very flexible and not much support.The world record for your age is under fourteen minutes. You're not limited by your age. You're limited by how much you're willing to work. It's curios that they've sold so many, but I rarely see anyone wearing them. NYC runner here and we have a lot of road runners to observe.Pretty sure dietary choices that day have impacted my running performance, not just varying levels of fatigue. I have a decent sample size on this now and feel fairly good about the conclusion.

No claims made about fitness or health, just within-day performance.I broke my ankle in September, no surgery needed, and was out of my boot by the middle of December. I'm running now, but it hurts.

It hurts when i start running, calms down a bit when i warm up (havent done more than 3.5 miles) and hurts when i stop. That aside, it hurts when i wake up, when i walk up and down stairs, when i cross my legs, when i spend too much time on my feet, and its challenging to stand on my toes (still cant wear heels). I feel so old and achy!! I didn't go to PT, my orthopedist wouldn't refer me, so maybe your recovery will be smoother if you do go to PT.

That being said, a fractured ankle is a much longer recovery process than anticipated. There's a lot of strength lost in your muscles, tendons, and  ligaments that is hard to recover, and the bone is still healing long after it can bear weight. The stress you put on it day-to-day and the naturally worse circulation your legs have compared to tje rest of your body just makes it that much slower of a process.
Thanks ! I am in the Northern California / Bay Area, so I guess one good thing is that heat will not be an issue ;-)

Thanks for the words of encouragement ! One can never have enough of the blessings and motivational support ! They are much appreciated. Knowing the next run is another opportunity to improve. Also, brownies.It might sound silly or too cliche ! But I want to run a Marathon before I turn 40. It's just one of those silly itches :) Advise taken. I'll probably skip it.I guess I'll look into adding another day down the line. Not an option at the moment though. Thanks.I'm not following, what's not actually true? The Sketchers lawsuit or that supplements are unregulated? Both of those are true. And neither is in the article.Yes you can do it. Just spend the next 16 weeks gradually increasing your mileage.   Make one run a week a long run,  try to get it to 12 or 15 miles if you can. Treat each leg of the race as a run, not a race. Stay properly fueled and hydrated.  Nap if you get the chance. Have fun. Thanks! Yeah I'm looking to smash the time next race... which should be easy enough considering it's a month away and course is a lot flatter :PWhich is weird because I'm pretty sure I steal more than 95% of what I say from you.Dude. For a first race, and being a bigger guy, recently injured, and facing unexpected hills, 5:38min/km is pretty solid pace. Be proud. Remember that most people didn't even start the race.

Now you have a benchmark for improvement!/u/ForwardBound is an idiot.  We only agree ~95% of the time.

But yeah, you are doing pretty good for what you are doing.  Consistency is the key to running, so just start getting consistent and then worry about focusing on a specific distance.,Not actually true, but people read an article and are now experts. Awesome. Glad I'm not the only one who has already watched this today.I feel awful when I eat fat before a run so I stick to toast with jam or cereal with almond milk.I've had tendon injuries in both ankles and had success with myofascial release therapy and using a lacrosse ball on the tendon myself. There's a chain of chiropractors in my area called Airrosti that specialize in this but I think a lot of sports doctors do it. I spent $160 on a few visits but it was totally worth it to get back to running. I also learned that my hip is super tight on the leg that I have the most ankle problems with. So now I know that I need to work in that and also foam roll my IT band. My running has improved from it what it was before injury.Sketchers got hit with a lawsuit as well, for 40 million (10 times the vibram case) for unsubstantiated health claims. I wonder if that case made it obvious that shoe companies who make health claims are good targets.

Supplements are completely unregulated. They aren't even required to have the ingredients they say they do, and can almost sell whatever cheap filler they want as whatever they want to say it is. It's insane.How about a head lamp band? Hide the lamp under a horn or just cover it with something to be part of the costume. I've used them to run in the dark and they stay pretty secure.I've my ankle twice in the past year as well. I fractured a bone in the ankle a couple years ago. What I did is I took a while off with a lot of icing, and when I came back I started off with easier runs I would normally do. You should probably go see your doctor if it's an issue you frequently have thoughYeah, I use to use VFF's but found the little toe pockets to be annoying and didn't seem better than Merrell trail gloves.Yeah, I have a pair of Merrell's minimal shoes and they have no signs of ware at about 500 miles.Get a couple pairs of tights. I have some regular, thermal tights and some others that have softshell front panels to block wind/rain from the goods. I recommend getting some quality base layers too: Under Armor, merino wool, Nike Pro Combat fitted, etc. And lastly, you need a 1/2 zip and a windproof, waterproof jacket. If you layer well, the jacket doesn't need to be anything crazy. I have the Asics Storm Shelter jacket.

I ran 14mi in the snowstorm that hit mid-Michigan a couple weeks ago, and I was toasty. Just to give you an example, here's what I wore:

* Nike Element Thermal Tight
* Lululemon Studio Boxer (under tights)
* Nike Pro Combat, fitted baselayer
* Lululemon Metal Vent Tech SS
* Lululemon Speed 1/2 zip
* Asics Storm Shelter Jacket
* Chaos CTR Adrenaline Dri Release Multi Tasker Pro Balaclava + windproof insert
* Craft Siberian Gloves
* North Face beanie
* Thorlo Pads merino socksThe only thing to really fuss about is getting good tights. Everything else is basically just layering cheap stuff and you'll be find. No need to pay big bucks. I've been running double digit mile runs through sub-zero temps with a pair of thin dollar store type gloves and socks over top of them.What? I still don't get the joke.Buff is the best invention ever!I know this is a serious question and there have been lots of great answers BUT... I live on the east coast of Canada and it was -32 with the brutal wind today on my run. In addition to everything else my snot froze. Heat stroke is the least of my worries lol! Good luck with your problem though. Oh yeah, we did speak. I remember where I know your (real) name from now. It's too bad you've been injured so much. Must be frustrating not to be able to catch the PRs you sound like you're very close to achieving.

I just do the easy pace at whatever feels good. Seems like that can vary wildly for different people. Today I was doing 7:45 - 7:50, but another day that feels like plodding. I'm mainly training for the Run to Remember half at the end of May, but I also want to perform well at the YuKan Fool's Dual in April. And a few other hard workout-type races in between. Are you doing the Spring Classic again this year? If so I look forward to seeing you off in the distance.

Good luck at Hyannis--the weather seems to be a huge factor in whether that's a good race or bad one. I hope it clears up and the roads are widened a bit.Agreed.  Unfortunately, I have yet to see reviews of similar depth from a running-specific perspective (and certainly not this many reviews side-by-side).I have two halves coming up: Hyannis in 11 days and NYC in March. The first one will be just a hard workout where I may try to run the second half of the race at my goal pace (~5:40). I am little bit scared of the distance as I have done only one 12+ mile workout in the last 7 months.

My weekly mileage has been 15-30 for these seven months, so I don't know what to expect. Last spring I reached 700 miles by the end of March, failed to improve my 5k/10k times (almost 2min short of my 10k PR), suffered from some kind of over-training for the next three months (ran a 1.19 half during this period), and have been half-injured since.

You seem to be training fairly hard, my easy pace was more like 8:00 last spring. Are you training for something? I think we actually spoke after Spring Classic last year.Two words: merino wool (as a base layer)Well it matters how much they made. Look how much Jordan, Lebron etc get paid for their name. Sure he's not them but it's his name on the shoe.Don't push an ankle recovery, take your time and let it heal completely before training again or you will have issues for the rest of your life. If you have to do physiotherapy once the cast is off, take it seriously and don't half ass it - this is your only chance for a full and strong recovery.

I had an ankle reconstruction (bone pinned and ligaments reattached) after severely rolling it in a basketball game. It took me 4 months before I could walk properly and over a year before I was running at normal pace again. Listen to your body and take your time, the last thing you want is a lifelong injury. http://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=chafing&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=allI live in rural Kansas, so most of my runs are either trail or dirt road, but thanks for the insight! &gt; they just make them slower and more injury prone.

Does anyone else remember how a statement like this used to lead to a flood of posts by barefoot runners citing some survey by the Italian Olympic team with a sample size of 12 as evidence of the contrary?

The barefoot running craze was seriously weird.Haha, thanks for the advice :)Supplements are such and absolute mess. Since they are not regulated by the FDA there are no truth in advertising requirements. This has lead to tons of fly by night companies being involved.

I suspect there probably are quite a few suits involving supplements, but they are rarely successful because the companies making them simply close up shop only to reopen under a different name in a different state.The starting line is a great place to strike up a conversation! For your next race just try saying a few words to the person next to you, introduce yourself, wish them a good race. In my experience at races 95% of people are happy to be there and are very approachable when you give them a chance. The other 5% are the douches that think they were one injury away from being an Olympian. Speed wise I think the highest benefit people are getting from them is that they're really light compared to traditional shoes. That said, the calf gains are a definite real benefit.

Can we all just agree that Hoka One Ones are the worst thing ever when it comes to shoe gimmicks though?

Can confirm.  During the last snow dump (seriously, it can stop now) I thought "what a badass" at every runner.  There's this absolutely ancient woman who I always see running, and sure enough there she was running through the snow storm.  She' a BAMF.My best piece of advice for you would be to run outdoor. There is absolutely no reason not to (unless you were kicked off the team).

If you are set on not doing outdoor the do outdoor, the best way to improve your running is to have a coach help you though it.

If you WILL NOT do outdoor than I would suggest:
Find new routes - you seriously only have one route
Run more but progress slowly, don't want any injuries
after a few weeks add in a 4 to 5 mile tempo run
add in some intervals later, like 1000 meter repeats with limited recovery
do strides after all your runs
google search summer of malmo, follow that plan loosely
check out the letsrun.com boards, they have some great info I'd say there's no point in doing the speed stuff. You should be concentrating on getting the most distance in that you possibly can. Don't extend your one run too long, but yes, it's a good idea to make one longer than the others. Fit in a very short fourth run if you can.&gt;  I was an age group placer and didn't die so it was totally worth it.

*fist bump*
90 miles in a week on a treadmill?! That's amazing. I'm in awe. I actually don't mind the treadmill much at all, especially when the alternative is hop-scotching through snow and dodging cars in the street.

I generally don't use an incline on the treadmill I use, as I've found that my paces on the treadmill and the track are very equivalent, though I think I'm going to experiment with incline on a few upcoming workouts.

Thanks for the kind words! 8 miles @ 6:00 is extremely impressive. I hope to be up there in a month or two. My easy is mostly around 7:30 - 7:45. Sometimes I get down to 7:15 on long runs.

Are you training for anything in particular? Goal race for the spring?There's also the semi-popular Canadian band known as Swollen Members.Body glide.Soak them in cider vinegar, it generally pulls out the stank I might be able to help you with Running Formula. What makes it hard for you to extract a concrete plan from it? No, but it's what this thread is about.No problem. Good luck! I think you're going to be experiencing a lot of new PRs soon if you bump up the frequency.Below 0 degrees C or F? Below 0 degrees F isn't too bad to deal with, most of the time. You *really* heat up once you start running, so it may take less than you think!

What I wear isn't perfect, but I personally don't want to buy new clothes:

1. UnderArmour Cold gear tights. These are *awesome.* Get them or something like them! I've never worn a shirt version, but it'd be a good idea if it's that cold.
2. Sweatpants over top of the tights. A pair of wind pants would possibly work, depending on weather.
3. Balaclava. These things are *great*. They cover more than just a hat, and keep more wind out!
4. Gloves. I should have better ones, but your hands heat up as you run.
5. Tank-top. Cotton. As said, I could probably have better.
6. Northface Fleece. God-given warmth on the really cold days.
7. Newly purchased wind-jacket. Super lightweight, and cutting out the wind does wonders.
/u/ForwardBound saying same thing, seems to be something of a consensus. Thanks!Seems to be a consensus that I need to run more. Thanks for taking the time to reply.OK, so definitely possible, good to know.

Thanks for the advice!Which Ragnar are you doing? Any chance you can change which legs you're running?

Ragnar is a grind, and it'll be tough if you've never been over 5K distance. You'll need to train yourself to basically be in half marathon shape. Near the end of your training plan (the 2-3 weeks before your relay), you should do some 2x runs (think 3  miles in the AM, 5 in the PM) to prepare for the low rest you'll get during the event.

If it were me, I'd get started on a half marathon training plan, tweak as needed, and just try to SURVIVE the event. It'll be plenty of fun, but getting hurt would ruin it.

Forget pacing, just take it easy and enjoy being out there. http://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=winter&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=allEvery run below needs a 10min warmup and 10min cooldown.

Sprints: 100m dash

 * 6-10x 60m or 10-15sec sprint with good form (bad form = trying to go too fast)
 * 1st 20m build up to speed and last 20m gradual slow down (stopping abruptly = injuries).
 * Rest = at LEAST 2min rest (should be back to ~90-100% before each sprint AKA full recovery; this is not meant to be hard cardio)
 * Can also use hill repeats either as additional training to sprints, or just hills alone. Same concept, except you run up a hill at full speed for 10-20sec (no reason to measure distance or start/stop slow since you wont be going as fast up a hill).

Intervals:

 * maximum 5min hard per interval
 * Rest time is same as time ran (ran 3min hard, 3min easy)
 * Best results with at least 90sec in duration (typically 400m up to 1 mile)
 * General rule of thumb: run them until you feel like you can only do 1 more and stop

Threshold (not necessarily HIIT) - AKA "comfortably hard"

 * Pace should stay consistent at a pace that you can hold onto for long period of time from 20-60min
 * Pace described as "only being able to talk 1 word at a time"
 * General rule of thumb is 15-45sec slower than 5k  race pace
 * Can split up into interval type runs with short jogs in between (5min Tempo, 1min easy), repeat until tempo total time ran = time you want for tempo pace.

Calculate your training pace:

1. Run a time trial of either: 1) A certain distance and time it, or 2) Run for a certain amount of time and calculate the distance you ran. This should be race pace; OR you can run a race as well
1. [Use a running calculator and enter your time trial](http://runsmartproject.com/calculator/)
1. Use the infor the calculator gave you for training paces and quivalences for varying distances for race pace.
Interesting point. You got me wondering, what about other famous names that are probably trademarked but also that of a famous person, whether coincidentally or otherwise? Does Tesla's family get a cut? Maybe lawyer guy/lady above can answer.Yeah, you are definitely right. I have been tossing it over since the race and it's making me want to get back out and try again lol. Next one is beginning of march and a bigger event. I'm not gonna worry so much about the social aspect, and instead put my focus into running a good race. If I happen to meet some people, great. But running the best race I can will be the goal :)I wouldn't consider myself fortune for having one. I worked for it. It didn't fall out of the sky.

Also, you don't have friends willing to take you? That's just...sadYeah, I think you're right. I'm just gonna have to get over worrying about "fitting in", get out of my comfort zone and see what happens. Thanks!Go for it!Sounds scary. Sometimes in the summer I have to cut my runs short because I feel like I am overheating. Increase your mileage and forget about the intervals. You don't run enough per week to get a benefit from them that couldn't be eclipsed by adding on more kilometers.

The coach for my run club could crush most of the members and he's 47. You definitely have a lot of years left to run faster.I took it. Lied. Haha, see that's the thing.. I could have ran 30 seconds faster and got a medal (the guy who got 3rd didn't even show up to get his! grr!)... but in the end 3rd or 4th out of 4. My pace still would have been over 5:30, not much different xDIf you did a 21 on streets, you can easily go sub-20 in a race maybe even sub-19. Go out in 6:20 pace (19:35 pace) and see if you can hold on to that for 2 miles. Push hard in the final mile, and even if you fall back a little, you're still setting yourself up for a huge PR.Honestly? In order for you to find out the questions you asked you would have to do some actual work.

Want to know if more female runners are running marathons? Look at the results of 10 different marathons for the past 10 years and do the math.

Are more runners using gels? Look at the companies that sell them. Most 50ks and ultras are on trails so your road paces won't matter as much. There are many plans for a 50k but what worked for me was training miles maxed out at around 50 per week with my long runs building up to 26/28 miles three weeks before the event. In short, if you can run 50 miles per week, you can finish a 50k (IMO).

Also, if you sign up for a trail race, try to do your long runs (or longish) on trails. Every run doesn't have to be on dirt but the experience does help you get used to the different pace and rhythms.

Your ultra will also be small. I ran Chicago with 45,000 people and my first 50k with about 300. The trail can only handle so many folks.

Would I do more ultras? Maybe. There are some great races I'd love to try. But I kind of decided my long-term goal would be Boston and training for that time doesn't really work with ultra training. I say go for it. I learned a lot about myself doing a 50k and I think that's helped me be a better runner.Thank you! Yeah... I didn't do any form of sports in highschool (unless you count partying a sport...). I wrestled and played soccer until middle school, then started smoking, ditched that about 5 years ago. So the whole being healthy/fit/etc.. i'm doing for pretty much the first time in my life.

I guess I hadn't considered how much of a leg up high school/college athletes would have, but that makes quite a lot of sense.You are flat lining because you don't have much of a base.  25k/week is very little running.  Focus on building that up and you will see improvement.Also forgot to add, if you are not running everyday, you can actually run hard/quality workouts everytime you run (besides the long run). The days in between your running days should be enough rest as these would be easy runs anyway.Sounds like a question for a physical therapist... Best 5K was probably a few months ago. To be honest I'm getting *slightly* faster, but was hoping for better progress.

Didn't know about the running calculator, thanks for that.

Many thanks for the tips, much appreciated!Sorry haha, I'm training for a 20 miler right now, I haven't gone further than 10 and my mile splits for faster 3 mile runs are around 7 and my longer runs are around 8:30 When was the 5k time trial you did? To be honest your age isnt that much of a factor as is your athletic ability. Your best bet to figure out what your 5k could be is to do a time trial. You can do a shorter distance if you want and get a theoretical 5k pace using a [running calculator](http://www.runsmartproject.com/calculator/)

For workouts you should do 1-3 quality workouts a week, not just one (sprints, tempo, intervals, etc.). Also should add more runs per week if possible. Only running 3 times a week you wont see much progression (which is why youre not seeing much benefit from the intervals because its the only thing keeping you in "fast" shape). That's not what the article is about.There is a master's runner under 15min for a 5k. I have friends who are in their late 40's running in the 18's I am sub 20 at 37 and 250+ lbs. Limits are things you place on your self primarily. I'd say you could go sub 20 or faster with correct training and a good plan for nutrition, sleep and the rest of your life. Remember all stress is cumulative and can lead to lack of progress. You body can only handle so much stress, so if you are stressing it with training adding in a stressful job may be too much, so square away your life, then square away training/nutrition/recovery with a coach and you will get faster. I don't think it's in the same ballpark as a biopic. They *trademarked his name* to sell their shoes. A name that the rest of the family still has, for one thing.Thanks for the tips. I'll be taking it nice and slow to make sure i adjust.

I find the thought of running on a nice golf course much more pleasurable than running on roads. Damn, I don't know why people on both sides of the barefoot/shoe argument get so SALTY.

I wear shoes, but who cares if someone wants to go barefoot or run in those toe-shoes?

Oh, did they claim that training barefoot/shod is better? If only there were a way to settle these sorts of things in a way that's related to the sport at hand...

It's called racing.Poetry in motionOhh gosh, *so so* sorry, I misread that part of your original post! It all still applies though. Rushing into a treadmill really isn't necessary when you're starting running. You'll be going pretty short distances for short periods of time, so it'd be worth seeing if you even like running first. Maybe you'll do it a few times and say, "Fuck this, I'd rather get an exercise bike!" You could definitely stay within a short distance of your house, and it wouldn't take very long (since you're starting out, your runs will be short!).

Also, running often helps people with anxiety. So maybe it'll help you not freak out, and you'll realize you don't mind running outside. Or you'll realize you love running, and that it's worth getting a *nice* treadmill. As said, this question comes up a lot, so a search of the sub will have a wealth of info in terms of buying a treadmill.Nailed it.I went swimming once with bad shin splints and it almost hurt as much as running to be honest.. Maybe because you kind of flex your feet while kicking, I don't really know..I'm not overweight, I weigh about 110-120lbs and I'm 5'7!

Apart from that I understand what you are saying, I will have a look elsewhere on the sub-reddit to see what others say as well.That sounds like a really good base, stick with it!  I apologize for the interval/tempo comments then, as I said, I'm not too familiar with the beginner plans.  Throwing some 5k's in there is definitely a good idea to get you comfortable and more used to racing.  I so no reason, if you stick more or less to your plan, why you shouldn't do well in the half :)  Good luck!Depends on your fitness, I've done races on friday evening, saturday and sunday in 1 weekend, and ran 3 half marathons on 3 saturdays in October last year.

What do you think yourself ? Are you fit enough ? How many times a week do you run ? And how far ?This is absolutely what kept me in that cycle. Makes you feel unstoppable when you train that way, but overall very damaging.Why are you in such a hurry to run a marathon?  Take your time.A quick search of this sub will show tons of info about buying/using treadmills. It would be worth checking them out. I responded to one of those threads, so I'm not going to repeat the specific things to look for in a treadmill here.


**In short:**If you do not currently run, it is probably not a wise investment to buy a treadmill. You will **not** find a nice treadmill for 400-500. It will be a POS.


Tons of us hate running on them, and getting a nice one is *expensive*. If you do not currently run, it is very likely unwise to spend a large amount of money on something you might not even like to do.

And to be frank, you're ~~overweight~~ out of shape. You will not be running long distances or periods of time, especially to start. I understand that you're anxious to leave the house, but we're talking 20 minutes within a half mile of your house. *Max.* I would at least spend a few days running to see *if you even like running*. Whoa! Bold take....Levins is the favorite at this point but I don't see a runaway. Hill, Lamong, lots of class in that race. Keeping track of my miles has helped me with this, if only to give me a quantifiable check against my own sense of progress, whether it is higher or lower than my actual progress. What I have found more often than not is that my sense of what is enough has increased with the mileage and frequency of running such that lulls that I have now are still improvements on the lulls I have had in the past.

How much running data do you keep? Can you compare where you are after the latest setback in relation to prior recovery periods?What are your goals?  That's kind of the deciding factor here. If you want to get faster, then you'll benefit mostly from (1) running regularly with higher mileage at a LOW intensity, (2) running hills (doesn't have to be anything structured--just chose hilly places to run), (3) sleeping a lot and (lastly) (4) maybe doing one tempo run/harder effort run per week.  Generally, I advise runners to avoid speedwork until they are comfortable with (at minimum) about 20 miles a week of running.I thought this was /r/nottheonion before I read the article A proper hill workout is hard running uphill and a slow jog down. Always feel like you could do one more rep at the end of your workout.It's clearly suggesting association and/or approval. They could have called them anything but they did not. Yes, douchey.Choose one:

A - Run easy and eventually you'll get faster

B - Run fast and eventually it'll get easier

Sounds like you've been picking B.  If so, try A.Certainly does sound like over training. I've ridden that horse, but I've swaped it out for a nice, trusty donkey. It's a slower life, but it gets me there.I'm right there with you. This was supposed to be the first winter I made a concerted effort to keep running since I started a few years ago - I got a gym membership and everything.

In December I increased my weekly mileage too quickly and strained my calves. I donated blood after xmas and could barely slog through a couple of miles for 2 weeks. Then I got bronchitis in January which barely subsided in time for my half marathon. And since I hadn't done enough training for the half, I had to take another week off to heal after that.

I need to move out of northern climates. I didn't mean program per se. Just like... routine. Would you recommend jog downhill, spring uphill or something like that? Or even just run both ways?Especially considering the guy's name they are using has been dead for 40+ yearsLots of people are in your shoes and they all get told the same thing. Build up more slowly because your legs clearly aren't ready to handle the workload you're putting on them.Thanks for the advice. How do you think I should get in the mileage, i.e. via fartleks, long runs, tempos?

I left out my 5k time because cross country courses, and thus my times, differ so much. My (not very recent PR) is around 18:25, but it was on a paved road race. FWIW, I suck at long, gradual hills, and running on grass drains me much more than running on pavement.thanks for your advicesA 10K a week after a 5K should be no problem.Suing for $15 million in damages seems a bit much.You sure it's not just because they totally changed up the way you run? You can still run like you do with VFF in running shoes."We're taking it in stride," says his dad.I often go back to this...

Think Easy, Light, Smooth, and Fast. You start with easy, because if thats all you get, thats not so bad. Then work on light. Make it effortless, like you dont give a shit how high the hill is or how far youve got to go. When youve practiced that so long that you forget youre practicing, you work on making it smoooooth. You wont have to worry about the last one  you get those three, and youll be fast.   -CB.It's not the running part that gives me anxiety...

I just have a lot of anxieties that build up when out, especially for a prolonged period, it's not unknown for me to start having a panic attack in public, and for now at least I would prefer to get fit at home.It depends entirely on how quickly you recover (which is mainly a question for your doctor). If you are fully recovered in April and able to run 10k immediately then sure. But my experience with injuries less severe is that even after you're recovered it takes 2-3 months to get back to pre-injury levels. So you'd be cutting it close.K. Maybe you are running to fast when you should be running easy. You could be tiring your body out which can lead to sickness and injury. Been there. Done that.Sounds like a pretty atypical race, also quite small. For a big race, 30 minutes ahead of time is barely enough :) You would not generally finish last in your age group at that pace, it's just with such a small sample of 4 things can get wonky. No shame in taking a walk break up a nasty hill!

I've rarely gotten into conversations with people, though the 10k I did I did run with 2 other ladies for a while and we chatted a bit.

If you want to meet people running, a running group would be the way to go. Lots of running stores will have casual drop in groups, I'm going to one tonight.Oh my van supposedly has a tradition where we will stop randomly and start a dance party on the roof of the van so I'll bring febreeze I didn't know what that was, but google makes it sound pretty terrible, and suggests that you see a doctor immediately.Thanks for the advice, just out of curiosity, I thought static stretches are not ideal if you don't exercise? Shouldn't static stretch be performed after running? Maybe I am getting something wrongAnything for a couple bucksWhat's wrong with Vibram shoes?I always thought it weird that Vibram was successfully sued for this when so many other products (*cough* supplements) make what seems like far more egregious claims. I respect going after companies making unsubstantiated claims, I just don't understand why it was Vibram specifically.You used the word marathon. Are you referring to either the 5k or 10k as a marathon or is this a different race you want to know if you should do the week after another? If the latter, then definitely no.I'm not familiar with that specific diagnosis, but I am familiar with twinges behind the knee. I've always stretched out my calf and hamstring really well. As I understand it, those two muscles connect at the ligaments behind the knee. My pain has come from those two being tight and subsequently tugging and straining the tendon. So let's of toe touches and calf stretches would be my suggestion.Details, yo.I think Levins will win this pretty comfortably. Chelanga or one of the BTC guys could cause an upset, but Cam ran really well at Millrose last year, and seems to be in even better form now. If you like running, then run. You don't have to race to be a runner. In my experience, you will meet more people running rather than racing. Like others have said, find a running group!20 broken up is not nearly as bad as continuous.  4 months is more than enough time to prepare.  Most 1/2 marathon plans are 12 weeks.  If you live in a warm climate you learn a few things. Drink water over an hour before you run, try and be in the shade, pay attention to your heart rate, run with money for an emergency drink or with water, and try and run in the am or pm. It's easy to run until you stop sweating without seeing it coming. If it happens you need to find shade and stop. Heat stroke kills people. Be careful.I think we would. How many injury threads are like: "I doubled my mileage and added speedwork. Now my knee hurts. Should I change my diet?"Well you've got loads of time so don't over-think it. I'd say just work up the mileage for a few months and gain lots of endurance. Since it's only your 2nd year running cross I'd say maybe slowly get up to around 50 miles per week and hold that. Around May you could start doing some intervals (say 800-1600) and work from there.

It's hard to tell without knowing what you've been doing before or what you can run a 5k in, but this is a very simple plan to work with.

Work up mileage + slowly increasing pace = endurance gains. I'm incredibly jealous of that milage given that I pick up a shin injury if I try to run too much. You can definitely run a marathon.

ps. 5min km = 8min mile

10secs in km = 16secs in mile. So 60 seconds in km = 96 seconds in a mile.

So when trying to convert, work from 5 km / 8 mile. So if you're doing a 4minute km, minus 96 seconds from 8 minutes. IE: a 4 minute km is a 6min24sec mile. Or if you're doing a 6minute km, add 96 to 8min, which would be 9min36 mile.Thanks for the kind words :) I think I will stick to the plan atleast till SD Rock N Roll and then re-evaluate if I want to do the SF Full or Half !Awesome ! I hope to post something like this too later during this year :)

I am 148 lbs with a little beer belly !! I am taking notes from the thread on what to do and what NOT to do :) I appreciate your feedback. Thanks for the pointers, greatly appreciated. This is the kind of stuff I want to learn from Runnit. Getting wiser, one pointer at a time, I guess :)

As I wrote in the other comment, I will try to get stick to the plan but target the Rock N Roll first and then evaluate if I should continue to do the full or just do the SF Half ! So you want to almost double your long run mileage in a few weeks? Good luck with that. You may be a tad sore afterwards.Thanks for the input. Feedback like this what I was looking for. Now scared, rather very motivated from all the feedback. I think I will try to stick to the plan till the RockNRoll and enjoy the running and then evaluate, if I should target the SF Full or just do the Half :) You don't really need an "HIIT program". Just take one of your running days and make it a tempo run instead of an easy run.  Or a hill day, intervals or a fartlek or whatever.
First, well done on the weight loss. At 6'1", you could have gotten a lot worse than 255 before you decided to do something about it, so well done, there.

Don't worry about the place in your age group yet. There's really two types of runners - those who ran track/XC in high school/college, and those that didn't. If you didn't you are going to have to work really hard for a long time to catch up to the guys who did it for the past decade (almost regardless of what age they are now).

My first triathlon I was 6th of 6. A year later, I finished 12th of 200 at Chicago, and a year after that in the top 11% at an Ironman. You just started your journey - congrats on your finish.Even if you're an absolute novice, a 5k will not burn you out. Doing a 10k 6days later will be absolutely fine, unless you manage to fully injure yourselfYou shouldn't always try to run faster....Yeh I mean you didn't exactly fill us in with details but if you're already into running, then you can train for it. But as Yellow_guy says if you're not a runner but just intrigued by ultras then you're going to have a very very bad time if you try one in May.

But either way, the obvious advice if you want to do an ultra is to start running more.Maybe we'd have fewer injury threads if more people followed that approach. (Probably not, though . . .)&gt; (Leaving the house will always be the hardest part)

Not true. Source: myself. The hardest part is making myself head back home.What exactly are you worried about?

I understand a dreadmill for cold/bad weather training, but there will always be people faster than you. Part of being a runner is realizing that you just let out a huge fart at mile 12, spit on some spectator's shoes by accident and have snot coming out of your nose.

It happens.Paraphrasing Marvin, the pessimistic robot from the Hitchhiker's Guide: The first mile is the hardest. The second mile is also the hardest. And the mile after that is also the hardest. And the mile after that...

Or, as they say: the hardest mile is the one you're running right now.I once heard that the first two miles and the last two miles are the most difficult parts, and after a few years, I'm inclined to agree...Thanks, that's kinda the stuff I was looking for.If you start from zero.......YES!Yes, he ran almost all his races in shoes. For this particular one, adidas had fucked up and hadn't brought any in his size.Right/left is what they promoted in the 1970's and early 80's, but new scientific insights show very clearly that left/right significantly reduces injury risk if properly alternated (this last bit is kind of crucial though). In a study conducted among 6 self-selected runners, none died within 4 months of switching to a left/right pattern, whereas more than 98% of the control group (who didn't run at all and reported a partially sedentary lifestyle) had died within 90 years, and runners who kept using a right/left pattern didn't score much better, with an average life expectancy of little more than 80 years.I imagine your best bet would be to find a sports-related doctor in your area and him/her for a reference for a surgeon that has a good track record with keeping patients active.And maybe it really is two 9ish mile runs with a rest, instead of "20.9 miles". But I've been injured in the past from too much, too soon. And I've seen it happen to many other runners as well.  This experience has caused me to adopt a conservative attitude towards training.I'm competitive by nature too.  Racing is competition, that's what makes it fun.  Sure you get to compete with yourself but you're also competing with other people.  Odds are there are always going to be people in the race faster than you, but in that race on that day you might be the person out kicking some other random person to the finish line and knocking them out of 3rd place for your age group.

It always seems like there's a huge gulf between yourself and the 'fast' people.  The problem is the definition of 'fast' is always a moving target.  I ran (err hobbled) my first half-marathon in 3:15.  Everyone seemed fast to me.  Running a 2 hour half seemed blazing.  Since then I've worked my half PR down to a 1:23 (and a 3:15 marathon would mean something went wrong), but those 'fast' people are still there.  I don't think I'll ever crack 1:15 in the half (1:20, maaaaaaaybe), that pace just seems far too much for my old legs... but I'll give whomever is running near my pace a run for their money.Obviously I don't buy something whenever I'm helped, that would be ridiculous.  There is a big difference between that and what we are talking about though.

Try going to a LRS and, before you use their shoe fitting services, tell them your plan.  Tell them you'd like to get properly fitted for running shoes but, once you do, you'll leave and go buy the shoes cheaper somewhere else. See if they still want to help you.

Bottom line is the LRS provide that service because they are in the business to sell you shoes.  Not the business to help their competing online retailers sell shoes so, as I said before, you can technically do it but it is morally questionable.I placed in my age group (20-29) once, because there were about 4 of us in a local 10K.

Revel in it :-pWow, that almost sounds like the kind of gains someone would get from training.  I'm sure it's the shoes though.I see!..well I always mix stuff besides just water (electrolytes and some sort of calories).  I usually go on long runs and water is just not enough to keep me going.  I use a combination of Skratch labs(hydration) +Carbo Pro(calories).  But you are right, if you only put water in it you won't have any problems.  I really like this Salomon pack!Mirin' hard.

Just try that after college, kid...I had IT band syndrome which manifested the same way. Switching to minimalist shoes reduced the impact to my knees and helped some, as did roller stretches and other stretches that targeted the IT band. Even with all that I could only run on the treadmill for months. My doctor said in some cases a cortisone injection is required. So even if this is your ailment you should talk to a specialist.It gets easier every time you do leave the house. Good work :)Maybe I'm oversimplifying. It's been years since I did a relay race and I can't say I have a complete memory of how I felt afterward.Crazy as it sounds (and I'm bracing myself for downvotes), what you're doing seems absolutely reasonable so long as you keep your pace down and concentrate on simply completing the runs. I know a multitude of runner that started off with marathon runs but were cognizant of the fact that doing so at a high pace for a beginner would be disastrous.

TLDR; Maintain a lesser pace and focus on the distance.Not really that douchey. Trademarks are relatively limited. It mainly just means that another shoe company can't name their shoes the Biklia after they put their money into marketing it.One trend I have noticed is that running used to be thought of as having an extremely low or zero cost barrier to entry compared to sports like cycling or skiing. You just needed running shoes. Of course, you can still see [dudes in whatever they have lying around getting by just fine](http://i.imgur.com/QkvfX1F.jpg). But today there exists a product to satisfy seemingly every conceivable need a runner could have from head to toe, inside and out. Watches, socks, lights, belts, goos, sleeves, bumper stickers, magazines, bars, shades, rollers, race fees, headphones, underwear, outerwear, major motion pictures starring Kevin Costner, apps, and supplements get shoved in your face all day by the marketing machine that tells you what you need to wear to look like a REAL RUNNER. You identify as a REAL RUNNER, right?Wow, I feel so British. If I want people to get out my way, I'll normally shout "Excuse me" then thank them as I go past..yep. i have.  was in grand cayman on holiday.  a bit of diving in the morning.  afternoon on the beach.  easy 5 mile run early evening, super fast shower, immediately out to a bar with friends.  knew something wasn't right when we were walking to the bar but didn't think much of it.  standing there chatting, only a 1/2 beer in, got wicked dizzy, next thing i know i'm laying on the ground surrounded by people looking down at me.  the mrs. says i kind of mumbled something incoherently, went rigid and lights out.  one of the friends we were at the bar with is a local EMT, when we told him about the day at hand he was convinced it was heat related.Honestly, four months sounds totally doable if you don't skip training or slack off. Judging by the other comments, you're a cyclist so you've some endurance but running is definitely a different animal. I'm doing Ragnar too so I'm nervous as I haven't done a relay since high school many years ago. However, I'm starting slow with 15-20 miles a week and starting two weeks from now, I'm doing a 12 week marathon training plan. Honestly, just start and go from there. You won't know until you start running a few 5ks here and there and just build on it. Cheers. Fair enough. I think 20 miles is a long way to run AND feel good afterwards. To me, that's the key.You are right and I apologize.Well, OK. I don't think a relay like that is a huge deal for a healthy person.Such humble and great guys. Love to see them out there rollin through a sweet workout. While yall are at it check out nick willis's workout from last season where he runs then uses his baby boy as a weight during his core workout. What a great runner and father!I'm not worried about his lungs, though. I'm worried about the effect that running ~20 miles will have on his joints.That seems overly cautious to a high degree, if OP really is in good shape from cycling.I see. That makes a lot more sense.I passed !!! I gave it my all, and I passed. Unfortunately they didn't give us a time for any of the tests we did. As I said in my post, I think OP (or anyone else) can finish this in 4 months. But I think there's a high risk of injury.Great job. Remember to make a new thread every single time you run so that we can all congratulate you.When did you start running?

What has your training been like?Indeed! I own several pairs so I can rotate them through the washing machine! :DI think you'll be OK if you're fit now. Get up to running 5k 4 times a week and then start a 12-week half-marathon training program that ends on the date of the race. The mileage for a relay race might seem daunting, but it's actually far easier than running that same mileage all in one go, I've found. The toughest part about a Ragnar is holding your breath when sitting in the van that smells of B.O. for almost a whole day.in each case, the cartilage behind my kneecap was found to resemble "crab meat" and was significantly degraded. In parts, my kneecaps have no more cartilage. Microfracture was done to create a sort of backup but it's really not doing the job.Good job! Keep going!

(Leaving the house will always be the hardest part)I took 8 minutes off my half-marathon PB last year (1.34 at the age of 40) after wearing them for less than 2 months.

I've also had much less knee and ankle pain since I started wearing them - I used to get regular mild knee pain and occasionally quite bad and now I get virtually none.

I realise this is probably due to them forcing a better technique on me, and obviously they're not for everyone, but I love them.

Jeez do they stink, though :-)You really think a fit person can't finish a relay race with 4 months of training? I'm all for training properly but I think OP has plenty of time to get in shape to finish this event.The problem that led to the class action suit being settled was that VFF didn't have sufficient scientific evidence to substantiate some of the marketing claims that it made.

They could be 100% correct in their claims, but they didn't have sufficient evidence at the time they were made. Stair climber.  The real one.  You don't often see them anymore because of how much floor space they take up, but wow can I ever work up a sweat on the one in our gym.  Pretty much the only cardio equipment I'll touch besides the treadmill.Cool story.Good work, keep it up!!Sorry to not provide anything useful but isn't runner's knee really synonyms with Patellofemoral pain syndrome which doesn't imply tissue degradation?Dave's killer bread (my favourite) filled with almond butter and bananas is always good. Easy on the stomach but enough sustainable energy. Also, some natural turkey jerky is great. Protein bars are nice because you can have a few bites at a time so you don't get that awful stomachache if you eat it too fast. Also, SKITTLES. I know it sounds like a joke but they help settle my stomach and if it works for Marshawn Lynch, I think there's science behind it? Good luck! I'm doing Ragnar in the summer... No idea how I got convinced to join so we'll see haha. Cheers. Seeeee!....you can do what's hard!!! Keep it up!I typically wear dry fit shirts; short sleeves and tank tops.

I will try body glide! Thank you guys :)if you can currently run a comfortable 8 minute/mile, you will annihilate a 4 hour marathon, especially with running 75 mpw. even if your longest run has been ~15miles, your body should be prepped for a marathon after like a 2 week taper, since this is pretty much hansons' method.

with that said, marathon is a different beast and things come up over the back-end 13.1 miles that you never thought of, especially with nutrition.I don't know about you, but conditioning myself with Vibrams and with sometimes running barefoot has actually reduced my race times in sneakers.

You sound a little misinformed bub. You should probably take a lesson from the legend Bikila himself. Trust me, you can't randomly decide to run a marathon barefoot like Bikila did if you only ever wear sneakers. Try it, you'll injure yourself in no time. It takes some serious conditioning and strengthening of support muscles you can't get from only running in sneakers. Sure, he ran marathons in sneakers, but behind-the-curtains he put serious hours into barefoot/minimalist style training that improved his racing-with-sneakers performance.

I suggest spending less time reveling in sensationalist sneakers-VS-Vibrams drama and actually doing some research.Definitely! I am young, as well, (female, though) and assumed I would be able to push through. It's often too easy to ignore those cues your body gives you because you think you can tough it out. There will always be other days, other runs and other races. Listen to your body!I hurt just reading that It's technically correct, but not really suitable for this sub.Sorry for being vague. It's a little bit of both, in that my distance has increased and my mile times have improved. The more drastic improvement of the two is definitely in the mile time though. I used to peak out at around 7:30/mile, and after about three weeks of slowly integrating the shoes into my workout, I was hitting a reliable 7:05. I'm no speedster by any means, so that jump was enormous to me.Doable, perhaps, but don't just try to survive your first marathon, do well in it.

Look for a 16 week plan that starts at that 80 km/week level. Yes you can run more now, but a plan like Daniels, Hanson, Pfitzinger, etc... will require some speed work and you might not be ready for 120 km &amp; speed work. Dropping back to 80 km will give you a little more rest to recover from new speed work.Damn. This is crazy. Easily one of the worst scares of one's life. I'm a young guy, athletic, so i thought i was invincible running in the city heat. I now know better.TIL physical activity = taking steps&gt; my mile times have increased

Increased, or improved?

&gt; my calf-strength is through the roof

No kidding. My calves are the stuff of legends now.I must have the one pair of feet that Vibram had in mind when they designed these shoes. My chronic knee and back pains have disappeared, my mile times have ~~increased~~ improved, my calf-strength is through the roof, and I suffer no ill-effects of the shoes.

I get that they're an awful failure for literally everyone else, but for me they gave me absolutely everything I could've ever wanted out of running shoes without any of the drawbacks.

Edit: Clear up confusionThen he's gonna get there pretty fast.That's awesome mileage and provides a great base for a marathon. That said, it's almost impossible to understand the effort it takes to do a marathon until you do one, and not having put in the long runs needed to withstand the mileage will mean you're not going to have a good time. Kepe up the mileage, start a 16-week plan, do a marathon at the end of it and you might actually enjoy the experience.What the, what the. Your a brave man. I was kinda f'ed up a couple of weeks after. I couldn't sit down and watch a single tv show after, nor focus on work, or walk quickly. I'm just now feeling normal again. Scary shit.The worst bit is they literally trademarked the name. I love my Bikilas, but damn, that's douchey.They make morons who don't condition themselves and don't bother strengthening  support muscles in the foot/ankle* more prone to injury.

But sure, they do make you slower. I can always run a race faster in some kind of sneakers over Vibrams.Am I the only one around who genuinely finds them more comfortable than running shod? They definitely slow me down, but running shod tires me out much more quickly.I passed out at kilometer 36 of a marathon last June. It was a 35 degree Celsius day and an out of town mountain race where I had forgotten my hat at home but thought I would be okay without it. I am extremely fair skinned and haired and always cover up in the sun, so I don't know why I thought I wouldn't need that protection for a race.

I stopped sweating around kilometer 20, but continued on, chugging water and sports drink and stopping at every aid station for extra water. A medical team member gave me an assessment at kilometer 35 and gave me the 'all clear' to continue on if I wanted to. Less than a kilometer later, I passed out and fell down a small embankment to the left of the pathway that I had been staggering along. I definitely wasn't running anymore by that point. No major injuries from the fall, just some cuts and scrapes.

In hindsight, I made terrible decisions that day. I should have stopped when I stopped sweating. It took me a few days to recover with lots of rest and SO MUCH WATER. No lingering effects and I learned a lot about reading (and listening) to my body that day. Heat exhaustion is no joke. Take care of your body and always have lots of water on hot days -- in the summer, I always plan my long runs to include at least two convenience stores/friends houses in case I need to top up my bottles.This is great! Thanks so much. I think I'll aim for a base of approximately 20-25 miles a week (spread over 5 or 6 days) before I start the half marathon training. The trainings I've looked at start at approximately 15 miles a week and then top out around 30, so I'll be adding some miles, but that seems to be OK. I plan for most of them to be really easy miles, esp. since I'm such a slowpoke for now.

None of the beginner plans have anything like tempo runs or intervals, so I probably will mostly stick to easy miles for my first half. I plan on running some 5k races for run as I train, so I'm hoping to see progress as I tack on the weekly miles.
The problem was actually that Vibrams made it sound like they were *instantly* better, which if you believed could get you hurt if you put on Vibrams for the first time and ran a 5k. I had never done any minimalist-style running before, took me three months of adjusting/conditioning/getting stronger to be able to run a 5K in them.If you are putting in ~75 mile weeks, I'd say you are completely capable of running a marathon. This doesn't mean you'll get your sub 4 because I'm not sure of your race speeds but you are over qualified compared to some of the people around here who tackle marathons.Properly train for it. A marathon isn't just double a half marathon. It's a completely different beast.

Properly train, then blow a sub-4 out of the water.For actual running you definitely need some more thickness. I've been running in the same pair of mizuno flats since 2012, but I'll definitely look into the purrs when those finally fall apart. the thing is, I only feel the pain when I run. So during the four months, I feel nothing.Always following through! Quality .jpg!They only counted steps taken. I don't care about that. I care about the GPS tracking.&gt; just make...more injury prone

Only if you buy them and expect to run just as far in barefoot/minimalist shoes as in regular shoes.&gt; previously represented

I know, me too...I'm surprised they don't make one. I like the squish because I run in an urban area and find glass in the soles on occasion. Deleting this because you didn't read the FAQ or look at the sidebar.Me, 5' 7", a bit pudgy, age 44 at the time. I did something pretty similar and completed my first marathon. BUT: I was slow and it hurt. A lot. Especially after mile 20.

On the other hand, it made me fall madly in love with running and I've run three more marathons, faster and much less painfully, since.

As far as achievable, sure, I think you could do it. But set your expectations properly or you might hurt yourself. Paula kinda talks [about it on her website.]( http://www.paularadcliffe.com/serialisations-that-day/)Oh man! I was on the verge of blacking out after running a 50k in the dead heat of August last year. There are points at which I still have a hard time remembering bits of the end. Over the summer I had ran dozens of long distances in 80 and 90 degree temps but come race day I kinda forgot how important it was to pace myself and ended up all sorts of wonky after finishing. Erratic heart rate, dizzy, blurred vision, I had stopped sweating, puking up everything to the point of dry heaving, slurred speech, loss of motor functions and couldn't carry on a full sentence if I tried. Even a few hallucinations. Might have also been the tequila/magarita at mile 28 but I digress. Needless to say, I was an age group placer and didn't die so it was totally worth it.

My opinion is that if you are fine within a few hours after the race you'll be okay unless you have a history of heart issues. Then doctor, doctor, doctor. http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/relief-all-round-after-paula-pauses-on-road-to-glory-1-708248No we can't count this one. And I always thought she stopped to pee during that race.

**edit** oh, Paula...You asked for it.....

http://www.bur.st/~kim/radcliffe-posterior.jpgGood luck.  I don't think you can't do it in six months.  There is plenty time to get a half and a full in IF you really want to.  So don't be put off!I wasn't necessarily trying to scare you off, but if you can forgo the "instant" gratification the experience will definitely be more enjoyable and involve less risk. Plus if you're willing to put the same level of dedication into training for that half marathon in six months as you'd put into the full marathon you should be able to crush the half, rather than just surviving the full. Sounds harder than Columbus. I saw some other posts here about first time runners completing it though. I think I'll go for it! Thanks for your input, I'll keep that in mind.Try to convince a friend or two to join you. I don't run the same pace as my buddies, but going to the race together is fun. We can hang out, warm up together before, and they are usually cheering me on when I finish which is nice. Of course if you are the faster one, you have to do the cheering. :)These are wise words, OP.  As tempting as it would be to tackle the challenge, you will most likely end up miserable, injured, or both. /u/philthycasual does this count?

&gt; Elite marathoner Paula Radcliffe famously dropped a deuce in front of thousands of spectators.

Also, why have I never heard this story? Anyone have any info about it?I really wish they'd make a pure shoe with that same 4mm-ish sole thickness like VFFs. I mostly wear minimal shoes for lifting/non-running stuff, and the lack of squish is crucial.You got this! I'll see you out there tomorrow.Thanks ! Let me build up some mileage first, by trying to do a half and then a full. Thanks Much! I think time to re-do the plan and focus on half then :) I love my Vibrams btw, no hate there. Those things are bombproof. I only really wear them for lifting+sprints, but my ankles/feet feel a lot more stable now.

As for prices, I was almost always able to buy flats on steep sales, since few people bought them in store, while minimal shoes sold out so fast that you had to get them new, so I'm probably a tad biased.This is awesome, I haven't ice skated in years!Thanks ! I love Runnit ! Exactly the kind of feedback I was looking for. You guys are great !! Wow !! Maybe I should then just try for the Half ! Thanks ! Thanks ! This is the kind of advice I was looking for. I dont want to make any noobie mistakes. Maybe I should just look into running a half in July and then a Full in Fall ! No.  Your mileage is too low.  I have done a half-marathon while running 3 days of the week, but in addition to running I was doing about 6 other non-running cardio workouts per week.My understanding was that the problem wasn't that vibrams are *worse* for your feet but that Vibram claimed they were *better*. I mean, the evidence is shitty for any particular shoe. The running community has a long history of taking things with little to no evidence as gospel.That is very interesting insight. You make some good points. I'm right footed so I usually start with that foot first. DAE transition to left footed running? What are some good left footed running shoes for around $50?What you eat after the run is more important than what you eat before.I had the opposite experience.

Racings flats were expensive and fell apart after 2 seasons when they were being used exclusively for racing and a speed workout every other week. Meanwhile newer minimal shoes have lasted me over 900 miles, and a pair of (gasp) vibrams went for 2500 milesLiterally every boot I've ever worn in the army has had a vibram sole.Will Leer: Stud. Nick Willis: Olympic Silver Medalist Stud. Hell of a workout, especially at 7,000ft altitude

4 Mile Tempo: 5:08, 5:04, 4:59, 4:56

6x600: 1:39, 1:38, 1:37, 1:35, 1:32, 1:31 (!!!!!!!)

4x200: 27.6, 26.6, 26.3, 25.0 (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Unreal workout.Interesting read. Unsurprisingly, my advice is of course YES! You should race again. And everyone else's responses will say the same.

But I suspect we don't need to tell you...because for all the awkwardness that is the first race, I'm willing to bet you'll be turning it over in your mind, thinking about how you can do better, thinking about the excitment and nerves you felt before the race...


PS- When you do a race with more people there'll be plenty more people your age. And I too find that it can be hard to talk to people before a race, but I think that's because a lot of people are worried and focusing hard on what's in front of them. But if you strike up a conversation a lot of people are happy to relieve some of the stress and have a chat.According to the article he also ran his next race in shoes. Real talk: you are fucked.

To be really honest with you, this seems like a risky endeavor and I can't recommend that you attempt this race.  You probably CAN do it, but just because you can do something does not make it a wise decision. You are basically training for something in between a marathon and a half marathon. Generally, it is suggested that a marathoner have at least a year of running experience (at the minimum) and have been running at least 30-40 miles per week for 6 months before starting a training program. Lower-end programs max out at 50 mpw but 60-70 is not uncommon.For a half marathon, I think a program that has you running 40 mpw is sufficient to get you to the starting line trained.  So I think you'd want to be doing at least 40+ mpw.

Earlier today I was thinking about how an equation of minimum training volume=three times the race distance. This seems applicable.  A person can train for a 5K on just 9 miles a week. 18-20mpw seems good for a 10K. I think, as I said, that 40mpw is good for a HM. And ~80mpw will probably get someone through a marathon happy and healthy.

Now, a lot of people run races very undertained. I've heard many stories of people running half marathons on 20-25 mpw. Or marathons on little more than 30mpw. But I think that when the race distance becomes 50% (or more) of the total weekly volume that the chance for injury becomes really high.

If you are dead-set on doing this in 4 months, then so be it. I think your risk of injury will be high.  I can't emphasize this enough.  "Just doing it" should never be the goal. Completing the distance in relative comfort without injury (either in training or in the goal event) should always be part of the paradigm.If it was heat exhaustion/stroke, you'll be more susceptible to it happening again in the future.  You'll have to be doubly careful.As others say, achievable but just.

I'd personally be more comfortable with consistently higher mileage and more than one 20 mile run!

Do you feel you have to cross train?  Cross training can be really valuable for people who do high mileage and want a less stressful alternative one day a week but while your mileage is this low I'd be tempted to turn the cross training day into another running day so you are running 5 days a week and getting a better mileage.Brooks pure flow shoes are what you describe, but with a low drop, so not super flat, and some padding. They have a split between the big and the rest of the toes, but no pocket. Vibram has been making soles for shoes since rubber soles became a thing. I have always been a decent runner and in generally good health and when I see people who are overweight out there working at bettering themselves, it pumps me up so hard. I think I am probably normal in that regard, no one is judging or going to mock (there is the occasional jerk). Keep it up, and know that everyone you come across is probably thinking "you can do it!" And want to see you succeed!! I'm a fan of Petzl, personally, but beyond the basic specs, it's mostly just preference. IMO, if you want to go minimalist, most racing/XC flats are a lot better than most modern minimal shoes. I think most minimal models these days have far too much room in the toes, and not nearly enough durability for the dollar.

It doesn't help that race flats are comparatively dirt cheap relative to inov8s or Minimus or whatever.Vibrams were meant as a boat shoe, and tbh, the separate toes are pretty nice for that.

IMO, for lifting/running/fitness stuff, a separate big toe pocket and then one main toe box for the other 4 would be ideal.Dammit!Not what you want to hear, but if you've had the same pain for four months now, you definitely should be seeing a doctor and/or PT.Sprints work the quads, glutes and hamstringssounds like you might be a little biased toward your quads at the moment. Sometimes doing single-leg squats can help balance things, but some soreness/burn in the quads during sprinting isn't uncommon.All the data I've ever seen suggests that they're really pretty much equivalent, and whether minimal works for you or not is based upon your gait type and which of your joints is the most injury prone. I feel that it might be a bad photo. My arch on my right foot is much lower than the left one. Also I've had problems with my right foot a while ago when I was out running. Actually I had problems walking for a month because of my right foot. So I wonder if there are any good exercise I can take after. I was to a "doctor" that helped me with some exercises, most likely to make my foot stronger. But maybe there are more. :)Jeez, mention his name. He's only a fucking legend.

He's Abebe Bikila, twice Olympic marathon champion, the first great Ethiopian runner. And it's right that Vibram are sued, I hate when these companies appropriate a dead person like this.&gt; Do you think this is achievable?

Yes.  Emphasis on "achievable" or "doable". As in, yeah, you can "do" this...

&gt;Too aggressive?

Yes, times 10. Way too aggressive. This has INJURY written all over it.&gt;Then all of a sudden it just gets kicked into high gear.

Well, that's a Hal Higdon training plan for you: start out at like 15 miles a week. Suddenly: 20 mile long run on a 40 mile week!Let me preface this with I am not a lawyer but I do work in the film industry and deal with licensing alot. This is going to be a challenging case to win as his father has passed away and legally his legacy and name have been passed into the public domain. Meaning after you die anyone can use your name or talk about your life in or for basically anything as long as it's not deamed defamation or slander. Basically that means you have to be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt anything nagative you state about the person is true. That doesn't mean his son doesn't have a case as life rights are crazy complicated; but it will likely be an uphill battle. It's for this reason multiple Steve Jobs Bioflicks have been/ are being made one that acquired licensing rights and one that did not. They both are in the right despite some being upset that a film was made without the families permission. But hey can you imagine how difficult it would be to record history if we had to get licensing rights for every single person. And just to be clear any copyrights or patents do transfer at death I am only referring to life rights. But let me reiterate I am not a lawyer. I am a film producer who deals with life rights all the time; but that doesn't make me correct. This is just my understanding of how it works. I have a lawyer who deals with all of this for me. While I feel you should always have the families permission before using their dead relatives sometimes that's not possible; but that does not mean the film shouldn't be made. I will be interested to see how this case is worked out 4 months and I'm a cyclist mainly so I am in shape just not long distance running shape I agree. I really liked seeing Deena Kastor and Daniel Njenga in the first one, but wasn't very interested in any of the people in the second, and I'm sure I wouldn't know about the triathletes. I thought others might be more excited, though.Filthy hobby jogger.Over-pronation is an entirely different thing. Yes your feet are flat, but so are mine and a lot of other people's. Nothing wrong with them, you just might want shoes with more stability.Yeah, I really like the feel of light shoes with minimal padding but the separate toes seems gimmicky as hell. So, YMMV, but anyone I know of who has tried to speed up a recovery by doing any number of tips or tricks has found themselves worse off. The best advice is going to come from a doctor, but a slow recovery that leaves you feeling back to where you started is heaps better than a fast one that leaves you prone to re-injury.I was just referring to how your long runs stagger -  7, 5, 9, 10, 7 etc.  I understand the thinking behind it, just not sure how necessary it is in this plan.

Most other times (and even in a lot of Hal's other plans) the long run climbs consistenty, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, etc.

Back when I started running I used Hal's [HM Intermediate](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51132/Half-Marathon-Intermediate-Training-Program) program (but extended it by repeating some weeks) and really liked it.
I hope they do too. But I also hope vibrams stick around afterwords.  I don't have the money to hoard them at the moment.  Ha. I find that if you approach a Ranger style rely training like a half marathon, you'll be fine.  So you can use any appropriate half marathon training plan.

As for your knees, depends on why they are hurting.  If it is because you don't run much, run more.  If it is because they are weak, lunges are great, imo.

As for shorts, whatever you want.  The number of people who care is exactly 1 - you.  Nobody else pays attention.

You'll learn pace as you train.

Basic running shoes are probably a good place to start.Shoes: go to a good local running store and get fitted. How they look is totally unimportant. Buy the right shoe for you, not something for the ladies (or fellas).

Shorts: 2 inches is kind of a long inseam, IMO. I'd go with 1" or maybe even 0.5". Really, the shorter the better. The main idea is to be showing A LOT of skin out there.

Pacing: Assuming you are sufficiently sleep deprived, I would strong suggest keeping ahead of the lions. Getting eaten would really put a damper on your time goals.  Beyond that, stay in a "conversational" zone. If you want, you can get a heart rate monitor and get into HR zone training--some people have a lot of success with that.  Look up "Maffatone" and "Mark Allen" (he's a triathlete, but he had a massive success with HRM training).

Beyond that, you need to get ready to run A LOT.  You are basically training to run 20.9 miles, total, in a single race. One option would be to look at marathon training plans. Another option might be to look at half marathon plans, but really looking at higher-mileage pans.

Hopefully the race is at least 6 months away.  I don't know what your current training is like. If you are already running 3 days a week, then start running 4. If you are already running 4 days a week, then target 5. For now, focus on a lot of steady-state running.  You can use a VDOT calculator to help you figure what pace you should be running your easy runs. You might consider running one speed workout per week (I'd suggest a tempo run) IF you are running 20+ mpw. If you aren't running 20mpw, then make that your goal. And if that is the case, SLOW DOWN. Most lower mileage runners run way too fast in training.  Most running should be pretty laid-back and easy.I think he means what are you putting in there to drink. Electrolyte powders can make the bladders really gross really fast. I only ever put water in mine and then I rinse it out at the end of a run and hang it to dry with something in it (I use a wooden spoon) to keep it from collapsing on itself. I have used the same pack for many years and have never had to do anything more than this. Oh, good idea.  I will buy some flavored almonds at the store today, thank you.Perfect, thanks!Ran across this myself but thanks for the response.They probably do work for some people! They sure did sell a lot of them, and for that reason I hope the Bikila family gets a nice chunk of money for the settlement.&gt; That shouldn't matter on the shoes should it? Or is a more barefoot shoe preferable?

It shouldn't matter to the shoe.  Generally, you are going to get 400-500 miles on a pair of shoes, and if those are all 4 mile runs or 10 mile runs, it doesn't change much.

The preferred shoe is the one that you are comfortable and don't get hurt in.  For some people that is a "barefoot" style shoe, for vast majority of people, it is not.I can't speak to your shoe concerns, but I have made the transition to softer surfaces (for similar reasons as you, plus I enjoyed running on the grass!) and I will tell you that it might take a little bit of time to adjust. Your ankles and calves are going to be moving more laterally (side-to-side) than what you're used to. You might want to transition to a mid-foot landing, which is preferred over a heel strike- it's more stable and natural, especially on the ups and downs.That statement is extremely demeaning to the topic. These shoes do actually work for a lot of people. &gt; I've been relatively inconsistent

That is step one, be consistent.

For increasing distance, adding a mile to one run/week is a decent rule of thumb.  I.e., after you get consistent at 4x2.5, you can do 3x2.5 and one 3.5 for a week or two.  http://www.runningusa.org/annual-reportsWhat kind of shirt are you wearing? For me that makes all the difference in the world. With marathon plans 18-24 weeks is considered the optimal amount of time for a buildup, but this typically requires you to have a base of mileage already heading into it. My suggestion is to focus on a half marathon in July and then train for a late fall/early winter marathon since it'll be easier to train once temperatures drop in the latter part of the year.

As far as the plan goes, I'm of the opinion that consistent running is more beneficial than overloading on 1 or 2 days a week and that you need to be running at least 50 miles per week before you can be ready to run a full marathon without completely bonking out. Does anyone ever feel "in place" the first time they do something?  I certainly don't.

Also, it was a 5k in February.  Those are pretty rare.  The month generally has horrible weather and most people just try to grind through training instead of peak for a race.  If they do race, it is a "get in, get out" attitude to avoid spending time in the cold.

And yeah, male 20-29 is a dead zone.  Being competitive takes its toll on you, so guys who ran seriously in high school/college tend to disappear for a bit.  Other guys haven't realized how much those nights of pizza and beer have done to their body yet (you yourself are 29, so you are just on the early edge of the curve).

As others have said, if you want a true social running experience, find a running club to do training runs with.  Spoiler: you'll feel awkward and out of place the first couple times you go to one of those too.  I have one that I will randomly go to, and I still feel a bit out of place even though I generally lead the front pack through the workout.  I just don't know the guys that well yet.That's what I've been doing wrong. I thought it was right/left. It is true, I am extremely lustrous.I did something close to what you did, going from barely being able to run a 30 minute 5K to a 3:45 marathon in about six months using a very similar schedule. So yes, it's possible. It's also brutal and risky. For at least six weeks I was battling a knee injury, and with this kind of schedule there's no leeway so I just kept running and suffering.

So do I recommend it? No, not really. Do I regret it? Hell no! It was kind of stupid, but I don't know if I would have ever done it otherwise, and despite the difficulties I came out of it loving running more than ever.

So you have to know yourself. Is it worth the suffering, and the risk of injury (potentially permanent) to do it so soon?

As offensive as this comment is, it was also actually pretty funny. Begrudging upvote.30' is not too early at all. Seriously. I've been late once. ONCE.

Being at the back of the pack, weaving around people walking, not being able to warm up properly, not being able to go to the bathroom? All PR killing things.It's hilly! Going up to the bridge nearly everyone around your pace walks. After the bridge there are quite a bit of rolling hills in the park that will take your toll. Finally the stretch back towards the bay isn't that bad anymore. I'd download Snapchat for this!I'm in the same boat as you, but I do a lot of parkour so I'm doing additional cross training with rock climbing! (Not sure if that'll help with shin splints, though...)The Spirit of the Marathon 1 was great.  Spirit of the Marathon 2 was mediocre.  This Triathlon film might not be worth watching.Most of the posts I see are people asking if the pain in their legs is normal or what kind of GPS watch to buy... but outside of that I was just trying to compound what I've seen with other people's knowledge. I didn't know people would take it so poorly.Thanks ! Sorry but which Long Distance Cycling?
Is it for the "Cross training" ? I was going to look and research more into what cross training I can do to help me. :) :)

For the long distances towards the second half of the plan is from Hal's plan here
http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program

And that's why I wanted to get feedback from the guys here because you guys certainly know way more than I do at this point :) Thanks for your feedback. I am not too set on this particular race. But I know that if I "train for too long" I dont want to give up and loose interest. So after lurking around for quite some team and reading through some of the other plans. I thought that about 6 months should be optimum to train for a Marathon.

And then there's the motivation to run a Marathon before I turn 40 :)Heh, kind of my thought.  Through week 16 there are some pretty conservative increases (more or less). 10mpw to 25 over 4 months is reasonable.

Then all of a sudden it just gets kicked into high gear.

I say follow through with the half then be open to re-evaluating the marathon goal.

Also what's up with the weird Long run distance cycling? The mankini is always popular.  http://thatdingostolemy6pack.com/the-borat-mankini-debacle/&gt; Too concerned that it could otherwise be patronizing.

I've gotten two compliments while I'm running in my life and they both were giant pick me ups. The first was when I was really pushing myself, the second was when all I had was to just do it. That second one got me the extra mile. I hear a left/right alternating gait has been all the rage recently.I have no clue at all about this but I would imagine that in this particular case you can compare for how much similar elite sporters lend their naming rights to companies selling gear. Let's say standard practice is x% of net sales when then you have a base line number that you can apply.

See....if you read this sub all the time, you'd be able to pull some industry trends yourself by looking at all of the posts. Or, you could google and get some answers. Or, you could go to a marathon expo and see which booths are the most popular. But that's like...actual work.Little late to the game, but I might bee interested!

NE OhioJust wanted to highlight that first link. It's the best thing you'll read on this.

Consistency is the most important thing, then distance, then pace, then specific training plans.you could also look at the Altra one^2

they look like they'd flex a lot, and they have a very wide forefoot if you have wide feet

http://www.altrarunning.com/fitness/en/Altra/Men/one-squared-mensWelp, sorry. I read this sub all the time because I'm gearing up for my first marathon at the end of the month and just figured it'd be a good place to get a response from some marathoners. Apologies.You're welcome!Yeah I'm not sure what the deal was there.  After seeing you get filleted I just filled out the survey with "Obstacle races are retarded"I'd be worried about catching my head on fire.Honestly, at this point, no amount of training will do much help. It's possible it could help you mentally prepare, but there's a reason people take weeks to prepare for races. At this point you can just try and figure out what pace works best for you, figure out what works best with your inhaler, and hope for the best.This is right on the edge of what I would call achievable. Yes you can make it through it if you don't get injured, but with essentially zero base mileage on your legs, a 20-mile long run is going to be brutal, and that's entirely glossing over what the last 10K of the marathon will do to you. If you're dead set on doing THIS race THIS year, then good luck and godspeed, but if I were you, I would seriously consider training more over the course of this year and tackling the marathon next July. Respect the distance.I am the only one I know in my city that runs in the winter. I have seen a few people but I've never met them.

A weird anomaly about my winter running: I bundle up like crazy to run in -30C weather, but I have never worn more than socks and regular shoes on my feet. Obviously I'm very aware of what's going on with my body, but I have never felt the need to do this. No damage, no problems. It's odd.  Bravo! Keep it up :). To steal a phrase from a totally unrelated social movement, "it gets better" ;)heh... people were not such big fans of [my response](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/2vjems/obstacle_race_survey_xpost_radventureracing/) to this poor guy's schtick. An overwhelming number of runners today started from a similar place as you. When I see runners who are struggling on their first, or tenth run, I want to high five them, because starting is so much harder, and I remember.

I remember not wanting to go for a run, because I was afraid my nieghbours would see me leave the house, run halfway down the block, then start walking because I was just kidding myself.

I remember feeling like a fool. I remember feeling like every runner was laughing at me. Then I became a runner, and I realized they weren't laughing, they were cheering me on. That the only way to do it was to go through this, and that *this* was how someone becomes a runner.

Endure. And don't forget where you came from when you are the cute, bouncy experienced runner passing someone struggling to start.Easily digestible carbs and protein are what you want. Pretzels, chips, peanut butter, bagels and the like. I started running again too after years of partying/smoking through undergrad, then wasting away in front of a computer with minimal exercise in grad school. Trust me, my lungs know what you're going through. The struggle is real.

Some commenters have touched on the fact that walking-running in intervals leading up to straight running works best to increase your fitness. I will definitely say that is the *only* thing that has gotten me back to running again. C25K is an awesome program and it has completely transformed my fitness and breathing abilities. I'm just at the end of it now and will be running a 5k race in a week.

Now I'm not a  doctor, nor a marathon runner. But my best friend is a marathon runner *and* a doctor, and I will try to relay some info she shared with me when I started up:

Don't go too fast. Try to run at a pace you could hold a comfortable conversation with.

Breath using your full lung capacity. As you read this, put your hand on your stomach and practice breathing to the bottom of your lungs, to a point you feel your stomach rise. Apparently, breathing all the way down to the bottom of your lungs is something experienced runners just naturally do. Pfft. For me, I hit points where I have to recite a little mantra in my head to pace my breathing. (Breath in "twinkle twinkle," breath out "little star.") if you feel yourself taking shorter breaths, try to gain back control as best as you can. In my experience, if I keep breathing short it will only get worse. If you simply can't--rest. But don't stop pushing yourself. Be patient, and keep going! :)

Edit: Not sure if this would interest you, but I cross train with yoga. Yoga is incredibly helpful for my breathing, as you learn to move pose to pose based on inhales and exhales.Hey thanks so much guys, very helpful stuff!Make sure you take enough electrolytes to balance with the water you are taking.If you're not aware that it's Bikila's family sueing over the name it's easy to think that it's about Vibram hurting marathoners or something like the top-level comment assumed. It's kind of a shit title and not really a huge news story IMO.It's kinda wrong to characterize him as a barefoot marathon runner (it was a one time thing, he didn't inhale) but otherwise the headline is spot on and honestly pretty unsensational for USA Today.So I just checked my inhaler and it's Albuterol, which is a rescue inhalor for after my run if I'm not mistaken.I have a Black Diamond Storm, and it is awesome.  100% waterproof and 160 lumens is extremely bright.  I've used a lot of cheap headlamps in the past, but this has been worth every penny.bleh... I thought this was over something other than a name. Nothing to see here.Please take my short survey, thank you. A lot of it has to do with weight as well.  I'm a a bigger guy at around 235lbs, and I eat through shoes at a pretty good clip.  I generally get a new pair at closer to 250-300 miles. Uh, how?  It accurately represents the case.[Sorry, but a sweet name such as Throbbing Member has to be taken.]( https://wastecase.bandcamp.com)Especially if that place is approx. 3 miles away.Definitely don't be disappointed in your pace - that's a really solid first 5k time! If you decide to keep it going, all you can do is shoot to do better next time.

It took me until my 5th before I started feeling satisfied with my time, effort, etc.Sensationalist headline is sensationalist.I would imagine swimming is great. Even running in a pool would put less stress on your joints and stuff.Look up you tube videos on how to use it.  It really increases an inhalers effectiveness.  Most people use inhalers really ineffectively.I put a mix of warm water and dish soap. and use a sponge to clean the bladder. You can also mix warm water with a little bit of bleach (1/2 a teaspoon)Ahh, okay. It's all connected anyway. Still, the heat is nothing to play around with .Well, i guess i should be alright, still running, but very cautious of proper hydrationDamn I am in for a rough week. Lol But I need to do this, or it could be grounds for military seperation. It's only a few months old-ish. No more than 6 months.

I have a spacer but I ~~don't really use it~~ have never used it.. Yeah, I mean I enjoyed the experience of running in a crowd. I think my expectations were just skewed going in and I kinda lost sight of why I wanted to race in the first place (which was more about doing something 'special' once in a while to motivate myself to keep up my fitness and as a barometer for my personal progress). I had heard other people talk about all the awesome friends they'd made from running and expected that to happen right away, which was obviously unrealistic.

Going to go into the next race (bigger field), without the expectations, focus on running the best race **I** can and not worry about anything else.What're you putting in there? I have a bladder with the same design and just turn it inside out and rinse it after each use.. My understanding is that exercise associated postural hypotension is frequently misdiagnosed as heatstroke or heat exhaustion. Weird that it still seems to be a problem, though.

After a spring marathon in heat that reached 89 (after training over the winter and cool spring temps that I don't think got above 70) I crossed the line, took water, and then began feeling nauseated after drinking a little recovery drink. I sat down for a few minutes and began to feel much better. Some med guys asked if I was okay and I said I was but could he help me stand up. He jerked me very quickly to my feet which caused a massive head rush and I nearly blacked out. I ended up in the med tent but was fine. From what I've read and understand, I was suffering from EAPH not dehydration or heatstroke/exhaustion.Not really. I run early morning or at night on hot days, drink water, etc. But I've also been fainting since I was a kid, so I'm not that worried about it.Body Glide is amazing.  Any time I run more than about 8 miles I start to get in pretty rough shape from all the rubbing. Body Glide eliminates the blisters, chaffing, and bloody nipples!How old is your inhaler?  You might look into getting an actual nebulizer.  It will deliver the med much more effectively.  Or get so ething called a spacer to use with your inhaler.  Anyway, this sounds lime uncontrolled asthma/being out if shape.Being ridiculously out of shape, it is possible for be to be able to run a 2-mile in 19:36 by next week? Complete objective opinion.I think this is the perspective I was needing and you really just put the whole experience in context for me. I'm going to keep this in mind for the next race, just focus on running the race and let the rest fall into place as it may. Thank you!Goddamn. This is some serious ish. I keep a water bottle glued to me now. So no lingering problems though? I have. I have done it 30 minutes before, *and* right after I got back. Neither really helps.I would use your inhaler BEFORE you run.  You are having asthma symptoms.  Talk to a doc, there are multiple inhaler meds that might help more.Requests for free market research are an increasing trend.fuckin' kids. gott damn

Edit: This is facetious bitterness...Yeah I think I'll do an easy 2-3k warmup jog next time so I have something productive to do rather than standing around looking lost haha.Haha! That's sounds like a good plan :)

Part of my problem is I'd looked up some similar nearby race results (and this event's results from last year).. and looked at how I would have placed based on my expected 5:15/km time, and felt pretty good about it.  I never really adjusted my expectations from that 5:15/km pace and somehow magically expected I'd hit it on race day even though I was still running slow from recovering form the illness.&gt;I started off at a good pace, about 8min mile, slow pace.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you're out of shape. An 8 minute mile, though obviously not a competitive time, is actually a pretty fast mile for the average person. You yourself say having that time before was the result of your basic... why is it surprising that you can't run it now? It sounds like you haven't done any serious running since October. You likely feel like crap because you're over-exerting yourself.

I have no idea how PT tests work, but yeah, I'd say you won't be noticeably better by next Thursday.Racing may just not be your thing.

I have run almost every organized race I've ever done ALONE (save for relay-ing a marathon that my mom went to for picture-taking since I needed proof of my accomplishment for a senior project in High school)

I don't usually talk to people, and I just sort of do my thing. For some reason this experience is a rush for me.

I am decently fast, so when I get to the end I like to cheer for the other finishers (but once i hit the 20-25 bracket I stopped placing ha)

I often make a PR in races because the people around me push me to go a little bit faster.

That's why I like doing organized races

You may not find any of those things particularly compelling, or the other reasons may outweigh those potential positives.

That's totally cool.

My best suggestion is maybe to look around for a few more races and find out what past entry volumes were (how many participants in your age bracket?) and choose based on that.

Also you can't usually expect elevations on course maps, but if you do races around your town you can drive out and run the course beforehand sometimes (depending where it is, obviously)

Also, you could try talking to someone first! I say that, but I would never do it myself because I am scared of social interaction :PThanks for taking the time to respond with so much detail! This is really helpful.

I did recently get on Strava and joined a couple groups in my state, but haven't really found anyone in my area yet.

The running group nearby runs early morning, and I was concerned I might be out of place with the people there... but your experience is encouraging. I might give it a shot.I have! Doc told me to be careful running in hot weather, and to make sure I stay well hydrated. Scared the hell out of me. #####&amp;#009;

Depends on your goals, but that is plenty of training to successfully complete a 5k. But if you want to run a 5k fast, you are going to have to do more structured training and increase your mileage. Share your goals, and we might be able to provide some additional guidance.Breathe through your nose and keep your mouth closed, you will learn how to control your breathing. It's a bit of a training exercise... I was told this and never looked back, running just got easier! And when it gets tough because I go a longer distance or increase my speed I just remember to breathe through my nose and everything comes back into focus. Running can be meditative! I got into Buddhism through the Shambhala tradition and the leader of Shambhala runs and likens it to meditation, he even wrote a book! ( http://www.amazon.com/Running-Mind-Meditation-Lessons-Training/dp/0307888177) Still meaning to pick it up! He also has a interview on youtube if you're interested. :)  Ice skating!

Seriously, I found that it doesn't put any stress on the shins, but it also works all the muscles in your feet in a different way than running. I think it is only beneficial to switch it up a bit. And if you can't skate yet, you will learn pretty quickly. Also, the fresh air is great in comparison to an elliptical in a dank gym :)

I've really got no particular desire to do a race. Haven't done one since high school. I don't like running with other people, I don't really like crowds...   I've considered signing up for a marathon, but even that would just be because there's planned water stations. I'm not sure if I'll do it. I *do* want to run a marathon, but I might just go run one on my own when I think I'm ready.

Also, I'm not sure if a race is the best place to meet people. If you're looking for fellow runners, a running club might be a better way to actually meet them. At least in my experience, a lot of people are race-focused on race day. Maybe a "fun" race, as well, like a color run or a tough mudder, would be better.Do I like to race? I dunno? I'm fairly competitive by nature so I think it would be something I'd enjoy. But when the gap between myself and the rest of my bracket is so large it's not so fun. The next event nearby should be a lot bigger... I also will cross over from the 20-29 age bracket into the 30-39 bracket (which I've noticed has a lot more people in it).

I certainly wasn't disappointed that I didn't talk to anyone DURING the race, it was before/after. There is a running club in a town about 30 minutes away, they run on weekends at 7am. I don't really want to wake up at 5:30am every weekend, and I'm doubtful that there would be any guys my age there anyway.. so I would probably just end up feeling awkward and out of place again.&gt; I appear to be in black hole between hardcore runners and older folks trying to get in shape.

I'll also note to me that sounds like the majority of runners I know. Out of us all, only a handful are hardcore and competitive, and only a few are older. I'll actually be in San Jose at this time so this is applicable to me! I've only ever ran the Columbus Marathon though which was flat and cold. I finished at 4:05 but could definitely do better (I had some injuries). How hilly/warm is it in SF in July?You didn't say if you were male or female, so I'm going to assume male. Possibly based on your 5k time (McMillan projects that you could run a 3:10 marathon with equivalent training), but you will have to have a successful marathon training cycle, which may be difficult since you have never run a marathon before. I'd say your best bet would be to find a legit plan that fits your training style and to schedule a test half marathon 1-2 months before your target marathon to gauge your fitness. For legit plans, I'd suggest Daniel's (Running Formula), McMillan (You, Only Faster), or Pfitz (Advanced Marathoning). Good luck!:) Great post. We've all been at the beginning stages of running OP. I'm glad a fellow runner could make you feel like you belong cuz anyone making the time in any degree def. belongs! Makes me think of my etiquette in and out of the gym. &gt; Showed up too early I guess (about half hour), and stood around while people showed up, felt out of place and awkward.

I don't think this is too early at all.  As you gain more experience, you will start using a warm-up routine.  Nowadays I generally need about 30 minutes to warmup, I run the course once easy, do some strides, do 2 2-minute repeats around race pace, and then do some more strides.  I like to get done with this 15 minutes before the race starts. I usually to get to a race an hour early (more if I have to pick up a bib).

&gt; Noticed that of the males in the race the vast majority were either considerably older or considerably younger than myself.

20-29 is somewhat of a desert age group.  Most college age serious runners are not jumping into random road races, post-college a lot of runners lay low for a few years.  It's not until later in life that most people are forced or compelled to take fitness seriously, so you see a large representation in the upper age groups.

&gt; Didn't talk to anybody the entire time.

Pretty common.  If you're looking for socialization, you might just want to join a club or find some local runners to connect with on Strava/Dailymile/something and build a loose-knit training group.  It's easier than it's ever been really.  But make cold contacts at races is kinda iffy (I've never tried it TBQH).

&gt; Course map had no elevation listed and halfway through I faced the biggest hill I've ever tried

Yeah, not knowing the hills sucks.  This is why I run the course for part of my warmup.  However if you're not ready to run that much as a warmup, you can always drive the course, run it a couple of days before, or map it in software and get your own elevation chart.

I wouldn't worry about your time too much.  I think you're probably still coming off of illness and the fact that you could run 5:15/km in mid-January tells me that you've got better fitness than your time shows.  5k is actually the most difficult road distance to run well, IMO.  Plus the hill killed you.

&gt; should I even bother racing? I feel awkward and out of place.

You don't have to race if you want to, many runners never race.  But there's absolutely no reason at all for you to feel awkward and out of place.

&gt;  I appear to be in black hole between hardcore runners and older folks trying to get in shape.

To me that sounds like a pretty good black hole to be in.  There's no reason you couldn't associate with either group, if you desired.

When I started running at 24, I started training with a group of 50+ year olds.  They taught me a whole lot.  It's good to get different perspectives.  Don't write off hanging out with old people.

As far as the "hardcore" runners, for rinky dink road races no one is really "hardcore".  It may seem that way at first, but there isn't some kind of line in the sand that only certain people can cross.  Some people take training and racing more seriously than others, and you're free to go that route if you want to.  I've never seen a "hardcore" runner sneer at or be hostile to a "lesser" runner, either to their face or behind their back (not counting internet trolls).I think in this case it would be an estimate of how much the family would have made if they had some sort of agreement letting Vibram use the name.  Probably a certain percentage of sales.That is FANTASTIC! Soon you won't give a damn about what anyone thinks. Your confidence will build as you learn that YOU CAN DO WHAT'S HARD!  Seriously, the other runners/walkers out there harbor no ill thoughts towards you b/c they know how hard it can be to get started. Any asshat that makes a comment is simply an asshat. Congratulations on your first day out and here's to many, many more!!!Yeah, definitely not "racing" anyone other than myself. I didn't really expect to be competitive with the more serious runners, but I was a bit surprised that there weren't more guys around my level (there were 2 of us).

As for not trying.. all I can say is there wasn't really anyone who seemed approachable, and I felt it'd be better to not try and feel more awkward than I already did.  I maybe shouldn't have picked an event in small town for my first time.

You're entirely correct about checking out the course in advance. That is certainly a lesson learned.your position in the race is meaningless... you were 4/4 in your age group, if there had been 20 people in your age group you probably would have finished 18th or something, who cares?

The BEST thing about racing is now you have a barometer to measure your own progress by. Do the race again next year and compare your finishing time to this year. Running is measured against yourself, and the first time you race you have nothing to measure against so you have to look at the other people around you which is a surefire way to feel bad about yourself.

If you REALLY want to feel good next year after the race look up the finishing time of the guy who came in 30 seconds faster than you the first time, chances are his time wont have improved much and you will have blown way past him if you really put your mind to it and train hard over the next year. Then buy him a beer. Nothing wrong with showing up early for the race. Gives you time to do warmup, plus its nice to meditate a bit before and clear away everything else so you can get in to the zone. You're right! Thanks!Small winter 5k races are always like that. If you're worried about being alone convince someone to participate in the race and carpool. I would have pegged you as more of a crushed velvet kind of guy.I would like to see video of a 4-foot kid running 6 minute miles.  Would it be cartoon-like for his legs to be going that fast?Honestly you could probably run the whole thing without stopping right now.  2.5mi in ~25 mins gets you an average pace of 10min/mi which is just fine for a beginner's easy run pace.

BUT! since you are taking walking breaks it means your actual average "run" pace is higher, so just run slower at the start and push through some of the discomfort and you could probably run the whole thing through right now.

Aside from that, no increasing overall run distance will help your training - even if some of it is run/walk. Who said you can't?In my experience it eased physical discomfort and made the music in my ear-buds sound awesome, but it made the run seem to take *forever*.  It wasn't a good trade-off for me but I can see how a lot of people would enjoy it.EPO and blood doping help manage my stress, cramps, and nausea during my runs. Why can't I use them? /sThis is the prime example of a typical first 5k race. You feel out of place. You feel slow. You feel like you're not supposed to be there. What you didn't realize that there were other's in your postion too and you just didn't know it. There was probably an old guy who was doing it his first time because he realized that he's not getting any younger. You probably missed the timid young college girl in the back terrified that somebody may scoff at her weight or how fast she was moving. You probably didn't realize that those more serious runners probably know eachother because they are the only friends they've got because they've alienated themselves from having other friends. Think about how all the walkers felt when this spry young guy (YOU) passed them as they tried to finish.

I was in your spot too. Racing is something I do to keep the fire lit. I do it for myself. Everything that comes from it is just a bonus. I've made life long friends running 30, 40, 50 mile races and I've learned a lot about people in general by doing 5k's and half marathons. You are in a grey area that most runners find themselves in at one point or another. If you want to keep racing, do it for yourself or for a cause. If you'd rather just stick to going solo then go solo. Should you choose to race, remember that once your face become familiar in that circle you'll be just another one of the group. You'll get nods from others. You'll get pats on the back from the more serious guys and the older folks. People will approach you because you look like you belong. It's awkward at first. But after a couple of times, you'll fit right in.I run in silk. I avoid all peasant fabrics.Do you like to race? Some runners race just about every weekend. Others might pick a few races a year and focus on those. Some runners don't race at all, and that's fine too. 136 people is quite small; in a bigger race you'd be much more likely to have more competition around to motivate you.

If you want to meet people, I'd recommend finding a running group in your area. It's a lot easier to talk to someone on an easy run than a race where you're pushing hard for 5k.To be fair to the rest of the crowd, it sounds like you didn't actually make any attempt to have fun or meet people.

Also, you shouldn't consider it racing.  You aren't competitive and won't be for some time.  Consider it running a familiar distance but with formal timing, and aim for personal fulfillment.

Finally, it's not like you couldn't have checked out the course in advance (unless it was really a very poorly organized race).

I say, consider it lessons learned and approach your next one differently.This was what I guessed, cheers!The fact that you were afraid of getting teased by teenagers whilst running just shows how fucked up our society is. Why should anyone mock someone who may not be considered 'healthy' whilst they are trying to do something about it. Should I aim to be able to run the whole 2.5 miles without stopping to walk before increasing distance?Same here. If it'll be an intense run, I find the OJ is too acidic, but for regular running I love the sugar boostIs this going to turn into the next "Fast jogging will kill you" trend?Thanks so much. I hope I can just find the motivation to not give up so easily!some other movie maker did that... it was the one released online for the chicago marathonThe Flex is a cheaper version of the Free- the most similar would probably be the Free 5.0.The slower turns into faster on race day when you push it! Or during workouts.

The reason for running slow to get faster is to get a ton of time spent training in your aerobic zone. Training harder will give you the same benefits as well as a few more, but will also lead to injuries and prevent you from training as much. All those other benefits aren't nearly as important as the aerobic ones. Run faster only when you feel really good, won't injure yourself, and won't in any way shorten tomorrow's long easy run.Yes, your easy pace should remain the same.  If you have trouble maintaining it on your long runs, get a heart rate monitor.  Your HR may be too high.Nah- Vibrams are shoes with toes in them. Racing flats are minimal shoes, but they have other benefits in addition to being lightweight. They tend to be more "responsive", meaning they are rigid and give you better push-off.I got into running after I quit smoking and a few months later I started using Runkeeper. I used the app to post my runs to Facebook &amp; Twitter (I think its the only thing I've ever done on Twitter) so the world could see my activities. In the end, it didn't matter if anyone was reading those posts or even seeing them, just the fact that I was putting it out there meant that I had to keep going. I could "feel" the judgement from my friends if I skipped a run, even when they didn't say anything. The reality was, most of my friends had gotten sick of the almost daily running updates and had blocked them from their feeds, but that wasn't the point for me..it was that I was getting out and someone, somewhere may have been disappointed with me for not running.

So I did. I didn't skip runs. My calendar, for several years, was full of 4-5 runs every week. Most weeks around 20-30 miles. Minor injuries have slowed me for the last year, but now I'm healthy again and back to training.

TL;DR - There's something to be said for the social aspect of having a fitbit or using Runkeeper/MapMyRun/Garmin Connect/etc.Three or four times a year? That's a lot more running than I do. I really am a lifter at heart. However, I get what you're saying. Thanks for the advice man! These Asics have been pretty good for me since I've had them.Good site! Thanks for sharingYou don't need to make up the deficient in one day.This makes me so happy! Keep going - you are awesome for getting out there in the first place. They always say the hardest part of the run is getting out the door...

Every time I pass a runner, I try to at least smile, and every time I see someone working hard I think "c'mon, you can do it!". I'd yell it out to people across the road if people wouldn't think I was a complete loony for doing so.I eat zero dairy.  Dairy is not necessary.  Milk is for children.Eat sugar after running.  It is what your body is asking for. After your body gets the sugar it will stop complaining about food.[Body Glide](http://www.amazon.com/Bodyglide-Original-Anti-Chafe-Balm-Packaging/dp/B005L8YVRO)Also, check out /r/ultramarathon&gt; How do you keep yourself excited to run?

I don't. I just go run anyway.I make overnight oats. It really fills me up. Here is my recipe:

1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1/2 cup old fashion oats (do not cook them)
1/2 cup milk ( I use skim)
1 teaspoon honey
sweeteners (optional)
1/2 banana
1/4 blue berries (you can put any fruit in it)

make before bed and put in the fridge. This will allow the oats to absorb the liquid and become soft. This recipe ranges from 350-400 calories depending on what kind of milk, yogurt, and fruit you use. It is filled with protein and fills you up! I eat it about an hour before I run and feel great for my long runs.

Best of luck!
You don't have a breathing problem, but a fitness problem. Run slower, keep at it, you'll get back in shape, and when you do, the breathing will become easier again.&gt; Or is a more barefoot shoe preferable?

No. There's a sense out there among newer runners that the progression, as you get fitter, should be towards a more minimal shoe. That's not correct. I know some national class runners who train in pretty stout shoes. Nothing wrong with that.

The best thing I've found for preventing injuries is simply finding shoes that fit and retiring them when they hit 400 miles. Running is a relatively cheap sport, so new shoes three or four times per year doesn't break the bank. Plus, it's motivation to run more. Who doesn't like new shoes?Anybody uses other techniques or cleaning materias? I've heard of denture tables, baking soda and lime/lemon juice, but haven't tried them yetI love this post. I'm not the slimmest girl, but I've received nothing but admiring looks from other people when out running. One of the best things that happened was when I was taking a break after running non stop for 15 minutes (a major achievement), all sweaty and achey, and a bloke pulled up in a van to ask for directions. When he saw how dishevelled I was he laughed and said, 'You need to slow down girl!' It made me feel really proud that other people thought I was working so hard, and made me realise how far I had come in just a few weeks.Nice link. The only issue I see (and it is minor) is that it is not specific to running.&gt;  throbbing member

Just found a name for my new band! Not to contribute to a dumb holy war, but I get "more injury prone" but "slower"? Aren't racing flats and minimal shoes pretty much the same thing anyway? I don't know enough to give advice, but that's a cool video! Thanks and good luck.Your situation is very unique and completely understandable. But I have to ask, what are we supposed to do if all of our efforts to warn you (or anyone else) go unnoticed? It's not like we know you have an auditory processing disorder or that other people are deaf or can't understand us? I get that people have issues but isn't being startled just part of the deal if you choose to put yourself in a situation like we are discussing?

My original comment was targeted directly at people who are being completely oblivious of their surroundings out of sheer stupidity. I understand that people have issues but I'd be willing to bet that nearly everyone I've scared could hear and process just fine.

Just the other night I was running after the sun went down and in a dimly lit section of my neighborhood and I nearly gave an elderly woman a heart attack because she was dressed in dark colors and walking in the middle of the road. I fake coughed, I scuffed my feet, and I called out that I was passing and got nothing from her. So I ran to the side giving her as much space as possible and she screamed and clutched her chest. I apologized the best I could but she was the one being irresponsible should she have had a heart attack.

And then we have the headphones blasting people... *shudder*... those people man, I tell ya!&gt;A Boston law firm that has previously represented Vibram said Tuesday it was not authorized to comment on the lawsuit.

Just my opinion.We should have one for r/running that would be cool. The r/fitness one is too much protein powder pictures so far for my taste...
I don't know how to set it up either. Top man, that'll do me. That's what I do, but mainly because I'm slow to initiate speech and often during a run am not capable of speaking (because of my autism, not because I'm running so hard). So I just run on the grass around them.&gt;But try not being a prick for once in your life, you might just surprise yourself.

Still not being original I see?

You can do whatever you want champ.  And if you ever post something worthwhile I will be more than happy to help.  Until then, I'll stick with being a prick and you can try figuring some things out. I read that before attempting a marathon you should get in really good 5k/10k shape. I *completely* agree that you should build mileage first. I had gotten my mileage the year prior basically to where I wanted to be for the marathon (in 2013 I topped out at 70 mpw, and only went to 75 as my max in 2014), so I was pretty set on that front.

I think that when you have time, training in stages can be helpful--go from short and fast to long and slow over about a year, because the marathon-pace runs at 6:45 feel a lot easier when you're used to running 5:45s to train for a 5k. The training for any distance is basically the same when you're at an extremely amateur level like I am, so the 5k stuff really just counted as extra miles on my legs.

To be completely honest, though, I needed to step back from focusing on the marathon for a while, and I thought setting a 5k goal would help me reset. I ran ~18:30 in early January and 17:58 in April, and the training was a lot of fun, and left me very prepared for long tempos and fast-finish long runs that are the bread and butter of marathon training.Maybe she was unfamiliar with what that meant and thought you were telling her to move to the left, then to the right. I could see myself making that mistake back when I was sedentary (but had no car so walked everywhere) and was not familiar with the convention of alerting someone to what side you were passing them on. Consistency is key.  So work on that first, Do your 2.5 mile run every other day for 3 weeks.  Then add a longer distance run one day. Say

Mon |Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | Sun
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
Foo | 3 mi | off | 3 mi | off | 5 mi | off

or something. Stick with that for two weeks, then add another 3 mi run and up your 5 mi run.

That's a good start.
For now, focus on consistency and building your base. Generally, you'll want to adhere to the rule of thumb to increase only ten percent per week. Perhaps start with 4 days at 2.5 miles each, then start following that formula. As you add miles, you'll want to add differentiation. Increase the mileage on weekend run first. Once you're at, say, four 3 mile runs and one 5-6 mile run, you'll certainly be fine to begin a half marathon plan.

I don't think you'll have any trouble being in shape for a half in fall. When you're 18 weeks out, pick a Higdon plan that matches your base and go from there.

I  would also recommend some shorter races before then. They're fun!  See, this is why I love online communities - such brilliant minds. That's the pickle of public surveys, chap - I can't do them myself. I'm as entitled to join this community, politely request help and go on to browse the rest of the site as you are to jump on here and be less-than helpful, no? If you don't want to do it, don't. But try not being a prick for once in your life, you might just surprise yourself.


Oh. "Famous" to the general audience. It is sad that running this one race barefoot is the one thing most people know him for, and using his name to market "barefoot shoes" is pretty fucked up IMO.I guess the other thing I should add is that I've been piling on the miles lately trying to build myself up to a full marathon, or a ten mile ruck run. That shouldn't matter on the shoes should it? Or is a more barefoot shoe preferable? I can't imagine that makes a difference, but it doesn't hurt to ask. What made you decide to focus on a fast 5k first? I'm hoping to BQ sometime in the next two years. Currently I've run a 20:30 5k, 1:35 HM, and I've never run a full. Conventional wisdom suggests slowly building mileage then adding speed. What was your 5k PR before you started working on it in the spring?You might look at what you're eating in the days leading up to the runs that leave you with no energy, rather than focusing on what to eat immediately before the run. I sometimes go as early as 4:20 am and don't eat anything. These runs will sometimes include fartleks or strides and I don't feel any low energy because of my overall diet. Try running on an empty stomach. You just might surprise yourself. I am autistic and have auditory processing disorder. Chances are I will be oblivious regardless of what noise is made, and people saying, "On your left" and similar doesn't help much because I just hear it as a jumble of sound, not as distinct words, and don't understand what they were saying until well after they've passed. (I don't hear consonants well, so it sounds to me like "AH-ER-EH!" but slurred together, not distinct syllables.)

I hear people walking or running near me well before they get to me, even when wearing headphones with music on (though the difficulty understanding speech occurs even when a stranger is talking to me in a silent room). I always startle when someone passes or yells out to me. Not everyone who startles is ignoring the environment or even listening to music (I often wear headphones without music).That seems like a lot to eat only an hour before running to be honest... try eating whatever you normally have but like half that amount? Or just wait a bit longer (you can even go back to sleep between eating and running). If you really want to eat right before you run just have a banana, SMALL bowl of cereal, or small energy bar (clif bars are still probably too heavy).All good points that irk me too.  Telling people to walk on ice is kinda douchey though. If they are walking they could get on a bike or elliptical machine though since they are just doing some cardio and not really training. My old work had a gym onsite with the same problems. Walkers sucked there too, especially considering you could easily walk around the campus inside and have almost a half mile one way. No need to take up a full treadmill spot in winter with your weird ass form while walking. &gt;avoid cotton and synthetics

That's why I run in cableknits only. [Wool or bust baby](http://www.selectism.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/aran-sweater-2.jpg)I eat a Gu with caffeine if it's over 5 miles. If under I just run with water and eat breakfast after.First of all, gross. And B) that's Nike talking. Nah, you should have just realized that nobody wants to do your leg work for you. We  get a bunch of these posts from dumb-fuck "startup/app dev/ idea guy" people like you.


Be original for once in your life, you might just surprise yourself.
Asics skyspeed are dstrainer for neutral position. They are freaking cheap.&gt; Or maybe it was from a broken heart, I don't know.

I'm here imagining Chris McDougall crying in a dark room drinking bourbon while watching a VHS compilation of his old talk show segments.Sorry, I have a hard time responding when my mouth is absolutely full of Big Shoe's throbbing member.Hypothetically, say this survey was simply the catalyst to join the community? What - should I have flirted through a few posts, whispered some sweet nothings before penetrating with this? My b. Yeah!  I thought this was a new spin on the same idea.  Vibrams broke his feet so badly he _died_.  Or maybe it was from a broken heart, I don't know.When I see headphones I land on my feet a little louder so they can hear me coming. I run close to them and startle them on purpose. Should not be out and about with headphones on so loud you are not aware of your surroundings. That is dangerous. Never thought of like that, but you're right!  That's Brickell Key in downtown Miami.  It's exactly 2km in circumference, and makes for a pretty nice place to run.I just came to applaud your username. Can is a beast.It's sad how none of you suckers understand the science in *B2R* (that's what those of us in the know call it) yet you make fun of the barefoot scene. I'll just sit here sipping my iskiate, munching my BBQ mice and corn mush and chain smoke while you guys bow down to Big Shoe. There is no ideal way to breathe. Just breathe anyway that allows you to run comfortably. If you aren't getting enough oxygen, slow down.Congrats on starting to run again! I can't think of any reliable guides for breathing. Unless you are looking to become elite very quickly, or run the first sub 2 - hour marathon, what I found was the best for me was to run and try different breathing patterns until i settled into one that I naturally adopted.

As to actual, medical, breathing problems, I'm not sure. Amazing job /u/ohfuckthisishard !  Don't worry about pushing yourself too hard for quick results; you will get there over time.  Turn exercise into a lifestyle by making it something you look forward to.  ie, even on days you don't feel like doing it, simply get dressed in something comfortable and head to the park (or where ever you went running), before you know it you'll feel gross when you skip your daily trip.

Here's a little motivation from a person who says it a lot better than I can: [Terry Crews](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2u6hoi/in_the_recent_ama_with_terry_crews_someone_asked/)

Keep up the great work and congrats on accomplishing the hardest step!  Please keep coming back to share your progress with us! &gt; You should go for an odd number (3/2,2/3)

Interesting. I've never had a problem with stitches, but I could give this a try. I'm so accustomed to my 3/3 and 2/2 on hills I think I'd feel really out of sync with an odd rhythm, but I'm willing to try it. It's worth being aware you probably won't be the slowest there.  Parkrun attracts literally every kind of person, not just hardcore runners.  And the ones that do beat you aren't judging you, they're just grateful to be beating *someone*!If you've worn a hole in the insole, I'm guessing the rest of the shoe is pretty well toasted.

If it helps, I'm pretty sure the Asics Gel DS Trainer is the exact same shoe with a non-triathlon upper, and is a bit cheaper.  A quick look shows that runningwarehouse.com has both of those shoes for 70-80 dollars in a few closeout sizes.I'd look at the couch to 5k plan, which involves walking breaks between short, easy running sections.

Cold weather, sinus problems, and smoking will all make breathing more troublesome, but for new runners, the problem is often just that you're running at basically 100%, when you should be going at a relatively easy pace.  If you're huffing and puffing and struggling to breathe, you just gotta ease off a bit until you find a pace where you can breathe better.

Also lots of good info in the faq: http://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faqJust tell me where to send my dick pics, and I'm all set. Well the "Vibrams suck" lawsuit has already reached a class action settlement.Oh man! how great is it that you get to come to this community that you don't participate in or contribute to and get to badger us with all this free survey / marketing bullshit.

We're not your damn focus group and I hope you drown in a mud puddle. For anything 10 miles and under I don't eat anything. Just get up and go. For the longer runs I will have some oatmeal or a cliff bar and some coffee about 30 minutes before I leave and take some water or Gatorade with me. It's probably time to just buy some new shoes.  A year is a long time to run in the same pair of shoes, and once you're busting out parts of the shoe, it's pretty much done.

No need to switch up the model if you're happy with these ones (and I assume you are if you're still wearing them after a year).But but but but but but but but Born to Run!1!

... No, I definitely think Vibrams have been proven to suck, but I was all ready to roll my eyes at someone being _surprised_ that they suck.&gt; a guy who became famous for running barefoot?

He didn't become famous for running barefoot.  He became famous for kicking ass.  He was the vanguard east african distance runner, heralding an era that brought distance running to a completely new level.  Once he won gold, it was like the cat was out of the bag, and kenya/ethiopia just started crushing every distance event left and right, dominating everyone else in the world to an extent that no other sport has ever seen.

That he happened to run a single race barefoot because Adidas didn't bring any shoes in his size is a minor footnote.  It's only so well-known today because it's part of a marketing campaign.
Vibrams don't literally kill marathoners, they just make them slower and more injury prone. Duh.Expected this to be something ludicrous about how Vibrams literally kill marathoners, surprised to find it's a fairly legit claim by the family of an actually cool dude.I run daily, and while it's pretty much my favorite thing, no one's always super gung ho about getting out there.  For me, the trick to getting out there on days when I'm not feeling 100% yay about it is to change some variable.  Running a new route.  Or running something I haven't run in a while.  Or listening to music (which I don't usually do).  Or listening to a podcast (which I don't usually do).  Or running at a different time of day.

In your case, since you just moved, maybe the trick is to keep trying to find new routes near your new place.  What you've tried so far has sucked... maybe there's something else you can run?  Maybe there's a group you can run with?  Maybe it'll look prettier at a different time of day?Gotcha!You'll get better answers if you elaborate on what "hurt" means.  Shattering both ankles in a car crash is different than rolling an ankle on a trail run.About time. I've been wondering why this hasn't happened yet for quite a while now. Also, am I the only one who sees the irony of a *shoe* named after a guy who became famous for running *barefoot*? And that he didn't run this particular race barefoot because of some ideology, but simply because he strong enough to not have to rely on shoes, and preferred no shoes over the ones he had available at the time?Have a look at

http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/first-half-marathon-training-plan?page=singleNow kissYeah. Nothing drives the ladies crazy like the smell of week-old man sweat.

And yes, I am aware of the biochemistry.Numbers at the beginning of a legal suite are somewhat inflated, because usually you'll settle and usually settle for a fraction of the total based on some haggle of estimated odds of losing the suit. It's somewhat misleading for media to report the $15m figure without context, IMO.Definitally seems like you are overestimating the shape you fell out of. I had the same problem a few months ago.I have a cup of coffee unless I am doing anything over 10 miles. Over ten and I have a couple cups of dry cereal. I love corn flakes. Thanks for sharing. If I only had money for the trip, I would go there! Denmark - but I change between full lengt, 3/4 length and short tights, I just prefer tights to shorts.You need to tell more stories! We likey!The best training is specific. For example, if your 10K has hills, then you won't really be trained for them (especially running DOWNhill, which can be really rough on your quads).  Sooner or later you are going to have to get out there and run on the roads, so you might as well not worry about pace so much. For now, just run for time at an easy effort.You are thinking too much. Neither one is better than the other. I eat chews / chomps / jelly beans 15min before going, get dressed then run. Anything else won't stay down. Breakfast when I come back.This all depends on the person. Some people seem to think they need to eat and drink when doing easy 10-15 mile runs, others can literally go for 20-30 miles on little to nothing. Nobody can give you a solid answer about this because it varies so greatly from one person to the next. General rule of thumb is any run over 120 minutes you should be taking in hydration. Any run over 240 minutes you should be finding time to take in actual food. Personally, I do about 8-16 oz of water every hour (doubled if hot/humid), and about 150-200 calories an hour (300 calories an hour during races). This is zeroing in on my personal nutrition sweet spot. Then again, I run at least 25-30 miles every weekend and train for ultra marathons.I've been running for 4 months and I highly doubt I could do that! I am a well respected doctor and can tell you running it out can be very beneficial.

**edit** I don't know who would downvote a doctor, but shame on you. Also many times a slow easy run can really help to settle DOMS down. Yes, I get it now. I will do that soon. Thanks for the heads-up on this.I'm fairly new to remotely moderate training.  I started taking it more seriously last August (so, 6 months ago).  I'm just now reading the Hanson book for instance and learning how to train properly.  So, no, I don't do speed work at all as I was winging it and figured I had to boost my endurance for long runs before being concerned about speed work.  But perhaps now is that time it seems.
Thanks!Yeah, I think I do really need to slow down. I run by feel usually for 'easy' runs, but my calibration is totally off now, it seems. I feel great for almost a mile and then I feel like I'm going to die...Sorry for the double post, but the snapchat account is: r/Fitness. Take a look! In my experience, most trail shoes don't have all that much more soft-ground/mud grip than road shoes, and the ones that do are really only comfortable on trails, and mostly only in soft/wet conditions due to the luggy outsole.  If you want a fairly single use shoe, that might be ok, but I'm guessing you'll be just fine in road shoes.
YMMV, but I only run in my knobby trail shoes when it's a rainy, muddy, sloppy mess. Short of that I just manage a small slide or two on the wet bits in my regular shoes.  Some of it is just practice and technique.

If you want to look around though, the knobby trail shoes I have are often sold or labeled as "fell running" shoes over on your side of the ocean.  La Sportiva, Salomon, Innov-8 and others have a few models like that.  This matches my intuition.  I guess it's time for some proper speed work now that I'm "good enough" on long slow runs.  Thanks!Yeah, trail shoes are nice on grass, if it's steep or slippy.An apple.OK thanks I will try that!I have toast and a little jam, coffee, usually about a half hour to an hour before.  Never failed me.For sure. All easy runs should be done no slower than 6 minutes/mile. At altitude.220 minus age is horse shit. Ignore it completely.

Every week we get this question where someone used the formula and it didn't match up with their actual experience. As ofthers have posted, you have to measure your own actual max HR.Try a lube like BodyGlide or similar. I make my own. It's highly effective. It could be the muffins.

But think it is sleep. If you are eating dinner at midnight, then you aren't sleeping enough. Runners need at least 8 hours of sleep on a consistent basis.  And 9 or 10 is even better.  You just need to sleep more. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day of the week. That will make a huge difference.&gt; The pegasus is neutral, which isn't going to be stable enough for 80% of the population

I feel like that's a completely made up number.  If that were the case, the sales numbers for neutral shoes would be in the toilet.Look up hip flexor and see if that fits. If so, stretch!Oh now that's a good one!How are you still awake at all after all those muffins?OMG. Clearly. Corn is, like, so bad. When it comes to corn, I just can't even.I do everything in my power to not startle someone when I'm coming up from behind them. I scuff my feet, I cough, I clear my throat, I step on leaves and brush, I give as much distance as possible, I even yell "Passing on your left/right!". If the person I'm coming up on is completely oblivious to the commotion I went out of my way to make then I feel ZERO sympathy for them should I scare the bejeezus out of them. Period.That's a better question for /r/law probably! In this case, I would guess that the Bikila family could ask for a pretty large percentage of the sales of the model that used the family name without permission.a HUGE black wild pig, I saw it from a distance and thought well that's a big dog. After a while it went out of sight.

Then after going around a corner I was face to face with something like this http://www.sjamaanrudy.be/img/EverzwijnAttent.jpg. But it was more scared of me and ran away.Having goals will help, as well as just enjoying running.  Mostly though, not every run will be fun, but you have to run those anyway, or you won't be able to do the fun ones, or achieve the goals you set.Actually, an article in today's (Philadelphia) paper has the headline "That egg may be OK after all".  Apparently, dietary cholesterol is no longer a concern , according to "the nation's top nutrition advisory panel"

Of course, "nutrition science" is largely bullshit, anyway.  So take that with exactly 2600mg of NaCl.I'm a member up at the golf course so I know the rules and direction of the course. I won't be running over greens, just following the fairways.
Like i said up there though, It's often wet under the foot (I'm in England..) so perhaps trail shoes are the way to go?I have always wondered how they reach an amount that will relieve someone of "damages". Thanks Slacks, I did try running with my normal shoes but found a few parts to be a bit dodgy. Perhaps it was all in my head, but I was a bit cautious around a few areas - primarily steep inclines with wet grass/mud. I should note, I'm from North England so the ground is always a little... wet.
Would you say trail shoes are the way to go in my case?Just to be super pedantic, deoderant is to prevent odor. *Antiperspirant* is to prevent sweat. Most products combine the two, but it is possible to buy deoderants that don't contain antiperspirant.

That being said, sweat isn't really what makes one smell-it is all the bacteria. If this is actually a concern to someone, their best bet is to take a shower before the run and wear clean clothing (and avoid cotton and synthetics, as they are both known to get really smelly)

Also, there is only one way to complete a running-date: Burn and Bury.

Gotta assert your dominance, bro.What is the rest of your training like (i.e those other 29 miles a week that you run). Do you do any speedwork? Are you allowed to run on the golf course?

As slacks said though, any road running shoe will be fine as long as it's not rainy and muddy, in which case I can't imagine they want you on the course, tearing up the green.Why is this tagged Training?I'm not a doctor and all that...

If it is just actual DOMS...then running is probably the best thing to do because it will increase blood flow to the affected area and promote recovery.

But if it is joint/tendon stuff, then I'd be careful.  I'd also look into what caused the pain. One thing I think about is predictability. I can predict that I'll be sore in the days after a workout. That's classic DOMS--if you ran intervals on Monday and now you are sore on Wednesday.  But your "normal" runs should not be leaving your sore. And if you get a pain DURING the run or right after the run, then it might be something other than DOMS and you might want to go through the RICE protocol.I love this. My son is 7 and loves to run. He beats me at 5ks already. The last one he ran 24:04 and I ran a PB of 24:30 just trying desperately to keep up with him (I'm his mom). We also went to the USATF cross country championships. It was a very cool experience for him and he's determined to qualify again next year and be top 25. It's such a great sport for kids.I think the FIRST plan would be most effective for someone who already has a decent base. For example, if you take a runner who's been running 30-50 miles a week for the past 4 years...well, they might have some success with the FIRST program. But I bet they'd have even more success with a traditional program that had them running more like 60 or 70 miles a week.

Now, some might chime in and say that running less is a "good idea" for "injury-prone" runners who "always" get injured when they run over a certain mileage. Which I don't buy. If anything, injury prone runners will benefit especially from more mileage (provided it is done at an actual aerobic rate and not some junky aerobic/anaerobic middle ground).  You have to train the entire system to race well.  Yes, faster stuff is good, but, fundamentally, it comes down to putting miles in the bank.  The idea of cutting out all the aerobic base mileage and recovery running and just doing a 3Q (3 quality workouts: tempo, interval, long) schedule...I would not recommend that plan.

I think a lot of runners get excited about the idea of running a marathon. And while I don't want to dissuade anyone from following their dreams, I do question the wisdom of attempting a marathon on inadequate training. If you only have 3 or 4 days a week to train, then maybe focus on the shorter stuff. Longer isn't better. Not by a long shot. Heck, there are runners out there who run 100 miles a week with 22 mile long runs on Sunday and they never race anything longer than 10-12KM.  They might not run long, but they are FAST.Strava recently added a crowd-sourced race discoverer to their website: https://www.strava.com/featured-running-races?utm_source=top-nav&gt; Thinking of begging my boyfriend (who's a very good runner so I'll be a bit of a charity case for him! :P) to come out with me some time soon and help me with pacing and form and the like.

As a guy with a girlfriend, I love it when she asks to run with me. Quality time and quality of health/life all in one date.

That said, my recommendation is to ask him on a "running date" every now and then.Just curious, but where do you live that it requires tights 10-11mo/yr?I wear compression underwear under tights, for two reasons.

1) Tights seam to frequently have more abrasive seams than running shorts, and wearing compression underwear beneath them minimizes chafing.

2) I only wear tights when it's cold enough that having an extra layer of underwear beneath them makes me more comfortable.Regular, normal running shoes will be fine. Studded/spiked shoes are for racing. Trail shoes might work depending on how rough the terrain is, but you'll likely be fine with regular running shoes. I do a lot of my miles on a grass cross country course in normal running shoes.My only rule of thumb is to not buy white compression shorts. ... or white shorts of any kind ... or white tights ... or white swimsuits.  :)  I've had similar experiences (during the day) and gave up on "On your left!".  Now I just holler "Comin' through!" and let them decide which side to move to.  In all honesty, not saying anything and just running past is the simplest and easiest, but it does freak people out... for good reason.

My only other tip -- when passing someone walking a dog, always pass on the non-dog side of the person.I have a cheap Princeton Tec that's a few years old.  It works ok and takes AA batteries.  It's not bright enough for me to be comfortable on dark trails.  I just bought my wife a Black Diamond Icon for xmas and that thing is *really* bright at the brightest setting.  It also has the over-the-head strap to keep it more secure &amp; comfortable.  I don't *need* to replace mine, but if I did I'd strongly consider the Black Diamond Icon.  Definitely read the article on OutdoorGearLab.com linked above.Your heart rate doesn't "stay too low".  It's just that you've optimized your conditioning for long, slow runs and have been doing it long enough that it's not pressing your cardiovascular endurance.  The reason you can't sustain faster pacing for longer is because you haven't practiced running faster, or optimized your musculature &amp; cardiovascular system for running at speed.

I turn 38 next month and also weigh about 180, and run 40-50mpw.  My "easy" runs are at about 140-145HR, which usually puts them in the 8:15-8:30 range.  My threshold runs are in the low 150s and my tempo runs are in the high 150s.  I can sustain low 160s for about 3mi only, so I call that my 5k pace.  MaxHR for me is only mid-170s.

p.s. If you can sustain a "max" HR for a few miles, it's not your max HR.  You can only sustain your max for, say, 30-60 seconds.&gt; I don't like to do the "good job" sort of comment unless someone's obviously putting in a serious grind...

The motivation when you get that random "good job" or "go get it." when you have your nose to the stone when running any distance or race, in the last hundred yards... Sooo much adrenaline.Eat after.  Take an energy bar with you on longer runs in case you get hungry.Stability in shoes doesn't change your form, just how much you over pronate (which is more a biomechanical fact than anything, and can't be changed). The pegasus is neutral, which isn't going to be stable enough for 80% of the population. If you like nike, try the lunar eclipse - its going to be similar in terms of feel to the pegasus, but with a little more stability. The inspire really only has a mild amount of stability - the paradox is their high stability shoe. I'd play it safe and err on the side of stability, but hey - if it ain't broke - don't fix it!LolokI'm a student, so I don't really have a schedule and that doesn't help. I don't really have a time when I go up, and sit still a lot. That and depression (I think) makes for a bad apetite, and irregular meals. I normally eat pretty well, but eat fast food once a week or so, it's just nor regular at all. If I could sleep better I would eat better, but the running helps.Depends, what's your age/gender?I've been enjoying some OJ recently.Not *quite* funny enough to be that though.Read [this article](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Best-Headlamp).  Chock full of useful information (including how manufacturers lie to you about their battery life). It's just a small creek in William B. Umstead State Park in North Carolina.

Nobody has lived in that area since at least 1937 when the park opened. I am guessing it's just a meaningful place for someone who shared it with Lynnie.okay, i was expecting this sort og answer. I guess I'll either have to make room for more training or I'll have to postpone the plan. Thanks anyway.I to get stitches if I eat before so I just get up and run. Breakfast for reward.I always eat toaster waffles with coffeeYou have it in you! You just have to keep going day by day! GOGOGO!You're starting something awesome. You're at a point where a lot of us wish we  could go back to; experiencing how awesome running can be for the first time. Keep at it. It gets better.It's absolutely normal to land on the outside of your foot and this is not underpronating. Underpronation means that you dont roll your ankle inwards and push off on the outside as well.

When you feel like you run on a line, this might indicate low hip strength. Strengthen your core  and abductors by doing side-lying leg raises, glute bridges, bridges etc.

I don't quite understand the knee part, I guess your toes point outwards and your knee bends a bit outwards then, too? That's also normal if your toes point outward slightly.Soon, you will crave a run when you get stressed. The most constructive avoidance impulse ever!I don't have much else to do where I live that doesn't cost an enormous amount of money, so running is what I do for fun... Setting short term goals helps keep motivation up, and long term goals keep me going for the long haul. That said, I do it for fun so missing a run isn't the end of the world. As long as I get out 3+ times a week and my weekly distances keep growing inversely to my pace, I'm happy.if you keep up the routine over a long period of time and watch your diet too then you'l be like the girl you saw in about 1 year.That first run is in some ways the toughest but also (in many ways) the best!  Like you, I possess rolls of fat -- not as many as I once did, but I still possess them.  When I first began running, I was incredibly self-conscious about how I appeared.  Like you, I threw on anything that I thought would be "acceptable" to cover my body.  I did invest at the start in a good pair of running shoes purchased at a reputable store for runners, and I already knew the value of an excellent sports bra, but covering my body seemed essential for me at the start.

That was in May of 2013.  Then it got hotter outside in my climate.  At some point in August of that year, I just said, "Fuck it," and wore what was comfortable:  compression shorts and a short running skirt to cover, plus a short-sleeved shirt.  You know who noticed?  No one but me.  I was more comfortable and had better runs.  I felt practically naked that first time I wore compression shorts, but holy cats did I feel freer.

Like you, I have found more experienced runners to be wonderfully encouraging and (for the most part) kind.  There are assholes everywhere, but just about every runner I meet while running is supportive in some way.

I've been running for almost two years now and I still have weight to lose, but I am no longer self-conscious in any way when I'm on the trail or treadmill.  After all, I'm there to run, and running makes me feel better than nearly anything I've ever done.

And like you, my running friend, I teach.  Running -- knowing what my body can do now -- has helped with my self-confidence in the classroom.  I was morbidly obese once upon a time. Now I'm not.  Running isn't the only thing that helped me change that, but it has contributed significantly.

As others here have said, though, don't run to lose weight; run to run!  Running has become one of the great joys of my life.  This is something that surprises me, as I hated being athletic as a kid and I'm well into middle age now.

Congratulations on your first run and thank you for sharing your story with us!Side note: a 16 year old ran a 14:49 5k at the USATF National Junior Olympic Cross Country Championships.

That kid is going places.I've been relatively quickly progressing up from 5km to 10km and hit the goal a while back.
Ever since then I've had a pain in my left hip during/the day after running. The ache feels like it is literally in the joint...a very dull ache.
I took a few days off this week and went for a run this morning and whilst definitely not bad, a few hours later I can just feel it.
Any suggestions as to what it could be/how to resolve it?
ThanksOmg, without. I have been running pretty high mileage for many years now and I consider wearing underwear on s run nearly as ridiculous as wearing s fruit basket on my head. I suppose some kind of compression stuff is acceptable if you really think you need it, but regular underwear? Plz stpFair enough, I only have the CEP comp. tights:
http://www.cepcompression.com/dynamic-run-shorts.html
They fit like any other pair of tights.Are you from UC ?I love my Princeton Tec headlamp, but only for running. It says water resistant, but I wouldn't swim with itYou might not see this but you did an amazing thing by toughing it out and going for a run. I'm glad you encountered a girl like that, it's incredible what one small gesture can do. Sometimes I don't want to say things to people while running or at the gym but I will from now on. Keep on doing it, just a little bit of movement everyday makes a world of difference.You need to measure your max heart rate, or more safely and arguably better [your lactate threshold](http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/joe-friel-s-quick-guide-to-setting-zones), and base your training zones off that. Don't use that 220-age formula if you're even moderately serious about training.



Last fall I bought the Nike Lunarglide 6's and I absolutely loved them. My feet are quite wide and I still ran with a pretty heavy heel strike back then, so the Lg6's felt better than anything I'd ever worn before.

It was kind of heartbreaking when one of the shoes broke after only about 35 days and well under 150km which seems really crappy for a 130 pair of shoes. Something inside the outsole/midsole just popped up and now there's a hard bump on top of the midsole right at the ball of the foot, which makes it impossible to run or even walk in.

I went on to buy some cheap supermarket shoes with thinner and flatter soles which pretty much forced me to transition to a midfoot strike so I guess things worked out for the better.Keep running. Not to loose weight, not to be healthy, and not because someone say so. Run because you can. Losing weight or feeling healthy are just side effects of running. Healthy eating will come naturally, none of which  you have to struggle with. Sign up for a race to motivate you further. Eventually, you will find out that most runners do not judge you, a beginner...and this is when you realise that you are a runner. &gt;It feels good, but I guess it's the keeping-it-up that's the hardest so it's also intimidating because today was nothing compared to what's coming.

The thing you don't realise is that once you start you release all these endorphins (feel-good hormones) into your body.  After a couple of days they're gone, so you need to run again.  It is addictive, and as your mood starts to drop off, and you don't feel like running, that's *exactly* the moment you MUST get back out there.I eat very little dairy because I'm lactose intolerant. I can eat small amounts of hard cheese, but not milk, soft cheese, or yogurt. I drink lots of fortified soy milk to replace the calcium and protein. I eat tons of carbs, though. I would say carbs are essential for energy, but I know some keto types would disagree.Ginger nuts (a type of cookie). I let myself munch my way through one packet a week. I don't think it has any effect.Body Glide! Lots of starch, lots of veggies, some lean protein, very little fat. I typically eat a huge bowl of thick oatmeal and a banana for breakfast, fish with bread or rice for lunch, toast with marmite (no butter) in the afternoon, and veggies with potatoes/rice/pasta and maybe some tofu for dinner.

Honestly, though, I don't think it matters, as long as you get adequate calories.Personally, I'd rather not feel like I'm going to vomit. But I'm not anywhere near the head of the pack.I wear no underwear and loose shorts, but I'm female, so I don't have any need for support.I see your point. But the problem is, to find a better shoe (assuming there is one), it requires trial and error.

You have to spend time to go get fitted, wear it on runs, and if it doesnt work, you have to hope you don't get injured. If you don't get injured, you have to ship it back or go back to the store (assuming they accept returns). Then repeat the process.

 Or, assuming your shoes didnt cause any problems, you can pick up a pair and continue your training.

To each their own, but I've tried about 5 different neutral asked, with high cushion, and fell in love with the Brooks Ghost. I tried the 5's and they were wonderful. I tried some saucony's, and they were okay. I tried some adidas, and they sucked. So I tried some Ghost 6's, and they were amazing. So my plan is to stick with the Ghost's until they are no longer amazing.ThanksI think it's a lighthearted article to be taken in that spirit. The comments in the article were much nicer!Nuts. A good handful will give you 500 calories, and you will be more healthy as well.Point 2 is true, but none of my compression shorts have been meant to be worn alone (assuming you mean the shorts are unnecessary). Or:
1. Put on compression shorts.
2. Realize that the only people who will notice your manhood are people looking at your manhood.
3. RunM/28 - I run in tights of varying lengths about 10-11 months of the year, always commando!
When we occacionally get some heat around here, I run in shorts with built-in liners, still commando.
When I started running, I ran in cotton boxer-briefs, oh the horror, never again!  Even if you're slow or a newbie, joining a collegiate team is a really big commitment. I was one of the slowest on my team, which was an NAIA school, probably equivalent to a low D3 or high D2 NCAA team. My PR for the 8k is 33:42 (6:46 pace), which was generally in the bottom 20% of races I competed in.

While I did more for the team outside of the running itself, the time commitment from the workouts, races, meetings, etc all add up *really* fast. It basically becomes your life outside of classes. That's not to say it's a bad thing- I loved every second of it, and my teammates were amazing, but it's not for everyone. You have to love running as a sport, enough that you're willing to sacrifice a lot of your free time.

All that aside, if you're interested then you should contact your school's coach. He or she will likely tell you what to expect if you want to walk on, but keep in mind 10-15 miles/week is a long way from what you'd do. Again, my experience is as a slower runner, and I started around 30-35 miles/week, and maxed at 55. So expect them to tell you you'll need to run more and possibly get a 5k/10k result to see if you meet their standards.Wow, I love you and I love her! Someday, I'll get the courage to do what you did today and I hope to encounter a woman like the one you did. Until then, I'll be subscribed to this sub, gaining the strength to begin, as you already have.To expand a bit; there is no formulation that will cover the entire population, all the xyz-age formulations are based on small sample sizes, and correspond to an average.
Your max HR could be 160, it could also be 210.
Without testing it, you wont know.I only have 1 pair of running shorts that have the built-in liner, but if I could I'd do that always. Otherwise, I use boxer briefs which work great for me.I would see a doctor and see if you should be wearing a boot. I broke my metatarsal last summer and was off of running for three months and on crutches/boot for two. For some reason whenever I sprint I feel a burning sensation almost like a cramp in my upper left thigh on the right side. Not entirely sure what causes it, because anything less than a 90% sprint doesn't trigger it. Anyone have any idea what causes it, or how to get rid of it? Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong area.My own son is now 3. I would love to be able to run 5Ks with him in a few years! (Maybe not as fast as *that* kid...)Where do you live that you have a pizza island?I have no idea what your schedule is but as someone who was really overweight and not for as well, the C25K programme was amazing. as a friend of mine said: it's like it tricks you into getting fitter! Good on you for overcoming your anxiety and getting out there, your body and your mind will thank you. What a stupid article.

&gt; DO wear deodorant

Hell no. Deodorant is for preventing perspiration, but for running, I *want* that sweat.

&gt; DON'T spit or blow snot

I've been working hard on perfecting my snot rockets; there is no way I'm not showing them off.

And, the centerpiece:

&gt; How to impress the shorts off any runner on a date.

&gt; DO dress comfortably.

Yes. Yes, that's how you impress people. I bet anyone I've ever run with secretly admires my comfortable dressing skills.

Oh well, what can you expect from a self-proclaimed "relationship expert"... (How does one even become one? By going through a lot of relationships?)Thank God someone else remembers this quote.Not if you don't improve. BQ is around 3h these days and everyone I know around that time is well sub 19' on the 5k.It's simple : do in your marathon as you did in your long runs.Don't think there's much consensus there other than that running through DOMS itself isn't necessarily dangerous, but can lead to indirect damage when it impacts your running form.

My personal approach is this:

* If the soreness is so strong that I can't move normally, I'll rest.
* If it doesn't get better with running, I'll rest.
* If there is any pain that can't be ascribed to DOMS, I'll rest.
* Otherwise, I'll run, paying extra attention to running form.
* Additionally, if I encounter DOMS and it's not the result of an exceptionally hard run, i.e., I get DOMS when I shouldn't, I take it as a sign to go easier, and adjust my training plan.I'd say if it's a first date probably best not to meet just the two of you too, especially if you're running through anywhere not well populated. Always best to make sure everybody feels comfortable. This happens a lot to runners. Don't worry. Everyone on my track team has had the same thing happen. If I think I am going to spook them out, I just try to run really far around them...Very good! Consider this: you have taken the most difficult step: the first one. Now your perspective is the following...
In some time you *will* be fitter, you *will* be stronger, you *will* be slimmer and you *will* be proud of your achievement when you cross the finish of your first 5K. All it takes is just going out again and run.Agreed with everyone here. I'm training for a half in April and my plan was 3 months and has me running 33 k a week right now. Sure you can up your training, but you will injure yourself if you increase too much too fast. I guess my major reason for writing you was to ask what's the rush? I know when you first start off running you want to run every race and set goals and be impressive and whatnot. Many people I know who have run marathons trained for 1-2 years or more for just the first one. Couldn't you work on half marathon time this year then move up to training of a marathon next year and ultras the year after that? It kinds of seems silly to bang out everything in the first 8 months or so even if you could or should do that...which I would say don't. Log tones of miles. Run your half. Maybe run another half in 6 months or so and see if you can improve your time. Good luck! And happy running!I'm still over-weight, but when I finish a 5K or a 10K I feel like a super hero. I'm hoping that as I keep going, I'll be able to gain better control of my body and health and my own destiny.

I hope you will feel the same way I do about running. And I think we all really have control. Just by taking that first step out the door, you show your body that your mind is in control. Keep going!Yay. Fellow runners.  It bums me out when people don't wave back.

I run regularly and I do it in old t shirts and excercise compression shorts I got at target.  Don't be afraid to look like a hot mess.  I
Your username is glorious. Thanks, I think that may have been what caused my worry is that my HRM and watch   had my training program times in it. So I was constantly trying to keep on track with what it said. Trying to do 5:45 kmph and hitting 7:10 due to a hill was just freaking me out!

Suppose I need to relax. Just newbie nerves!Please never think of yourself as a charity case. If you think that's what your boyfriend thinks of you like that then keep running or anything and don't give up. You're better than that and you can prove it to everyone.I love My Fitness Pal! I save every recipe I make, so everything's already there. I very rarely have to search for foods anymore, take a couple of minutes a day and I know exactly where I'm at.

With a regular running schedule and consistent counting I've lost 5kg this year. So I'd say it definitely helps!At least in my experience, they help keep you a little more loose on longer slower runs, and it seems like it's better the next day.

So in other words it's completely mental and just my weird running habit.Do compressions help with recovery? Or is it just something that is more comfortable for you?I'm a regular smoker, and runner.  Not sure about it's performance enhancing abilities, but it sure can help motivate me some days.  Sometimes I'll wake up feeling lazy thinking I'll just take an off day, but then I'll have a toke and suddenly start to think "wtf am I doing? I'm being a lazy pos!".  At that point I'll usually proceed to lace up my shoes and get to it.  Yeah man tomorrow is the big day, and last night I didn't give it my all. When I reached the 1.5 mile mark , I wasn't winded, or gasping for air so I know I didn't push myself. Tomorrow I'm going to push myself , because it's do or die. Thanks for the tips. You might need to move a bit quicker than that seeing as how that would fail even the Air Force's standards which are the lowest between the three branches that do the 1.5 mile run... and this is coming from an AF guy.Somedays my fat thighs like to rub together and chaff, underpants help with that but then i get wedgies

For tights: Compressions
For running shorts: Build in liner, occasionally compression under if it's a cooler day and/or more of a recovery runstories like this make me love this sub.
great to see something so simple, mean so much to someone.

point to us all, a friendly smile, a nod of the head - just general positive human interaction can make a change in someones day.

somedays i feel so good i want to throw a high five, but then think that i am going a bit over the top....

OP - keep going, you wont get great experiences like this each and every day, in fact i guarantee you will face some really shitty days when you just want to give up.

Dig a little deeper, remember that smile, and keep moving forward.Yeah still majorly weird.1) Invent time machine.
2) Go back in time 6 months.
3) Care about the things you asked so you can change them with proper time and training.
If 1-2 don't work, learn your lesson and just do number 3.Good for you /u/ohfuckthisishard

I find nothing more inspiring than someone trying to better themselves and their lives, however that is. We're all broken in some way. As Leonard Cohen says "There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in"

Keep it up!
Just test your true max instead guesing. I am 37 and my max is 195. Try run cooper give it all and you will see where it bring you.It was about a block away from the hospital, kind of behind it. So, not exactly in the middle of nowhere, but still...Female here. I always go commando. Underpants=chafing, and there is nothing flopping around for me![starts to argue]

[sees username]

Never mind, good for you guys :-) Go forth and be tired.I've just moved across town, and at my old running track fellow runners always smiled or nodded when they passed. On my new route though noone will even make eye contact. It makes me so sad :(And it hasn't quite been that long:

But if I go out and buy pants, well I know what pants are supposed to be like. I can tell if they fit me. Nobody puts me on a treadmill and has me walk to see how the pants fit, etc. But if I went somewhere and tried on dress pants, had those pants tailored by the in house tailor, wrote down the precise measurements the tailor personally performed, and then went online I would feel wrong about doing so.

And my quibble isn't comparing two local stores. It was with the idea of using local knowledge and then going online. You will most likely find those same shoes cheaper online. And it is fine to buy those down the road. But that first pair, the pair they sold you and you liked and you want to go buy, those should come from the salesperson that sold them to you.Go to a physical therapist to see if it's just a matter of taking it slow, or inherent problem.

Also, high quality insoles (I love green super feet) help.Stretching, the stick, that's it. Calf soreness happens.Try running on it and see how it feels. Stop if it hurts and make it a short easy run so you don't get endorphins flowing and raising your pain tolerance.I'd only be concerned if you had other symptoms (heart rate is poor at adjusting up or down with increased/decreased activity, or pain, or irregular beats, or dizziness/shortness of breath, etc). Every heart is its own special flower.It's not good to smoke before your run or after, but otherwise it's not a huge deal. Tobacco - makes you slower. Marijuana - light usage has little impact.In a large local park, another runner, running with her cat on a leash. Oh, and in a suburban park in TN, a guy walking his dog by driving holding the leash out the window of his pick-up truck. Only if you are getting injured should you change you form imoYou can run long distance at a heavy weight. You just gotta go slow. I like running fast so I don't lift for hypertrophy. But one thing that's weird, it's a little difficult to lose muscle mass. For example if a 150 lbs xc guy bulks up to 180 lbs, even if he stops lifting it will be tough to get back down to 150. There's a tradeoff between strength and long distance speed.I agree, pretty foolish for a women to be walking out alone at night with headphones in so loud she can't hear anything.  Maybe you taught her a valuable lesson.  When I run at night I leave one ear bud out just so people can see that I'm aware of my surroundings.

I almost maced a guy once when I was running at night, I saw him walking towards me and then jump behind a wooden fence I was running next to.  I slowed down, honestly got my mace at the ready, as I ran past I noticed he had a dog with him and was just getting out of my way :-} nice gesture, just not a good technique I just started listening to audiobooks while i run and I love it! Thanks for the suggestion!Oh man, just seeing those flowers in the rain and the burnt out candle, it looks so sad!Hah, yeah, after a run last night my wife spent like 20 minutes on the elliptical because she hadn't hit her calorie goal for the day.I ran in them once for cross country in high school. Never again. Went commando and never turned back.I've got the "Feed Zone Portables" cookbook, they have a bunch of "rice cakes" recipes - basically put whatever you want in calrose "sticky rice" (I like eggs, chicken sausage, and a little bit of soy sauce and brown sugar) smush it together into a bar, cut them up and wrap the portions in parchment foil.Running in boxers is a recipe for disaster. Google testicular torsion if you want to know the real reason.At what point does mid run nutrition and hydration become a must? I am starting to get into double digit mileage on my runs and it hasn't been an issue yet and I read about it here and there. http://i.imgur.com/gPbEGQr.jpgMaybe wear shorts over your tights?  No one has to know you run commando, the only way they'd find out is by staring intently at your junk, and then they're the weirdos&gt; I am very confident  that muffins don't make people tired.

Pretty sure my boyfriend would disagree with you.

 &gt;  presumably dropped by an unknown number of migrating swallows.

African or European?I think running history and recent training done will help give better answers for this question.

"I've been doing some moderate training"

SpecifyLook up the Angkor wat half marathon at the start of December - awesome race

Nice! I've been hitting Subway about 3 times a week. I'm hooked on the turkey on wheat, double meat, no cheese loaded with veggies and brown mustard. Low cals and tons of protein. Don't look at the sodium though if you are watching that. I think you may need to focus on building your endurance instead of just toning if you're planning on climbing Ben Nevis!


It looks like it's a 10km walk with a 1.5km rise, and that most people take over 7 hours round trip. How does this line up with what you currently do? Can you walk 5km comfortably?  What about 10 or 20? Can you carry a backpack doing this? You'll probably need good, water, and some clothing (for when the weather changes).It's crazy. I'm actually pretty well-versed in nutrition. I have a pretty good idea of what macro-nutrients are in what foods, and what to avoid, how much you should be consuming.

But counting calories takes that to a whole different level. I'm been trying to stay under 1950, and I've been doing a pretty decent job, and I'm been dropping weight.

It's a lot easier to manage cravings when you KNOW that it will put you over your calorie limit. Makes it a pretty black and white issue that you can't really justify.Could not agree more! I have also done this a few times, and just as you say, when the logging stops, the effort (eventually) stops.

For me it's also important to step on the scale every day. I know I would get into a mode where having not been on the scale for a while, I would just not want to see the number, and so would avoid it. Soon a month, 6 months, year go by, and now you have to start over.welcomeYep! Same here. Its such a nice feeling.

This week i've been feeling so fat (week before period so im bloated) and yesterday i had to put on an old belt (that used to be super tight on me so i never wore it) and i had to put it on the 3rd hole! Felt great.

And about bras. I bought a really nice $70 bra a couple of months ago and its becoming too big. I feel so stupid now for spending that much money on a bra knowing that it would be too big in a couple of months.

But whatever, its all worth it! Keep going!I did Nutrisystem for a few months several years ago. To be honest, I thought the food was disgusting and I would dread eating my meals. The frozen meals are better than that shelf-stable ones but not by much. I couldn't keep up with it for very long. I found clean eating and calorie counting to be much more pleasant.AWESOME! I've started planning my meals out and it can be so hard to stay to the plan. Being able to see the calories (like on the bag of chips) can really help - I wish everywhere had the calories listed.Multivitamin and fish oil are the 2 that I take. Not really sure if they do anything or not. If your diet is decent you really don't need any. I recently convinced my boyfriend to switch to Jack and Coke Zero after he noticed the scale creeping up. He went from drinking 3-4 Cokes at a time, to a Coke followed by Zeros, to just Zero. Saves him over 500 calories on each drinking night.




Best would probably be if you could stick to sipping good whiskey straight though. I hit up [GDNF](http://www.getdrunknotfat.com) pretty regularly to check on beverages that I'm not familiar with.No, you shouldn't eat more. Your calorie limit is based on 24 hours, I assume.  If you're trying to eat every 3 hours that's fine, but staying up later shouldn't equal more calories. It should still be part of your "fast".  make sense?great job! I started at 386.6 and the first time I had been under 300, I weighed 299.6. It was a great day. Now I can't seem to get under 295 without rebounding back up to 305.I do the same thing. Also, if I'm so hungry that I know I'm going to give in, I go to bed early.GREAT JOB! Good for you!! Keep that good feeling going :)The treadmills in my gym face the weight lifting section so i just watch (not creepily) guys lifting while i run and it helps time go by faster.

Or listen to music with pretty interesting lyrics and focus on the lyrics.

But yeah i havent been able to run for more than like 10-15 mins without getting bored.Make sure you check your new TDEE too! It won't have changed a ton in 15 pounds but that's going to start affecting your weight loss as you lose more.Tears, man! WTG!!!This just happened to me too. I literally freaked out for a few seconds like 2 days ago when I scratched my chest a felt a big bump right in the middle. Turns out it was just my sternum.  Ahh. I needed this. I just had a salad for lunch even though I really, really didn't want to. I plan on eating at maintenance tomorrow so I pushed through because I need to stay on track today to reward myself with maintenance tomorrow.Oh yeah, I'm starting to find that oils suck.That's huge! Congrats.You can make your meals as elaborate as you want. Cooking is an art form that should be celebrated....all you need to do is use healthier ingredients and watch your portions better.Honestly, I don't think he's started his journey yet. Give him space.

If you were there with him, you could shop and cook healthier, and encourage taking smaller portions by your example. But you're not.

Feel free to share your fitness achievements with him, but don't push him. If he's like me, he'll push back, and end up in a worse position than before you pushed. Nice job!  I'm about 6 lbs away from the same post!  I may steal the Twoville, I like it. It gets easier. I'm rooting for you!!OK.  Well, if you consistently eat that, you should lose weight.  If that's what you want to focus on for right now, track the calories in the lunch you talked about and stay within your goals.  If you want to focus more on macros as well, eat foods that hit your macros in MFP.as someone who has been tracking calories the last 3 weeks and has failed every single day at staying under 2000, I like this post. I cant wait for the day where I finally stay under 2000, hmm maybe today?7 months... Thanks!Bud Light is the most popular beer in the American market, and a can of it is 110 calories.  I'm just using that as a measure.  If you drink 15 of those 4 times a week, that's 60*110 = 6600 calories just in beer.  By way of comparison, that's 22.75 slices of Papa John's pizza (large cheese), almost 51 servings of potato chips.

Put another way, I'm a 6'3", 200 lb dude.  If MyFitnessPal is to be believed, I burn about 1000 calories running a 10K, so I would have to run 66K *every single week* to keep up with your consumption.  That's over 1.5 marathons.

Every.  Single.  Week.  Just in beer.

Congrats on your weight loss, and I know you didn't ask for this advice, but "my friends do it" is a really flimsy excuse for binge drinking.MyFitnessPal (funchords)Start simply by logging and tracking your calories.  Worry about eating healthier after a week or too of just seeing what you normally eat.  When you do make changes to your diet, make small easy changes that you can live with.  Maybe instead of getting a bacon double cheeseburger you go with a cheeseburger and no mayo.  As you continue you'll find yourself wanting to make better choices.  Instead of a fast food burger you'd rather eat 2 chicken breasts some rice and veggies.  When I started I knew that pork ribs would have more calories then chicken breast, of course.  I didn't anticipate that pork ribs w/bbq sauce would have as much as 6x the calories of chicken breast. So chicken breast is starting to win when I make food choices because I don't want to be hungry all the time.  I still make room for sweets and snacks, just less of them.  I live and die by caloric limit.  For me my TDEE is ~1750  I try to eat 1350/day, 1450 on exercise days.  When I splurge I try to keep it under 1750 so I'm at least maintaining.

tl;dr   In the beginning you don't need to make drastic choices, you just need to stay within your calorie limits.  Figure out your TDEE and subtract 20% and use that number as a goal.To tag on to this, remember that your "maintenance" level will change if you lose a large amount you need to recalculate your deficit. ie if your body maintained at 3k when you started it might be at 2k now and you'll need to adjust. And congrats on getting under 300, keep up the awesome work!I find that when I stop logging, it's the first step towards a binge. It's like I want to pretend that food has no calories.Usually my routine is :
1st meal 7am, then 10am, 13pm, 16pm, 19pm, 22pm the last one and I always eat the same thing, and then go to sleep but for example, on friday sometimes my routine start at 7am and I go out and get to sleep only 3~6am, Shouldn't I eating something after so long?Logging now is so easy it's hard to imagine not doing it.  8-10 years ago, counting calories for me meant work, or meant eating the same thing over and over because it was a known quantity.  Having the whole picture in a single place, plus the ease of just scanning something into MFP and boom, no+effort=tons(insight).Well done on hitting the 50s, that's awesome! :D I think you can get to your goal weight no problem, especially now you're seeing the benefits for counting calories. Here's what I think, and I'm not a doctor.

First of all, we live in a world where 13 year olds are drinking morning espresso, and I can't get my head around that at all.

Second, I wouldn't worry too much about calorie counting, not at your age.  I would make healthy food choices as much as possible.  Eat healthy foods.  Proteins, fruits, and veggies are good building blocks.  Starches are fine too, but foods with protein and fiber will probably keep you feeling satisfied for longer.  Drink plenty of water.

Third, get active.  If you're going to be climbing mountains, you want to be in shape for that, but there are a ton of ways to be active.  Go for a good long walk around where you live.  Explore your town on foot.  Ride the exercise bike if you want to, but you don't have to.  Run.  Swim.  Do active things with your friends.  Play sports.  Make it a point to be active for a while every day, whether it's a game with your friends or a nice walk wherever you decide to go.

As you get older, life is going to be full of micromanagement, but now isn't the time.

I'm going to go not drink espresso.Come on 159 :D We can both to it!!

 I'm 5'2 so my GW is way down there in the 120s. If I can just get to 159 finally after all these years of yo-yoing, I'll know for sure that I can make it to 120 :DThis post has too little content  **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Floseit&amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2vo2ki/weird_question_but_has_anyone_notice_their_feet/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

I'm kinda hoping for the 160 plateau this time so I can push through it finally and make it to the lowest weight in six years while knowing that I had the strength this time not to give up! MFP spit that number out - a 1 to 2 lb loss per week puts me in a 1400-1600 range of calories a day.I truly don't understand why you would think you should eat more because you're staying awake later. If your deficit takes you to 2000, then eat that much.I've started doing a few push ups and pull ups to tone whatever muscle I've got, but I'm not going to bother trying to put on any muscle mass at this point.  From what I've read, it's extremely hard to put on any mass while still eating at a caloric deficit.  You can do it, girl!

Being able to forgive yourself is important.  It's unrealistic to think that you'll go the rest of your life never slipping or wanting to indulge for a special gathering - you just have to make the commitment to getting back on the wagon the next day.  The worst thing you can do is say "I failed today, I might as well give up."  Because the one day of screwing up/taking a day off is not what's going to destroy your progress, but the giving up definitely will.

If you're having trouble getting back into it after a few days of not logging, make a real effort to log your food *before* you eat it - it will really help you decide to make smart choices instead of just thinking "Oh God, what have I done" later.  And I find if I have my meals already planned out it squelches my inner Craving Beast.

Good luck!  &lt;3  If you use MFP you can add the url for the recipe into their recipe section and it will break down the calories in the recipe.For a second I thought I was in /r/programming, since the post works perfectly there too.Awesome!  My go to weight has been 160 for years.  I've always focused on exercise and random restrictions (no dairy, no grain, no sugar) but never on calories until now.  I'm at 150 now and plan on going until I can hit my ideal body weight, I'm guessing 135 but I'm 38 now and haven't weighed that since I was 18...
F38 SW 168 CW 150 GW 135Where'd you get 1600 as a number?  How did you make your plan?

*For weight loss*, calorie deficit is basically all that matters.  If you take in fewer calories than you use in a day, then you'll lose weight.  However, for nutrition, you probably want to make sure you're getting good balances of nutrients, which is why utilities like MFP count them.

So if your main goal is weight loss and you can deal with this a meal, then do it.Thank you! I'm blushing so bad this morning. Hmmm... that's a good question and honestly I feel stupid saying this but I don't really know.  My only main goals are to lose weight and stick to 1600 calories per day.  I don't even know what else I should be looking at...This just made me smile so big. Great job OP! It was wrong, but so so right (and it was my birthday, so psht!) Good luck!!That's one of my favourite things about MFP, and one of the main reasons I log every day - that streak! I'm only on day 96 myself, but it's still very motivating. Log everything as accurately as you can and use the bar code feature when you can as well. Good luck!!!This will sound crazy but I *love* butternut squash. Every so often I'll roast a whole pound of cubed squash and eat it all. The best thing -- it's 204 calories and 9 grams of fiber! Do keep track of the oil you use, though. I find that a tablespoon of olive oil + salt &amp; pepper is enough. Good advice haha I just feel like a water balloon with too much waterGood luck to you too!  The key is sustainability.  I know two people who have lost a significant amount of weight and have kept it off for 5+ years.  It's about making permanent changes, but ones you can live with psychologically. Do it buddy! im &gt;30lbs away from the 2XX's clubI prefer phoenix wings, buffalo style.Thnaks so much! I will be sure to check these things out. As others have said, don't eat back those exercise calories.

Drink lots of water and weigh yourself consistently (same time &amp; under the same conditions) so you can have as close to an apples to apples comparison.   Even if you do that your weight will still fluctuate a lot.  I can be 3-4# different from one day to the next even eating the same amount of calories.

You should also take measurements.  Don't let the number on the scale determine whether or not you feel like you've accomplished something.  You will feel the difference in your close before you see the difference on the scale.

Sounds like you have a good program/routine going, keep up the good work!I've been able to get up at 5:30AM for a pre-work workout for 3 days in a row now! I found that setting an alarm for 5:15, then 5:30 allows me to wake up and lay in bed for 15 minutes until I have to get up. It helps that I prep my food and clothes the night before. I feed my animals, blend my pre-made shake and go!You just reminded me of something I hadn't thought of.

I completely refuse to talk about my weight issues with my family or friends, although in the past I've trusted partners enough to get them involved.

My friends tend to make rude comments about overweight people. They make them casually and I think they don't realize how wrong that is and how much that affects people. They're not bad people. They are generally kind of compassionate, but they fall into that common place.

My family does not care about my journey. They care about the number on the scale and the size of my clothes. They want me to be thin, not healthy. They don't care about the battle, they only expect results. So I've completely stopped talking to them about it, for years.

This makes me think that the attitude of the person willing to participate in your journey is very important. I feel the OP is truly concerned about her/his SO. That's a good start. But is only naturally for us to be reluctant to share this with others, so it has to be done with a lot of care.I popped in here to mention bringing lunch to school.  From what I remember of the school cafeteria, there's only a few "healthy" options and the temptation is always going to be to go for the food that everyone else is eating if you're getting your food with them.  If you're grabbing lunch with six friends and they all get burgers and fries, it's a lot harder to be like "I'll be over at the salad bar.  By myself.  Getting the wilted cafeteria lettuce.  :("

If you bring your lunch every day, you can be the table-snagger for the group AND avoid the pressure to not be the odd man out.  Plus, you'll be eating what you love, not just choosing from what the school is serving for the day.This isn't a great question because it doesn't specify anything about what "healthy" means?  Do veggies and hummus have a ton of calories?  Probably not.  Is it enough food to satiate you for a long time?  Probably not.  If you add fruit in there, is it going to bump the sugar content?  Probably yes.

However, in answer to the idea that you somehow need meat or a sandwich in your lunch to make it worthwhile, that's not the case at all.

If you could give us some idea of what your overall food plan is and what your goals are, that would really help.  Try to reformulate your question.

There is no way to judge a single meal, ever. Nutrient timing isn't super important so what you have throughout the whole day is what is important. Also, your specific nutritent goals (how much protein/carbs/fat are you aiming for?) is primarily how you would gauge your adherence.I hear unicorn meat and veggies is the best :)So true! Being aware of the calories you're consuming makes all the difference.

I've decided that instead of giving myself rewards for weight loss goals, I'm going to give myself rewards for logging consistently instead. I love fashion, and I especially love ModCloth. I've told myself that I'm not allowed to buy anything from ModCloth until I've logged my calories in MFP consistently. So far, I have one more week to go and I already have my reward picked out.&gt; The problem with weight loss is that it happens so gradually and you're forever looking in mirrors to see if you can notice the change, but it never happens.

This is exactly where I'm at. Sometimes I wish I could wake up and be my old weight for just ONE day, and then switch back to where I am now so I can actually see and feel the difference.I think this is why it took me so long to get into any kind of food-related lifestyle change.  I couldn't imagine cutting carbs or meat or sweets out of my life completely - to do so would, to me, have been so detrimental to my quality of life as to make it not worth it.  So I just kept telling myself I would eat whatever and just try to burn it off.

People used to doom and gloom about the calorie counts in the stuff I was eating, but because I didn't know anything about what was "a lot" it was more annoying and guilt-trippy than informative.  My mindset was "Why are you shitting all over my enjoyment?  I've already decided that calorie counting is not something I can do and still be happy.  Quit making me feel guilty!"

Finding out I *can* eat what I want (just smaller portions and with a little bit of planning) while still losing weight was a total revelation for me.  And it's had the side effect of getting me to eat healthier too - not because I *have to* according to some misery-inducing diet rules, but because I can tell that some things are better at making me full at a given calorie amount, and I can *choose* to sub them in for the less filling stuff.Exactly.  My losses may not be a perfect 1.5lbs a week but the cumulative loss has been.  It's just so crazy for me to have it not be a mystery.  I've hit every predicted goal, not always on the exact day but always within a few days of the prediction.That's awesome!  :)

I set MFP as one of the tabs that automatically opens when I open Chrome, which is how I keep on top of it.  Even if I forget for most of the day, as soon as I sit down to check my email, it's right there, staring me in the face.  I log my calories/exercise, and then move on to what I actually meant to do.You're right, I should have specified while eating.

I'll do more research on the subject and get back. However, I would just be weary of cold water while eating. I feel like you're on the home stretch this time around.  Your words have a conviction.  Good luck and thanks for sharing what this experience might be like so close to goal.I think there's value in doing it now and also next week. Knowing how "that time" affects my weight, water retention, etc. helps me to not freak out when it happens, and feel good about things returning to normal in a few days :)...I stress-ate 440 calories worth of cookies at work yesterday...Awesome! I'm also 180 (5'9" so somewhat overweight) and trying to slim down 10 pounds or so. Keep at it.Yes, you can't out run your fork as they say!I felt the same way yesterday, but I remember why I am doing this, and what I want, and how that donut or whatever is just not worth how i will feel. Keep your chin up there are rough patches Completely agree. I'd never dieted before and just started on January 14. I've logged *everything* since then and lost over 6 pounds! It's amazing to see how many calories things have. My previous breakfast was 7 servings of cereal and 3 of milk, for nearly 2000 calories, more than my current daily limit in only one meal!I'm 20, but in college. The biggest challenge I see that you would face as someone in high school is not cooking your own meals. I would say that you should tell your parents about your goals and I'm sure they will be supportive. Attempt to count calories as best as possible and try to take your lunch to school. The FAQ is great and just browse this page as well as r/fitness and r/fitmeals to get a better idea of what you should do. My biggest suggestions are to find out your BMR and TDEE (google if you don't know) and eat at a caloric deficit. Good luck mate!Awesome!  I just updated mine today too!Thanks!I second this plus pita everything! You can put so much stuff in a pita pocket and take it to go, I'm obsessedA nursing class. I'm a versatile person.Kawrae :)
&gt; No more working my ass off and hoping it works.

THIS.  I'd tried exercise programs for a while here and there, tried to make healthier choices, but never knew whether it was working or how long it was going to take.  It's amazing how much easier it is to commit to something when you *know* it's going to work.  I agree with you completely.

The surgery might help, but if it doesn't go hand in hand with a change of mentality and lifestyle, it will ultimately fail. You can count on anything called a "calorie burning &lt;insert gadget name&gt;" to be complete bullshit. What is your username? It is always helpful to have friends for accountability! :)I reached my first goal weight (166 to 135) back in October.  At this point my weight loss had slowed to a crawl both because of my much lower weight, and getting bored. I decided to take a break and ate at roughly maintenance for 3 months.  Did not log or weigh myself often, and while I stayed aware of my calories, I didn't obsess over them.

My weight stayed stable the whole time, even over-eating chocolate &amp; cookies at christmas like it was my job.

I got back on track in January.  It was a little hard the first few weeks because I had gotten a bit sugar-addicted again, but now I'm smoothly losing at about a pound a week again when last fall I had slowed to less than 1/2 a pound a week.

Glad I took the break, and I'm *very* glad I've started up again instead of deciding to be happy with a barely healthy weight.  I'm 8 pounds away from my new goal weight of 120.What rolls down stairs

LOG FROM BLAMMO  But to me, that's why a lot of people that try those diets can't maintain their weight. They gain it back once they stop paying attention. Should you count calories for life? Absolutely not! But doing it that way has taught me how to be able to "eye" portions, especially with my veggies and fruits This is encouraging.  Brad Pilon's explanation seems sound but on the other hand, he hasn't weighed more than 180lbs his entire adult life so in a way I guess I didn't feel like he was 'qualified' to address what might make a difference to someone who has 130 lbs to lose, if that makes sense?  Thanks for sharing your experience. :)  And your vicarious cheesecake.
So you set activity *and* you're eating back calories, you're double counting. For most sedentary is the best activity level as the activity levels tend to overestimate and if you pick a level other than sedentary you don't also eat back caloriesYep, just go to diet coke. Cuts out a majority of the calories. I believe a regular Coke is 160-180 calories each with a 100 per shot of whiskey. so you are looking at around 520 each for a double tall. If you use Diet Coke you are looking at 200 each.Yeah, this is the first time in dozens of attempts of logging that I've logged everything and stayed under my calorie target for more than a day. Day 4 at 1800 cals plus p90x3 and its amazing how much easier it is if you have a plan and stick to it. Logging is awesome, knowing how much I packed for breakfast lunch and snacks makes dinner an easy decision. I even had enough for dessert last night which blew my mind. Logging is the best!Downloaded, and on my homescreenMy boyfriend and I recently went for the weight loss together and we are seeing some progress. It's really something you have to think of as a lifestyle change and not a diet - if you keep saying diet, you keep thinking temporary and it needs to be permanent in your mind so you can stick with it.

We cut out bread and sugars entirely. Now that's extreme but super effective right now - we are both down over 10 pounds in a month. We have definitely had cheat meals though, but overall we look at a meal and say ok I need a lot of veggies and some meat, anything else is a cheat.

Clean out all the temptations from your fridge and pantry, make it easier to eat healthy than to eat unhealthy, do a cooking class together or something! Or really I know there are a ton of recipes out there that if you follow, you will be able to do! Feel free to PM me if you have any questions on how to cook something - I love cooking and have really just gotten into it in the past year or so

I will get downvoted for this probably but take a look at the Paleo diet, it is pretty restrictive but the basis of it is good to keep in mind - Veggies are number 1, then meat, then fat. I'm happy to send over some recipes for tasty vegetables, they can be hard to adjust to at first for sure. I've recently done this as well.  At 295 now.  Started at 320.

Can confirm, used my fitness pal and strive for around 1880 calories or less per day.

Took me 2 months.When I was training for a longer race, having a fuel belt (belt with water bottles and a pocket for a snack) was really helpful.
I browse [sparkpeople](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/)Congrats! Damn it feels good to hit certain milestones like that!He whines about how his feet hurt from walking... because his license was suspended from double homicide. He wants us to ignore the fact that he killed two people and sympathize with his little feetsies. That's pathetic. He complains MULTIPLE TIMES about how his feet hurt after mentioning the killing of two people ONCE. He killed two people, which is no big deal, but his fucking feet hurt and he needs to tell people how much they hurt. He brags about how far he walked to work, but are the people he murdered complaining about their walks to work? No, because they can't walk, or complain, or see their families, or breathe, or taste, or love. They're dead. He killed them both and took everything from them, then complained about how that double homicide led to foot pain for him.Thanks,

I think accountability is going to help with me, I'm going to try to be active on LoseIt and other related subbreddits. Maybe the pressure of putting up progress pics will help motivate.

Speaking of motivation, I don't know if anyone else has tried this but when I went on a little health binge about a year ago, I would listen to these playlists of motivational speeches (e.g. http://8tracks.com/mrtalented/motivational-speeches) and it kind of got me in a positive mind set enough to workout and eat healthy everyday. Rather than listening to music during working out I would listen to these. If you can't find them on a music app try Youtube or something and search "motivational speeches" Some of them put a chill down my spine.
I completely agree with this! There have been days where I ate complete garbage but logged everything and it really put things into perspective! I would look back and usually it wouldn't be as bad as my mind cracked it up to be. Log4lyfe lolthat's great! It's amazing news. Nothing like a this to keep you going. Feeling good about what you are doing is the best motivation. I'm not saying he can't make up for it elsewhere or that he can't drink.  What I'm saying is that consuming 3500 calories over maintenance of Jack, Coke, broccoli, or pure unicorn meat will cause you to gain a pound, more or less.  The balancing act is for everyone else to figure out.  I mean, hell, I eat fast food a couple of times a week.  We all make our choices. Burning off 1 pound a week *without* a vest is really pretty easy work for most people. Even if this works I feel like the sort of person who buys it will just eat back those extra calories thinking they found a good deal. I'd rather be comfortable and warm for 2 hours and just sacrifice eating a bearclaw each day. I realized this morning that my jeans are quite loose around my waist, and went to cinch my belt enough... and ran out of holes.

Gonna need a new belt soon, and probably new pants.Hey this inspired me to go check on my day count on MFP and I'm on day 213! I feel exactly the same way, I don't know if I'll ever stop logging. Once I hit my goal weight my maintenance calories is 1500 (if I don't work out) and I've sort of just accepted that counting my calories will most likely be a permanent part of my life. Congrats!! I hit the 160 wall, too. I know in the past I've not passed it because I was content with where I was and didn't want to put in the effort to go further. But I weighed 160.8 this morning and I am not content! I will reach my goal! And I'm totally looking forward to your post when you finally see 159, too :):-) cheersDon't give up this time. Keep going. You can do this. Everybody hits a plateau - maybe yours won't be 160 this time. Who knows? But you can get through it. Come here for support. You're at 168 - that's awesome! Sorry about the cat pee...maybe store this scale off the floor :)Even if it ends up burning more calories, you'll just feel hungrier and thus eat more.Great job!I'm just saying, you said he was atoning for what he did. Nowhere did he say he atoned for it, or felt bad, or did anything for the families, or anything other than how it affected him legally. There's no reason to assume he even thinks he did anything wrong, based on his post, so I'm not sure why you say atonement is any part of this. His tone suggests the opposite.I had no idea about water retention from weight training, thanks so much for the tip!Me too! It's already helping me out a lot. :)I agree, it's a mental game. And I also feel like doing stupid food things when I'm feeling upset. Sometimes I just power through it which makes me usually in a worse mood, or I have a small fun snack which is usually enough and cheers me up a little. But it's a tightrope walk. So easy to turn 1 small snack into 10.

Let's hope we all kick February's ass!On MFP I selected 'Lightly Active' and it tell me 1,690 is how many calories to consume to lose 1.5 pounds/ week. What do I have to be afraid of? Shit that'll fuck up that meat-covered skeleton.Same here, McDonald's and just shit food every day, as long as its under 1500 I go down. Its awesome , other than being hungry a lot. All I can find on the subject is that cold water can disrupt digestion if you drink while you eat. The reasoning is that the water will pass through quickly, flushing out digestive enzymes along with it.

In terms of temperature, it says that cold water slows down digestion, but I'm not sure exactly what this means.

High fiber foods are said to digest slowly and help with satiety and avoiding overeating. This is perceived as a good thing.

Also, does "slower digestion" equate to "slower metabolism?" I'm not sure that these two things are linked at all. I've tried working out and stuff, unfortunately I think I need to start slow. So I've actually JUST downloaded MyFitnessPal and it seems to be helping a lot, eating about 1300 calories a day. And trying to work out as much as possible. Also trying to eat less rice,potatoes,bread and all that stuff. I hope you don't mind but I've decided that you'll be my inspiration!

I'll be following you and rooting for you! Thanks for the tip on the FAQ btw!
This is pretty much what happened. I was heading to work on the interstate and another car slid on black ice running into me.

The police wouldn't even of known I was drinking if I didn't live in a smaller town. I was heading to work and barely over the legal limit at the time. I registered a .09, and when the police arrived on the scene they were never even gonna breathalyze me. However one of the officers who had multiple run-ins with me, arrived on the scene. He knew more than likely I was at least over the legal limit. Yeah,  at 24 I lost 85 pounds to drop to 195. I was considered overweight, still.  I'm large and broad,  and i might have had another 10 pounds to lose,  but 160 would be a 21 bmi for me,  and to think of losing another 35 ppounds from where I was,  it would have frightened me. In a deficit you are not putting on muscle, your strength gains are coming from CNS adaptations. I would err on the side of caution, and not eat back exercise calories. Keep it simple.

edit: I also forgot to mention the part about water retention from weight training, when you lift, your body will "swell" slightly (the same as when you are injured) to help those muscles recover. This can account in some cases a stall in lost "weight".What activity level did you set? If you continue to gain I would reconsider the calories.  You haven't been losing what you expected to which seems like a clear sign that it's too many calories I'm having a small food/coffee/water/sleep habit slump because I began in January and work has been busy, but I'm still going to the gym. I found if I don't do a small bit of cardio every other day the cravings for fun food are more frequent and persistent, and it's harder not to eat at night, even though I have workout appointments 3 days a week. Those alone aren't enough. So I'm surviving it and looking forward to the end of the slump.

I don't count calories or pay attention to what I'm burning in the gym, I find it doesn't matter nearly as much as what I eat, when I eat, and whether I go to the gym or not.

Great that you've set goals, congratulations and good luck :)Weight watchers would have a similar list that you may have more luck finding - it would be most of the non-starchy vegetables and some fruits, spices, herbs, tea and coffee (though must count sugar and milk/cream), mustard, vinegar and probably a few other minor things. Can't wait till technology continues to reduce the effort of logging. Would love to just be able to take a photo of a meal and get the caloric info and stuff.p.s. One more thing. I've had to learn the difference between "good pain" (aches from using muscles) and "bad pain" (impending injury). Don't let good pain scare you off of doing things. It'll pass. Or at least move around. :)I 100% agree. Last I heard was that it burns brown fats which many people don't have much of after infancy. Grats. I'm 10lbs behind ya.Well, we're all different, that's for sure.

But sometimes not being able to do one thing can mean you can do something else. For example, I can't squat well. So if I drop something on the ground, I don't bend from my knees or hips to pick it up. But I'm really good at bending over from the waist to get it!


I'm really enjoying using weights at the gym. The machines go as low as 10lb, and the dumbbells can be as light as 3lb. Just 'cause someone else is using more doesn't mean you have to start there!

Be brave. We can do this. thanks for the heads up. i'll up my water game. currently i hit 64+ oz a day.This doesn't work directly like that. I'll try to find the article but drinking cold water is fairly unhealthy in terms of taking away blood from digestions, slowing your metabolism. There is, like anything else, a balance that needs to be struck. Where did he brag at all?  And if he's not in prison any more what the hell else is supposed to do than better himself?  Stay an alcoholic, continue to attempt to drunk drive?  This is what humans are supposed to do after they've done wrong and been punished for it: get better, don't do bad shit again.  It's a waste of money. If you want a strong fat burner. Pick up ephederine or DNP at your own rizkI've heard of these kinds of things before. It will work, but only for what's known as "brown fat" which most adults do not have a lot of. Other than that it will just make you cold. It is not worth it and I would label it as a scam. However long it takes, you're going to get there, and we will be here waiting to greet you!Congrats! I restarted at the same exact weight as  you, and have the same goal as you. Keep on keeping on! It gets harder and easier at the same time, but being under 300lbs is awesome! I did a similar happy dance when I saw it tilt under 300!If you want some help, this hypnosis change what you eat from high-carb to veges.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNPND9FfqUGood for you!! You can do it! Running is so awesome because it gets better the more you do it (okay...that's probably true of anything, but I really love this about running). Keep it up and you will totally be doing a 5k this spring! Absolutely, or men! As mentioned by others, as long as you're happy with your body that's what really matters. My favourite cookbooks ever, are the Looneyspoons collection. I think they are Looneyspoons; Crazy Plates; and Eat, Shrink &amp; Be Merry. They list the calories and macros, and what I really liked about them (aside from the recipes being really tasty) is that they used a number of the same ingredients throughout the book. Not in a way that made them boring, but in a way that you could stock your pantry once, and be all set to make a bunch of stuff.

I also like these websites, and they list the nutritional info of their recipes:

Thank you! I wish I lived close enough to work to do that haha. I love listening to podcasts while I walk!The calories were set for me via the LoseIt app (and I double-checked on the MFP app, it gives me similar numbers).This is /r/loseit, not /r/letmetellyoumylifestory in detail.  We've only heard a snipet of the story. The simple fact of all this is, we've no idea of the specifics (if he only got 6 months, there's a decent probability that maybe he didn't cause the accident but during it was caught drunk ) and because of that I'm not going to wish him a slow death like person I replied to and hope rather that him kicking the  booze, getting in shape and trying to better himself is part of the process for doing anything he can to make a horrible situation a little less horrible.It's nice to feel comfortable in spaces.Walking on a treadmill is about the only thing I *can* do, judging from my experience thus far. Unrelated health issues earlier in my life left my lower back muscles incredibly week, so I can't lift weights or anything like that without pretty serious discomfort. I have considered trying yoga or something like that, but the same health issues left me really unflexible too. I suppose over time I could regain some of my lost flexibility though. Maybe I should just really look into things I could do to strengthen my poor back. D:It sounds like you're saying it's easier for you to give up something you enjoy than it is to develop more self-control...so yeah, I guess that makes sense.Better off with the whiskey, forget the soda. No carbs, different sugars in the boozeThank you! I've always wanted to visit Portland! I guess I never thought about how difficult it would be to get out and exercise if it was wet outside all the time haha. I realized this about myself yesterday. Not only do I have to keep logging. I pretty much have to log all of my meals and snacks for the entire day for it to work. This way if I feel like changing something, I can look at the rest of my day and figure out how to make up for it before it happens. That makes sense.  I'm a believer in second chances myself, but I couldn't help but be curious.It took me awhile to get into it, too. But I definitely like it for finding other people who eat like I do.
Anyway... really, feel free to email me anytime. Even if you just wanna rant but spare the boyfriend. I'm here!I have a few, but I suck at linking things, so bear with me if these don't work, but they are accessible with a quick google...

Enjoy!you can probably absorb a few drinks once a week. just try to drink a ton of water with them to minimize the water retention. sounds weird but go with it. the more water you drink, the less water weight you will gain. Last week I got into a fight with my mom, ate cupcakes and muffins, only made it to the gym twice and moped around. Then my husband went grocery shopping and only got junk, pasta, boxed food crap. So I went and bought my fruits and veggies, got mad, went to the gym and felt great. I will eats the veg and go to the gym everyday this week. I'm over my slumpI would definitely swap the regular Coke for diet if you feel you can. Coke has a lot of sugar and calories. If you're having, say 2 pints of Coke that's basically 100 grams of sugar. I think the Jack's workable in a diet if you plan ahead for the calories but I would definitely cut the normal Coke, especially as you drink it every week.No hope involved, it really works.  Just be honest with your intake.  Also don't let a week or two determine if it's working or not.  I say give it 30 days.  Another thing, don't compare your losses to others and don't let fluctuations up or down freak you out.  They will happen and it will be discouraging but just remember it happened to every single one of us and if you push through, you will succeed.word. i'm working out and eating between 1200-1600 a day, even on workout days. losing at about 2lbs a week from 198 with a goal of around 160. Same.  I feel like an idiot but this made me tear up a bit.Tuna "meatballs" with curry-tomato sauce .. yummy.
No, the maximum muscle gain especially in a deficit for women is 1/4 lb a week. However the gain could be water weight as lifting is associated with water retention. Are you taking measurements?

I would stop eating back exercise calories, even if conservative you're likely overestimating

Also how did you set your calories? 1650 calories is probably a 20%ish deficit about 400-500 calories a week which is less than to 1 lb loss per week

I think you need to reduce calories **You don't have to walk.**


It used to drive me nuts. "Everyone said" walking was the easiest exercise, and it would be easy. Bullshit.


Try something that interests you. Keep doing it if you enjoy it. Just 'cause you're not ready to compete in the Tour de France doesn't mean you can't ride a bicycle... or a recumbent bicycle, or a geeky adult tricycle if you want to. I ended up on a recumbent because I found the height of a regular bike/trike scared me. So what? I got on my funny looking bike and rode it. And I got all sorts of compliments on it too. :)


So go ahead, try belly dancing if that sounds like fun. Or maybe you'll like lifting weights at the gym. Or bowling. Or scuba diving!


Just 'cause we're fat it doesn't meant we're limited to walking.

I ate about 150 over my limit twice in a row... That hasn't happened since I started keeping track LOVE the feeling of changing your flair! Congratulations, keep going!!Whats your favorite way to log?thank you for all of the information, as I said above I think I was just deluding myself and thinking I was tracking everything but it was very vague at times. For example I know I wasn't measuring the cream I use in my coffee, just "guesstimating" it. I didn't actually realize those small miscalculations can add up to no weight loss...but that makes sense. I will definitely try to stick to the 1500 max and give exercising again a try to help with those cheat days. Thanks!#####&amp;#009;

That's AMAZEBALLS!

Congratulations, what an awesome way to stay motivated and on track!Nothing but excuses. No one cares how big you are or what you look like. Get over it.First off, great job on your choice! Second, everyone else that has responded has really great tips! I am personally a chip-a-holic. It was always my weakness, chips. Something I found that can replace them is the veggie straw chips. There is no redeeming nutritional value to them, but you can have 38 of them for 130 calories, and for me it really helps that craving. Another thing I really like to snack on is triscuits and cottage cheese. I will have half a cup of cottage cheese, and 1.5 servings of reduced fat triscuits for a total of 290 calories. They are so tasty together, and really satisfies that chips and dip craving. Good luck on your journey, stick with it!haha that's the best way to describe it!You are right, I was just deluding myself and thinking I was tracking really accurately when even last night I had a glass of wine and just guessed how much I drank. I think that is happening more often than it should and probably is what is causing me to stay at my weightYes. "DUIs are super dope." is exactly what I took from this dude's story. A+ reading comprehension, you beautiful snowflake.Where did he atone in the original comment? All I see is acknowledgement that he killed people. Atonement would be working to help the families of the people he killed for no reason other than his lack of self control. Atonement is not posting on the Internet about how double homicide made him a better person.thanks for bringing this up- I usually eyeball it, I think weighing ingredients would be like the next step up for me.Great progress! Nothing quite like seeing your jawline resurface. How is it hypocritical? Are you saying that everyone in this thread has killed people with their bad choices? Because I haven't. I haven't committed a single vehicular homicide.

It's great that you can forgive someone for doing something that didn't affect you, though. I'm sure the families of the people he murdered are right on board with you.Felt my chest just now and there was a bump too. But unlike you mine was a man boob :( at least it's smaller than 6 months ago...Well, I'm not consistent with counting- and I get more swept up into the cooking. I need to step back and not be thinking about it all the time, because thinking about it makes it harder to remain disciplined. Does that make any sense?Congratulations! I've lost 78lbs in 42 weeks so far, and though my SW was a lot higher (283) if you knuckle down and go for it, no excuses, you can do a lot before your wedding.

It's very easy to make some simple dishes from scratch. One of my go-to recipes is a can of tuna or salmon, a bit of rice, cut up spring onions and red pepper, and 2 tbsps of soy sauce. Takes all of 5 minutes to make and is delicious and healthy. Most of the dishes I make using stir-fry bags of veg and take me less time than delivery from a takeaway.

One of the things that helped me enormously is support from other slimmers, both on here and at a weight-loss support group I go to. It gives me accountability while at the same time helping me through rough patches and bad weeks. Their encouragement has often saved me from ditching the whole thing over a few bad choices.

You can 100% do it if you are honest with yourself, make the changes sustainable and draw the line immediately under any binges or bad choices. Of course life will get in the way sometimes, but if you're sensible and realistic and take it as a change of life and not just as a crash diet before your wedding, you'll walk down the aisle at a weight that you are both comfortable and happy with.Inspired to commit your own double homicide? What is inspiring about a drunk driver who shows no remorse about killing people?This helped me.  Thank you.  I never thought of practicing eating, but you're totally right.The mental battle is really about 90% of losing weight and it is the hardest for me. It's so easy to throw the towel in when you feel bad about yourself/your choices. Negativity breeds negative habits - I try to recite this to myself (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt!) I don't think 3lb is too bad though, and I think you'd be very surprised how quickly you could get that off. I'd also be very wary of thinking that you gained 3lb of fat, it's going to be a lot of water weight if you had a bit of a binge and ate salty food or had too much booze etc. We shall try and try again!unless he takes those calories out from somewhere else in his diet. meaning if he works out, or cuts back on something else he can "fit" those jack and cokes in. Although it is not the greatest use of calories, it is important to keep that balance so we don't go off the rails.
Congrats on getting away with double homicide. It's great to hear how you murdering two others hasn't held you back at all. Here's to you mowing down several more families and dropping a few pounds with each one!

You fucking scumbag. What kind of piece of shit BRAGS about how killing people hasn't affected them? I hope when you relapse and murder another couple people, it makes you just as happy as it did the first time.Many people think so, but the only ones I've found were when I was changing a workout regimen (likely water), or haven't been good about hitting my goals. I've never had a plateau when I've been 100% responsible in my eating, and without changing my workouts.My birthday was the 5th and I took 7 days "off" (4th-11th) from my restricted calorie goal and ate at a maintenance level. I still logged all of my calories, but let myself go over my calorie goals and ate what I wanted. I'm now back to my deficit and I can already tell it helped jump start my system. Breaks are needed sometimes, especially if you're plateauing! Oh, and I weighed last night and I didn't loss or gain, so I'm calling that a great success after the piece of cheesecake I ate on my birthday lolWay to go!

i am 20lbs away from "Twoville" this morning. can't wait to get under 300. I agree with the posters here (and especially with u/audiojister regarding weight being tied to shame- not just in our own minds but reinforced by society/media/etc.), and just wanted to add one more thought.  Being overweight for so long, I've had a whole lot of stops and starts at this; so many that it got to the point where I felt that the people I usually confided in were tired of hearing about it only to then see me fail again.  Now, that might not necessarily have been true, but the thought of disappointing someone close to me who genuinely cared about me again by reverting to old habits was too much to bear.  I'm not saying this thought is rational at all, just that that was one reason why I was hesitant to talk about it with my friends and family.  Just make sure to reinforce that you care and you love and support him no matter what- even if his journey were to take a long time or he messes up a lot or what have you.I personally consider anyone who has a complete disregard for their life and the lives of others as a threat. Anyone who drives drunk is a sociopath. Anyone who drives drunk, kills two innocent people just living their lives, and then comes online to brag about how double vehicular homicide hasn't held them back from living their life is the scum of the fucking earth.Great job! Keep it up!Your comment brings to light an important aspect of weight loss I think.  I too am fairly happy with the way I've chosen to eat (except for more cake- I could eat cake every day).  I didn't mention that I was thinking of 'maintenance' weeks lining up with holidays which tend to have splurgier food choices.  I think if I chose an ordinary week to eat at maintenance, my maintenance would just be more of the same good choices I ordinarily make.  Thanks for your insight.WTG yourself 95lbs is a ton!  how long did that take you?Like most weight loss scams it is only really effective with a balanced diet and exercise. Another effective way to lose weight is by using a balanced diet and exercise. Yes! I have come to terms with having to log forever, it is such an insignificant price to pay for good health!MyFitnessPal!I've used MyFitnessPal in the past, but somebody mentioned that LoseIt app recently, and I'm giving that a go. They're very similar, and very easy to use. You just search for what you're eating (they have TONS of stuff preloaded), and if you can't find it, you can scan the barcode and it'll automatically populate the nutrition information.Awesome! Great job, and thanks! Hmm.. tudorland is good, but what about twoville; a play on Dr. Seuss Whoville? That's the wittiest thing I can come up with, thanks to my 4 yr old son. Good morning!
I am a long time loseit lurk, so I figured I would sign up so I can actually partake in threads. I am a 26 year old mom of one living in the Boston area, and I am beyond fed up with my physical state (5'3" and 157lbs).
Long story short, I've always been on the athletic and smaller side. I have pretty terrible body image issues that probably stems from my childhood but I won't go there. I sustained a bad sports related injury in 2002 that required multiple surgeries and led to being very sedentary. I stayed home from school a lot and eventually recovered but I no longer got involved in athletics and just I just really loved food, for every occasion and emotion. I was also diagnosed with depression around that time, as well.
Fast forward to 2010-2012 and  I got into the absolute best shape of my life and felt amazing. I was in the gym almost daily and used working out as my all around stress reliever, antidepressant, everything.
I met my son's father in October 2012 and found out that I was pregnant 3 months later, and everything began to spiral downward from there. I ate whatever and whenever I wanted and went from 117ish to my now 157. I can't wear the clothes I want to wear and hate how I look naked, like haaaaaaate it. Even though I love my son more than anything, I've struggled with bouts of deep scary depression all along the way. I feel like I'm leaving a lot out but I didn't want to ramble for too long. I'm just ready to finally be at peace and feel good once and for all, but I'm having trouble getting there. I'm hoping that being part of some sort of community will  help me out of my slump! Nothing wrong with elaborate meals as long as you know the calorie content. I'd suggest knowing what your maintenance  calorie intake should be and weigh ingredients accordingly then weigh portions out. Preparing in advance is a good way of controlling calorie intake.You seem like you're in a great position, actually. You're happy to prepare your meals, and you have a history of successful weight loss. Frankly, all you need to do is consider the caloric value of all the meals you prep, which should be easy for you...is there a reason you aren't doing this? I guess there's something I'm missing, since this seems like an obvious solution...you don't need to stop prepping your own meals?I'm really short too, somewhere around your height give or take an inch, but unlike you I've always been really heavy. So I've always wanted to be one of those tiny girls who eats half a sandwich and is like, "Wow I'm SO full!" I would love to be just this little thing who can occasionally have a big meal but for the most part doesn't need much to keep going. And it's SO HARD. So I think that's my difference - my lifestyle change is also what I think my ideal is. It's all probably wrapped up in size issues and things (like I can't wait to be tiny enough that people can pick me up. I've literally never been that small. I mean I guess I was when I was a child but probably since middle school on I've been larger than my peers) but I love being short and I want to be tiny in every way, including my portions. I don't know. It's weird and I recognize that's completely different from what you even asked for, but I realized it as I was reading what you wrote. Anyway!Yeah, I have browsed through there a little bit, I was just not sure if there was anyone on here who was in a similar situation as mine, or similar age, who could provide so advice. Thank you though! What do you use to track calories?The same thing happened to me when I first started out. I lost the initial water weight, which is exciting to see, then lost a couple of real pounds. I was so pumped! But then the scale just wouldn't budge.

For about two and a half weeks, the scale was either the same number mocking me, or worse, it would be two-to-three pounds heavier. I was so frustrated that I said fuck it and had a pity party, complete with a sadness-fueled Mexican food bender.

The next day I stepped on the scale to accept my defeat... and I was down three pounds.

Stick with what you're doing! Lifting can cause your muscles to retain a lot of water while they recover. The weight will come off eventually, and when it does, you get to claim victory over the scale! Just remember, this is a war of attrition, so dig your heels in and know that you're going to come out on top.By gaining I mean 1-2 lb increase. I have a friend who has tried to get me to check into getting Topomax for migraines. I have another friend who actually takes it, and there's no way in hell I would ever do that to myself. The side effects sound worse than the migraines themselves.

I couldn't deal with the "topomax head" -- I'm a graduate student and writing my dissertation is hard enough without feeling stupified.Here's a great article about why exercised based diet plans don't work as well.  http://vitals.lifehacker.com/exercise-vs-diet-which-is-more-important-for-weight-l-1677532039Read the FAQ. Then read through all the posts below yours. Tons of information already on here. C'mon back when you have specific questions :)It is easy and I've been losing weight but all last week I hit a plateau and this week I'm gaining...I haven't eaten more than the 1200 calories per day, maybe it's because I'm not drinking as much water since im in jury duty? I don't know but it's frustrating and I feel like quitting. I've been good, yesterday someone brought donuts and I stuck to my own breakfast. I don't mean to whine but :(Agree. Logging is amazing. I used My Fitness Pal and although not every calorie is to the exact it's a pretty good rough guide. For example a tablespoon of mayonnaise is like 100 calories. If I didn't log that before I put it on my plate I may have just had 3 or 4 tablespoons worth instead.

Logging also allows you to treat yourself! Without logging I would have guess I was at my target already by dinner - not 500 calories off which allowed for some chocolate cake!

I feel like it gives me a purpose as well. I look forward to logging my meal in advance and then subtracting or adding things to make them fit within my calorie intake. It makes losing weight rewarding seeing your streaks come up or tracking how well you're eating. I love logging!

Congratulations on the milestone!!

It's a HUGE deal.... but I may be slightly biased since the same happened to me today too!!

Welcome to "Tudorland" (since I can't come up with anything else that sounds like "onederland" for this momentous occasion lol)

Keep losin'! :)Maintenance breaks are a smarter way to lose weight both psychologically and physiologically. When I'm cutting I incorporate them but I just eat what I would otherwise eat just at maintenance as I don't really view the way I eat as splurge or not splurge. It's a physiologic effect for me that in most after but it can also have a strong psychological break for many. I have chosen a way of eating that I genuinely enjoy. For example, next week I'm on vacation and thought I would plan some "fun" meals, my meal plan looks exactly like what it usually looks like as for me a sustainable way of eating means eating foods you enjoy eating.  That being said, if you want to use maintenance breaks for special occasions that's fine but instead of framing it as an opportunity to splurge and creating an unnecessary dichotomy perhaps instead view it as "it's vacation, I will eat what I want in moderation to satiety with a goal to maintain my weight." A subtle difference but an important one to avoid the diet mentality which is often why maintenance doesn't work out long term.Oh, and congratulations on your pending marriage! That's v exciting. As I get closer to deciding to propose to my girlfriend, I definitely don't want to be the weight I am now if/when we get married. You can do this!A few things on this...

* I've found that there is a direct correlation between the distance I live from fast food places and how much fast food I eat. Maybe something to consider when you get married and move in with your soon-wife.

* Experiment with spices. I don't have an extensive spice rack, but a bottle of McCormick Caribbean Jerk and a bottle of Rotisserie Chicken spices, along with black pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes lets me do just about anything I want to. Most of my home-cooked meals are chicken, turkey, or burgers cooked in a pan on the stovetop, using some of those spices and seasonings. I'll also occasionally make a big pot of pasta and cook up some ground turkey or ground beef to add to plain tomato sauce. All of these meals are quick and easy to cook. Total beginner level stuff. For veggies, I just buy steamable packs and throw them in the microwave six minutes before my main meal is done cooking.

* I do breakfast and lunch easy. Breakfast is a little cup of granola at my desk with my coffee. Lunch is either leftovers, tuna lunch kits from the grocery store, or a deli meat sandwich.

* Track everything. Tracking calories should freak you out when you eat out and realize your small meal was 1200 calories on its own. Tracking what you spend, you'll notice that a home-cooked meal costs $1-$6, whereas you can easily spend $8 on fast food and $50 in a restaurant with the lady. It adds up QUICK, even if you just eat out once a day.

* Be patient but firm with yourself. You'll screw up. It's cool. Keep at it.

Good luck!Ooh I remembered another one, cottage cheese! and Greek yoghurtCall me a cynic, but anything that supposedly promotes weight loss that isn't diet and exercise sounds sketchy to me.I was surrounded by people without food issues, so exercise alone worked for them.  I however can only maintain healthy eating habits for a week or so before I start eating in secret, binging, and constantly grazing.  This is something I kept as hidden as possible from everyone around me.  Now my life is so different.  I've recognized and acknowledged my issues with food, and am working to change my old habits.  Tracking helps to keep me aware and conscious.  There are no secrets or rationalizing, just honesty, awareness and kindness.Roasted broccoli is amazing. I mix it with asparagus and some fat free cottage cheese and put it in the oven for 25 minutes. Amazing.Thank you, that's very sweet of you. :) Honestly I've tried Instagram before but it's not really my thing, I never have anything to post and it's not as easy to use as some other sites I frequent. I lost 8lbs in my first week as well. Even if it's water and not fat, it's still stuff that was weighing you down to begin with. If you can have it gone, have it gone! Keep up the good work!The [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq) is a great place to start. &gt;it was the logging that made them work and dropping the logging made it quit.

I couldn't agree with this more. It mirrors my experience exactly. I've come to realize that I'll be logging my food for the rest of my life. That sounds sad, but it really isn't. It's a small time investment in return for much better health.Topamax for weight loss only?  Ugh, gross.

Don't ever do that to yourself.

I was on it for 1 month for migraines as I have daily pain in my eyes.   I did lose weight during that month but I was already walking/counting calories/making changes, I wouldn't say the topamax did much beyond making me miserable.  The topamax put me on my ass - any energy I had was sapped from me.  Fatigue is not fun.

Also, it fucks with your brain.  I felt like a goddamn idiot for a month.  Topamax head is what my neurologist calls that... how delightful.Thanks! And, just like everyone else around here: calories in &lt; calories out = weight loss. Figure out your bmr and tdee and eat below that. I am usually doing about 700-900 calorie deficit, but I don't calculate my exercise in to the equation so I don't eat back those calories. Have you read the FAQ yet? If not, definitely check it out, tons of useful info in there!I'm more shocked with how many people are disappointed this is the answer I give them and don't want to hear it.I was riding in the car with my significant other (its weird to be 40 and call him a boyfriend or partner and even significant other is odd to say!) and I kept saying, "something is poking me in my back." I felt around behind me and it turned out it was my shoulder blades poking the seat. It was a good pokey feeling after that! Enjoy finding your rib!Congrats, buddy! Really happy for your transformation and new lease on life! Keep it up!I had gastric bypass six and a half years ago and have lost over 200 pounds. It was the best decision of my life. I was extremely overweight so I had to go on a special diet before the bypass and I lost about 40 pounds that way. Even with that weight loss, i knew that I needed the surgery. My blood sugar was out of control and my asthma was just getting worse. So many people think it's an "easy" quick fix but as with anything, it's all about changing your eating habits and living a healthy life.

Yes, for the first year or so after surgery, you will lose weight no matter what. Just because you're so limited to the amount of food you're capable of eat. After that though, you're like a normal person. You have to work at it to lose the weight.

I can't say enough how much this surgery gave me my life back. I no longer am on any meds and my asthma is completely gone. My quality of life is a million times better. When it comes down to it, it's a personal decision but the most important thing is to realize that there is no quick option to losing weight. It will be a lifelong journey! It was really eye-opening when I realized that the only thing stopping me from losing weight . . . Was me. There wasn't some cosmic force in the universe making me fat, it was me. I'm just in the beginning stages (I've been making lifestyle changes slowly so I see it less of a diet and more of a way of living) but this week I started counting calories in addition to working out. I really, really can't wait to see some results, no matter how small.congratulations! how'd you do it! I'm struggling to drop from 230 lbs to 210 lbs. I can't figure it out! Learn some easy "cheating time" meals.

I eat Chick Fil A, Chipotle, Five Guys, etc.  After figuring it out with their calorie information, the meals I get from there are between 500-700 calories.  If what you eat is high protein and skip the bad shit, it's fine for your macros.

Just skip the fries / extra carbs if you have to stay low for whatever reason (height, no activity, etc).Thank you for your reply. Yes, I will decrease my alcohol intake for sure. I'm limiting it to weekends only. I bought some really nasty rice protein powder after reading your comment, to make sure I get my daily amount of protein. Thanks again!If you go that route find one with a little key pocket (speaking from experience) :)Just starting out with the whole MFP and counting calories thing... here's hoping :\This is also a good idea. I should ask about that. I think right now she's keeping her phone in a sweatshirt pocket (it's February in Michigan, go figure), but when it gets warmer out, an armband will be very useful.Goal for today is to cook a nice and healthy dinner for myself tonight instead of eating something on the go.What I do is I weigh in daily and don't think too much about what the scale says that day, I just calculate the general trend. I started my weight loss journey at the beginning of the year and the first month looked like [this](http://imgur.com/caZWJ5G). Yellow line is my goal, red line is the trend. Sometimes you can see HUGE jumps from one day to the other, or if I would only weigh in once a week it might look like I'm not losing anything at all, especially if I hit a bad day. But looking at the trend I know that I'm on track. They initially prescribed Topamax for me to treat my migraines and it was horrible. Yes, i lost about 20 pounds but that was because the medicine made me nauseous the whole time I was on it. Never again!!Does she have an armband for her phone to wear while working out/running? Maybe an iTunes card to go along with it?I lost 11lbs in my first week, not even kidding. I think it's the drastic change to your calorie intake and type of food you're now eating. As another poster said, fast food and junk type food have alot more sodium so alot of water weight will be lost one you cut back/cut them out but at least you're losing!  Well done on your decision to get healthy! I started logging yesterday for the first time in my life. You are absolutely right. Awareness is essential :)

Nutritionist, that's an idea. I've had a couple of opportunities to see one, but for some reason didn't want to- maybe I was too defensive to feel comfortable  talking with a stranger about it. But I should as you say just think of it as another tool. Good to hear you found it useful.Oh! I totally get that. Before I started to put on some muscle in these areas I felt that too. It'll definitely change. :)My sister and I have resorted to first-run things backed on Kickstarter for my dad. It's the only stuff he can't buy on his own.

Pretty sure we're going to try to do one of those "recreating childhood photos as adults" things for our mom for the holidays this year.Yeah i had a look and it's under "entries" saying when I've entered my weight and how many pounds it was. That's great, I would just prefer for it to tell me overall loss in my home icon but I suppose I started on a nice round number and can always work it out myself. I think the home icon is showing monthly weight loss for me. Thanks for your reply :) Weight loss is not linear. Plateaus are a normal part of weight loss. Give it some time and if the weight doesn't start coming off then decrease your caloric budget a bit and then reassess.Burned out...exactly.  After a lifetime of poor eating habits and a bad relationship with food, I went crazy with calorie counting and exercise and I lost all the weight in the span of about 7 or 8 months.  Then I moved to a new state and started a new school, which was very stressful.  I was fine for the first few months and feeling on top of the world, but once the stress from the life change kicked in, I crashed.  It didn't happen all at once, but a little at a time like you described.  I just caved, and eventually went back to my old bad habits.  It took me a long time to realize that I went about my weight loss the wrong way.  In hindsight I think the maintenance part is the hardest, and I wish I had seen a nutritionist at that point so they could help me reflect and stay on track.  Maybe that would help you too?  Now, while I am chipping away at this slower, I am actually very wary of calorie counting (although I know it is still useful), but I am trying to find a balance.  And when I make it to a weight that I feel good about, I want to reach out for help where I can so I have the right tools. I do not believe you can burn an extra 250 calories per hour, just by being cold or wearing a cold vest.Ugh, mine are the same way. Good for them, but so frustrating for gift shopping! Makes me want to give them stuff like "coupon for one free hug" or something, just to be all "you're hard to shop for!" :) I personally love zumba, the moves are always changing, it's a great workout, and I think a lot less boring than just running on a treadmill. They have vidoes on youtube you can work along with.I would suggest changing the treadmill for a while. I exercise at home like you. I don't feel comfortable doing it outside, not only because I feel judged, but also because I live in a big city with a lot of traffic and I hate the smog and the noise.

I used to go to a gym before, but that's not something I feel comfortable doing right now. Like you, I'd love to swim, but I don't have any affordable options.

So a few days ago I did some research and found a video program to exercise at home. It's not aerobics, it's all about walking, but with a twist. I started yesterday and I feel very motivated. Jogging/running on the treadmill was always very tedious for me. I did it at the gym because I could move to other things after that.

Anyway, PM if want to know the name of the program.

In any case, I wish you luck. I know exercise doesn't necessarily come natural to many of us. It implies a big effort, and finding ways to make it enjoyable, at least until it becomes part of our life. Continue to count calories for at least a few months while in maintenance. Elaborate meals don't need to push you over your caloric intake for the day and if you keep counting they shouldn't be without your knowledge. When you look at your weight progress, it seems to default to showing you a small time frame like a week or a month. That threw me off too til I realized it was just showing me a week not all time. When you go to the progress section, there should be a dropdown where you can pick a different time frame to look at.Some people read as an option.  Books on tape and podcasts are great options.  I want to keep walking till the end, even though I am on a treadmill!I love the idea of doing some races together! I was going to do the Soldier Field run with her, but my roommate and his fiance decided to un-break off their wedding set for that day, and I imagine I'll be needed at that. Still, there are going to be tons of runs in the Spring, I'm sure. That's a great idea.

She's got an iPhone loaded up with music. I'll mull that around in my head a bit. My parents are pretty well off, which makes them difficult to shop for. Typically when they want something, they just buy it. I might check with my dad about the idea of more workout stuff or new music.I felt so good about myself and basically lost 5lbs before Christmas, maintained, lost slowly but steadily through January, but the first week of February kicked my ass. Put on 3lbs, undid about 3 weeks of work and I'm kicking myself for the bad, and frankly, stupid choices I made. Trying to put it behind me and think of the bigger picture but I'm still struggling as my brain is hardwired into the "you've failed so you might as well give up" mode. Still here though, and still trying. Onwards and downwards!I really appreciate your perspective. It's hard to tell where things are going sometimes. I'm clearly burned out the way you were- feels better to name it, now I can deal with it. That's a good point, I'm trying to undo a lot of bad habits in a short time. My behavior makes more sense now.It does, yeah. I've thought maybe automation could help me but wasn't really sure how to do it. I do have a slow cooker- that is a great idea. Also coming up with a pattern, I think, would be very helpful.* Could you purchase a couple of race entries for a race you could do together?

* Does she already have an iPod? If not - get her one? If so - get her an iTunes card so she can get some new music? Or you could get her a playlist. The 2015 equivalent of a mixed tape.

* I have a lot of workout clothes and shoes and I STILL want more. Cute workout stuff makes me want to workout. If your mom feels the same way, she might appreciate some cute new stuff, or a gift card for it. Funny, I'm the opposite. Progress pictures with a sports bra totally discourage me, but I think I look so much thinner with clothes on. But then, I haven't been putting any muscle on yet, so maybe that'll change :)Okay, I just want to let you know that I was at your stage at one point.  I was very close to my goal weight, keeping track of my food closely, and then I let the weight creep back on over the years.  I realized later that I had become completely obsessed with tracking food and calories and intake and it left me completely exhausted and ultimately I failed.  It was my fault - nobody else is to blame.  But what I didn't realize at the time is that I was trying to alter over 20 years of poor eating habits in just a few months, and I became obsessive about it.  I should have taken care of myself more, done more research, and been more gentle with myself.  It is awesome that you are reaching out now, before you are back where you started.  My best advice would be to not beat yourself up and just take it slow.  Still prep your meals, but rather than doing it on autopilot, maybe take one day this week to write down what is BEST for you and see if you can incorporate that into the next week.  Take it slower, but not so slow that you gain weight?  In any case, I just wanted you to know that you're not alone, and you are actually at a great point to reflect and stay on track instead of regaining like I did. :)This is going to be long, and I tried to do a tl;dr but really couldn't, so...oh well.

First, is he already working on losing weight or are you asking how to encourage him to start? I wasn't sure from your post. For me, deciding to start losing weight was a very personal choice. I don't think there was anything my husband could have said to get me to start -- he always went along with any new thing I was going to try (everything from C25K to green smoothies to complete sugar fasts, none of which helped), though. I was pretty quiet about counting calories and he kind of let me do my thing when I first started. When I realized this worked and got more confident about it, he amped up the support.

What really helps me is the understanding of my husband. When we're tossing around what to eat for dinner, he'll ask me how many calories I have left for the day, and if it's not very many he will try to think of things he know will fit in my budget. He likes to make big breakfasts on the weekend, but I've been eating smaller/no breakfast in favor of larger dinners, and I appreciate that he doesn't push it when I say I don't want French toast on a Saturday -- we just enjoy our coffee and time together instead.

What DOESN'T help is when I feel like he's policing me. I get really defensive -- I've discovered that I like to feel like I'm in charge of this myself and he's there to help, but he's not the boss of my weight loss. So while I like him saying things like, "Are you sure you want to go above your deficit today? We're going to a birthday party tomorrow," I really, really hate "You're having more chips? We had a big dinner..."

Also, compliments help. I don't always believe them, but they do make a difference -- especially passing ones rather than the "wow you look really good!" We were folding laundry a few weeks ago and he commented that he thought my new jeans would fit him. That made me feel better than all the "look how skinny you are!"s in the world. A few weeks ago I put on an old dress that I thought fit better than it had in years, and he mentioned something in passing that I'd have to retire that one soon because it was looking too big.

I don't necessarily think that there's any way he knows these little passing comments are the best support -- I think he just says what he's thinking and it ends up being what I need to hear.

It might be different for everyone. Maybe ask him what would be helpful. I thought working out with my husband would help, but it honestly kind of discouraged me a little. I joined some fitness classes with my sister, and am way more motivated to work out than when I did it with him. Like I mentioned, I like his understanding and encouragement, but don't like when I feel like I'm being watched. Blatant "you're looking really good," don't help me all that much (although they're still nice to hear -- I just feel like he has to say that because he's married to me, so I can't trust them, ya know?), but passing comments about clothes being too big or something like that can motivate me the whole week.I'm always shocked at how it's both ridiculously easy and yet kind of difficult.  It's difficult in that you have to be thinking about what you're eating all the time and because it's really frustrating when you plateau.  It's really easy in the sense that it's just counting, and in the end, it's a lot easier than most of the weight loss plans out there.i may go the the route of diet and jack. perhaps just diet soon... thanks.Hello!

First of all, congratulations on making the decision to be healthier and have a better life. That is such a big step at such a young age, which is great.

My first advice is to slow down a little. I know you have a lot of ideas and goals, and that is awesome, but remember changing your lifestyle is a process that takes time. Make one or two changes at a time. Making too many changes at once might be difficult to keep up and it's easier to get discouraged. For example, you could start by cutting down the soda. Don't drink more than 2 for a 10 days, when you've achieved that, go down to 1 for 10 additional days. Finally, go down to no soda and all water for another 10 days.

Second, I recommend moderation. One-two hours of exercise a day might be a long-term goal, but start slowly. You could start by exercising half an hour every day or 1 hour 3 times a week. In time, as you lose some weight, you can exercise more. But take it easy, your body needs to get used to your new calorie intake and your new exercise plan.

Finally, I'd recommend to set more realistic, healthy goals. 100 lbs in 6 months is excessive. When you loose weight to fast, you regain it easier. Losing weight is a long journey. You have to understand that in order to avoid frustration. We would all love to lose our weight in a matter of months (or weeks when the excess weight is not that much). Truth is it can take even years. And this is not a bad thing. The changes you need to make to lose the weight, and then maintain your healthy weight and stay healthy are forever. They will become part of your life. They won't be a temporary thing to lose weight. And you need time to incorporate changes in your life.

Cheers and good luck in your journey!


Maybe make them less elaborate? Can you involve the slow cooker? Then you just need to toss the ingredients in, and retrieve 'em when the meal is cooked. I make a big batch of something simple and then freeze it in single portions. Every day I grab a mini can of tuna, a frozen container of soup/pulled pork/chili etc from the freezer, a piece of fruit, and I'm all set. It takes so little time to do the prep, and then I don't have to think about it afterwards. Make sense?Fast food and processed foods have loads of sodium.  You lost mostly water and probably a bit of fat (depending on the number of calories you ate).  It's normal to lose a lot of water weight in the beginning.

A loss is a loss though!  Take it and be proud of your first week!Don't question it. Just keep going! Keep up your new good habits, and hopefully it'll stay off. About 4 calories per mL of coke and 2 per mL of whiskey.

It's a lot either way.

Maybe Jack &amp; Diet Coke next time? Or just Diet Coke? It cools your core down which your body then spend extra energy heating back up to an ideal temperature. You can get similar results with taping some icepacks to a wet T-shirt and wearing it for a bit then refreezing it.

This doesn't promote sustainable, healthy weight loss. Save your money.This is huge!  Congrats!!Flair update **-95 lbs**I suggest avoiding these foods when you are with him.  You can be silently supportive.  It still respects his privacy without providing temptation.

Thanks! My memory wasn't far off after all! Hooray for high school science. :)Yeah ,i watch what i eat but i know that exercise is really good for you overall not just when it comes to losing weight but it can improve your circulation and stuff like that.
Also i love swimming but i would only do it in a public pool if i could wear a t shirt which my local pool doesn't allow.Agree with read the FAQ ... get on MyFitnessPal which you might be doing already since you know your calories.  It's a great way to log your food.  My advice: never quit logging.  http://redd.it/2vngg1

Your exercise is not sustainable, but it also isn't primarily responsible for weight loss.  Do it because you enjoy it and it *secondarily* helps with weight loss.  But don't put the cart before the horse -- diet is primary.  We like to talk about exercise because we feel like we're publicly doing something where with dieting we're eating mostly in private.

Keep going, you're going to do awesome!

Low carb burger: just delete the bun ... another burger tip is to delete the mayo, use mustard or steak sauce or have it plain. Before I started losing weight, it was very rare for me to eat junk food. I didn't really like candy and chips etc, I just got fat by eating too much healthy food lol. Now that I'm losing weight, I'm getting cravings for junk food WAY more than I did before. It's so strangeOh me too. This is where I put on my weight. During grad school I made the "busy" excuse. Never packed my lunch. Lots of going out and drinking with friends. Only real exercise was from the car to the bar.

So scary about your heart! Will you still have to get your aortic valve replaced? (That's my leaky one as well). Has your super sweet resting heart rate eased the problem for a bit? Did you have any symptoms from the severe leaking?

My stats: F/5'3"/168. SW: 170, CW: 168, GW: 120

Good luck, my friend! &amp; Cheers to a happy heart!

Edit: I keep gaining and losing the same 3 lbs. I think my recent switch to low carb will be a game changer, though.Nalgene water bottle is a brilliant idea. Get the wide-mouthed 32 ounce one. Heck, get two. Keep one full in the fridge at all times. You won't reach for a soda if you have cold water handy (if you're anything like me).

Replace soda with coffee or tea if you need to wean off the caffeine slow. I recommend black coffee. It's delicious, and something like 2 calories a cup.

1500 calories for a 6'3" guy seems really low. Bear in mind that 1-2 pounds a week is a good healthy pace to lose. If you lose a lot of weight very fast, it's my understanding that you increase the likelihood of loose skin.

Take your time, bud. You're on the right track, more or less, but you're still at the starting line. It'll take time to get going and get up to speed. Patience is your friend in this endeavor.Or men!... &amp;gt; Sweetie you don't look so good, your bottom lip is bleeding

~ 'Bitters &amp;amp; Absolut' - The NationalThere isn't much one can do past TV/Music to make treadmill running enjoyable. OP has already failed because there will be no option that he wants to hear.I like to dice up some carrots, potato and turnip, toss with a little olive oil, salt, spices. Throw in the oven at high temp 425ish and leave them til they just start getting browned. You're basically making oven fries out of different root vegI love that you brought out this topic.

First of all I want to point that these are merely my opinions based on my personal experience. Some people might disagree, but I hope it helps you.

You said something very important. A change needs to happen (I prefer the word "long-lasting" to "drastic", as the latter sounds scary). I also think that you need your family/significant other/friends/coworkers to be involved. As in any big change in your life, the more support you have, the easier it is. Sure, he is the one that needs to make the change and the effort, but others being conscious, encouraging, and supporting will help, for sure. If not, why are we all here?

I love your attitude. You love your SO and you're concerned. You want to help. This is great. The world is full of people who would rather give up on someone struggling with weight problems or shame them, so  I want to start by appreciating the fact that you are caring and compassionate.

Being overweight/obese is a source of shame for many of us. Not only because it affects the way we look, but because in many cases exposes our lack of control (over the food we eat). Thus, the way you approach him about this must be very smart and careful.

I would recommend sitting down with him and talking about this openly, in a very caring way. I would start by acknowledging this is a personal battle, but you love him and you want to help him. I would also acknowledge this is a very difficult topic, but you'd still want him to listen to what you have to say. You could let him know you want to support him in any way you can. That you want him to be healthier and happier. You could discuss with him some ideas of things you could do together that would help him. Finally, you could assure him that you will respect his desire to do this alone if he doesn't feel comfortable, but that you will always be willing to help and support him if he needs it or wants it.

There is just one thing you must keep in mind. He will change his lifestyle when he decides to do so. No amount of loving advice or unloving criticism will make a person change if it doesn't come from inside.

We are all very different. If I had a SO, I would love them to exercise with me, cook healthy food with me, compliment me when I achieve goals. That would motivate me a lot. But that's me. He might feel different about this. I think it is important to talk about it, but it also important to listen to him and respect his wishes regarding this.

Whatever happens, I wish you well, and I think you're a great person for caring and be willing to support your partner.


Thanks for this! This is a great baseline, and inspiration. Winter is a real challenge for me...I don't do cold well. But I imagine that will get improve, too, as my metabolism gets better. I walk a few times a week as well as yoga, but I could do more. So I've recently started with the C25K app.

I just took my heart rate with my phone and got an average of 72, but I'm not sure how accurate that is. 55-60 is an amazing achievement! Something I'll be working towards.If you join a running group, it might be cool to NOT listen to music while you run with a bunch of other people who would probably talk to you to keep you distracted.

Why are you super concerned with working out if you so clearly, obviously, dislike it? Losing weight is *almost entirely* about what you eat. I would focus on that instead of asking for advice and then not taking any of it :)WTG!!* Read the FAQ

* 1-2 hours a day is a LOT of exercise for someone who does not currently exercise much. Be aware that if you set very big goals right away, you will get discouraged if you don't meet them.

* It's been one day. Keep going. Ah one of the reasons I LOVE this sub. Thanks - I needed to hear this! Some days are easier than others - some weeks are easier than others - this one has been a hard one! Onward and Upward!Every 3500 calories of Jack, coke, or any combination of the two that you drink will cause you a pound of long term weight gain.  You're right I don't like running, in fact i hate it. while i love swimming i don't have a private pool and I wouldn't feel comfortable being in a public pool. The running group thing isn't realistic at the moment but only because i don't have a phone and would therefore be unable to listen to music. But i might see if my town has a running group so when i get a phone i could check it out.  Thanks for the suggestion though.Definitly! Especially because that's all it takes. Exercise helps in other areas for sure, but weight loss is remarkably simple in practise - though it sure isn't easy ;sIf I recall correctly, the cold doesn't burn fat, it makes white fat brown (or beige).  I have to go to work now, but if someone wants to investigate further, the terms to start with are: cold thermogenesis

Anyway, this isn't the lifestyle change that we need.Right on! This is hard for me as well - especially at restaurants. I also splurged yesterday, got a giant burrito from a local Mexican place. BUT I left out the sour cream. Then I only ate half (which was still substantial in calorie amount I'm guessing) and stopped, which is unheard of for past me. I saved the other half - but honestly, the one half took care of my craving - so I'm fighting the obligation I feel to eat the rest of it just because it's there and I paid for it.
wow. amazing progress! congrats!!It's something I tell myself, thought it might strike a chord with some people.Read up on VAP cholesterol tests and in particular have a look at understanding the difference between pattern A &amp; B LDL cholesterol - your test won't have that measurement for example.The per-slice weights for the brand of bread I eat are out by 50%. A slice is supposed to weigh 40 grams -- but actually weighs 60 grams. YES! I am shocked every time I step on the scale - I keep thinking it's going to jump back up to my heaviest - for no reason at all.

Then that light bulb clicks on and you get it - it's amazing! And all through just keeping track of calories and moving more! I know, right? Cheese really isn't my crutch, but I do use it to get more protein because I get tired of meat and fish all the time. I'll use a bit of a nice camembert as my "dessert," for example.

When he asked about my diet, I told him I didn't really eat much red meat, because I'm not fond of it...but that I did eat a fair amount of cheese. He said that could raise my levels as well.

We had the food discussion before the exercise discussion, so I think maybe just hadn't gotten there yet when he said that a low carb diet is "the best thing" one can do. I would think exercise.

I do exercise, though. And I totally agree--it's amazing what just a little bit can do. Even once or twice a week yoga has changed my body so much. I'm getting my first-ever back muscles. THIS! I was so frustrated because all my exercise was getting me nowhere! I finally understand that you can't exercise out of a bad diet - at least one as bad as mine at the time!

I just wanna say Hi! I can't offer you any solutions, but I'm happy to be a friend. If you ever wanna chat, you can email me (shannonf27@gmail.com)
I also recommend getting on Instagram (SweatyGirl27 is me). It's fun as a hobby, but also offers lots of friends, motivation, and recipe ideas if you search the right hashtags.
Let's say you got ice water at 1 degree celsius. To maintain body temperature, you will have to heat it up 36.5 degrees.

So if you drink 2L of water a day (a little more than the 64oz recommendation), then you're drinking 2000g of water.

You will need 36.5 X 2000 = 73kcal/day to heat it up. One Kcal = the american calorie.

So in this "I always have perfect temperature water available" scenario, this translates to about 7.6lbs a year.

I doubt holding ice on your shoulders somehow performs better than this. Much of the heat will come from the environment, and your body doesn't always prioritize heating up your extremities - it focuses on your core temp.

***

TL;DR - if you want to "cheat" weight loss using temperatures, then drink a lot of cold water, but don't overdrink because that's bad too.I have 115 pounds from my starting to goal weight, and when I first joined the sub I will admit I was a little taken aback by the people that came here needing to lose 10-20 pounds.  Shame on me.

Because now, I LOVE those posts. Please please please keep coming here! With so much to lose, I make mini-goals -- my next is 50 total pounds down at 195, which is still obese. And 195 sounds so, so, so good sometimes compared to where I was, but then someone posts their progress pics from 170 to 150, or 150 to 130, and I'm like, holy crap, I need to keep going! I'm going to get there someday and I'm thankful there's a community here to support those last pounds...and I can't wait to get there. You guys are huge motivation for me personally, and I'm grateful you're here. I'm looking forward to joining your ranks someday and posting my progress from obese to overweight, then overweight to normal, and then honestly from normal BMI to some vanity pounds.

If there's anything us "bigger losers" can do to help motivate you, please let me know and I'll be sure to be mindful of that as we all work on getting healthy!In my opinion, if you know you're below your TDEE, stick with what you think you can maintain. If you aim for 1200 and are always hungry, you're probably going to end up eating more, feeling bad about it, etc. If you can maintain 1500, great! You've got to aim for something that doesn't make you suffer, and you can maintain for a longer period, make sense doesn't it?

Also, remember your metabolism will *proabaly* get used to the 1500, and you may later be able to reduce it a bit if you feel like it. Important thing is if you do that and start having problems, it's probably just that you need the 1500, and going back to that is perfect.

I'm 24, 5'9, and started at around 122kg (265lbs), did 1500 for about a year, lost around 35kg (77lbs) that way, then decided to lower it to 1200, but I was already extremely accustomed to very small portions, etc. I would've never been able to start with that number.

Good luck!Do you know any more about the test? Or if there's a better one out there? This is actually the first time I've done the fasting blood test, so I don't know a whole lot about it. But I do know that the result was split into at least two different values (my good cholesterol was good, but the bad cholesterol was a medium-bad reading).Thanks! It's a great feeling. I got lazy and gained 10lbs back so I'm in the process of reversing that again but it's amazing what just a little bit of willpower and devotion will do for you Thanks :) I have been there before where I were pretty heavy, and the festival is amazing!

So am looking forward to enjoy myself while there. Congrats! That is a great accomplishment! Last idea re: running outside, and then I'll let it drop - do you have any running groups in your area? Where I live (...Canada) there are tons of Running Room groups. There's a minimal fee, and you go once a week with the group. It's awesome because the leader sets the pace, so you know how fast or slow to go, you can meet new people or you can keep to yourself, and nobody would be "judging" you (they're not judging you anyway, I promise), because you'd be in a group. And the runs don't have to be long. If you can do 6mph for 10 minutes, you can do 5mph for 20 or 30.

Every response to people's suggestions has been an excuse. I think maybe you just don't like running? That's okay. Try swimming. Try biking. Try anything. I think he was just doing a bit of troubleshooting to let me know examples of foods in my diet that might be causing it.

He seemed to be on top of his game, and mentioned the whole thing about the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee dropping the charges on cholesterol. Told me not to worry about eggs (unless I was eating a crazy amount), etc.

But this is a good point. The cheese is likely not the biggest culprit. It's probably just being overweight and unhealthy-ish in general.I use the nuvaring and everything is normal with it, but I don't know how it would be without bc.. probably a hot messI lived in London for 6 years, and the gym I belonged to had TVs built into the treadmills. It was awesome. I didn't workout that hard but it made the time go fast... I can't stand watching tele on a small screen but thanks for the suggestion.I kept my pledge yesterday :) Thank you so much! It is a small but strong step towards my goal!I live in England and most of the television i watch is on the internet so i can't really do that but thanks for the suggestion anyways.I once fixed a whole in the wall at my gym got free shit for a year I'm not interested in getting much bigger as muscles go. For now it has no benefit job or health wise, as I already run daily so cardiovascular health is fine, and I stretch so my back muscles are also in good shape. That and I work everyday for 14 hours, so when I say I haven't got time for strength training I mean I've got about 30 minutes of free time a day I'd rather spend doing low impact exercise like running or stretching. Hello, thank you so much for replying.

I have been through what you described. There have been times where I've felt I need to throw up what I ate because it was so excessive. It is a horrible feeling.

I will take your advice and find out the calories of fast food whenever I feel like ordering and eating it. One thing I did yesterday was block all the take-out websites on my browser and re-direct them to MFP. I think that will help.

Thanks for your support!That's shitty advice. See someone else. I go to a psychologist and have a separate doctor give me meds but I keep them both updated on what the other is saying/doing so it works well together. I'm more of an inside sort of person so I'm not really right for running outside, plus I don't like people judging me and it would feel like everyone looking at me would be. Also I can't keep myself paced properly when im running outside and I stop running far to easily' i find its better for me if i can just hit 6mph and just do that for 10 mins. Thank you for the suggestion anyway.Thank you so much! &lt;3Thank you! &lt;3Hello, and thank you for replying!

I started using MFP yesterday and I love it, I find it extremely useful, I think it will help me a lot to keep control of what I eat.

I don't have any hobbies right now. I kinda lost interest in everything when I became so depressed, but I want to make exercising a daily activity that entertains me, helps me stay healthy, and also helps with depression itself. It will require a lot of discipline, but I'm determined.

Thank you for your kind words and feel free to PM too :)Use it as a realisation. The whole life is short motto and what not. It should spur you on to be as happy and healthy as you can beI haven't used Zombies Run! yet, but I'm half way through the Zombies Run 5K app. It's really fun, it makes me want to run more, I'm sad I have to take days off in between the runs. I can't wait to complete the 5k app so that I can start running with the regular app. I just bought new runners today.
Oh, and apparently it also works on treadmills, but I still think outside running is way better.

Two years ago I tried to get into running with a different c25k app and lost interest some weeks in, the story of zombie run really helps!

edit: you can also check out /r/runner5 and /r/runner5k two subs about that app.
I gained weight on sertraline but only because it didn't work for me and made me feel depressed when I never had been before (was given it for anxiety). I had no desire to do anything and my life was work, food, and sleep.. six months later my jeans didn't fit lol. So glad to be off of ssris.From a woman's perspective, I think she looks awesome in both pics. But weight is extremely personal, and everybody has their own goals. Looking good, dude! You look great! :DIt's not really worth it. I tried that with my anxiety until I was having daily panic attacks. It's a year later and three different meds and a therapist later, but it's finally improving. It was impossible for me to really deal with lifestyle changes on top of the anxiety and panic but now it all works together and I feel better.Soup! I have soup every day for lunch. Thai chicken curry, or chicken tortilla soup, or potato bacon (lower in cals than one would expect), etc. Or a big salad with roasted veggies and quinoa. And tonight we're having tacos with refried beans and tvp (textured vegetable protein - way, WAY lower in cals and fat than ground beef) with all the fixings. Go on Pinterest and look up "low cal dinners" - tons of ideas. SquatsSounds bogus to me. 500 calories is a lot of energy. That's 42% of my daily caloric goal and the entire deficit I'm try to make in my weight loss. That's the equivalent of me jogging for 45 min but I can do it without even noticing? Doesn't make sense. I'm going to notice when I have to expend that much energy in a short period of time. This line "So dont expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight." Also seems to be a red flag. I wouldn't be surprised if this product comes with a recommended diet to optimize results. Don't follow the diet? Than you haven't used the product properly and don't have a case for false advertising/non-results. I also imagine it's very uncomfortable which will prevent people from being able to "use it properly"."Oh no it's the cops! And a construction worker?" Just a quick recommendation: 1200 a day is really low when you're beginning. When your body is accustomed to, say, 2500+ calories a day, going to 1200 is stressful to your system causing you to get overly tired and lose the willpower to keep going.

Depending on your height and weight, it might be better to start with around 2000 calories a day while incorporating exercise and then work your way down to 12-1300 over a few months.Thanks, I'll try this! I think there's an app which is a "run from zombies" kind of story that you can listen to while you run to make it more fun. It's called "Zombies, Run!" I don't have it nor used it myself but if anyone has used it they could chime in. For solids, always use grams.

For liquids, either will be very accurate (making sure you're using a proper measuring cup though). From a mans perspective I've no idea why on earth you'd want to lose another 11lbs. You look great and I'd personally focus on trying to develop some performance goals now rather than keep slashing calories to end up skinny instead of lean.My $15 scale has worked just fine too. It's not necessary to spend more (though the bells and whistles of other scales may be nice to have)Is your rice cup maybe instead telling you how much raw rice to use to end up with 1 cup cooked rice?

You should be able to pick up baking measuring cups at the dollar store. 200 Day Streak on MyFitnessPal today. Definitely the longest I've kept it up. I may not have always logged everything or stayed under my goal everyday, but I've actively made watching/being aware of my calories a habit and that's what is important.Based on your numbers, you were aiming for a 300-500 calorie/day deficit? If you managed to attain a 500 calorie/day deficit without *any* days that go over 1400, then you would have lost a pound a week.

So if you're hovering between 1400 and 1600 plus once a week going not just over 1600 but over your TDEE (and you don't specify by how much), I'm not sure why you were still expecting 1lb per week loss. You might be able to eek out 1/2 lb per week at best in that situation honestly and again - depending how much you were over by you could be back to no weight loss.

Couple this with what /u/Murf_ says - your TDEE given by calculators are just an estimate - so yours could very well be 1800 or even 1700.

No add on top of that... just how accurately are you measuring every thing you're eating? Are you measuring the oil used in cooking? Are you measuring the cream and sugar in your coffee? Are you measuring every condiment and sauce you eat accurately? Any errors are going to cut into the caloric deficit you though you created.

Increase the accuracy of your calorie counting, lower your caloric goal to a hard 1500 max and stick to it 7 days a week - not just 6. If you want a 'cheat' day then lower the caloric intake the other days. I am bulimic. Mostly recovering through regular therapy sessions. I was prescribed topamax and Wellbutrin. Apparently they are a popular combo for people with compulsive behavior issues.When I started my journey I had been fat for so long. I knew how to fix it, and that is what I ended up doing, so for me it was not ignorance that kept me fat. My lovely husband tried to nugde me in the right direction, I had help from outside, nothing helped.

The thing that worked for me was when I managed to get my head in the right space. I do not know even now 9 monts later why it worked this time and not earlier, but I was ready. I changed my eating and started running.

I have tried many times before too lose this weight, and like so many before I have given up and shot back up. I am now the lightest I have been since I was around 16, and i KNOW it will stick.

What could my SO have done? I do not know, but I know he tried and failed. I needed to want this for myself.
&gt; I try to compliment him on any weight loss I notice

I know if my SO had told me that, I would almost want to spite him, complement on other things. Like you look good today, that shirt suits you!

Unless you can make sure he never eats anything you havn't prepared for him, he needs to do this himself. Support him even if he does not want to do it your way. If he wants to focus on something else, encurrage that.

If you want to try to make him eat better do not say: "Look hon, that is low calories, why do you not order that?" Rather something like, "Oh, that looks soo good, I think I will have that" Do not focus on it if he doesn't want to.

Sorry about the ramblingThis is the only thing you can do to make running fun. Treadmills are absolutely the most boring thing in the world. Go outside, get fresh air, hear the birds chirping, see other people, be alone in your thoughts while out there. It's a good time just to get away from it all.Log, log, log -- even if you stop following the food program because of your crisis, log.

I've been down this road a number of times: Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Low-Carb, Rotation Diet ... each worked (for a while).  Each program involves logging food -- and I'd get to this point where I felt like, okay, I understand my food now. "I've got this." And I'd continue but drop the logging.  Within a few weeks, the entire effort dies.

So, of course, I'm logging again with this try but I looked back on those other tries and realized that it was the logging that made them work and dropping the logging made it quit.  This is day 216.  "I've got this" again.  I obviously know how to eat correctly to lose weight.  But I won't quit logging, not now and not a year from now, not five years from now.

Logging is the thing that keeps awareness in my effort.  Awareness is the key ingredient to control.  If I'm having a crisis like you are, I'll eat whatever food comes whenever it comes because I don't have time or strength or care for control.  I will log it (which takes no time, I'm really practiced at it by now) and keep going.  I'll take my control when I can, and not worry at all about control when I can't.  My control will still be better here and there and will be entirely back as soon as the crisis is passed.

So, my advice is to log.  Log like nothing else matters.  It's not magic, and it's not physiological, its psychological.  Awareness, then control. Found one on my knee. Turns out it's my IT band. It's misguided at best.

I'm guessing that the "aim" is to achieve cryolipolysis, which is a procedure performed (I think) by a physician where they take a vacuum device, place it against your skin, and it brings a chunk of skin in there (say, your love handles).

When the skin is in there, it's introduced to cold temperatures. The device works in such a way that it doesn't give you frostbite, but chills your fat, it also restricts bloodflow from entering that area for the duration of the treatment. After a few treatments, you lose fat and weight because the fat breaks down.

Treatments usually take about an hour. It's also quite expensive.

According to a number of studies (goto google scholar and have a look for "cryolipolysis weight loss"), the procedure actually works.

***

Unfortunately, this vest will not do shit other than make you cold and possibly give you frostbite. The guy doesn't even use good "before and after" photos. He has a quote from a guy who went from the 300s to the 200s, and then posts a picture of a relatively skinny guy and then a girl who definitely look like they're purposely sticking out their guts. Unless one of these models are about 7 foot - 8 inches, then I call bullshit, or the seller is a charlatan who can't even write a decent kickstarter brief.

(Please upvote OP's post so that others can see the discussion behind this gimmick. Someone will inevitably stumble upon this and buy one unless they're educated on the topic).phew, as a keto-er, I would be only able to eat half of this (meat +veggies) anyway :) And to be clear, it was a splurge, it was just about twice what I would eat for a normal dinner instead of 4 times lol
The logic is sound - your body does use quite a few calories to keep you warm but we have no way to verify their claims that it would burn 500 calories in 2 hours but I suspect that to be a gross exaggeration.

Every once in a while, someone posts that drinking ice water causes your body to burn more energy - which again is true since your body does spend energy to warm up the water to maintain your body temperature. *But* (and it's a really big but) if you sit down and do the math - which I did once - drinking the recommended 8 glasses of water as ice water instead of tap water when the math was done worked out to only an additional about 80 calories per day (sorry can't remember the exact, definitely under 100 calories, can redo the math if interested).

So based on the ice water math, I highly doubt that 2h of this vest could burn 500 calories.

Further, even if this vest burned 500 calories per day, does that teach you how to eat well for life, or do they expect their users to wear the vest for the rest of their lives? Any temporary change will only ever give temporary results.

Edit: a letterThis post is especially for you. When I started doing this mindful, circuit-breaker method, I used to binge like you did.  Like everything else, it's a practice -- the first attempts won't be as good as the well-practiced occasions later.  Hope this helps you, too!Might have something to do with this http://www.livestrong.com/article/517370-taking-vitamins-and-iron-with-tea/#page=1Fixed your life after ruining 2 others. Congrats?Yep! Months in and I'm also still shocked at how few calories and how filling a decent sized, well balanced meal can be. Keep it up, OP!My exercise is walking. At my fastest, it is a moderate 3.5 mph but 90% of the walks are at a good 3.0 mph clip -- a 20 minute mile. At my peak, it is 5 times a week at 60 minutes each.

My resting heart rate was between 85-90 before I started.  At my peak, my resting rate got to 55-60.  Even now, its winter and the ground is snow covered, I'm getting out about 3 times a week and my resting rate is 60-65.

A little mild exercise goes a long way for the heart!It had a lot of carbs the difference is I ordered steak fajitas instead of ground beef quesadillas and I ate most of the refried beans but left the rice for meal 2I have a friend at work who was complaining about her weight and I casually mentioned how well calorie counting has worked for me and she looked at me like I'd grown a second head. Well I've lost a bunch of weight so clearly it works...It's okay. I forgive him. Yeah, it sucks, but life's not fair and everybody makes mistakes. It's hypocritical to judge.

btw it's pretty easy to kill people with a car even if you're not drunk.Hey, whatever works. I just rather blow money on video games than running shoes when I have perfectly good normal shoes.He blames his job for the weight; A job which he also claims he loves. He works anywhere from 60-100 hours a week in construction management. He hasn't had a raise or bonus since he started,  so that in itself is pretty demoralizing.  Since he took this position two years ago, I've watched the scale go up. The job has put a lot of stress on him, our relationship, and life in general. When stressed/depressed he turns to food. But, he refuses to change jobs because he thinks there is huge gain to be had in the long term. He makes very bad eating decisions and blames convenience or too busy to do anything more. He'll skip meals, order two sandwiches instead of sandwich and salad, etc because he says he's got be be on the road or job and doesn't have time to sit down and eat.I must admit I'm a spender when it comes to gadgets. I spent money on an aria scale and a fitbit, and on top of that a cheap scale for food.If you're losing right now, you have to remember that once you do reach your goal weight you can actually back off a little on how aggressive you have to be. Not too much or it'll creep, but losing weight is hard and takes a lot of focused effort. Maintaining is actually much easier (if your activity stays the same).ScamLet's give them the benefit of the doubt (this is the internet, we can believe whatever) and assume they're an empathetic human being - in which case, they definitely think every day about the lives they ruined.

What do you expect them to do about it? Kill themselves? Well, I don't think OP's life is worth any less than the people they killed. Those guys deserved to live long, fulfilling lives, and so does OP.

Every life is sacred, and completely writing somebody off due to mistakes they made is exactly the kind of bullshit people are pulling when they fat-shame. Yeah obviously there are degrees of seriousness here, but the underlying fallacy is the same. It's hypocritical - everybody makes mistakes.

Let's try and keep this place welcoming and encouraging.I started counting my pounds in terms of kilocalories, it makes me feel like I'm doing more when I look at my stats :-)
When I'm doing weights it also reminds me that just because I didn't lose anything this week doesn't mean I didn't lose fat, I can look down and still see a difference.I said together because I can't constantly be eating Taco Bell or cooking fried food at every meal, when he obviously needs to eat too. But ultimately I guess you're right, of he wants it bad enough, he'll ignore what I do in favor of a healthy decision.If it seems too good to be true, if is. There are no quick fixes in weight loss that are sustainable Drop your calories a little more? Increase protein? Drop sugar/carbs? These are all questions because I really don't know. Your current progress looks great, but I know what it's like to juuuuuuust want to take a little more off. Keep doing what you're doing, maybe it's just a plateau and you need to power through it! I'm guessing that with only spending 6 months in prison for killing 2 people, you spend a lot of time watching your back for friends and family of the deceased?I don't have kidsMy question exactly! I thought I was the only one struggling to sign up. My phone won't allow me. If you happen to find out, I would appreciate some help. Vice versa, of course. I don't have a phone to begin with, but that sure sounds fancy. My $15 scale is like the only money I've put towards losing weight, aside from new, smaller clothes.Good luck!! That festival looks amazing! Do NOT get a fancy coffee beverage with whipped cream. Already talked myself out of it once today...just need to do that all day.

Lol and the more you lose the easier it is to keep it off, sitting down just isn't comfortableI'm not sure about more fun, but I find the time goes faster when I do intervals, or use my heart rate monitor to make sure I'm in the correct heart rate zone for my workout.

I like watching tv while on a treadmill (as long as it's the tv right in front of me, or I tend to go sideways and fall off), but I find I get distracted (obviously) and don't pay as much attention to the stuff I need to, like heart rate and making sure I'm working hard enough. My elbows have always been extremely pointy and bony no matter how fat I have gotten. Is it a thing for meat/fat to go there on some people? There was a scale I would've loved to pick, but it was way too expensive for me: it connected with your phone using bluetooth, and if you gave it the name of the thing you were weighing (for example, raw chicken) it automatically added proteins and calories and the like to your MFP.Omg I thought I was the only one. I had been chubbier my whole life! I was like "how the f- do skinny people sit for long periods of time?" ... still not used to it but it's not a bad problem to have :)You could watch netflix on a phone/tablet. My gym has tvs on all the treadmills, which is really nice for relieving boredom.Run outsideSame with me! When I'm standing or laying down now I'll absentmindedly sort of tap/bounce my wrists off my hip bones just because they're there.

Then again, it's also made me realize how much extra bulk (you could say fat too haha) is really still on my frame :-/The pain in the morning after workout is indeed sweet.

It makes me wake up with a smile, knowing that I have grown. That I have made progress. :-) TDEE is just an estimate and can vary according to the person and situation. If your weight is not moving you either need to eat less or move more.

It's also worth going over your tracking with a fine-toothed comb - MFP values can be very funky. Don't discount cooking oil, alcohol, etc. Be pessimistic when tracking.

OP, do you account for oils when frying your food or in your salads?only semi-relevant, but you reminded me of on of my favorite quotes:

http://anniesiskwrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ghost-4001.jpg
My commitment for the next 24 hours is to research nutrition and motivate myself to want to eat healthy - as opposed to willing myself to eat healthy because I know it's the right thing to do. This right here is my biggest hurdle. I understand I should eat healthy, but I don't truly WANT to for some reason.I wish somebody would have told me sooner. This is like the best kept secret everThat is so awesome! haha I hope to have this happen to me! :DPita pizza.  One pizza can be made for a little over 200 calories if you buy the right ingredients.  I guess I should be happy for you, but seeing you killed 2 people while intoxicated makes me not like you. Sorry. Good if you turned your life around, but 6 months was probably not enough time for you. If he is no longer a threat than what objective good does imprisonment accomplish?

I suspect you just want to see someone suffer, not see a benefit in the situation, as indicated by your wishing him to get stomach cancer.

How pious and moral of you.I think one important thing is to **not pressure him into eating things he doesn't want to**. Not even a little bit.

You may currently structure some of your activities around food: cooking and eating together, going out to eat, etc.  This is very natural, as you may want to share eating experiences with him. However, as someone who is naturally thin, you may underestimate just **how** difficult it is to plan and maintain a diet under the best circumstances, even without having to concede calories due to outside forces.

So please just don't do anything to undermine his diet. Be considerate about what things might undermine his diet without meaning to. This includes giving him food, insisting on eating the same foods as him, suggesting a bottle of wine with dinner, wanting to go out to eat, etc.as a society, as a specie, we need rehabilitation to work. otherwise we're all just going to end up as type two psychopaths. ever seen "the road"? horrifying.No, I don't think I'd be seeking revenge.

If he can be reasonably deemed no longer a threat to society than he should be released. He has quit drinking and has lost weight, they could put a breathalyzer ignition in his car before they consider imprisonment.

His intent was not to harm people so I do not think he possess an innate trait which makes him a danger to the public.

My family has been effected by the malicious acts of others, I still don't feel as though that means they should be imprisoned for their entire life. Don't be so presumptuous.

&gt;How do you know he is no longer a threat to society?

Can you demonstrate that he still is? He has quit the activity which endangered himself and others. Putting someone in a cell for the rest of their life is rarely a reasonable solution.

What good does ruining another person's life do for society? Shall we lash thieves as well?

Yeah, I'd say this. Probably the other car's fault but he got slapped with a DUI.I feel worse than before when it comes to my appearance.

I am healthier and can get back to my old athletic lifestyle but now I have loose skin on my abdomen, hips, ass and a bit on my thighs and pelvis.

Quite honestly I despise how I look now except for my face. I hope my skin will improve on it's own significantly over the next couple years but as of now I am quite depressed about it. I am 20 years old and have the skin of an old man, I loathe myself for ever allowing my life to get so out of hand and I feel cheated because I will never have the body that I want no matter how hard I work. I question the extent to which someone can ignore appearance and often feel like I am going to be alone for the rest of my life, either due to the revulsion of others or my own disdain for myself.

Realistically it isn't that bad, if it still bugs me I'll have surgery to remove the skin form my abdomen and hips but I am not fond of that idea or reaching that point. I try to focus purely on the objective goals I've met. I am faster and healthier now. I am going to work on lean gains for now.

I am 6ft. 6in. and went from 340lbs to 255lbs in under 6 months if anyone is curious. My understanding is that I will see my skin at it's worst due to the rapid loss but eventually it will recover to the same point it would have if I lost slower, at least I hope so. I hope to reach 210-220lbs by the end of summer.

I don't see a difference in my appearance other than my face.
I think Subway is my favorite restaurant.  I go there usually 4-5 times a week.  I usually get either the oven roasted chicken or ham and egg white with no cheese, add brown mustard.  I used to get baked chips but they honestly do nothing for me other than make me want another bag.  Great job on sticking to it!How do you know he is no longer a threat to society? Because he lost some weight and stopped drinking for a year?

I don't know what world you're living in, but I am uncomfortable with people drinking and driving, killing multiple people and getting a slap on the wrist. I suspect you'd feel differently if it was your family OP mowed down while drunk.No, I suppose some people support attonement and giving a person a second chance.What is the point in being in prison if he is no longer a threat to society other than your warped sense of justice?
Eggs are great, nuts and legumes also but nuts are high in calories so eat them sparingly. Some vegetables have a surprising amount in them considering they are veggies! Spinach, broccoli - it won't be where you get your full amount from but every little helps! Milk and dairy although can be calorific, especially cheese, so watch them... I'll try to think of more but there was a brilliant post on /r/1200isplenty the other day with a vegan day which had plenty of protein in it :)Hi! You and I seem to be in the same place right now with weightloss (5'4" SW:242 CW:198 Started losing this summer).

Do you feel the need for bread, cheese, and sweets in one day? Normally I have a day of eating some portion of all of these 1-2 a week but usually I would rather have a larger amount of veggies/fruit or a fattier meat with those calories.

I also have generalized anxiety but not manifested as OCD. I calorie count religiously 6 days a week and give myself my busiest day as "eat smart and don't worry about it". I would rather wean myself off of MFP slowly when I reach my goal and can maintain without counting than hinder my weightloss.

Typically the morning for me is coffee and maybe a protein drink, lunch is stir fry veggies and fruit, dinner is chicken/fish/lean beef with veggies and a healthier carb (sweet potato, wild rice, whole grain bread), and I do sometype of dessert a few times a week (banana bread, smoothie, protein shake, sugar free pudding, etc.)

Good luck!Just being honest, you should be in jail for a long time and perhaps the rest of your life.

I hope you think everyday about the lives you ruined.Fat free 1/2&amp;1/2. It has fewer carbs than skim milk and to me it tastes better. If I feel the need for sweetener I add Stevia.M 27 5'10'' SW: 305 CW: 235 GW: 180? I don't really have a goal... just want to be more comfortable with myself.



ANYWAY! I was at 290 pounds when I went and met a bunch of new people. Met a really nice girl, who was then and is still completely out of my league. I didn't do anything about it, but I thought to myself, I don't want to be able to think anyone is out of my league, but I can understand why someone like her wouldn't care about me if I don't care about myself.  I started Keto the next morning. That was in November. So that was my first aha moment about getting serious about weight loss. Then about a month and a half in, I realized I was mentally a lot healthier on keto and I decided I do not plan on stopping this even after I'm at my goal. I'll up my intake and eat at maintenance, but it's not a diet for me anymore.



The girl in question is now a friend of mine but I don't see anything happening romantically there.. Shux. I did learn last time I hung out with her that she browses /r/keto which is insane to me because she is tiny and I know for a fact she has no qualms about eating a bunch of cookies...It was truly is a relief to discover I loved working out so much. I worried I wouldn't like it or I feared the pain. Not the case at all, I relish the pain.  Every morning I wake with the ache of a hard work out from the day before it taked everything I have not to skip work and do it all again.I'm eating 1660 calories a day (because that's what MFP recommended for me) and I'm losing more than 1lb a week! It depends on your build and then number of calories you were eating before I guess. I'm F/21/5"8 and my starting weight was 204lbs. I've lost 11lbs in 5 weeks eating at 1660 and it didn't feel like a difficult change to make. I'm sure the calories will have to get a bit stricter as my weight comes down but for now it's working for me!There are couple of things I look forward to consistently these days. Exercise is one of them.

I teared up a bit while writing this. I think its my body's way of thanking me.  MFP suggests nutrition goals. Being healthy isn't just about burning calories; it's about a healthy intake of nutrients that are in proportion with each other. You should aim to reach but not exceed the nutrition goals provided. If you go over or under by a little bit every once in a while, that's not a huge deal, but there is more to being healthy than having a lower calorie intake and utilizing the nutritional goals on MFP is a great way to familiarize yourself with that. I have a measuring jug that does several measures, and on it they have both American and UK cup sizes which differ dramatically. I never knew it either, but it was interesting to see!No reason to stop fapping!! Anyway! I can attest from experience and playing too much EQ / WoW in Highschool that you're making the right choice!  Far better now than in college when you really want to enjoy the world.I'm the same height as you and was almost the same weight when I started just over a month ago.

I use MFP to count my calories and it said I should eating around 1,200, I also exercise about 3-4 weeks. I have started to lose weight and I'm sure you will to. Hello, I've browsed this forum for about a day before deciding to join. I actually stumbled a bit into wanting to lose weight, it's been something at the back of my head for a while.

I'm R (F), 22, and I'm 5'11 and weigh anywhere around 90-100kg (I don't own a scale, but will head to my parent's next week and borrow theirs). Last time I weighed myself this summer I was 92kg/203lbs, borderng obeese if you believe BMI is accurate. My (ultimate) goal weight is about 72kg (160lbs), which I haven't weighed since before I was fully grown! In 2013 I lost a bunch of weight and was around 84kgs for a while, but then life changed, and I gained again. That time I didn't actively start trying to lose weight, it kind of just happened, but now I need to actively make that choice because as I said: life is different.

I've kept track of my calorie intake, and  try to make it to the gym 2-3 times a week (mostly cardio). I'm a week in (or week 3 on exercise), and I'm already feeling a lot better. I feel positive about this. Since my goals are less number oriented and more health/feeling better there is less of a pressure to perform well, which has been my downfall a lot of times before.Ya you'll be fine, your skin hasn't been at its current stage for that long either.What does "vigorous" dieting mean and what is your training like? It's true that you can do a body recomposition where you eat maintenance calories and just exercise to build muscle while losing weight (however both are at a slower rate but at least you're gradually looking better), but if your program or workout routine sucks, it'll get you no where.

Id recommend bulk. It is far easier for most people to lose weight than build muscle. Eat a lot. And get on a program that focuses on big compound lifts, like SS, SL, ICF.Wow what a great turn-around, just be mindful as you go into maintenance mode, don't let old habits creep back! I think best thing to remember is 1lb is approximately 3500 calories.  Even huge binges usually don't get too terribly close to that number on a single given day.

So, even if you have what you thought was a good day yesterday and then hop on scale and has a number you weren't expecting, don't worry, you didn't go super crazy on calories to gain 3 pounds in one day. The converse is true, if you had a day that got out of control with eating, you probably didn't eat 1 extra lb (3500 calories!) worth of food to cause the scale to fluctuate. Water weight is usually what you see (especially after very salty foods).

So i guess mainly, don't be discouraged, look at loss over time and try to stick to your plan!Exactly - There is huge doubt about the links between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol.

Not to mention your bog-standard cholesterol test is fast becoming outdated too.I'm at a plateau right now and it sucks. I lost 10 pounds last month. 11 Days into this month with no dietary changes from last month and I have not dropped a single pound. I have, however, increased my workout intensity, so I assume I am holding onto water-weight, but still its trying on my motivation to see the scale not budge even a 1/10th of a pound.

From what I have read, plateaus will always pass as long as you are consistent and honest with your counting. *terrified shrieking*When I started, getting even this far seemed like a possibility, and to be honest, a part of me still believes that I won't get to the end. I have to break it up into smaller goals or it would be too overwhelming to try to achieve.Yeah, that's the one that people always ask me about. The reason I cut out rice is because I eat a lot of potatoes. Sooo many potatoes, that I really don't need the carbs or calories from rice. I suppose if you aren't eating a metric shit ton of potatoes, then you could probably eat some rice too and still have the same results.Man it really wasn't! I would let it go on for about 9-12 weeks, but anything longer made me really run down, so I would go to the doctor and get medication to stop it. I would take it for 3 weeks, have the heaviest and worst period of my life after, then one regular period, and then it reverted back to the 3 month thing. It made me miserable, and all I wanted was to take it all out cause I was so exhausted.

Now I feel like a different person! I love knowing that it's going to be gone in a few days, and that I don't have to dress like I'm going to a funeral for the next 3 months!This post has too little content  **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Floseit&amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2vmyao/does_it_matter_if_you_go_over_your_fat_on_mfp_if/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

As you suggest you're at a disadvantage for the actual contest but a big advantage for actually succeeding in real, long-term life which is far more important.No it's which serving size measurement to fall back on if they don't line up. It's not always cups, and in fact many of the foods I see just say one piece or one package.Body dysmorphia is a bitch :( I'm weighing daily right now but I'm kind of aware from reading here that it can go up and down. It's interesting what a difference it can make when I'm feeling a little bit dehydrated and I weigh myself and see I'm 0.5-1k lighter than the day before.

I think over time I will get bored of doing it every day and do it less often. It's just super important to know it's there to see that what I'm doing is working.Oh wow.

The realisation that half portion of a 'healthy option ' in a restaurant can be 900 kcal...A bad day won't undo all your hard work now! Do NOT give up! You are an inspiration to ME to have actually lost weight and also been going hard at the gym! I am nearing the end of my second day and wanted to binge so badly but I came and saw your post and it has inspired me to stay on track! You can do it!!!

Remember if you gave up now, gained it all back and tried to lose weight in a few months time you would look back to this day and kick yourself. Tomorrow you'll be wishing you started yesterday! So you just realised that cups is a very poor way to measure anything. Grams and milliliters don't lie.I'm guessing that it was the kind of situation that could've happened even if not intoxicated. Maybe the accident wasn't his fault but he got sentenced anyway for being intoxicated? Just a guess.Awesome thanksHaha, know that feeling of people telling you shit. For years I thought I'd have to never eat meat again, start juicing every vegetable in the world and never even think about pizza.

Admittedly though, that's kinda on me. I never really get too "Oh I should've started forever ago" because I know I wasn't really too ready. If I was, I would've found this all out myself before I did. I could've just googled and found the information I needed, but I didn't want to. I kept "It'll be too hard" up as a protective barrier. Congrats on your progress, but I gotta ask:  how are you NOT still in prison?  Obviously, you're rehabilitating and there's lots of hope for you, but I would think that killing 2 people because of driving under the influence would warrant a lot more than 6 months incarceration.This could not have come at a better time. Gotten back in to losing weight after numerous strings of failure. By the end of this, if all things go well, I should be extremely close to my goal weight!

Wishing everyone the best of luck!Ugh, seriously! This actually kinda makes me mad. People go on and on about how hard it is, and just always believed them.

Yes, it is hard if you do it hard core right away. But if you ease into it (like everything other damn thing in life) it's not that bad. Obviously, generally speaking.

If anyone, anyone at all, had told me just eating better would work on its own, I'd have done it forever ago. But no, everyone made me think I had to crash diet, I had to kill myself at the gym, and I had to never eat a carb agin if I wanted to get fit.

Bullshit.

I cut down on my calories and walk sometimes. Yay new body! I guess I'm just bitter that I could've done this years ago but didn't because I was terrified of how hard it would be and that my life would be miserable. Wow thanks. I didn't know it was that different, since looking at the cup looks very much like a cup, however from what I've learned it's less than half of a standard cup.Calculate your BMR using an online calculator and use that as your base rate. Mine has oz, grams, pounds, and ml. I wasn't sure if fluid ounces and the ounces in a pound were totally interchangable. And thank you, I needed to know which one to fall back on. Green tea (well, caffeine) is a stimulant and stimulants suppress appetite.  Just my guess.&gt; To be Normal I'd have to be low to a weight I can't consider healthy for myself.

I mean, have you tried it?
DID YOU FUCKING MORONS MISS THE PART WHERE HE KILLED 2 PEOPLE? I HOPE YOU GET PAINFUL STOMACH CANCER AND DIE VERY VERY SLOWLY.Great going! I had a similar moment recently :)thanks for your advice.

I have been diagnosed with OCD so it's on my medical record. But I've also been told it's actually general anxiety disorder since it doesn't manifest as obsessive actions. But in that case I wish she would tell me that's the reason because I have had therapy for it and have no intentions of contracting an eating disorder on top of everything else.

Like I said lately I've been eating more junk food or street food like falafel although I try to avoid outright garbage like potato chips and chocolate bars etc. If I buy pastry I buy it in limited quantities so I don't just go to town on the box. Etc.

You're right that we all have blind spots. This diet is just hard for me to implement. Maybe I should force myself to do it anyway but the reason I was successful with calorie counting is that I wasn't "forcing" it...That's what this sub is all about-- Support. I'm glad I found it as well, glad it's here and glad it will continue to be here.

I'm nearing 40 of my 120 lbs to lose, and that's just from my first goal weight. Patience is a serious virtue. 75lb gone, and I'm still like "Can't believe it was this simple all a long"Thanks for your advice. Actually part of the reason I wanted to go to a dietitian was to get a better estimate of how many calories I should be eating to make sure I don't undereat. Maybe I should target 1500 instead. Rice cooker measuring "cups" are different from US cups, due to historical/traditional reasons. That's probably why measuring with it gives you a weird amount. :)

http://www.usarice.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=74All right, more NSV for me.
I realized my NSVs are a bit arduous when they are actually occurring! This ain't easy! And getting to post them here is like a consolation prize. :)

Grumpy now. Tired. Long day. Car in shop, had to ride bike to and from work. Means another step into being more active. Getting active again, like I always was, prior to that adrenal fatigue and sedentary lifestyle that hit me about 2 years ago. Really starting to feel it as a lifestyle, this being active--not something I am doing temporarily until I reach a goal. This is a good reframing of my thought patterns. It is really starting to sink in deeper now. This is not a sprint, it's a marathon. With cool people trudging alongside me. (Including you.)

Was about 1000 cal deficit at end of workday. Ravenous (!!!!!), wanted nice sweet yummy sandwich from coffee house, NOW!! So, I thought, I could eat just about any sandwich at 1000 cal deficit prior to bike ride home! But then, how would I log that, in my food log? God knows exactly how much of what they would put in it, to make it tasty. And so I ended up eating my pre-measured broccoli &amp; lentils from work fridge, before getting back on the bike to go home. More pleasant ride that way, when not starving/bonking.

Got home, hungry. Not entirely trusting FitBit calorie totals, so have been trying to come in each day under budget. Just in case. Logged smoothie and skipped drinking half of it cause it turned out kinda gross. Then did more hooping in my living room, just to make damn sure I didn't gain weight today. Ended up at about 750 deficit according to FitBit (which thinks I drank the whole smoothie, and I think it also underestimates my exercise on the bike). I guess I'm in the clear. I mean, something good has to be happening here, right?? Am definitely more active, eating way less sloppily, than I was Before FitBit. As soon as I have time to get to gym (which is where the scale is) I'll do my first updated weigh in.

TL/DR:  too grumpy to write one, grrrrrr!! but rambling makes me feel better; so please skip if uninterested. Breakfast I usually have a smoothie made from kale, berries and almond milk, plus a slice of wholemeal toast with butter.

Lunch is usually some sort of stew or soup but always with chick peas or lentils - something with protein.

Dinner, again protein, maybe an omelette, fish, tofu or cheese with lots of veg.

I also eat fruit as snacks - apples, mandarins, grapes.
I sometimes eat some rice or couscous alongside veg.
A glass of wine about three times a week...

It all sounds scarily healthy now that I write it down but, mostly it's what I like to eat. I might sometimes want a creamy pasta dish, or some chips, or a bag of crisps. So I have a small portion and then reduce something else to reach my calorie goal.

Hi, I'm captain obvious, and you're on reddit, and this is my comment.Hear hear. You want to help him, and that's great, but this is something he needs to do for himself. I'm a bit late to this party, but no, it absolutely does not have to be 1200. I'm 5'2" and about 130lb. I've just had to tweak my calories from 1800 to about 1600 to lose. (To be fair, I am pretty active and I have a decent amount of muscle - just trying to get rid of some of the chub that's covering it up!)

But yeah, I'm a short-arse and I eat a lot more than 1200 calories. The idea of 1200 You're significantly taller than me so I expect you'd be able to eat more.

I think the most sensible approach is to reduce calories slowly. You'll find a sweet spot where you're losing, but eating enough to keep you happy. Why restrict more than you need to?I'm going to stay under my 20 grams of carbs and 1200 calories. I'm going to understand that it's not a big deal if the scale is a tiny bit higher than yesterday. Water weight happens, and unless my numbers are consistently going up, it's not something to freak about. This is going to be my lifestyle now, and I can't live a lifestyle where I lose my mind over tiny fluctuations in numbers.Trying to stay away from nuts. I'm already at two meals and have a physically demanding job, so I'm keeping them away.Awesome--congrats!
A sweet victory, and a pretty sweet username as well!Pistachios! A lot of times I'll substitute a meal for a cup or so of these.How does one figure out how many calories they burn when they aren't exercising? Narrowest point within 1-3" inches up or down from your navel. Suck in and push out. The spot with the most difference is likely closest. Narrowest point near your navel. This part of your torso is prone to being sucked in or pushed out. You should be relaxed. The range can be 4-5" between these two. Check yourself, suck it in and push it out. Measure both. Your real waist value is between these.I can't wait until I start to have this! Thanks for renewing my strength to trudge on. :)Sometimes, we have really, really bad weeks. It has happened to probably every person who has ever tried to lose weight ever. Here's the deal, though. What happens in your eating habits is between you and (presumably) myfitnesspal/Loseitapp/the back of a checkbook you count your calories on. There's no one that's going to make snide comments, or yell at you, or judge you in any way. Your only enemy in this is you. I know, at least for me, that my worst critic is myself. If I have a bad day, I just have to distract myself. Watch a movie, read a book, take a walk. Give yourself a break from your own thoughts.A further question if I may, any benefit for drinking green tea half an hour after every meal?Anyone know how to edit this Google doc on an iPhone? My computer is currently under the weather.

I did a quick google search but came to no resultsYou need a more tests, or one authoritative one. Look at ranges for lean body mass at your height. You likely dont have that much. That is over the top for someone 2-3" taller than you. Have your tried one based on body measurements?

You didn't mention your age or sex or ethnic background. All are important.What that means is when you lose to 150, your metabolism is naturally slower than that of someone who is at 150 and never got any higher.What's worse was leaning against the wall suddenly hurt my elbows.

I wasn't even thin..actually at the high end of overweight by bmi standards. That had to be simultaneously awesome and crappy.

I'm having a hard time balancing drinks on my stomach nowadays. I'm going to miss it, but I'll also love not being able to. That's awesome!

But uh.... what kind of class is this... *chef*?That's what trash compactors are good for! I have a really hard time seeing it when I'm wearing clothing. I know it's the winter and I have to wear jeans/sweaters all the time, but I still feel just as big as I was last year, even though I've dropped a few sizes. The thing that really makes me feel better are my progress pictures that show how much muscle I've gained in my arms, back and stomach. These pictures help put things in perspective! Steady, steady my friend :). Good luck!I've reached the point where I plateau for over a week, then drop a pound...plateau for over a week, drop a pound. I stick to my 1200/day pretty strictly, too. It was a little frustrating at first, but like OP said, you have to trust that eating at a calorie deficit *is* going to take the weight off. All plateaus end eventually!I lose weight much faster with a higher calorie limit. If I set it too low, I go over and get discouraged. I say "oh well, guess I'll eat 6 pieces of pizza." I had it at about 1550 for a month, but now I'm at 1350, which, frankly, is probably too low. Slow and steady wins the race. You'll be just as skinny whether you lose it all in 2 months or in 2 years.Exactly! I think problems I have had in the past have been binging for ONE MEAL and giving up entirely. You can't undo a month in one day but for some reason I always give up. This time I won't be! I can see where you're coming from with that mindset, though in all honestly the actual eating itself is the biggest stressor out of all the things entailed in this for me - I would rather just see everything as numbers and hope counting the calories will get me to a place where I can actually enjoy food again and not abuse it like I have been.

Yeah, I am admittedly incredibly impatient. The biggest problem for me is that I had hoped to enjoy my college years to make up for the hellhole that was high school, and so far it really has made me more stressed, which I honestly didn't expect. I guess the tradeoff really is that one day down the road I may actually manage to be happy for once. That is so deeply inspiring. Good work. Thank you so much for sharing. I have been doing the low carb, high protein/healthy fat eating regime and it appears to be working. As a warning scales can be deceiving; I am a big guy and I do a fair bit of exercise so my weight bounces around by about 10 pounds depending on how much water I am holding. Exercise consistently and eat well consistently and weight loss is easy! Just dont kill yourself and not exercise for a week or binge like crazy and you will be fine!  I can understand the whole "my weight basically defines me" thing, that is exactly how I've felt the last few years of my life, all on top of highschool angst and anxiety and whatnot. It sucks and that's why I wanna beat it to the punch.

I'll work on the hobby thing, I used to do all sorts of stuff but depression has kinda rendered it all boring and unfulfilling. Hopefully I can manage to rekindle an old passion.

I'm gonna be totally honest about the friend thing, the problem now is that I feel like nobody wants to get to know me because I'm fat, but at the same time I don't want people to try and befriend me just because I got prettier. Confidence isn't really the problem, I don't think, I'm just a very private, very introverted person and that makes it hard for me to open up enough to even begin making a friend. I suppose beggars can't be choosers though, any friend is better than none.

I will certainly try your suggestion, though the campus I live on is not the best place to walk, it's like 80% hills and my poor lower back hates that. Even walking on a treadmill is killer... I suppose I just need to take small steps and build up some strength as I go.

Yeahhh tonight I actually flat-out ended the conversation and hung up while my boyfriend was on break at work tonight because I didn't want to start spewing negativity at him again, hence this post.

Oh trust me, the rambling is appreciated. Writing stuff out is cathartic and I'm both sad and glad that there are others who can relate to me in all of this. Thank you so much for your advice and kind words!

I have ADHD. Assuming you are using the term literally -- you have been diagnosed with ADHD -- it's not an excuse. It's not different from any normal person trying to change their lives. You have to learn to pre-portion your shit. You have to plan your meals. You have to exercise self-control. You have to be able to set out a plan and stick to it. You have to have a strategy for getting the munchies.

In short, it is not any different from a normal person. You just have an added difficulty curve. So what? You can be angry about the hand you've been dealt or you can do something about it. I keep a notebook with me at all times. It has a to-do list on every single page. I program timers into my phone to remind me about shit I have to do. I make back-up plans.

Take it seriously and commit to it. Lost 75 lbs a few years ago. Kept it off for 2+ yrs. Life got busy and I stopped calorie counting July 2013. I was moving locale a lot without a kitchen, had less time for exercise, etc. This all came together and I gained 32 lbs from my low, most of which I didn't notice. That's when I knew this was forever. It's taken the better part of 7 months to get back to where I want to be and I'd rather log every day than sobs half the year overweight and half at where I want to beExactly!

Ugh I am hoping I lose fat around my face and my huge stomach. I am not in proportion I have thin arms and a "small frame" but a large protruding stomach and double chin. I obviously know you can't spot target weight loss but I'm hoping my face thins out and my stomach deflates a bit!Thanks for such a detailed reply! I checked my TDEE &amp; BMR so I feel confident I can up my calorie intake now! Thanks for that!Read some Lyle McDonald Calories are important but just as important is what what the calories are made up of! Eating 2 mars bars per day might keep you within your calorie goal but it won't be very healthy!

PS: muscle is heavier than fat and so you might not lose any weight, you could potentially just tone up! I try really hard not to think about it as me losing weight but learning how to eat.  I want to see results, of course, but after years of not being in control of my eating I know that has to be the focus.  My TDEE is 1700~ as long as I am below that I'm losing.  Maybe not as fast as I would like, but in a manageable, sustainable way.  20 years ago I would have killed for this information and technology like MFP and support like this reddit.  Don't be like me and put off what you can do today.  You think toughing it out a few months or years is hard, try 20, lol.  There's no hurry.  The slower your loss the more likely you are to keep it off.  So you may not be where you want by 19, but you can be where you want and in a position to keep it that way by 25.  That may sound like forever from now, but it happens fast and you deserve to be healthy, and feel good in your own skin!Wow that is brilliant! Well done on that! Thank you for replying too!I scratched my collar bone the other week and was shocked at how my collar bone was poking out haha. I know the feel. It's pretty sweet. I'm kind of confused by your post - I know I'll have to alter my intake once I lose weight, but I'm talking about right now. Also, 175 is the highest I've ever been - before I started college I weighed 125 and then I gained 50 pounds over 5 years, so I don't feel like I would have the metabolism of someone who was obese (could be wrong, I guess). Rowing machines are just... ow.If you're relatively weak for your size and not very athletic, what about working on those areas in your body as a modest goal? Getting into better shape (with associated muscle building) will help your overall body composition look closer to what it sounds like you want. Not gonna lie, time really does crawl for me. I do my best to log everything, even if I'm not 100% sure of the calorie count I at least try to guesstimate. I've done all the calculating stuff more than once (I tried and mostly failed to shed some weight last October) and since the 1600cal a day was sorta working for me I thought dropping it down some wouldn't be a problem, but I suppose I should try increasing the threshold a bit. Actually I have no idea why I didn't think of that in the first place! Thank you for your input and advice, I really appreciate it. :)If I could up vote this twice, I would. Congrats!If you know when you have these ravenous cravings, plan for them! Portion out your 'big dinner' to make it smaller. Same for when you have your midnight snack. A few minor cuts means you can still eat to satisfy the hunger cravings you have. BUT you won't go over your limit if you reduce the amount a bit for both eating times.It was extremely fun, even though I can barely dance.Thank you so much! I've been following /r/loseit for a while just for the motivation because it is all so inspiring but I will definitely check out those other subreddits as well! Thanks!23F, 5'7'' and 135 here trying to get to 125. Going to be honest, it has to be less than 1200 net. Why? Adipose tissues dont die, they expand or shrink and if you were fat before your metabolism is slower compared to someone else at the same weight that was never overweight/obese. To maintain 135 for you should be roughly 1600 net calories a day. If you want to lose weight to 125 and average 1200 a day, losing 10 pounds would take roughly 3-4 months. This is not counting plateaus and stalls.  So when you get down to 140s, weight loss is extremely hard and 1200 wont event cut it.Ate about 1600 calories a day for about 4-5 months, with a couple cheat days and junk food here and there. Lost about 60 lbs in total. Also exercised but not regularly enough for it to be a factor in weight loss. It's almost 80% in your diet whether you lose weight or not.Visit your dietitian to help you with this problem. Account for the donuts. Let the MFP spike up in calories for today. But stop right now. Tomorrow, get back on track. In 4-5 days you won't even see this spike on your eating trends, and it will not hurt your progress in any major way.

You'll get those blips sometimes, and that's fine; we're all human after all. Don't let the blips slowly transform into bad habits that endure, however. *That's* when you need to start worrying.always go by weight. this is why so many people suggest getting a food scale, because the labels are wrong 99% of the time. does your scale have an option for oz? if so, weigh your fluids that way, or exchange the scale for a better one. mine does grams and ounces but not mils. 8 oz of milk = 1 cup = 240 mls.How'd you calculate that BMR (or TDEE)? That seems crazy high even if you're a highly active teenager. And if you *are* a highly active teenager, 1300 calories a day won't be enough to fuel all that activity.

Also, thinking you're gonna' drop 5.5 pounds a *week* is misguided at best, and dangerously scary at worst.You got it!  I love thinking about how heavy the 45lb plates are at the gym :)

Haha! I did this when I first started losing weight a few months ago. I was standing without a shirt on, looking in the mirror and thought I saw something weird. Lifted my arms overhead and yelled for my husband to come look, I could see my ribs! He laughed, but holy cow I was so excited!Congrats!! I can't wait until I get there and know how great it's going to feel, so I'm especially happy for you! That's a great achievement :)I am 5'9"F and I typically eat 1200Kcal/day.  That said my current monthly average is about 1360 due to the occasional dinner out to enjoy.

I also run 25-30 miles/week.

If you have large calorie deposits on your body, ie fat, it's not a big deal to eat low so long as you are careful to get the right macros, micros and fibre.

It is not so good *IMO* to eat that low when you get into the 'healthy' BMI range because presumably you don't have the physiological reserve you used to and you're getting close to maintenance anyway.

As for feeling miserable, I do get a little peckish sometimes but not overly so.  Eating 1200kcal of nutritious food is different from eating 1200kcal of candy.

My dinner tonight, that is keeping my belly sated as I write this was:

8oz julienne zucchini
8oz tomato
3oz mushroom
2oz spinach
1oz feta
1oz sliced black olives

All this pan fried in a non-stick pan with a miniscule amount of olive oil, no salt.  Sometimes I add paprika but tonight I ate it plain and it was very satisfying.

So yeah, YMMV, eat to feel good and fuel your body and make sure you get all your nutrients in before you hit the treats to make sure you stay in your calorie budget whatever that might be. :)
Yes, on one hand it's bad to focus on exercise only for the reward of eating food. That could just worsen your relationship with food and lead to nowhere productive. What happens if you eat a big meal but you *don't* run?

Here's some practical advice:

* [Go here](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) and calculate your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). Calculate what it is as *sedentary* to get a baseline. It's very easy to overestimate caloric burns from exercise, so don't fall into that trap.

* Get My Fitness Pal if you don't have it and start logging what you eat. Once you know how *much* you should be eating, this app can help you track that, monitor your intake and stay on track. Don't be dishonest with yourself or only log when you have good days; that won't help you one bit.

When you know how many calories your body needs (and the subsequent cuts required to lose weight), you won't have to feel afraid when you hit certain caloric numbers every day.You have good days, and you have bad days. Focusing on past failures won't lead to anything positive. Recognize that you're human and *will* have bad days. But move on today and the next day and so on to get back on track.

Bad days are blips on the radar. It's bad habits that show up as enduring trends. Don't let your blips turn into trends. You can do this.Hey there, I'm turning 28 soonish and I'm 5'3" and my highest weight was 209. I wish, *I wish so much,* that I had my shit together and started counting calories 10 years ago like you are now. I could have avoided nearly 10 painful years of shitty crash diets and sub zero confidence. I really allowed my weight to factor into everything else in my life, how much space I took up was always on my mind and I never educated myself on how f-ing *simple* it is to just eat less (track calories) and move a little more.

You are there, I wish I could go back in time and be there too. I know how hard it is to see how lucky you are when everything around you seems horrible but you are in such a great spot. You can sculpt your life into something incredible.

- Try to find a hobby, or something you can feel passionate about that can distract you. Maybe volunteer someplace interesting, you'll have a reason to be social and around potential friends.

- As the scale goes down i'm sure your confidence will most likely go up and it'll attract a few friends, it's been happening to me a lot lately and it's freaking me out.

- Try to substitute snacking with walking, or crunches or pilates. Try to train yourself to make the jump from "I'm sad/anxious/stressed so I should eat something to feel better" to "I should go for a stroll and clear my head." Look at fitness as therapy, it's helped me get over using food as a drug.

I know how you feel about wanting to say it all somewhere so you don't have to dump it on your boyfriend, I'm exactly the same way. My SO is my only real friend and he gets an earful as it is, so I try to not overwhelm him with how bad I feel at times. The truth is, since I've lost some weight I feel *A LOT* better than before, and I'm sure it'll get even better than this.

So okay I just rambled a lot sorry. I feel like I'm writing a letter to my past-self. Just try and take it slow so this change will be permanent, *do not* rush you *do not* want to crash and start all over. Invest in yourself, your life just starting up and it's within your power to make it a good one. Awww don't cry!!! We all need a boost sometimes and god knows I've needed my fair share! My boyfriend brought home thin mints today and I seriously sat in the bath and cried before promptly demanding he hide them until he can take them to work to put in his break room. We are at possibly our most fragile right now, and you know what? That's okay, because we're learning to be strong in ways we never even fathomed.

I totally get how you feel. My friends back home are naturally skinny or have gained so much weight we're just not allowed to talk about anything healthy anymore. It sucks! I'm totally on my own. Anytime I try to share my weight loss with my mom it is completely brushed off because she doesn't think she's capable of change. It is really effing hard to do this alone, but we're doing it and we're making progress and learning a ton about ourselves and those around us. I choose to see this as a beautiful thing.

If you ever need encouragement PM me :) Seriously, I could use a weight loss buddy too. And don't forget that you are a badass :)I set the goal of 30-45 minutes of cardio for my workouts depending on my day and schedule, and then when I hit whatever my goal was, I put on the song 'Aside' by the Weakerthans and push myself as hard as I can until it's over.  I don't know for sure that you'll get the reference, but given your username, it's relevant.Should read the FAQ first. It covers a lot of what you asked.Here's a little [list](http://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/why-drinking-water-early-in-the-morning-good-for-health-p214/) of the benefits of Lemon and Honey water :)Thanks for replying! I have read the FAQ a few times now but I also read on a running forum-y thing that we shouldn't be tricked into thinking we can splurge on a huge (calorie wise) meal after running. As in like is my motivation to run so I can go home and eat more? Isn't that detrimental to changing the ingrained bad habits of my over eating already? I don't know I am confused.Don't focus on the scale, focus on how you feel.  My hardest weight loss was getting from 220 to 210, and that was after losing 60 pounds that came off effortlessly.  220-210 was a GRIND where it seemed the scale stayed put for weeks.  But I came to realize that I FELT better: less pain, more energy.  I stuck with it and eventually got past it, and you can too.  Set goals for yourself in what you can do, worry about your reps/weight, perfect your motions and ignore your weight for 3 weeks.  If you stick to that, you'll come back to the scale to see a difference, or else you'll see it in yourself and the mirror.  I don't know you, but I believe in you.i understand thanks. it's probably the latter in that my tdee is 2000 and not 2500 so therefore need to eat less or exercise more. I think you should read the FAQ and educate yourself on how caloric deficits work.  That will help you make a much better plan than you have.Do you still hit a weight loss plateau by counting? That's what im doing right now. 1400 calories a day + 30min workout 5-6 days a week. I'm down 6.5lbs in a month, but I'm afraid to hit a plateau...That's so awesome!! Seriously, splurges periodically are important. You planned and you rocked it. Good job. Having lost a lot of weight quickly and gained it back, only to go about the work of losing it again, I can only tell you that if you lose a pound slowly, you're more likely to keep it off.  Losing while maintaining healthy eating habits will prepare you for a healthier life when you've reached your goal.  Eat 1500 if it's comfortable, and sneak in a 30 minute quick-walk whenever you can.  I don't know if swearing is okay in this sub, but to heck with fast.  Slow and steady, and healthy.I'm actually crying, I really needed this. I just binge ate like there was no tomorrow and just stared at my belly pregnant with all of the food I consumed tonight. My friends are largely uninvolved in healthy lifestyles (most of them are either naturally skinny or overweight with no desire to change), and my family doesn't understand why I can't just not overeat. Thank you for all of your kind words, you rock and I hope you are able to continue your journey to a healthier you There's nothing about your post that you can't change with some basic planning and willpower.

If you buy too much food at the store, buy less each time and go more often.

If you eat too much, count your calories and stop when you hit your limit.

You stop overeating by becoming aware of what's going into your body and acting in such a way that you don't eat a caloric surplus.Congratulations!  I don't think I've been a normal weight since an early teen, even at my thinnest (195, 6'1") I would have been considered overweight.  To be Normal I'd have to be low to a weight I can't consider healthy for myself.  If you're looking to put on muscle, why wait?  You'll still be burning fat by exercising, plus it's something new to keep you motivated.   Girl, you're like half way there! I have zero friends other than my SO where I live, and the friends I have in my home state do NOT want to talk about weight loss. The best thing I did for myself was become my own support system. I'm gonna seem like that crazy girl, but I talk to myself regularly. I encourage myself to make good choices when I'm grocery shopping, I tell myself to hold back when I'm staring holes into my fridge, I tell myself to go just five more minutes when I'm out power walking alone, I give myself probably 5-10 pep talks a day in front of the mirror naked.

So you had a few bad days. I have too. But you are the only person preventing you from turning that around. Tomorrow morning, log your breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks. Log it all with a smile knowing that you're breaking the cycle, starting fresh, and taking control over your health. Forgive yourself. This is not impossible. You know that, because you've already come so far! Put a bandaid on the cut and hop back on the bike. You've got this. It's you against you in this battle. Which you do you want to win?This is going to be my last post in this thread.  You should also read the FAQ, because it doesn't seem like you're understanding what I'm saying.

You are currently eating 2000 cal per day and not losing weight.  You claim to have been doing this for two years.  There are two possibilities here:

1.  You have some kind of medical issue that's causing you to not lose weight, like a thyroid problem.

2.  For whatever reason, your body just burns 2000 calories a day.

To lose weight, you need to create a deficit.  Since you're not losing weight at 2000 calories a day, then you need to create a deficit lower than that.  Either eat less than 2000 or exercise.  If you exercise, don't eat the calories back because you'll wipe out your deficit.#####&amp;#009;

So far I've lost band size but the cup sized has stayed in proportion!  Keeping my fingers crossed.but if im on 2000 kcal a day currently and tdee is 2500 and then incorporate exercise? Sorry I sound stupid but perhaps my tdee is lower than the estimates so yeah dont eat more after exrcise?You know what to do.  You messed up, no big deal.  You're still better off then when you started and this time you have more experience to help you succeed.  You can do this!
I'm 31 and I've never heard the term decolletage before. TIL.You're young, so patience is hard and I know if time is moving slow for 38 year old me it most be killer for those younger.  You have to give the process time.  I week is not long enough, heck 1 month isn't really long enough.  I'd say you have to be willing to invest time and energy into this process for at least 3 months. That means tracking and logging everything, even on days that you overeat or binge or feel like a failure.  Just keep at it.  Figure out your TDEE and try not to go over it.  If 1400 calories is too difficult up it for a little bit.  According to this calorie calculator you should be able to eat 1600 and see results.  http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/I have always believed that diet is the key to weight loss and exercise is the key to health.  Losing weight is simply a matter of eating less calories than you consume, and you can achieve that with zero exercise.  But seeing the number on the scale plateau or go up because of workouts isn't a bad thing.  Remember that how you feel is more important than the number on the scale.  Keep doing what you're doing, and eventually you'll see the results, even if the scale doesn't.Do you have any theories as to why he's been putting on weight? Maybe he's depressed and turning to food, maybe he's changed his routine and isn't getting the usual work-out, maybe he's crunched for time at work and picking up a lot of pre-made food? There are a lot of reasons why people up their caloric intake suddenly. Try to figure out what changed, maybe it's something you can address and not his actual appearance/weight.

If you're up for it, read through the FAQ and get acquainted with how simple it is to lose weight, especially if it's slow and gradual like 1 pound a week. Maybe he thinks losing weight means changing your life over night but it doesn't, he just needs to eat fewer calories (500 a day fewer if he wants to lose 1 pound a week, 1,000 fewer if he wants to lose 2). He can still have pizza, just maybe not the soda, **he doesn't have to throw out everything in the fridge and replace it with kale and tofu.** He can take walks instead of getting a gym membership.

I *WISH* someone had educated me on how freakin unintimidating losing weight actually is years ago. You can start so slowly, seeing the scale go down and the clothes get loose is a great feeling and it'll motivate him to keep going, getting educated and feeling commited is the hardest part. &gt;but in my opinion, a drastic lifestyle change needs to happen, which should involve both partners to make it last.

Why though? Single people are perfectly capable of losing weight without a romantic partner involved. If your SO wants to do this by himself without you being involved, let him. It's perfectly possible. It's a very, **very** personal journey for a lot of people. Some may want to open up and talk about it and involve others, yes, but not everyone does. It's about his habits and his body, not yours.

I'd be pretty annoyed if my partner disrespected my boundaries too.

Be supportive by cooking healthily if you cook for him at any point, not tempting him with high calorie foods, and being open if he does want to talk or involve you. Try to push your way in there when he doesn't want you to may make things harder for him, or push him towards giving up if he wants to keep his weight loss personal but you're not seeming to let him. I'm sure he'll tell you if he wants someone to work out with or whatnot.

If you need to compliment his appearance, tell him he's handsome or something rather than pointing out the weight loss if those comments annoy him.. a compliment shouldn't make him miffed, so if something you say is doing that then it isn't a nice compliment so why would you want to say something that upsets him anyway..Can't enjoy being able to sit comfortably in any chair in the world, butt's too bony now :/I think it's great to engage friends/coworkers in a friendly contest like this.  It's always a big motivator to surround yourself with like-minded individuals.

My advice for you personally would be to keep it friendly.  My guess is you don't really need this contest to keep you going down your path (you would be doing it on your own anyway), because of that you're set up to be a strong voice of encouragement to your coworkers, even if they are losing more weight than you.

Remember that the goal is for each and every one of you to build healthy habits, not to out-lose each other.

Encourage the others and be a cheerleader.  Everybody wins.

Since I haven't answered your question though, yes I think you have a huge advantage since you've already got a head start on your habits.  Good luck!It might, but if you're 100% sure you're not overeating, you can either eat less or move more, and you don't need to replace the calories if you move more, because if you exercise and eat the calories back, then you're at no deficit.That's a good feel!

I loved feeling my hip bone again for the first time in a looooong time!would you say exercise would increase my metabolic rate?sorry I meant if I incorporated running so say an hour burns 500, eat 2500 or 2300 making it 2000-1800 as opposed to 2000 minus 500Amazing story. I guess your username doesn't really apply any more, huh? Keep kicking ass at life! You don't need to counteract the deficit if you're not losing.  If you're 100% sure you're not overeating, it's probably doctor time to find out if you have a metabolic issue.yes and have been for the last 2 years using digital scales as well as logging the amount in a notebook for each meal. I am 100% certain I'm not overeating. I don't know if I need to incorporate regular exercise into my routine and increase calories by 200kcal or however much to counteract the deficit. perhaps my metabolism is so sedentary that weight stays the same regardless of eating less than tdee

tdee is 2550 mifflin st joerThat's just awesome :-)

Keep at it! Yeah you did.yay!  I am excited I wanted to keep my desire to lose weight a secret from my SO for a loooong time, mostly because I didn't want to admit (to myself and especially to him) that I was overweight and insecure. Obviously he could tell, but we never talked about it and he always told me how beautiful I was.

It wasn't until I had been on the bandwagon for a couple of weeks that I really confided in him. He knew I was eating healthier and working out, but he didn't know I was counting my calories or what I was doing to work out until I told him. I guess I just felt like I needed to be already on my way to improvement before I shared my feelings about it.

The best thing you can do is ask your SO how they want you to encourage them. Has your SO openly expressed a desire/active pursuit of change? It wasn't until I could see the changes in myself physically that I actually started taking my boyfriend's compliments as sincere, even though I know he was the whole time. Now that I am making progress, I tell my SO my caloric intake every night, talk about my cravings, talk about my workouts, in what small ways my body is changing, and every day I tell him what my small victory for the day was. He used to want to work out with me and I was way too insecure. These days I would kill for him to do yoga with me or go out for a long walk. He is teaching me how to build up muscle though, and I love it and don't feel insecure anymore. I feel closer to him.

Study your SO and his reactions to different means of encouragement and go with his preferences. It might take a while for him to open up. It wasn't until over a month in that I actually told my SO about when my overeating started and why. This is because every challenge I face in my weight loss, I had to come to terms with myself before I could share them with him. Talk to him about what will motivate him and what will discourage him, and really truly listen to what he is saying. Hope this helps.If you eat 2000 cal per day, even if you're sedentary, you should be losing weight at that rate of consumption, based on the fact that I'm 6'3" and 200 lb and my sedentary TDEE is almost 2500.

And apparently this means I lose weight and look better? Crazy!whaaaaat??? I didn't realize that was possible, I hope that was a healthy cycle for you, though I'm sure now it's waaaay healthier. my mom had long periods, but she had anemia and ovarian cysts What's the reasoning behind the honey, lemon, and hot water? Hey there!!! What's up, I'm new here, a 22 year old male 5'9'' and 195 lbs. Current BMI 28.8, overweight. Fair enough. I want to feel good. That's all, feel good, live longer, and just increase my awesomeness potential. My goal is to be lets say 75kg by the end of the year. Simple enough, and very doable. I dont want to blast fat, but make lifestyle changes. Something permanent, something that I'll love for the rest of my life.

I used to be a 1.5 pack a day smoker and quit, mainly because afriend did too. She was a new years quitter and i just couldnt stand the envy. Now I realize how important motivation is, and how...well for me envy/jealousy/competitiveness can bootstrap important decisions in my life.

So far I have cutback on unhealthy things in my life. Coke (regular), I don't take sugar anymore in my coffee, I don't ingest raw dairy and substituted soymilk etc. I rarely eat eggs, and when I do I remove the yolk, drastically reduced carb intake, and where possible substituted with whole grains......you know all the minor stuff.

So far so good. I want to make "low intensity" changes that I can sustain for decades at a time. This is the approach I am trying to take. Eventually this will culminate into bigger and bigger changes.
I have seen too many people fall into the "bodybuilding" trap. They blast fat like there's no tomorrow, and eventually let themselves go. My professor in college used to be a fitness model and now....well.

I want to make lifelong changes that I will enjoy. I don't want fitness to be a chore, a job you get what I mean? I want to be like my other professor...he gets up at four every morning and bikes for two hours, and even has won state-level races. And he's as lean as a beef jerky.

So yeah, I know the enormous power a group can have on someone. Going at something, no matter how determined you are can be challenging. If you don't have atleast someone to motivate you and to keep tabs on you it is bound to fail. The human will can only do so much. After the enormous support /r/stopsmoking showed me, I am really blown away by how much kindness and motivation random strangers can show. I want to use that to my advantage.
So.......Hi !!!


P.S. I might have shown profound ignorance of how fitness works, please be gentle :)[This is what I've been doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpqbzPj92HU)

I've been missing a few of the foods because I haven't been shopping yet, but I've been eating:

* Apples
* Prunes
* Green Tea half an hour after every meal.
* Honey + Lemon + Hot Water (Before Sleeping).
* Grilled Chicken

Gotta say, 3 days later and down from 304.4 to 291.6 I'm feeling much better about myself. Congrats on your weight loss :)Nice! Not only are you saving the calories you now have 2 meals for the price of one!Congratulations man. That's badass. You are amazing! So nice of you to do that Badass leggings!My breath.Curious that he said a low carb diet is best but then said cheese was the problem- because a lot of low carb diets involve consumption of cheese like crazy. One thing I think doctors and anyone can agree on is that lots of vegetables are good for you and your heart, regardless...even if they have a lot of carbs. Losing just 10% of your body weight if you are overweight significantly improves your health like crazy. You don't even have to be "healthy weight" to see so many benefits. Exercising regularly, even walking, is good for your heart too- we know that weight loss is pretty much dependant on diet but you gotta look at that exercise see all the benefits it has  for your body too. Now that's a lump i wouldn't mind discovering! I'm looking forward to the day my collarbone reappears.I completely understand what you mean.

I've been in " I want to be thin " phase without actually working for it, for 4 years.

My discipline and self control was in tatters. I felt miserable and looked miserable.

I started following /loseit /getdisciplined /progresspics from Jan 2015 and my life seems more lively, peaceful and brighter.

There is no turning back for us now. Its only going to get better. Right? :-)

Edit : /bodyweightfitness too! Maybe he doesn't want to? Not everyone wants to be totally muscle bound. I'm a lady and I think he looks fiiiiine. Keep the goodness flowing :-)Your right, and for the most part I have managed to. But the urge is always there.I've wanted to change for years but this is the first time I've REALLY wanted it if you know what I mean.  As in, I want to be slender more than I want to eat any food I want.

Thank you!Wish I read this 15 minutes ago.  Stayed under my mfp goal, but not my personal 1500 goal.  Damn lemon bars.Keep at it :-) Similar thing happened to me.  Noticed a dark spot on my face.  Turned out it was the shadow of a cheekbone I never knew I had.I'd lost 35lbs and was well on my way to losing the next 95lbs when this past May my father got sick very suddenly and died six weeks later. I was absolutely devastated. Immediately after he died, my weight loss came to a halt. I didn't gain much (mostly because my emotional eating was paired with a re-appearance of an old, previously dormant case of bulimia - 0/10, do not recommend as coping mechanism) but I didn't lose anything at all.

It took me almost 6 months before I was able to look in the mirror and realize that even though I'd lost 35lbs and mostly kept it off, I was still 235lbs and 5'3. My father died directly because of his weight (he had a heart valve replacement that got infected a year later, and his body couldn't fight the infection before it killed the liver that was already sick with fatty liver disease). I had to shake the fog of grief and depression (which told me that I was healthier than I was a year before and that was good enough) and realize that the weight I'd lost was going to come right back if I gave up now, and if the weight kept going up, I was very likely to die young and horrifically like my father did. And that frightened the hell out of me.

If your father has already had heart attack, you're at a greater risk of one yourself. Your body might be healthy right now, but the longer you carry that weight around, the more you damage your body. And one day you'll have damaged it to the point where you cannot recover.

Don't let that happen. Love yourself more than that. I re-started intentional (and tracked) lifestyle changes in January, and I'm down 10 more pounds since then. I've still got a long while to go, but the little milestones help a LOT. My first milestone was getting down below my license weight, then below my pre-grad school weight, then out of Obesity Class III and into Obesity Class II, then 50lbs down, onederland, Obesity Class I and so on...

You've got your entire life to lose this weight... or not. But the sooner you lose it, the longer that life will be. Oh god, the cravings. I almost get shaky with desire when it comes to sugar craving.I've gone from a size 20 to size 12... he keeps pointing out men who are interested... it's his loss, not mine, lol![*sigh...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTgFtxHhCQ0)I think when you are in the process of losing weight, people aren't quite used to seeing you that way and have a hard time imagining you thinner but still healthy.  They probably just need to get used to seeing you like that.

I'm less certain on this second point, but I also think that you look a little more awkward when you are losing weight vs. when you've stabilized at a lower weight.  I don't have a great explanation for that, just anecdotes about people I knew who looked gaunt while they were losing weight but looked more wholesome after they had gotten to their goal and stayed there.I'm a huge Blackmilk fan, this is where my love of crazy prints comes from&gt; I very much struggle with an all or nothing attitude. I think the weekly goals might help keep things in check because it is a realistic time frame.

I was the same and it works for me. It isn't an instant process and took me a few months to get right but why this worked for me is because it changed my thinking from "I failed in my long term goal so therefore I am a failure why try" to "I failed my weekly goal, why did I fail and what can I change to make sure I achieve it next time. It has changed my life for the better so it can't help playing around with it.

I can't speak more highly of the 5:2 diet. The 2 days are pretty rough to stick to in the beginning because 2500 kj is not much food. But you get a sense of satisfaction out of sticking it it so boosts your motivation to stick with it.

Watch the link form my page, the documentary gives you a good insight into intermittent fasting.I'm only 5'4" but I've decided to go higher than 1200 - I eat between 1300 and 1600 depending on the day, and have lost enough so far that I feel good about that choice. I know it will make things slower but it will also make the whole journey more pleasant and sustainable for me.I think it's one of the best feelings I've had in a long time!1200 is the often quoted number of "minimum calories you need to eat to not die" so a lot of women read that as "welp, that is the number I need to go to" or are already so small and light that just to get to a deficit they have to go as low as a doctor will say is possible to go. I wish.. Taking a week off from the gym after posting steady gains all week long even staying in calories and eating right day in and day out. Some combination has to work, maybe mine is gonna be just eating betterOne thing I see it as is this: it takes a lot more gumption to lose a small amount of weight than a large one.

If you're only 20, 30 pounds overweight it can easy to ignore. "So what if I'm a little pudgy, its not like it really matters." But it does, because not tracking your health is how you wake up one day and realize that you weigh 120 pounds too much.

It's easy to know that you're extremely overweight when you have 100+ pounds to lose.

Although ultimately losing the weight is equally difficult no matter how far you have to go.I'm also in the medical field. There are some scary complications that can happen. Also, there is so "quick fix". Even if you decide to go with Surgery, you have you change your habits completely or you'll end up exactly as you are now. Same here! Or at least I hope they stay proportional to my body...

Edit: actually something nice that's happened already (only 8 lbs into my desired 40lbs loss) is the little pockets of fat below the underwire of my bra are disappearing, so even if my breasts have changed size (haven't noticed either way just yet) they look better.*thank mr skeletal*Yeah, but the point is that it was taught, so you can unlearn it.And that's why you don't teach your son a lesson...I'm going to be completely honest even though it may not be a good example for others.

I don't eat that well, and I still lose weight. I do it by exercising rigorously. I've gotten to the point where I can't stop doing cardio. It makes me feel so great. I wake up in the morning feeling okay, and then when I get my cardio in, I feel like I've come alive.

I also manage my calories, but I can lose weight at 2500 a day so I can still indulge in my favorite foods pretty often. My diet didn't really change much. All I do is exercise a lot more, and avoid the horrible meals. I used to on occasion, go out to eat, have something like mozzarella sticks or wings for an appetizer, a bacon cheeseburger for the entree, and then have some big brownie sundae for dessert. And during that time, I would have 3 tall glasses of coke. Probably like 2-3k calories. So really all I do is don't do that, watch what I eat a little bit, and exercise a lot.

I realize this isn't the best plan for everyone, but it works for me and I thought I'd share. I've gone from 220-203 in 3 months doing this. I know I probably could've been 190 by now if I got my diet in order, but hey, I'm happy.The idea that resonated with me the most: if you eat one cookie and feel like you're going to eat the whole box, it's better to throw the whole box- it's not wasteful because you would have eaten the whole thing anyways. Overall, an informative listen.That is true.  How do you handle things now that leave you devastated, shocked, sad for several days?Yeah! That's what I loved about it. I felt very classy and elegant when I wore clothes that showed off my decolletage, neck, and shoulders. That's honestly part of my goals with this... I don't have a set weight goal, but a range. I'll know I'm there when I'm in the range and I see what I want to see.Is it winter where you are at?  Many people run low on Vitamin D in the winter.  This can cause lower energy levels along with deficiencies in Vitamin B12 (Vitamin B complex can't help if you are not absorbing enough B12).  I'm sure there are others as well.  I take a few supplements and take a multi-vitamin each day.

You may want to talk to your doctor and get a blood test done if you still feel sluggish after a few weeks. It's the best way to know if you are deficient in anything. How do you do this? Exactly. Even maintaining at 5'5, 120lbs, 1200 isn't enough to maintain weight, and if I'd continued to to stick with it, I would have slipped into underweight.

Part of losing weight in a healthy way is to create sustainable expectations and reprogram your habits. At 5'7, you shouldn't make it a habit to eat at 1200/day. Not only will it make you miserable now, but it won't even sustain a healthy weight at that height.

Side note: I do like looking at /r/1200isplenty, but only because of the low-calorie recipe ideas. The people there are adamant about 1200 not being sufficient for most people, and they *will* tell you if it doesn't seem like a good idea for your body type and fitness goals. I have also been struggling, mainly since Christmas. Managed to loose 13 pounds and now I've put 6 pounds back on. The late night sugar cravings are driving me crazy! I have recently started going to a gym three times a week and I am really enjoying it, but at the same time I am scared I will quit. I always do after a while. Struggling real hard to stay motivated right now. Thank you for the post! Also keep in mind that it takes a while. I just passed 100lbs this week. It took me 15 months to get there. There were weeks where I lost nothing and weeks where I gained. It takes time to get results so be patient. Me too. Not weird at all. The collar bone is a very beautiful part of the female form. (&amp; the male form! I just think it looks so elegant when a woman displays her decolletage.)These are strippers! Look how hot they are!
It's ok to weigh yourself often but better to set certain "weighing conditions". For example I only weigh myself in the mornings right after I get up AND only after a moderate intensity workout the day before. This ensures that I am reasonably dehydrated (a night of no liquids and sweating out from the workout the day before). I also tend to weigh myself with minimal clothing (or buck naked haha).

I do this about once a week, usually on a Saturday or Sunday morning right after I get up and before I drink or eat anything. This helps keep most of the important factors constant to get a clear idea of where your weight is heading.Yeah, I get so focused on the calorie counting and exercise that I forget to notice what's going on in the mirror and have woah moments. It's nice :) Obviously I think about being at my GW but I spend more time focusing on the here and now because thats how I'll get there!Those things get pretty annoying. Suddenly one day I couldn't use my computer laying on my bed anymore. My hip bones dug into my wrists. Don't apologize. That was a rude comment to you that didn't address your original question. Ick. I'm sorry. I definitely think that's more a society problem than a curvy woman problem. I know that sounds very /r/fatlogic but seriously, where people get the sense that they are allowed to comment on your body without restraint I have no idea.haha :)  I've considered that.  I'm looking for all types of groups.  I'm trying to get data from as many groups as possible.  everything from elite athletes to the average person.  The survey SHOULD distinguish between groups... hopefully....Medical complications. I would never alter my internal organs unless it was to save my life. The most important thing on a diet is sticking with it.  If for you that means 1500 calories that is great.  You will lose weight and maintain sanity.

If you want to speed up your weightloss a little bit you could start or increase your exercise.  (downside is it might make you more hungry).

The reason you might see 1200 often is that short women have low TDEEs.  Someone with a TDEE of 1600 eating 1200 actually has the same deficit as you, and will be losing weight at the same rate.

1200 is an arbitrary number assumed to be the least one can eat and still have adequate nutrients.  I haven't come across any scientific reason it is 1200.  Not weirdWhat an awesome feeling! I'm a few months away from this victory but it must just be amazing. Way to go :)I can't agree with that because I  was never really socialized. I like to think I'm a special snowflake even though I'm not, but I have always had hunger issues, and really they are more of satiation issues. Growing up I was never "full" or "content" or whatever it is most people feel. I was never taught to "clean my plate" or "eat my veggies" because I was inhaling everything given to me as a child. Even as a child I'd stuff myself until I was ready to yak.

Stress definitely though. Stress gets the hunger factor going.Black coffee made from a french press.  It will turn coffee time into more of a ritual rather than a grab-and-go deal due to cleaning out the press.  I can barely scarf down drip coffee black, but recently ground from a french press?  Holy cow that is good.  Wasa crackers are low calorie (60 cal for the multigrain, 30 for the light rye) and crunchy and high fiber too. They'd go really well with guac.Keep in mind we aren't really a random sample here :)It helps me to get a big bag, then weigh or count out the serving size of chips or snack that I want into a small bowl. I put the bag away, and all I get are the chips in the bowl. Works pretty well usually, and I seem to enjoy them more. Never ever ever eat out of the bag.You are my life style guru!  Thank you for all the amazing past advice and for this.  75 days in, no real binges, but I don't know how much longer I can last.  This advice really helps take the fear out of it.  Awareness seems to be they key to so many of my struggles.
Oh man, we are the same height and have the same start and goal weights! I hope to be where you are in another two or three months...

Also, here's an unsolicited relationship fact. Had your ex completely moved on and was happy with his life, he wouldn't have felt the need to text you 6 months after the break-up. He needed some form of validation for whatever shit was going on with his life at that time, hence the random insults.

Being mean to someone is just a small step below being nice. In both cases, the other person is constantly on your mind for whatever reason. Way worse than both is ignoring them altogether and not giving them a second of your day.I am 1 month into my journey now, and I have a similar goal weight to your current weight. I have around 50lbs to go... it's daunting. When I see people here losing over 80lbs it's really motivating, but I still feel my self confidence wobble. I have a personal problem of severely low self esteem, and I often feel like less of a person.

Thank you for this. I feel more inclined to teach myself *not* to compare myself to others so harshly, and work for my own goals.Great job! It's the small decisions day-by-day that all add up.A relative of mine is a nutritionist. When I said I was doing 1200 calories (which wasn't working), she told me that that was waaaaay too low for someone of my height (and I'm 5'6"). She said even 1300 might be too low. So I try to stick within a range of 1300 to 1500 (varies by the intensity of my exercise that day as sometimes I just NEED more protein). I found that around or under 1300, I feel very hungry and tend to binge eat more frequently because of the cravings. But with 1300 to 1500, I usually don't get hungry at the end of the day and stick to the plan. Even with a deficit, you shouldn't be feeling hungry all the time... it's just not sustainable and you won't be able to stick with it.As someone who spent 20 years rejecting the idea of counting calories and only exercised as a way to lose weight, this way is so much easier and predictable.  No more working my ass off and hoping it works.  It's just crunching numbers, who knew?  Oh, wait, you guys did!  Thank you, I couldn't have gotten this far without you all.Thank Mr skeltal with calcium. I had lap band surgery in 2012. It's not magic, but it did help me with overcoming my compulsive overeating problem. I am still perfectly capable of overeating and eating junk. I've had to do a lot of work on my emotional issues and finding a diet that suits me.

I don't regret the surgery. It went well with no complications. I think the band is still helpful sometimes even though I don't have it very tight. It can also be a pain when I do have to eat fast. I've lost enough fat that the port can be seen under my skin. By the time I've finished losing, it will be pretty obvious in two-piece swimsuit, and even visible in form-fitting clothes.

Be very careful in this decision. By all means, go ahead and do your six month program. If it works, keep doing it. You don't have to be in a hurry. Remember, surgery is serious. A lap band may be reversible, but removing it is just as big a surgery as getting it put in, and insurance isn't going to pay to take it out if it is functioning normally.

Most of all, when you go to a lap band seminar, remember that they are selling a product. I was already sold on the product before I went based on my personal circumstances and conversations I had had with other patients (not all of whom had good things to say, by the way), but I was overwhelmed by how they make it look like it is your only chance to live a normal life. It is not your only chance. It is one of the choices available to you.
Yes! I'm still astounded every day when I get on the scales and the number hasn't gone up. I keep getting paranoid and thinking it's just water weight and it will be back,

But no, you don't lose 10 kgs and 17cms (22lbs and 6.5 inches) of water!I've got the reverse feeling right now. When I look in the mirror, I still see slimmer me. And I feel that way too now that I've been working hard for the last few months. But when I see pictures, I'm pretty big, and am always shocked or surprised by what I see. I think we tend to hold onto a certain image of ourselves for a long time, and it takes a long time for that image to evolve and change.Nope, well for me it hasn't anyway in almost two years. At my lowest I hit 6% body fat and I could still feel fat (http://imgur.com/8OaOzKZ). Trust me, you may know, but your subconscious doesn't have a frigging clue. You could be like me, you could have body dis-morphia where you see your body completely different to how everyone else does.

I am still incredibly regimented with food, I'm currently floating between 10-15% body fat and yes I do still feel fat (even more so when I see that picture of myself at 6%).

The problem with weight loss is that it happens so gradually and you're forever looking in mirrors to see if you can notice the change, but it never happens. The people who notice it the most are those you see infrequently. It's so important to keep progress pictures (like the one above) of your progress to understand where you're currently at, where you've come from and what your journey has been.

One of my biggest fears is becoming fat again after everything I've been through. I fight with myself on a daily basis to eat the right amount let alone in excess.

I do kinda look at it in a positive light though, keeps the weight off :)2spooky4meOoooh! Thanks for that tip to look at percentage lost of original weight! That'll definitely help me stay motivated and keep things into perspective.No resistance training yet, just trying to get the weight off.Congrats, keep at it.Hey, you don't have him to thank for your healthy lifestyle, you have YOU to thank.Yup.

Started counting three months ago, and I often don't even eat clean food. MFP knows about my booze and McDonalds. It knows I'm a lazy asshole. It knows I sometimes eat an entire cheesecake.

But as long as I eat less than the magic number, on average, I shrink. It's ridiculous that this works so well despite me.One of my favorite things about losing weight was feeling my hip bones while I was laying down. Looking forward to being able to do it again!HAH! That's wonderful! It's nice to start feeling/seeing a bit of structure again. One of the things that I miss about my slimmer days is seeing a little bit of a collarbone outline. Don't know if that sounds weird, but that's my thing.Signed up! Thanks so much for organizing this :)Oh definitely, I was just recalculating MFP calories today, and I tried looking at the BMR for men and women of the exact same age &amp; weight, wow.  Women are like little hybrids compared to man trucks.  Age didn't make as much of a difference though.5'8" @ 150 is crazy lean. Time to bulk up those abs and chest for the ladies. The calorie counting alone has helped me a ton! I work ~65hrs/week and this has helped a ton. Too easy to just grab some drive-thru between jobs. I've lost over 20lbs just since Nov 18. Keep it up! I don't think I've lost any weight at all, according to my scale, but today I fit into an old pair of jeans.  I grabbed the wrong pair out of the drawer by accident and after being kinda bummed about not losing anything, I'm super ecstatic and more motivated than ever.This is a really good habit to pick up in general, just the act of putting away all of the food *before* you start eating sort of keeps it out of sight and out of mind.It has been a gradual process. When I started out, I decided I would have a cheat day every month. But as I go along, nothing really seems good enough to cheat. A year ago, I would happily swing by whataburger and eat a large combo meal. Now? Shit, that is like a billion calories give or take a million. I'd rather have my homemade roast beef and veg! I appreciate the comment.  What do you mean "go wrong"?  As in complications or gaining weight back?They're copies of the blackmilk Mr Shark legs, not sure if they're still on the BM site but if not try Aliexpress, East Knitting do decent quality copies.

The same print also comes in shorts and bathers :)Thousands of years of evolution that said that consuming more now meant surviving famine later. Unfortunately that concept no longer applies in the last 150 years.The next step is being on first name terms with everyone. At this point change gyms, haha. I'm not joking, you usually end up spending half your time talking to people than actually working out. This is the reason last month I joined a new gym where I didn't know anyone.I used to let myself binge on white chicken chili once a week when I was younger :) Never impeded my fat loss back then really and sure did taste good. I'd never recommend that behavior to my current older self though.You want to pick something that should work in the long run.  1200 is inappropriately low for many people, although it's a common number for short, small framed people.  1500 is going to be much more manageable.  Man. Just from reading that text - what a scumbag. My big thing is prevention. I don't keep enough food in the house TO binge on! So basically every 4 days I go to the super market and buy about 4 days worth of food. Another nice perk is nothing is wasted or goes bad this way.

When prevention doesn't work, uh, yeah I don't know. If I eat the wrong types of foods or get in the wrong kind of mood I become ravenous and literally lose control over myself. It's a serious eating disorder that every therapist I've ever talked to just shrugs off, but when I binge I tend to binge until I'm choking on my vomit or am passing out. So yeah, the best way I know to manage, is to prevent. When you are going through rough times the rate of weight loss doesn't matter as much.

* You have not gained weight
* You have not stayed the same
* You have continued to lose

Have you ever thought about getting a few sessions of therapy, to help you learn new and better techniques to cope with the good/bad emotions and challenges that life throws at us so often? Your obesity is an issue now, it is holding you back now. You don't have to wait for a heart attack, or diabetes, or anything else to prove it to you. Don't focus on how long it's going to take to get to your goal weight, that time will pass anyway. When you are making decisions to learn how to take care of your body, to learn about how to eat better to fuel yourself you are taking back enormous power. You will make mistakes, and it takes courage to keep picking yourself back up. But having a healthy body that works for you, that gets stronger and faster and better day by day, that is a wonderful thing to achieve. It's not about the big "I have to lose weight" decision, it's about the dozens of tiny good decisions you make in a day that will get you there.Sometimes at night I bang on arm on my hipbone. Hurts but feels so good too :)Cigarettes suppress appetite.  Its not uncommon to have to readjust your eating after quitting smoking.Hey there, F 27 5'3" SW: 192 / CW:149 / G:125. I think I had my "So this is life now" moment when my mom crashed at my place for a few days in November and I decided to try "maintenance mode" for the first time to keep things easier.

Oh my god, **maintenance as a short girl is a bitch.** It is a lot easier to wake up and think "So, today I'm losing weight and I'm eating 1200 calories so get ready for veggies and small snacks and no XL pizza." At maintenance (which for me at that point was 1750) you have *some* extra calories, but not *all* of the calories. So even when we went out I'd have to eat half of what I wanted, even if we wanted snacks I could have chips *or* a cookie, even if we wanted dessert I couldn't afford a full slice of cheesecake. I wanted to go out with my mom and enjoy life but I had to police myself more than ever. It's enough calories to get tastes of everything, nothing has to be restricted, but you can't have it all in one day.

When I hit my goal weight, if I don't work out all week, my TDEE will be 1500 calories. #$(@*&amp;, that's like a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee more than what I'm eating every day already.

What helped is to stop seeing food as anything other than food. It's a yummy thing that'll make me not hungry for a while and nourish my body and that's it's only job. If I'm sad I'll go for a walk, if I'm anxious I'll go draw etc. I will log everything I eat on MFP honestly. Yes, I do the same thing, although I go with a weekly average. It's a great combination of seeing the fine details, but also not getting caught up in the minor fluctuations. Did he mention why he thought cheese was the cause of high cholesterol? There is quite a bit of outdated science lingering out there, specificially eating cholesterol equals cholesterol, which we now know isn't true. If anything the inflammatory effects of food you eat (specifically carbs) creates a nice, sticky, surface for the blood cholesterol your body makes. Just a thought.Hard boiled egg (80 calories or so) is my favorite thing to add to a salad. And green onion. I work in the medical field.

I would never get elective surgery for something that I can fix on my own. This is just my opinion. I am sure those type of procedures work for people, but I have seen what happens when they go wrong. Hey 45lbs buddy! I'm maintaining now too :). Just know what we're doing is great, and we have accomplished so much! Also, everyone here with even the smallest amount of weight loss is doing so good! The weight loss journey is an emotional roller coaster, (I actually kind of miss my Sunday mornings jumping on the scale to see a smaller number, is that bad? haha) and everyone here can benefit from OP's wise words:)I cook a big pot of chilli on Sunday and freeze it in portion -sized Tupperware.

Then I take 4 frozen packs with me to work on Monday (I don't work Fridays), buy sour cream and a four-pack of little gem lettuce and I'm sorted for the week.Spoooooky!Alright, I'm going to tell you what I wish I did. Find yourself a good regime such as Starting Strength (SS for short), and stick to it. You will progress so much more than on any brosplit. Head on over to the reddit fitness [Faq](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise) and follow there recommendations.

I wish I would have started earlier. Soon enough you are gonna know more than most people when it comes to lifting.

Also you don't have to actually buy the books, you can find them on various websites or even on reddit.I've always had large breasts and a big booty (whenever I gain weight it seems like those are the areas mainly affected), and personally I've always hated it. I hate the attention my butt gets, I hate that even the most modest of pants don't detract from it, and I hate the shit people say about it. Female coworkers/friends are always saying things about my booty (positive things, but I just hate that my butt was noticeable enough to be brought up), overly friendly friends will slap my ass, and I always catch male coworkers/managers and clients looking at my butt (and sometimes laughing together about it). It's just all around an uncomfortable situation and was definitely a motivating factor in my losing the weight.

That said, I did always feel more feminine with my curves (no shame for the less curvy ladies put there, femininity comes in all shapes and sizes!), and I do like being curvy, I just wish it didn't bring so much attention. The last time I had lost the weight, I really appreciated that I still had the curves, but they weren't so exaggerated. I actually began to like that I had a booty, because while it was still big, it wasn't cartoonish if that makes sense.There are some studies done on this and how it does not always work for everyone.  Here is an article explaining why.  The BMI system can still be used for people to track progress, but as a fine tuning instrument for what you should exactly weight it is not a good benchmark.  Everyone is different in how they are built underneath.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/19/bmi-why-body-mass-index-i_n_798775.htmlSome days are just bad days. Log it in your food tracker and then be done with it. It's ok to have a bad food day once in a while, just don't make it a habit. And don't get too down on yourself. We've all been there, and we will probably end up there again.

The good thing is that you recognized it as an undesirable behavior and are aware of what you're doing.

A big part of the weightloss process is being able to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. You can do it, you got this. :)A teacher at my school I've known for the last 7 years came up to me and said they were proud of me for loosing as much weight as I have and that it's very visible. Completely out of the blue, made me feel great for the rest of the day.I started at 538lbs and was considering surgery, but I knew doing it the healthy way would be best.  Today I am down nearly 200lbs from plain old hard work.

If your health is in a dire state and lots of weight loss right away is needed you may not have an option. Surgery may be your only recourse. But if you an try to do it the old fashioned way it will teach you how to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle.

My Aunt works at a clinic that does these surgeries and a whopping 60% of people who have one these procedures either don't lose weight or do but gain it back over time.  There are ways to cheat it and if you are not emotionally secure you are bound to do so.

So before making this kind of drastic choice ask yourself if you truly have losing it the hard way a real chance. I love salad, mostly because I can eat lettuce until I'm ready to burst and it won't put me over my calorie goals. I have always loved raw vegetables, though, so if you don't like them salads might not be for you. I encourage you to try it though! My current favorite that I eat about every other day:

* Two big handfuls of romaine
* A handful of spinach
* One carrot, shredded
* About a cup of broccoli florets
* Half a cup of cottage cheese OR one of those 100-calorie guacamole tubs
* 3-4 tablespoons of pico de gallo salsa
* 2 oz shredded chicken breast (cold)
* 1/4 cup black beans

It's so good...and HUGE. I eat it out of a mixing bowl. I use the salsa and cottage cheese or guacamole in place of salad dressing, and I think it tastes great. It's a lot like a chipotle salad.As a Californian, that makes me so sad :(Like from the restaurant? :YI weigh in mostly daily, but only record it when there's weight loss.Duckface!I used to go to chipotle and get a kids size bag of chips and salsa 130 calorie delicious snackI appreciate the story and suggestions.  I don't have any health complications at this point.  I'm 24.  My surgeon says, "you're young, motivated, and intelligent so you shouldn't have problem with the lap band".  We'll see how things go.A lot of it can be when you decide to change your life, when that "wakeup moment" fully commits you to changing. I have another 40 pounds to lose, and lost around 45. If I waited another 10-15 years, I might have had to lose 120 or 150 pounds as the weight crept on. If I started 5 years ago, I'd have 30 less pounds to lose. We're all facing unique circumstances and different positions in our lives. How much you lose doesn't matter as long as you're on the path to living a healthier life and getting to your ultimate health goals.
I will agree to that. My parents tought me to fill my plate and then eat everything on it. So between what you said and how I grew up it became where it feels natural, or second nature. Does that make sense?It's nice, haha-- I gym with my mom and it was 8 weeks till we got the "hello ladies" from trainers and 12 weeks till we started making friends with other notable regulars... NSV all around!

I'm going 5x a week now and it feels great. Who knew I could enjoy this change so much? [Reading the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq) after I found /r/loseit was my moment. I had stepped on the scale thinking I'd be a bit into the "overweight" range. I was much heavier than I expected, and my BMI was 30. I was obese and needed to change, my weight was only going up and it was getting faster. I decided reddit would be the best place to look for advice, as bullshit answers would get downvoted. Reading "For most people losing weight is roughly a 80:20 diet:exercise split" in the FAQ changed my whole outlook. I could focus just on my diet for a while and worry about exercise later. I didn't have to feel like I was spinning plates, getting overwhelmed with all I had to do. It's been great, over a year on and everything about my life is better. Stats: F 26 5'1" SW 155 GW 115 CW 119.5, I reached my goal but regained 5 lbs due to an injury. I'm on the way back down now :)Thank you! And don't say "only 12 pounds"...that's a lot! Look at how much fat that is https://sixpackali.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/yuck.jpg
Be proud!

Haha random sweating no more! :)I can fully resonate with your story.

I was 260lbs and then got to 180lbs. I then went up and down several times to 210 or thereabouts. Why? Because I stopping thinking it was a big deal.


I think a part of it is never being fully happy with my weight. At 180 I wanted to get to 170. Of course I'd be so delighted with 180 right now though!

I'm back on track, this is what I did:
1. I use a great app for graphing daily weight so you know you're 10 day average - Libra, this way I don't give a shit about daily ups and downs, unless there are a series of ups
2. I track everything I eat in MyFitnessPal, knowing that I can't eat beyond 1600 calories, unless I do some serious running.
3. I have signed up for a marathon on June 1st and am following a beginner's 18 week plan that builds up to 6 runs a  week.


I don't overeat now. If I am hungry it's usually because I need to eat. I don't get bored because I am doing running. I don't worry because Libra and MyFitnessPal are tracking things for me and everything looks good.


I hope this helps.pork grinds zero carbsThis is exactly what I do, Friday mornings. If it's not great one week then make an extra effort, of it's a good week then keep doing what I've been doing!Thank you! Haha and yessss, disappearing double chin is a favorite of mine as well.

&gt; I was **loosing** weight

**Losing** is the word you want.  : )I'm sorry, you're right. A better lifestyle is not boring. Its simple. :)Thank you! Haha it really is. I feel like I'm beginning to see me now, if that makes any sense.I can't believe someone said that to you.  What a shitty person.

I gotta say, you were cute in your before photo, but your after is smokin hot.  Congrats on the hard work paying off.It's been 10 months since I started losing, it's been very up and down but I've got some momentum now and can't see myself floundering. That said I'm only 25lbs from where is was last April. It's all been experimenting and the right way of doing it for me, so yeah I totally agree that patience is key. Want to keep the weight off rather than yo yo like I have been, and as I've learned the hard way patience is one of the most important things in achieving that.That's a great goal :) 135 was actually my first goal, I knew I would be healthy at that weight but I wanted to continue to lose once I was there. this really resonated with me; in my first year of law school i gained almost 45 lbs from just shitty eating and making excuses (could've managed time better and just...didn't).

went to the cardiologist for something totally random (just a routine check-up because there's some heart disease in my family) and after the echocardiogram i have a severe leaking aortic valve that'll have to be replaced. it was a HELL of a wakeup call.

i began exercising (insanity is my treat of choice) and MFP like a fiend and dropped the first 20 lbs; gained back 5 over the holidays and am back down the original 20 again and my cardiovascular fitness is incredible! At my original appointment, my resting heart rate was 76 BPM and after 1.5 months of insanity and dropping about 16 lbs, it was down to 65 BPM.

I felt happy knowing that I'd reduced my heart's burden a bit :)

No, no thanks, ah no, no - no, no thanks, no - no, you're alright thanks but no etc.


Next tactic is to say you've been to the doc and he's worried about you getting diabetes. Seriously. Next time they offer just do an injection in the arm sign while shaking your head slowly and look grim as fuck.I've just stepped down my creamer. Every now and then I slightly lower the amount I put in my coffee. I'm trying to get down to a sane amount.


 On days it really matters to me I use almond milk, a smidge of vanilla, and done cinnamon. Tastes yummy, but more work than the creamer.indeed. aim for no more than 2 pounds per week. since you're younger it shouldn't be an issue. He'll be back. Be hot and with a hot boyfriend when he does.I'm 21 and I suppose guess I should pace my weight loss to minimize the risk?In general, probably.
But I'm apparently a land whale and its definitely NOT easy for me to drop 3-5lbs/week.

And as much as people want to claim cals in vs cals out, age and sex have a lot to do with it as well. I was in a very similar situation when I was 19 believe it or not.

I ended up losing 100 pounds in 6 months.  I would sneak away and started walking around our block, then around our town (it was a nice little square shaped town with one mile roads on each of it's four sides, a perfect square mile).  I eventually got a stairmaster in the garage and would get up at 630 every morning to do it.

For food I would eat healthy or occasionally miss a meal and try and eat as little as is polite around them.

Later, because they didn't see this actual effort, they thought I lost the weight because of drugs.  haCook something brand new, something exciting, that's low in calories, carbs, or fats, whatever you're trying to ignore!You know, when they started letting me through the gate without needing to swipe I felt the same. Accepted. Like I was part of something. Respected.

All the trainers know who I am and talk progress and sometimes just plain chat! Ah it's crazy, I love it.

I never thought I'd fit in in the mother fucking weights room though. I'm so happy these days. The gym has become my spiritual home.Try a protein shake, drink it down as soon as you finish in the pool.it really depends on how old you are and how fast you lose the weight.One group that you might consult is the /r/wls subreddit.

My story is that I was prepping for the Roux En Y Gastric Bypass.  My diabetes was getting harder to control and managing travel with insulin and pills was difficult. On July 9th, my surgeon's staff recommended MyFitnessPal for food tracking (because you need to track your food after the surgery). They assigned it as homework, along with walking 3 days for 30 minutes. It worked very well. I was down 19 pounds and I was pretty stoked! After the 3-week homework assignment was over, I kept tracking and walking.

In just two more weeks, I started having hypoglycemia. My blood glucose was in the 80s and I needed some sugar immediately. If you've ever had it, you know the feeling: hot, confused, weak, a little sick. 5 weeks of walking and doing fairly well on MyFitnessPal had changed my needs. I ended up dropping all of my insulin and most of my metformin. In two more weeks, I dropped everything. My blood glucose is in the high 60s and low 70s and I feel just fine. My HbA1C is 5.6 -- same as a non-diabetic.

I continued on MyFitnessPal and walking and I put my surgery on hold. I've now lost 90+ pounds in just 7 months and while I love the weight loss, the headline is that my diabetes is totally controlled with diet and exercise.

With the surgery would have come group counseling and education. Since I didn't have it, I joined TOPS or Take Off Pounds Sensibly for support and education. TOPS is a decades old non-profit dedicated to help people lose weight.

That's been my program: MyFitnessPal, Walking 3x a week, and TOPS.

I went through the entire process with the surgery, except the surgery: all the exams, the reviews, the education, the psychologist (one-on-one and group), the cardiologist -- the whole maze. When it comes right down to it, if I wasn't losing weight this way or if it were to come back for some reason, I'd have the Roux En Y (preferring it over the sleeve because of better effectiveness and good safety).

But what I've learned doing this has been life-changing for me. I am positive I won't have to have the surgery. Food logging gives **me** enough control -- it's not perfect but it's good enough.  It's not magic and if someone's right for the surgery and the surgery is right for them, it should definitely happen.

Make sure your surgeon is as picky about his patients as you are about picking your surgeon -- that way you know you've got a good one who is looking out for your safety and effectiveness.  Those trying to do as many as they can to whomever they can are not the surgeons you want.Rooting for your success!Cucumber slices are great. I use them to make 'nachos' with refried beans and salsa :) Yikes, I did not expect you to say that :D

Carrots are good for you. Enjoy them! I don't think it's cheating if you take a bit of humous with them.MY opinion is that unless the emotional and psychological issues and hang-ups that underlie the weight management issues are resolved, eventually people end up right back where they started if not worse off for the additional stress and anxiety.

With that in mind, at 7.5 lbs/month, you're already well on your way to a sustainable program.My dad isn't dead yet.  We are suppossed to log our food. However, I got hit with a hard emotional blow from my sister two weeks ago and though I have not ate carb foods, I have quit tracking my food, ate nuts, ate too many crab cakes, etc.  I have still been losing weight but only .6 pounds a week for the last 2 weeks.&gt; I've never felt more alive, more energetic, and just happy with the world.

That says it all. Well done.


Any pointers you could give to someone who's never done weights, how can I start off?Hey man, I weigh that much right now just got out of a toxic relationship (dumped) and have been going to the gym almost religiously the past month.

I wanna ask, what should I do to tone my chest? I have somewhat of M'oobs and I hate that. But I've been doing exercises to help that and its getting better but tell me ya ways!!!

Congrats man! I dont know you but I'm proud of you for deciding this isn't the end of you and lifting yourself to a new plateau.

I'm sure the honeys are finer now also!I think I came into the process like that, but that's because I'm a self improvement junky, and self improvement is make permanent changes.  If you have been trying to engineer habits for a while, thats how you think to solve problems.  You don't learn productivity habits and then imagine that once you're caught up you'll go back to your old ways.  This is just how you work now.

I don't have a hard goal weight or schedule.  I do have a commitment to making sure any change I make to diet or exercise sticks and becomes effortless.  If I get to a point where I reach equilibrium, and I want to lose more weight or gain muscle, then I'll tinker with new habits.

For me it's really about engineering a healthy lifestyle and getting weight loss as a benefit.  It's a way that works well for me.Okay! I can try this. I do love carrots :) "I know how hard it is to choose portion control over your bodies natural desire to eat what ever."

This really resonates right now, as I sit and ignore my inclination to go to the kitchen and find something tasty rather than listening to my stomach, which is decently satisfied after a reasonable lunch. This is so much more mental than physical. You post it because you have no change why you are stupid. Seriously.  I hope that he at least used protection when he was cheating.  Ugh.

OP did a great thing by taking that negativity and redirecting it into something positive, woo!Pretty sure that's over estimating your TDEE unless you are working out (hard) for an hour+ every day of the week. That's about my TDEE at 5'11'', 198 but I'm at 10% bodyfat and I workout an hour every day.I have 2 aha moments that completely changed the way I look at living a healthy life (by healthy I mean mentally and physically).

The first was finding the 5:2 diet. I have tried every diet under the  sun and this is by far the best I have found. It is simple to maintain and only requires strong discipline twice a week. I have gone a bit further than the diet suggests to what I call the 4:2:1 diet, where I eat &lt;2500 kj for 2 days, &lt;8000kj for 4 days and don't record what I eat for one day. This has not been excessively hard to maintain and has been very beneficial to my health. In addition, unlike other diets I have tried it is backed by solid science; watch https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymotion.com%2Fvideo%2Fxvdbtt_eat-fast-live-longer-hd_shortfilms&amp;ei=td3bVOGQPOLbmgWQkoKICg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPV5RJ98QN14DiWPixY8AF-iRsPA.

The second was changing my mindset from focusing on long term goals e.g. I want to weigh 80 kg (Was 94kg last year now down to 86kg with 6kg to go) to focusing exclusively on achieving weekly goals e.g. Maintain a disciplined 5:2 diet. This completely changed my perspective and I no longer beat myself up for lapses in my self control. If I fail a goal I cross it off my list and at the end of the week I analyse where I went wrong and make changes to help me achieve it the next week. This has drastically improved my discipline as I was someone that beat myself up for slipping up on diets and made excuses for not going to training and losing motivation as a result. Now I religiously maintain my diet and train 6 times a week (I do braziian jiu jitsu).

I have adopted this approach for all areas in my life that are important to me; relationships, career/growth, health and fun and have seen significant results in my life. Committing to this approach forces me to take plunges on things that I would have previously procrastinated on i.e. I started a blog, tell my family that I love them at least once a week (I live interstate from them), started learning Spanish (I'm getting pretty good), surf every week, do all my house duties (keeps the gf happy), drastically improved my fitness and have so far lost 8kg (since October last year and that includes the Xmas break where I purposely let it slip for 3 weeks and ate and drank like a king).

Good luck with your own journey and if you keen to start exploring the 5:2 diet or wanted to start looking at focusing on weekly goals send me a message and I'm happy to give you some more info.Seems about right.  Yeah, with all the info out there, I'm learning more from posts like yours -- things that make it real and individualized.  That make me write out my thinking like I did above. That helps me fix it in my mind. You look excellent, great story!

I currently do not do weights. I have no clue how to start. Whether to do big weights or more reps etc. Any advice on how to start and how to learn about doing weights for fat loss?I need a belt to hold up my size 16 pants now!Stay on my calorie count!Measure your cream, count it in your daily calories.

I take 1tsp sugar (15 calories) and 1 tbsp of half and half cream (20 calories). So a "regular" coffee has just 35 calories. Do you like carrots? Try eating 20 large carrots next time that insatiable hunger arrives. If you're not hungry for lots of carrots then you aren't really hungry.That's just good manners anyway. "Can I bring a side/dessert?" (Completely unrelated note: It looks good on you to let them bring a dish, anyway. If you make lasagna, you probably really like lasagna. If they bring roasted green beans, they probably really like those. In that case, even if they're not a super big fan of what the other person made, everyone there has at least one thing they like.)Also, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it easier to drop 3-5 lbs/week when you're a land whale, than when you've only got 30-60 lbs of fat to loose?Yeah I know, I'm not trying to lose so much as be healthier. I'm on this sub for tips and stuff. That's why I don't have a goal weight -- but I do want some idea of a goal, because it's hard to keep my current physical state in perspective My guess is you had been around 270 for a while so HUGE congratulations in the achievement of losing 40lbs. Anyone would be delighted to have done that.

You're now thinking you've an end goal to get to. How about taking it a bit easy on yourself and focus on losing 1lb at a time.

Personally I think you should enjoy and celebrate the 40lbs loss. You are well capable of losing 1lb more. And you're likely capable of losing 1lb more after that.

Have you been doing some exercise like walking or cycling or swimming or running? Exercise is great for your heart.

Well done again and hope you get on well continuing your journey.The leggings are off Amazon and the top is from Foreign Exchange (I bought it in every color - super comfy, flattering, and easily transitions from yoga to club to beach ) I don't think I had any particular ah-hah moment. However, I've worked really hard from the beginning at making my changes in the "mindless margin" - that space where I could really go either way.

If I could park closer or further, I parked further. If I could walk/bike an errand or drive - I moved toward walking it. If I'm not really hungry, I wait a bit longer.

The difference in calories between maintaining at 150 and maintaining at 120 is pretty low. Assuming you're sedentary, you're probably looking at 1520 vs 1680 calories per day. That works out to skipping a yogurt or adding a half hour walk.

The only "I'll do this forever" commitment I've made is to weigh every day. Everything else - I'm trying on to see how it fits.

Martial arts was great until I had a knee injury, now I'm trying swimming.
Calorie tracking makes me crazy, so I did an exchange diet.
I did alternate day modified fasting. Then occasional calorie tracking and occasional intermittent fasting.

Now I do moderation and food awareness as I kind of ease into maintenance.

Because I made a lot of small changes instead of a few big ones - even when I "slip" most of the good habits are still in effect. I guess my misconception is that I "have" to eat salads. I love your idea for chips, I'm now thinking about making my own apple chips too.Or, if you're like my grandmother, all the recipes say "a scoop of this" or "3 handfuls of that." She's not a real precise cook. I just throw caution to the wind and make up a number for caloriesMakes sense. The gluten free cereal is the only gluten free food I eat just cause it really is fucking delicious. Like heaven in a box.That actually sounds like the way I should go. I'm already eating raw/steamed veggies but roasted adds a whole new twist. So Broil?
 I think it's a quote from Michael Pollen's book, "In Defense of Food"... "When you see the words 'low-fat', think, 'chemical shitstorm'." You take out the fat, you gotta bump up the flavour somehow. Sugar, fake sugar, weird stuff I can't pronounce... I think you just need to decide which battles you wanna pick, and what stuff you're comfortable consuming. And if you are not a diagnosed celiac, get away from the gluten-free business. Very nice. Multi and fish oil. Brand doesn't matter. Pick your favorite.

Even if the science is bullshit, the structure and the act of taking them each day help reinforce my other good behaviors. This is the best advice. My biggest issue would be the inevitable sugar craving that comes after. Not more, but I do feel oddly smug about it. Had a Crunchie bar today, logged it, and had a slice and a half of pizza tonight (also logged it). Everything fit into my daily goals, and I feel good about that. Helps me feel like this is sustainable. I don't eat this stuff everyday, but I'm not feeling like I miss out on anything that I truly want.Two servings of pumpkin spice creamer. Keeps the white girl in me content. Yeah, I'm trying to keep my food the same, just less sugar, fatty foods, and snackage. I just don't want too much sugar to be the reason I weigh myself in a few weeks and have not lost a pound. You can  do this! All it takes is one small step at a time! You realizing that you want to change and rededicate yourself to this journey is an amazing step in the right direction!I don't get a lot of fruit, but my main snack is a gluten free cereal. Why would low fat foods be higher sugar?Honestly, your starting weight is in the healthy range, so you're not doing bad. You might want to work on building muscle more than just losing weight?

Unfortunately I don't have any progress pics available to me at the moment but I can check through some old backups later. what the fuck does that even mean?Thank you!I would,but maybe do it slowly. Not helpful for the mental health issues to be lying awake for ages, thinking... I would suggest getting your mental health to a place where you feel it's improved, and then tackle the weight. Good luck!Probably? I've never actually looked. It may just be a little hidden.That's the best feeling. When I was in one of my classes the other day, someone said "Whoa, I can feel your suprasternal notch really well." "That's because she's so skinny!" I felt awesome.Wow, what a shitty text.  Keep it up! You're awesome!A lot of shorter girls resort to 1200 a day because that's the lowest they should go to create a deficit and even then it isn't that big of a deficit. My sedentary TDEE is 1650... so to lose 1 pound a week without regular exercise I should be eating 1150. So that sucks. I'm pretty comfortable at 1200 now but it was a struggle to find low cal foods I enjoyed enough to eat over and over. It sounds like you could easily lose weight at 1400-1500 so I say do that and focus on keeping it sustainable for the long run. I'm your height, your age and I was 175 when I started low carb. I usually eat around 1300-1400 calories a day, a bit more now that I'm running 4 days a week and 10-20 minutes of yoga a day. 1200 is what I used to eat when I wasn't exercising. Basically just eat at a deficit and you should be ok. I wasn't and had to go low carb to lose weight but that is another story for another day.Congrats. I love my morning walks. Can't wait to get off the treadmill soon. Portland OR here is awful wet. I feel like you need a new doctor. I love the two therapists I've had. If your doc isn't a good match for you, can you try someone else? Thus is serious shit. Thanks I went over and read it. Cheese is my weakness too, even though I know that I shouldn't eat it! (I have an intolerance to whey, kind of like lactose intolerance but to the protein rather than the sugar in dairy). But I think I need to keep that in mind, that I'm working to have as healthy of a body as I can. For me, vanity helps with the day-to-day choices, but picturing long term I want to be healthy.
Go us!Dude, no worries, be a hardass all you like. I like the flavour, so I measure and count my "splash". A little goes a hell of a long way, We're the same age with the same body type! I decided to try and lose 2 lbs per week, and so MFP has me around 1200 calories a day (which is lower than I thought it would be considering my TDEE), and it's miserable. It's easy on the weekends when I don't work and can go a little hungry, but I find it very difficult (impossible) to do while on the job. Even making foods that are low cal and fulfilling, thanks to r/1200isplenty, doesn't really change the fact that I'm tired, hungry, and crabby all day. I think I'm gonna try and up it to 1400, because I just don't have the energy to make 1200 work. You'll be getting fist-bumps and "what are ya working today bro?"s in no time.I like what you said about learning more. I always love learning new things and just more in general. Sometimes I find it frustrating because there can be a lot of mixed information and a lot of articles boasting the next best thing or the 4 tips you just have to know. There's a lot to sift through out there.

As for me: F 21 5'2" SW: 150 CW: 130 GW: 120
I'm little and don't do much I don't need or deserve large amount of calories. I know my maintenance will be higher that 1200, but not by a whole lot it seems. I need to learn how to make it work, long term.Myfitnesspal has the ability to track more than just calories. If you feel you're deficient in a particular vitamin or mineral then work on improving your diet.

Vitamins are a stop-gap measure and without knowing what you are deficient in (if you are actually deficient that is) it's really just a stab in the dark trying to cover off what you may be missing blindly by just adding a bunch of supplements. OP said her father was in the hospital for a week, she didn't say he died, although the point is validJust a couple of weeks!? Good job! :D My BF is 6" taller and 20 lbs lighter, but he's trying to gain and I'm trying to lose. I can't wait for the day we switch places!!!It's ok he is gay and looks great.Don't know what kind of medications your doctor is thinking about, but I've used sertraline, citalopram and am currently using venlafaxine. I lost weight with all of these and gained only because I ate to much. Stress = binging, but I'm trying to resolve this with running. Work in progress, you can say...
Just want to say:these meds will not make you fat. Maybe you feel a little more hunger, but proteinrich and/or fibrous food can help with that. Choose wisely and you'll succeed!

Good luck with your stress and problems. Try to work on your mental health: it's the base for loosing weight. less than 20% of calories.Both of these are awesome. Sweet potato and beetroot chips are uhmazing. fparty -- feel free to add!According to the personal trainer that I was using, visible abs are simply a result of being at ~12% body fat or less (for males).

Good job, and keep it up!Sounds like you need to lose some more weight, or start working on them pecs.I'd just go ahead and eat whatever wasn't moving to fast for the rest of the day. Get back to your diet tomorrow. No regrets! I find it doesn't effect me all that much. And lots of people will tell you otherwise but I know what works for me and a buddy of mine. We are both in keto and schedule cheat meals. I've held my weight for 7 months (lost 65lbs) and so has my buddy (85 lbs lost). My doc has given me that kind of advice. Then we laugh because he's joking.  If doing the obvious worked I wouldn't be at doc's. :p

Do you have any progress pics? I'm 5'5", SW 135, but honestly don't know what my goal weight should beI've been struggling the last few weeks. Our kitchen is being renovated... I cannot cook. No sink to clean things. I can't clean things in the bathtub because the floor in there has SIGNIFICANT water damage so we have to limit our use in there until we find out what's wrong. I'm struggling to find mostly healthy meals that can be heated up in the microwave or when we go out to eat... I'm sick of sandwiches and soups... I want greasy easy fast food but I just can't... I'm hungry a lot!

End vent thank you for listening. I know it's a first world problem and I have no right to complain. The renovation is taking longer than we expected and have not had a kitchen for 2 weeks now... Samesies. I am 5'8 and 1200+ my moderate activity level just left me hungry all the time.

1400-1500 is way better for meDo you have a scientific source for this? Can genuinely tell you there is no photoshop. The lighting is pretty good in my bathroom and I did use Instagram (obviously) here is the original http://imgur.com/8JBxX3UI was going to reply, but TreeFIddy1031 said basically what I was going to say, lol. I check my weight daily but make my official weigh in on Saturday. The daily weigh ins help me stay focused on making my pound a week goal.

Take it one day at a time. Eventually you'll be able to see yourself thin, because it'll be easier to picture. You'll see the results and it will be easier to take the additional weight off as you get closer to June.

Hope this helps!MFP invite sent. My username is Hotcops, because I was watching Arrested Development when I set up my account :)


Your story sounds a lot like mine (F29/5'4" SW 200 CW 195 GW 150). This is the first time all the pieces have fit together for me, so to speak. If I can make this change, you can too (so very cliche but true). Best of luck! I did pre log. But I went with 10 500ml to start off with. And 8 of these were had a friends house before we went to a pub and a club. I did mange to drink JD and diet cokes when I got to the club. So I have that going for me.

And I am Irish so those who think the drinking might be excessive, lets just say its not to far from the norm.  Maintenance is a bit scary. I haven't been 185 since highschool so there is a doubt in my mind about maintaining that weight once I hit it. I mostly try not to think about it for the moment. I have maintained 190 - 195 for large lengths of time so I feel I could do 190 but 185 seems like a bit of a stretch.But again, I'll focus on losing the weight right now and worry about maintenance later. Today was my aha moment :/

[Here's the post I just made about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2vkxyp/psa_lets_remember_that_were_also_doing_this_to/)
I'd much rather not eat pizza than have a heart explosion.

This is our new healthy life!Ding ding ding. We have a winner.Poke a hole in the top of the lid with a thumb tack or a small nail.  Then you take a square piece of electrical tape and gently place it over the hole.  Then you use the ziploc ~~penis pump~~ [vacuum pump](http://www.amazon.com/Ziploc-Vacuum-Starter-3-Quart-1-Pump/dp/B003UEMFUG) over the top of the tape and vacuum out the air.  The tape works as a one way flap.  It lets the air out but not in. To unseal it, just remove the tape.  The lids are re useable.  Removing as much air as you can from the jar will keep your greens fresher for a few days, enabling you to make salads for 5-7 days at a time.Fellow emotional/boredom eater here. I'm fairly new to my weightloss journey (41 days) but I have a few mantras that really help me:

"This isn't the last time I'll ever have the chance to eat ____. Its not now-or-never."
"I've had that before, I'll pass."
"It's not 'forbidden'-I could have it if I wanted. But I'm CHOOSING to eat healthy and I am in control. My emotions aren't the boss of me" I'm a little taller than you and when I tried eating about 1,200 calories I was super miserable and hungry almost all the time. Which caused me to binge and eventually give up tracking what I was eating so I put on weight. I would say it is better to eat an amount below your TDEE that you can stick with, than to be miserable and give up. Even if it takes longer to loose the weight if it is something you can stick with you have a better chance of keeping it off.   Not sure what kind of cook you are but there are ways to make lean versions of those. No the advice was just "Avoid meds, don't think about food and meditate. "

I feel like I need meds. That answers my question tooThis is NOT being crazy at all. You might be tempted to just let it go "for one night", but in my experience that's a slippery slope. If you're truly interested in making a lifestyle change, you have to figure out how to work that into every aspect of your life-special occasions and family get-togethers included.


So do your best to enjoy the night with your aunt while still being mindful of what you are eating.Get out in front of it by saying something like, "Auntie, I look forward to spending time with you but as you know[does she know?] I'm making an effort to eat better. Please don't be offended if I only take a small portion/have something else instead/ask questions about the contents of the dish."


I experience the same thing with my inlaws. They're lovely people but not very health conscious. So when we visit, I make sure and eat a filling, healthful meal ahead of time and only have some salad or a side at their house. Good luck!  Big change, you look so healthy.Don't like salad, I dare you not to like this:

(Broccoli, Tomato and Feta Salad)Yup!  It's a long journey and the lifestyle changes required for fast weight loss can be difficult to maintain in the long term.  Just make sure that every day you're living better and making better decisions than you were before you started this journey.Nope 1200 is not required to eat at. It is just the lowest over can safely eat at on a regular basis before one starts to see the signs of malnutrition, generally. As long as you eat under your daily limit you are good. It isn't a race to lose the fastest, it's a race to live the longest (by reducing your risks by being at a healthy weight)Heavy or 'whipping' cream, 33 - 35 percent. Has much less carbs than light cream or milk.According to wikipedia (I know, a dodgy source) the average height of women in the US (assuming you're American) is 5'4 so I would assume that that is the average height of women posting here. You are clearly well above this and this probably accounts for your higher intake need. I would say stick to 1500 and forget about 1200. It's probably too low for you. You are 'known' to the gym people. Next step is become good friends with them and get free stuff!This. Gotta get my money's worth at the cost of my health. Where does this come from?Eat what you are comfortable with, not anyone elseGood plan. I get free food, snacks, soda, candy at work every day. I'm an emotional eater. I hate wasting food. I am actually heading out to a great restaurant with work tomorrow and I now have my game plan! Thanks!You put it on one pound at a time, it will come off one pound at a time! That is an accomplishment. I looked at the clock yesterday, and said "YES! In two hours I get to go workout!"


I've never said anything even remotely like that before in my life. I've always been exercise-resistant. So looking forward to exercise is a victory for me. Because it wasn't helpful or because you couldn't do what they were advising?  :).   Not criticizing. I'm in therapy and see a difference between the two. In my own case my therapy is more about identifying causes than changing behaviors. Not saying one is better (this is only therapist I've seen).

From reading other comments it seems you eat 3 meals and the third is at midnight. Is that correct?  If true maybe you could just time shift a bit and have smaller healthy and filling snacks around. Worst case you grab something of those as opposed to eating a whole meal.

Alrighty that sounds good... I thought that it might be time for that anyways... Thanks a lot!!!
**SO REAL.** I hate eating other people's food! They always add unnecessary oil and sugar! I just stick to raw salads at the dining hall.Congrats man, you look so awesome! (you looked pretty good before anyway).

That text your ex sent you shows me how messed she was. If a girl sent me that I would have a really difficult time just brushing it off and move on. But you did and you showed her!This is what bothers me about my lower stomach. I'm working on toning it, but I have a lot of excess skin. It's the reminder of how long I was overweight and by how much. I'm starting to save to get it removed though. I've spoken to a physican already and he wants me to get to my goal weight, work on toning more, and then making my appointment to remove the skin. I don't think I'll feel 100% comfortable with my body until that's removed.

Anyways though, have you tried lifting weights? Gain muscle, not fat, and I think it will help you .Fear and Ideal Protein may have been your starting motivation, but it's perseverance every day that helps you to keep going.  You don't quit, you double down.

Are you logging your food everyday?  Is that part of Ideal Protein?   Try a nondairy milk, like almond milk, soy or coconut.I have recently started doing zumba myself, at home, and I totally love it too! It is the most fun I have ever had working out!no, never. If I eat a bunch of crap, it is definitely over my goal&gt; a splash of olive oil

Hate to be a hardass, but this greatly increases the caloric value of the veggies. Roasted veggies are fine, but they kind of defeat the purpose of OP wanting to make low-cal salads better.

Cooking in general also makes more calories available than they would be raw- but the effect isn't huge.

My suggestions to make salad better: add vinegar or lemon juice, such as red wine vinegar (2 cal/tbsp), fresh ground pepper, and a greater variety of veggies that you like, such as raw grated squash, mushrooms, or jicama.HALLO!Age, height, sex, and goal weight?

Moderation is the result, but learning about this has been an evolution.  Like you, it started with no control.  Then tight control.  Now I'm learning about more caloric food with reasonable control.  My maintenance calories will be around 1900 a day, but I'm learning that I'm going to regularly have 1500-1700 days and occasionally have 2100-2300 days because life is like that, it's not as regular and routine as we would probably like to have it.

It hasn't been an aha moment, but there have been little discoveries along the way. Just relax and eat/drink what you want. Make sure to tell yourself that the next day YOU WILL get back on track. Being healthy should be a lifestyle change and it's okay to let loose every now and then. Salad is easy to make.

1. 50/50 romaine/spinach
2. Fresh Black Pepper Grinder
3. Fresh garlic salt grinder.
4. A little Parmesan cheese
5. Fresh RED onion
6. Cucumber
7. Salad Dressing (I like lite balsamic or lite Italian)

That will make the most delicious salad you've ever eaten.

I got my ass kicked yesterday with my first training but afterwards I never felt so good after a workout since high school training. It feels amazing and the soreness isn't nearly as bad as I thought! I am for sure going to stick that and weight watchers! Best of luck to the two of us!I work out regularly, but also have MFP set to sedentary. Do you have your fitbit linked to MFP? I do and it adds calories that I am able to eat, if I choose to. I typically eat back some of them. Sounds good. A tool like MyFitnessPal can really help you achieve this.  Set it to lose 1 pound a week.  Absolutely, and the less weight you have to lose, the slower it will go. I'm really happy with my average - it basically ended up being 5 pounds a month, though some months it was barely any while another would have been 8-9. It was a healthy rate for me, though it did make it hard to see results unless I dug up my old pants.It's funny, the biggest thing I ever learned was to stop thinking of dieting as 'EAT SALAD" and think of things mostly in terms of eating less bad while admitting I'm just going to eat garbage.

Like a large coke and a large fries are 820 calories. So at some point I started getting diet coke and a 6 piece mcnugget (280 calories + sauce). As a side to some other meal.

Like that is a savings of like 500 calories. That is an absurd amount. And it's still not 'GOOD' eating, but it's literally zero sacrifice of any kind and is the exact sort of change that I know ten years from now I can still be doing while a breakup with a girlfriend or a bad day might make me trade eating a bunch of radishes back for eating cookies.

Honestly because junk food is a lot of people's major source of extra calories it's kinda super important to be the place you focus the most effort into learning exactly how many calories are in each item and how you need to fit the calories into a day if you eat this hamburger or that taco. Because the numbers are so big to start with it's the place it's the easiest to cut hugely without real sacrifice or hardship. Cutting it out forever would be better, but we all know you won't, so figure out how to live with it. Thin people go to mcdonalds too. Its all cool, no worry, now continue your regimen. I just barely got into the "normal" BMI range as well. congrats!There's no caveat there.  Don't make your mental illness worse by adding physical problems to it.

What you're doing doesn't work, you're right.  There's nothing to "tough out" here.  You wouldn't tough out cancer or diabetes, and mental health problems still kill tons of people.I can understand that. I told myself the same thing when I first started out. For me, I'm goal-oriented so I set a goal of getting to a certain weight and going after it. The hardest part is just maintaining for me, since that goal is almost a non-goal, as where is the goal post, or finish line, when you are trying to just stay in one place? So once you hit that goal, you'll be able to refocus, though don't forget to be happy every day for the accomplishments you've had on the journey.Thanks very much! I'm male and I haven't yet set a goal weight, and only looking for the toned up or semi defined abs because I don't want to really bulk upI agree, I think that's the best idea. You can let her know that day or the day before that you've prepared a salad to go with whatever she's bringing. "Oh, I had all this produce I had to use before it goes bad"I understand. I'll caveat my post by saying I need to lose around 20-25 pounds total. I'm overweight by like 15 pounds. However, I really don't treat my mental illness at all. I'm trying to tough it out as long as possible but... I guess it's not working so well ehThank you. It means a lot. I am going to post some pictures along the way. I just found this sub today and am ecstatic. Yes my family members and friends are supportive but my mom is 6 hours away and no one around me needs to lose weight so it's been hard. I just went through a big break up (which looking back I realize was the cause of my weight gain.. Don't pick up others bad habits!!) and I am SO ready to get back to my healthy weight! I'm at about 164 right now with a goal of 130 and possibly a tad more after that. I'm 5'6" and 22 years old. I don't want to spend my last year in college being ashamed of the way I look!
My issue with seeing success on this sub isn't the # of pounds - because let's face it, most of us don't have 100+ lbs to lose (ok, actually I do but I'm not shooting for that anyway) - its the SPEED of the weight loss.

It's just not realistic for most of us to drop 50lbs in 3 months. Or even 6 months. And especially not in a way you can maintain for the long haul. (Not saying it can't be done, just that its def not as easy as you might think from reading this subreddit.)

It is possible, but you're thinking too far in advance. Those machines measuring bf% are notorious for being inaccurate so honestly I wouldn't even bother basing anything off of it. Also a lot of things can change between now and getting closer to your goal weight. I would say wait until you're sub-200 then worry about this.

Are you doing any resistance training?

This post is 100% tough love, but you need to hear these two things:

1.  At 232 lb and 5'4", you're still extremely obese.
2.  Your dad would not have wanted you to react to his death by joining him.

If you want it in the front of your mind, put it there.  The path to health is stationary.  It never moves.  You choose not to walk on it.Believe me, Im not looking forward to spending the $ on one, but medical circumstances dictate I get one.I think carrots are good with salsa. The crinkle-cut carrot "chips" are good for dipping.  Celery sticks sprayed with a little lime juice go really well with guacamole.Thanks. Never owned one before and this is super helpful!I don't want to describe my particular circumstances, but my SO suffers from a medical condition where they need to be 30 seconds from a toilet at all times. Inability to leave the house are part of the equation that lead to obesity, a treadmill seems like a good starting point.Wow, TIL. That's super interesting...and weird.
OP, don't let people tell you that you're not changing your life if you have some Taco Bell every now and then.  In a way, it's easier to eat things that lend themselves to precise counting.

You can get fat making every meal yourself out of only the most wholest ingreidents EVAR and you can lose weight with some occasional Bell.  This has been happening to me too. I'll rub around my chest and feel little bumps. Or rub my neck and feel little bumps.

I have a skeleton *inside me*, you guys.

Congrats to you for finding your own skeleton. :) There is a tool they use in cognitive behavioral therapy called the Thought Checker. the idea is to have your thought, recognize it, address what that thought meant to you, rephrase the thought, and address what the new meaning holds.


For bingeing, this might look something like:

thought: I've just eaten enough to fatten a cow for slaughter. I'm Worthless, and the day - and my diet, is ruined. Eating more won't matter, the damage is already done.

meaning: I hate myself, and have just wasted all my effort by binging on crap.

NEW thought ('Honest' thought): I ate 2 servings of lasagna, summer rolls, and a twinkie. That was more than I intended, and I've gone over my calories for the day. But, this doesn't have to ruin my week, or even my day. I can stop myself from continuing, and rather than going overboard tomorrow and trying to 'burn off' all the extra calories (and 'burn myself out' in the process), I will accept what I have done, log it honestly, and move on.

NEW meaning: I did something I dislike, but it doesn't ruin me or my day. I will use this as an opportunity to see myself for the strong person I am, and move part it in a healthy manner. Today doesn't mean tomorrow.Well, you're very swimmingly attired! I bet you look forward to Discovery's next shark week!1. Your ex sounds like a real cunt (and I'm assuming you aren't so into those) so geez, dodged a bullet there.
2. Somehow you look younger now. That's crazy and awesome.
3. Sounds like you had a full life overhaul.  Great job! Me too. When I was obese and gaining fast doritos were definitely one of the main culprits. I always think of it like this. I'm not going to fall of the wagon, since there is no wagon to fall from. It's just me, walking down the path towards a new life. Your will has taken you 40 lbs closer to your goal so why wouldn't it take you any further? You've got the heart of a fighter and giving up will only result in you falling back to where you used to be. At which point you desperately wished to be where you are at now. Does this make sense to you?
Diets don't really cut it if you want to maintain a healthy weight, you need to change your way of thinking. There is no wagon to fall of, since you decided to walk instead.
Hang in there OP and acheive your goal!You eat it because you have not change why you are overweight.

This will help you do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNPND9FfqU
So instead of going on meds that would make you fat and possibly solve your mental health problems, you self-medicated with food, which will never solve your mental health problems and also made you fat.

I fail to see how this improves your life at all.

Regardless of whether you eat unhealthy, you're still fat.  Your body will still break under the strain of too much food.  Food's an equal opportunity killer.

So, again, the advice still stands: treat your mental health problems or realize they're going to continue coming after you until you treat them for real.

As someone who has lost 100 lb in spite of bipolar disorder and while on meds, I'll tell you there's no excuse for not being aggressive with your treatment.  It's in your hands.This helps. It hypnotize you to replace high-carb with veges...

And it will also remove one of the reason why you weight to much...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNPND9FfqUYeah I like weighing every day.   But I what I consider to be my weight is an average of the last 3 days.  So the ups and downs are less noisy.
But weighing myself everyday is a great habit because it keeps me aware.  I hope I continue to do this long long after I've finished reaching my goal so I don't slip back up without noticing. &gt; but I cannot justify eating a bag of Doritos while I'm trying to diet

From your original post.  Just saying.  I appreciate the apology just the same.Part of successfully losing weight, and keeping it off, will be learning how to deal with situations where you won't know the exact calorie count of everything.  Just don't go crazy and eat seven portions, and you'll be fine!It sure is easier to count calories/macros when you eat prepackaged convenience foods. Even cooking for myself, I tend to eat simple foods with few ingredients rather than making something like a casserole and doing the math for calories/macros per serving. My dad is semi-overweight, he exercises a lot but he does not have a good diet. I know he lies about what his weight to me. Once, he half-heartedly mentioned in passing he needs to lose weight. I said "Switch to diet coke" (he drinks two 20 oz a day or more). "Nah. . ."
"Ok, eat less at each meal, I just watched you eat four slices of pizza, eat three instead"
"Nah"

Sometimes their heart isn't really in it. I love my parents and I want to see them get to a ripe old age, or at least see my grandchildren. But I also know I can't force anyone to do anything but myself.

I understand how much harder it is with a loved one, but they have to want the change. It's hard but true Your answer helped me today.  I always get down when I only lost 1 lb or none and forget that it's a long road and to stay with it. Thank You!It may be easier sure but it doesn't lead to a healthy lifestyle once your have reached your goal weight. You will eventually go back to your old habits because you didn't learn how to change those bad habits. You will always end up choosing fast food over making anything yourself.

That doesn't mean you have to give up fast food completely. You just have to limit it to a meal every week or two I have a keurig and I got k cups meant for iced coffee and they're pre-sweetened so I just drink those hot, they're amazing! Only 80 cals and I drink one cup so that's not too hard to add to my regular dayI definitely recommend eating breakfast and planning your meals in advance the best you can to distribute out your calories. Can you go to bed earlier maybe? Or try drinking more water.You're rocking them!!!
[Here's another awesome shark!](http://cdn-ugc.cafemom.com/gen/constrain/500/500/80/2015/02/02/09/f4/su/pown3ol80s.jpg)Look for vinaigrettes and oils instead of chunky, thick dressings.  It really brightens up the flavors when you have your favorite fruity dressing.

Here's my main three:
Spring mix with blackberries, balsamic vinaigrette, slivered almonds, and optional leftover chicken breast.

Spinach salad with raspberry vinaigrette and orange slices, pomegranate seeds, walnuts, sliced turkey

Romaine salad with lite italian dressing, boiled egg, artichoke heart, snap peas, cheddar

Small back story, I used to be 265lb, went to 213lb. Relapsed during my move and eating in vegas, am now currently 232lb and back on the wagon. I know what it takes to lose the weight with most of it being diet but went you put in the work the weight will fall off, especially doing interval training like Insanity. I'm on my third day of Focus T25 which is Shaun T's other program but stick to it, his workouts are the best workouts I've ever done, my girlfriend and I get our butts kicked with it. Let's move forward and kick butt! Cool thing is if I lose 30lb it'll be the least I'd have weighed in years, I know if I stick to this program that 30lb is gonna fall off, I'm stoked.Mine'll always start with the little bags, then before I know it I'm eating sharing packs at a time. Best to stay away from them entirely for me. Would you suggest a better bedtime? I haven't tried it, maybe that will help?Like a quinoa bowl or salad for lunch , no breakfast, usually eat like chipotle bowl for dinner and then get hungry at 12 and eat again. I guess I dont drink that much waterI don't want to go on meds, I heard they make you fat. But at the same time I deal with intrusive thoughts all day about how miserable I am and blah blah

I don't eat unhealthy I just eat WAY too much... I use food to cope, which I shouldn'tFight the power bro, just keep at it. Fuck that bitch - wont matter cuz you are winning :DYesss! Congrats. You look amazing. Keep doing stuff for yourself. Last year I was 265lb, went down to 213lb. Relapsed moving to Las Vegas (good fooood!), went to 236lb the beginning of this month, stopped the eating out and am 232lb. I started Focus T25 for my workout program cause I know that interval cardio works the best for weight loss. Got back on here cause I'm going to do it again and lose weight for good. So here is how I lost my initial weight. Start with your food intake. Drink more water, cut the carbs, treat carbs like a poison. No pasta, bread, donuts, tortillas, pizza, it goes straight to your hips and thighs. Find a salad you like. Make yourself eggs in the morning, snack on apples, oranges, bananas...that's simple right? Learn how to make yourself Chicken Breast, plop it on the tray and stick it in the oven, turn halfway through, cook through. Protein is going to help you with those splurging urges. Start finding yourself alternative foods, I found my love for almonds, avocado. Plan your meals, make a routine. Basically, the majority of your weight loss is going to come from dieting. Diet is about %70-%80 of how you are going to lose this weight. Running is hard at that weight, well for me when I was at my heaviest, so get on an elliptical and do interval training. Whenever you do cardio, do 20-30 minutes, make sure you do interval training.One thing I do is to take some psyllium husk fiber (I go for metamucil sugar free). A big glass of that stuff fills your stomach, and makes you feel quite full. Added bonus, I am as regular as the trains in Berlin. Just make sure to drink lots of water so it can work properly. Very helpful! Thank you.Maybe you have high body fat and low lean muscle (skinnyfat) and that's why you think you look fat in the mirrorGreat job so far! I am sure it can be even more discouraging with "less" to lose, but really just as much to gain :)I was visiting with my sister in December and told her that I'd lost 18 pounds. I was holding my 6 month old nephew while I told her this and she told me that he currently weighed 18 pounds. Mind you, my fat wasn't as squirmy as my nephew nor was it as cute but it was mind boggling that it was as heavy as him! Exactly! I'm only 5' and my SW was 120... I want to lose 15-17 pounds... that's it. Some people lose that in a month and I'm still not there yet (at 109 currently after about 2 months)  it was really discouraging but I realize that it doesn't minimize what I've been doing we all are working hard to do this regardless of weight the end goal is to be healthier :)I assumed you meant the share bags too. I have a serious weakness for Doritos. In my previous comment I was going to suggest getting a 30g single serving bag if you were really craving them. I've had to cut them out completely. They're not even that nice, but I can't stop eating them if they are in the house. Salsa, Avocado, Tuna, Cranberries, diced hard boiled egg (like a chef salad), and Rice Vinegar. I either do one or the other in my salad to make it interesting :). I'm not a medic, but the UK NHS gives clinical side effect data:

Very common: More than 1 in 10 people who take Orlistat

flatulence

headaches

infection of the upper respiratory tract

influenza

lowered blood sugar

oily discharge from the rectum

oily, fatty or liquid stools

passing stools more often than usual

stomach pain and discomfort

sudden urge to pass stools
I use [this calculator to find out my macros](http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/).I will stay under my calories and NOT give in to after dinner snack cravings!!!I stuffed my mouth with 5 pieces of pizza last night after a workout, don't let it get you down. I woke up this morning, drank 2 glasses of water, made scrambled eggs/salsa and am going on my third day of Focus T25 after I get off work tonight. Let's move forward and kick ass. Cake is simply a vessel for frosting. I'll let you know in about four more months... :)I still see myself as how I was almost daily, but then I'll see a recent picture and be like "holy crap!". This entire process is so mental and I'm still coming to terms with my new self. I'm not quite done either, but I think when I get to that point it will really help transition into my new way of viewing myself.I also am an emotional eater like yourself. Once I felt so guilty for having eaten fastfood that I almost made up my mind to forcibly puke it out.

I cried my eyes out for the rest of the evening that day.

I made a point to remember this miserable feeling.

Whenever I feel like over eating or eating outside food, I think of that miserable time and convince myself than I'm better than what I was before. I convince myself to eat to survive and not to pamper my tongue's momentary craving.



Or you can do another thing which is pretty effective.

When you feel like getting yourself some fastfood when its not your cheat day, take your phone out and find out how many calories the food has.

And then find out how much you need to work your ass off to burn those calories.

I hope this helps you decide wisely. The under armor shirt was my security blanket for the longest time! It doesn't conpletly flatten it out, but makes it look like you have massive pecks! Be pre warned, you will sweat more than usual with them and they hold in heat a little bit. I wouldn't go without one for the longest time, but I managed to break free of them recently.So let's put bread on cake?Remember that losing 100, 200, or 300 lbs means you first had to have that much to lose, and that even those of us with those numbers eventually have "just" 45 lbs to lose, too.

I can assure you, 45 lbs doesn't look insignificant to me, not with 65 lbs between me and my goal.  At this point, every pound lost seems like much more of a struggle than it used to.  The first 100 lbs were easy in comparison.Yeah. Three donuts is no reason to freak out. Three donuts happens. It's not a big deal. What would be a big deal is letting three small measly donuts derail your success. You are still awesome!Yeah...she's not ready. That's okay. I know it's not ideal for her health, but it's her life, her body. You need to respect that and not make her feel more attacked and judged. Take care of YOU. You can control what you eat and what you do. Lead by example, try not to worry too much about your mom and what you can't control. Today I will:

* Log all of my food in MFP.
* Do my full workout.
* Drink 80oz of water.
* Stay positive.
* Like myself and what I see in the mirror.
* Be an encouragement to others.
I'm currently living in Germany. Whenever you order "chips and ___" you *always* get doritos. It's not good, man.Salsa is made of veggies. I have cooked healthy food in the past.  Once night I made a garlic lemon chicken breast with some vegetables and she *hated* it.  Said it wasn't enough food.  She shouldn't be eating Fritos *at all*, even if it's with a healthy chili. :/Remember that BMI is slowly being phased out of use because it is increasingly unreliable since it does not take in enough metrics.You can't convince someone like this. It really is a realization she needs to come to on her own.

Focus on yourself, make healthy meals and offer your mother some when you do. No 'Have this, it's healthy for you!' just 'Hey, I made some of this. Want some?'.

Don't push the weight loss thing, she probably feels bad if she claims she's feeling attacked and not so many people are able to start losing weight if they feel like shit. They need to feel in a good place, supported, and prepared. If you keep up your own journey, she may join you. Especially if she likes the food you make :PYou are right although I thought about this fat absorber: https://www.medexpress.co.uk/clinics/weight-loss/orlistatYou can do it! Don't be discouraged, I had some rough times too but it's all worth it. Join the club :)i needed to hear this just now. thank you, and congrats!Stay under calories! I seriously needed this today! We have the same stats and its been super hard. I've lost a total of three pounds since the last week of December though I work out 4 days a week and eat around 1200 cals a day. Its discouraging for sure but I just have to focus on the end goal. Thank you for inspiring me today and congrats on losign the weight! You rock!Veggies with salsa? Hmmm I don't know about that one.

lol @ the downvotes for me not liking the same thing you guys do. Ahh  Reddit.Nope, actually sent this to a friend of mine who works in Photoshop for a living... he said it looks altered. It sounds like she's not really in a place where she's ready for change. If she's not ready, you can't force it.

What you can do is be patient, and try to help her any way you can. Can you contribute to the healthy food in the house? Could you offer to cook some meals, and do so in a healthier manner? I'm not saying you should be slinging salads at her, but make a roast dinner with veggies, or maybe a chili (which goes awesome with Fritos, FYI). She might feel insecure as a result of your weight loss attempts.

I know she's your mom, but maybe just focus on yourself for a while, and offer her help if she seems interested.

Also, when I eat breakfast at a restaurant, I totally order white bread for the toast. Just sayin'. My boyfriend is taking me to a restaurant that has published their caloric information for each menu item. I'm going to eat at maintenance calories for my ideal weight, which is about 300 more than my current intake. I've been super motivated to stay on track with my deficit and workouts this week because of it.Yeah, totally, I feel the same way when I'm lugging comparable weights at the gym. It's a pretty surreal feeling.It just stands as different for people. I know that for me I'm 240 (Down from 248 a few weeks ago :D) and I have a big belly but my shoulders are fairly fat-lessWow, what horrible things to say to you...or to any human being, really.  I'm sure he has no idea what he's obviously saying about HIMSELF with that text.
But his cruelty to you ended up being such a gift! Hah! Light salad is not good enough especially if it doesn't have any protein in it. For lunch I usually pack a salad with a chicken thigh. Without the chicken I get too hungry later on and end up pigging out. What I do is cook the chicken thighs for the week on Sunday and throw them in the fridge. Then I just grab and go in the mornings. Am I the only one who thinks the picture on the right looks Photoshopped?Either a little bit of half and half, or a decent amount of soy. Both work out to the same amount of caloties, both thicken my coffee enough to give it a more pleasant mouth-feel.

Cutting out sugar from my coffee was one of the first things I did, because I drink at least two cups a day, but I did it gradually. First two sugars, then one sugar, then half a sugar, and now, no sugar for nearly a year. How do you know what serving size I'm talking about? Many are supposed to be single serving packets, and are still horrendously bad for you. Edit: Sorry, that was a needlessly bitchy comment on my behalf. Even with a big packet, when I realise I shouldn't, I *will* just plow through them, half-consciously. Great job! You look great! I'm only down 12 and can already see face changes and am so excited for more. BUT I'm way more excited about the prospect of the random sweating going away!!"The only way your body will change if you give it no other choice"
I LOVE this, thanks xI've tried to drink black but I just can't handle the bitterness. I do a splash of almond milk and a packet of raw sugar.Nomoreshortbreaths :)I'm the same way.

I filled a trash can with stuff that I couldn't donate but wasn't going to eat.

I took the pain of that and turned it onto "I'm not buying any of that stuff again so I don't have to go through throwing it out again."My story is similar!  I would love to get back to that spot I was at years ago, and have had many times where I just lost hope.

Keep strong, and keep at it.  I know I am!

Also, I love the No Zero Days post!
There's a whole subreddit for it at /r/NonZeroDay Hey do yoy have any tips on monitoring calories burned for non cardio excercises like weights?Thank you.The previous advice we've given you is still what you should be doing.  Read the FAQ and control your diet.

Remember the erectile dysfunction part.So not only you look amazing, but you seem to have a time machine device of some sort! You look so much younger and healthier! Congratulations!
Looking very good, your hard work is definitely paying off :) May I ask at what weight you looked in the mirror and noticed how far you'd come?Dude, that's amazing. Last pic looks great. I'm currently a little over 200 lbs at 5'11 and my goal is to get down to 185 lbs and start working on muscle.Why are you eating a bag of corn chips?  It's not meant to be a single serving package.  If you want some guac and chips, eat some guac and chips.  *Some.*I need to know where to get these!  Super cute and kudos on rocking the crop top with it. :)Are you counting calories? If so (you should be) then arrange your budget so that you have enough calories left over for a large meal and perhaps a snack in the evening without blowing your budget.&gt; I know how hard it is to choose portion control over your bodies natural desire to eat what ever.

I don't think this is a natural desire.  I think it's socialized due to cultural norms and a lack of awareness of successful coping mechanisms for stress.

It's a hard process for sure, because it's difficult to undo the way you're socialized, but it's not impossible, and it's not natural.Duck face?Hey, I'm one of those people that lost hella weight. I went from 365 to 200 in about 13 months. Over the last six months it's been hella hard losing weight. I'm at 193 lbs. I'm not eating at a huge deficit, and I'm lifting a lot more than I used to, so my chest, arms and legs look muscular, but still it's hard to lose weight now. I'm the same height as you and know what you're feeling. I went from consistently losing a couple lbs a week to not losing anything in a month. It doesn't sound like you're treating yourself very well by sticking to a good daily routine and aggressively treating your mental health issues.  Why is that?

At some point, you have to realize that you're reaping exactly what you sow.  You're living like a person who doesn't treat their diseases seriously.  Keep in mind that it's much easier to lose weight when you have more of it to begin with. As you get closer to your ideal weight it gets harder and harder to lose. I've been stuck trying to lose these last 5 pounds for months!What do your daily meals usually consist of? Are they filling and nutritious? Are you drinking plenty of water?This is amazing!45lbs of muscle!?! Dang, son, that's some gain.Doesn't sound silly at all - I have only lost about 12 pounds but swear I feel lighter as well!
You pee it out, sweat it out, and you can breathe it out. Why water weight sticks around for so long and what mechanism triggers it to be released is still a mystery. One thing I've found is that regular re-feeds once or twice a month can help with water retention for some reason.  &gt;I do not usually eat healthy I eat like I used to my whole life but now I count calories so I eat waay less.

Okay, that's a good start. But even though it's true that eating less calories than you burn will result in weight loss over time, not all calories are metabolized the same way. This is especially true for sugar for which a calorie is more likely to be converted to fat rather than being burned up. If you are eating a lot of sugar or even trans-fat (read fried food) then your weight loss is likely to be slower than if you substituted those foods for something healthier. Lots of ways to add some pep:

A little of any of these will help depending on the salad.

- brown rice
- nuts &amp; seeds
- avocado
- feta
- pomegranate seeds
- dijon mustard
- green chillies

I've lost 4 gallons of milk.

I remember seeing this page posted a while back. It is cool but actually holding that much weight was like wow. I weighed 340 standing 6'1

I lost a little over 140 pounds in 14 months and got down to 192. I followed a lifting program. I think I only did cardio for the first couple months and hadn't touched it since.  I got real strong and lost a shit ton of weight really fast. I ate 2350 calories 5 days a week and whatever on the other 2.

When I finally got small I just increased my calories and my strength, lifts and size exploded and I went from that 190 in october of 2013 to 242 this month with visable abs I didn't have even at my smallest.

You can get strong even on a defecient. To get big you need more calories. Yeah, but the recipe won't really tell you how much butter she's putting in it. Or cheese. If the recipe calls for 1/4 cup of cheese, how much is she really putting on? I'm not sure you can really trust it.Splenda and cream. I'm down to 2 of those small cream tubs and 2 splenda packets per cup ~22 calories all together. I'm working my way to black. I'd start lifting and gaining muscle :)I really liked that one to.
It is not PC at all, but there is a line from those goofy "broscience" youtube videos that go something like "you know the difference between you and a mentally challenge person? the mentally challenge person does not complain about their genetics..." There are ways around most things, just have to find the right combination. Dude, leave those things alone.  Make the change a 100% natural one you can live with and sustain.

A great fat burner is a brisk walk 20 minutes after dinner.  Seriously.I want to know more about this 5 dress project but that link is broken in the blog. Google is no help. sidenote, why do the 'after' selfies always do that 'pucker my lips so I looks skinnier' thing?  Well, i guess I answered my own question, lol. * 45 day streak on MyFitnessPal
* A colleague told me I inspired her to start losing weight
* Someone I haven't seen in six months told me the difference was striking (well, for 35lbs, I hope so!)You're doing great.  Good work &amp; carry on.  If you want to do a little more, cut around 200cals/day and see it melt.
My days are typically between 1200 and 1400. MFP gives me 1800. I think most of the reason I'm over 1200 is because the wine/beer and dark chocolate I have.

It's not hard at all to still enjoy the things you like while losing weight. People think you have to give up everything. My office is a nightmare.

Every day is somebodys' excuse to bring in chocs, cakes snacks.

It's a real mix of people, including triathletes, but the food they bring in is invariably the worst junk-food.
Thanks buddy, I shall remember that! :) Two suggestions:

* Make your own tortilla chips. Take a tortilla, slice it up, lay the chips out on a baking tray, spray with low calorie oil , turn them over and spray the other side season with salt (a little paprika or chilli powder is lovely, or whatever you like to add) and bake in a low oven until crisp.

* Get a mandolin to thinly slice vegetables, have them raw with salsa, or prepare as above to make vegetable crisps. Carrots are brilliant raw, parsnip is my favourite crisp, but you can use try any vegetable. Just mind your fingers when slicing. I got this bag of chips recently called Falafel chips, they are amazing and go great with my hummus.As a 100lb'er it's not so much the number (although goal-oriented geeks like me like numbers) but the change in your body and mind.

The mind develops a better relationship with food and the body follows.

Log it and see if your day can be salvaged calorie-wise.  If not do better tomorrow.  Unless those donuts were 3500 calories you didn't gain more than a pound.  Hang in there, you don't have to be perfect you just have to do better tomorrow :)MFP invite sentThis! Fuck salad. There, I said it. Roasted veggies all the way.Thanks for this!  I just complained to my trainer about my anxiety that everything I'm doing will stop working.  It's been 75 days and I'm doing great but I'm terrified that it won't work.  He told me that the one thing that's guaranteed to stop my progress is quitting.  What I'm doing is healthy and beneficial regardless of the results or how fast they happen.  That's the benefit of making healthy lifestyle changes.  They are always beneficial regardless of results.  So I'm sticking it out and not letting my fear get the best of me or trick me into self sabotage.  If it takes 6 more months or 3 more years to get there I will get there if I continue making smart healthy choices for myself.
F38 5'5" SW 168 CW 150 GW 135175 lbs at 5'11" is pretty good. Maybe instead of lowering your goal weight you could start replacing fat with muscle.OMG a few weeks ago someone in my office brought in homemade coconut raspberry tarts. Two of my favourite things! So I googled it, and sure enough, I find a recipe online. OK, I can fit this into my budget for today! I grabbed one and savored every amazing bite.

Later I thanked my coworker for bringing in the treats, she says "Yeah! They're so good, especially since I use double the amount of filling and topping the recipe calls for!"

Goddamn.I wish it was warm enough to do that where I am. Hurry up summer! There is something satisfying about fitting a trend line to all that noisy dataYeah, I have to be picky when I go to Chipolte. I get a salad now. No rice, sour cream, cheese, no tortillas. I usually get black beans, green pepper onion mix, corn salsa, and medium salsa. Oh and by the way, I do the same as you as far as trying to keep my breakfast and lunch down to about 300 cal each. I try to keep my dinner to under 500 cal, which leaves me 100 cal for snacks (I'm on a 1200 cal per day diet).

Then any extra exercise I do, such as jogging, gives me a little more breathing room to go above that 1200, or I just bank the extra as additional weight loss if I'm not feeling hungry that day.Beanitos brand chips are much healthier unless you're avoiding carbs. In the case, Pork Rinds.I hate black coffee. Hate, hate, hate. So I've just focused on reducing the amount of sugar I put in my coffee. Right now it's three cubes instead of four. I just budget for the coffee. I know that I'll want, at minimum, two cups of coffee. Period.

If I want extra caffeine, I'll switch to a creamer with 35cal/tbsp and use one tablespoon for a double portion of coffee.

You might try getting flavored coffee. Coffee snobs decry them as the handiwork of the devil, but snobs gonna snob. I am always hungry late at night, so to prevent going over, I eat a smaller dinner. I may be hungry a little bit earlier at night, but I just try to push it to a little bit later. While eating a smaller calorie dinner, I make sure to take a few breaks and chug some water. I will usually go through at least 16oz just during dinner, and then I feel really full when I am done eating. Hope this helps, and good luck!!If it's something you can't take a small portion of, like, say, pork chops, maybe she wouldn't be offended if you ate half and took the rest home. &gt; only for those with type 2 diabetes

Fair enough, there are other studies and I just googled that one up on the fly. But there's also [this to consider about type 2 diabetes](http://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/statistics):

&gt;Type 2 diabetes is a common and increasingly prevalent illness that is largely preventable. In adults, type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes; the remainder are adult-onset (or adult-diagnosed) type 1 diabetes, a  form of diabetes for which the cause is unknown.

&gt;    29.1 million people in the United States have diabetes, 8.1 million of whom may be undiagnosed and unaware of their condition.
&gt;    **In adults 20 and older, more than one in every 10 people suffers from diabetes**, and in seniors (65 and older), that figure rises to more than one in four.
&gt;    1.7 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in U.S. adults in 2012, and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is on the rise.Congrats!! I am also getting there :) I am 3 lbs shy for my first one ..Forgive yourself. Learn from the experience. Were those donuts worth the calories?  If it happens again, have one and eat it slowly. Ok, thanks a lot.When I actually have coffee (rarely do), I'll put almond milk in it. You could also try coconut milk because that will give you the cream and a sweetener. Almond milk is only 60 cals per serving, not sure about coconut milk because I don't have any right now.

I have a friend that makes a coffee protein shake. Maybe look into that?Ahhh, gotcha. That's tricky. Makes for a late night and probably a short sleep. I can see why you'd be tempted to snack! Don't give up on the rest of the day! Eat what you normally would, and sure you may be over your calories, but not as over as if you kept going like that. Mitigate your damages... don't make it any worse than it has to be. Everyone has bad days, but you will be right back on track tomorrow! You've been doing this for a year, one day is only a pebble in your road, not even a bump.Based on the pre-packaged type of bread available here, that seems about right. If you go to google and type "bread calories" it should give calorie counts for a variety of breads, but most of them range from 250-300 cals per 100g.Thank you guys for the tips, it's very much appreciated!So constantly drink it each time? I've sort of tried this I just get so hungry lolFor branching out - [this might be an idea to try](http://www.weightymatters.ca/2011/08/are-you-setting-your-kids-up-for.html) - just got this off another thread. Basically the idea is retraining your brain to like certain things. You have to do it over a long period of time, but it might help you. Welcome!

Whatever you do, make sure it's right for you to do.  I was almost exactly your starting stats +100lbs but am now 100lbs lighter.

My loss was by around 1,200 cals a day of whole foods and fresh veg.  I ate carbs.   All good.

Keep on losing!
