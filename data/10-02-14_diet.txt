If left HIM hungry. Some people expect a supersize meal to fill them up. Some people can eat moderately and feel full. Today is your lucky day! I do.Not surprised. For anybody who lives in the ULK Sainsburys Basic brand of Peanut Butter is absolutely god tier compared to the big namesCleans out the neckpipes; fizzy Draino.well I know something I'm adding to my next amazon orderYes please. I recently went to Cozumel and had [these tacos](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/5d/06/99/delicious-tacos-served.jpg) on a tour and can't find a similar recipe. Everything on that plate was so delicious and I really want to make it again, so if you know anything about it please let me know.damn dude ..... looks so goodi saw a video of thai lady/chef cooking pad thai and she had onionsYes, do so. I think you should do basics. Like red rice, refried beans, salsa verde, homemade tortillas, etc. Those items are usually the sides that go with the guisado.
Then I'd like to see mole, chiles rellenos, pambazos, guaraches, sopes, tamales, menudo, and posole. I will be looking out for the recipes. Thanks!
When I lived there, kids got dividends.I'm not seeing any of that interest or effort. And then if you're going to post in a public forum, then it should be worth looking at.No because Europe.i actually did this in college. put a little fish sauce and sesame sauce in there too; actually not bad at all. Dude.  Unless you're in Alaska (From what Im reading below) eggs are super cheap.  You have to throw an egg in that to make it pad thai level instead of top ramen with peanut butter.  I don't think I've ever met someone skilled in top ramen consumption who eats it without choice of hot sauce.I wish I had the recipe for those chips!Why get the tube? a ginger root can sit on your desk, is considerably cheaper and you can cut/smash it with about anything.

I payed .79 cents for a big ass piece of delicious ginger.This is pretty much how my wife and I make our chili; it's at least a weekly staple for us, usually on weekends. We used to do the corn starch thing, but these days we just let it cook all day instead and it thickens itself up nicely. We find that the longer it cooks, the richer the taste; leftovers the next day are usually even better than the first time around.i watched it with the sound off and wrote down the names of the dishes i wanna try. next time i go to my favorite thai restraunt i will be able to order something other than pad thai and not worry about what im gunna get.   THANK YOU FOR POSTING!!!I recently tried the Tobasco chipotle sauce. May not be as spicy but so much more taste!What noodles are you thinking? I want to try this!
I've never bought premade pad thai sauce before either- any recommendations? Maybe you just have [tiny hands](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/C89uOeDL9Gw/hqdefault.jpg)...I didn't believe in fire shits either until i moved to San Diego, aka Mexican food heaven.Welcome to the club, brother.Coke is so much sharper... only way I can describe itYea, I was hesitant about writing that, but this recipe I think is quite good and comes close, if you want to try it sometime. Come to NJ, where everything is expensive.  I think 9 dollars is right if the stuff used isn't complete shit and also this is a yelp review, I would cut my fingers off before I believed anyone on yelp.No, I live in a Scottish village, ahahah.Yes. Yes! YES!! Please do this. At my local grocery store they sell sushi like that fresh for about 10 USDOffensive to who? Chefs/cooks with fully equipped kitchens, a food budget &gt;$25 a week, and years of experience? Unless you're whippin up pad Thai in some authentic Thai shanty, I don't see any reason for YOU to be offended.What's fappenin? You would be surprised. Without sugar, it's richer, more peanut-y. Better fresh otherwise oil separates.Oh my god free fresh salmon...  Being in an extremely landlocked province, the idea of cheap or free seafood hurts my heart.Hmm, do you put the egg in whole, or do you crack it into the pan? I ate a burger topped with sauteed ghost peppers on a lark in St Augustine. It was very very hot, and I teared up and sweated. No issue with shits the next day, though. If I really abuse the spicy stuff I'll get some butt tingle for 10 minutes or so, but nothing I could call pain.The problem Isn't the "standard" being high, it's people shitting on a person in their late teens/early twenties who more than likely is using a kitchen smaller than my bathroom. Yeah fuck him for his nomenclature and interest in food. /sOnly fat cats use mugs. If you're really frugal you use the bottom of a broken beer bottle. Pro-tip: used oil rags make great thermal insulators to keep the hot drink inside from burning your fingers. If you can't afford a used oil rag you can usually find a handful of dead leaves. They work alright but they're not as convenient.Probably b r cause a large percentage is.$5 * 365? Yep, math checks out guys.OP thinks college students can afford brand name items...?
I can barely afford toilet paper.Totally yes, what a great idea!I fully support what you're doing. Now you've made me homesick for Veracruz... Pescado a la veracruzana sounds amazing. Tambin que incluyes horchata de arroz, coco, cacahuate, y avena, tortillas, volovanes, espaguetis verde, chancletas, tamales regulares, milanesa de pollo, flan, cualquier tipo de jaiva, algo con pia........ Ehhhhhh... Y mapache.

Edit: but I think you should start simple with a recipe for carne asada tacos. Kendal Jackson Merlot.  This is pretty affordable and pretty easy to get.Everything you need for cancer.Wow, it sounds delicious :)Just posted something similar. Fresh made from the machine at health food stores.Mix half sriracha and half white vinegar. I like this more than either cholula or tapatio Thanks for sharing and looks delicious.  I have been mixing some clams I have with some store bought sauce.....I will have to give your recipe a try!  I would literally pay you a subscription for this. Please do it.I love making Tai food. So healthy and a wonderful variety of mild spices.Exactly why I haven't found one yet.  I'd love to make some mole but don't have the time to make the sauce! /r/avocadosgonewild Pepsi is revolting. Its like a sloppy version of coke.Has ramen always been $0.25 a packet?

Because if so, it's price when accounting for inflation has plummeted.No I like adding Sriracha to my pad thai after I make it.   How much are you putting on that it masks all other flavors.  Yeah, these are called jokes.It is not very good. Too sweet and too mild. Yes, pleeeeease!Yes. What i do is take sriracha and mix in equal part white vinegar. This gets you a better hot sauce than tapatio. &gt; a hard shell taco with lettuce and shredded cheese

This is exactly why I had this idea! Every time I see a post about tacos like that it makes me mad!

About seafood, I'm considering *camarn al mojo de ajo* and *caldo de camarn*.Racha Thai, Seattle.  Duck soup, beefish broth though.  Yu choy, shiitake mushrooms, cilantro and onion :D   I eat their wonton soup alot too.Portions are smaller, but there are a ton more seasoning packets and variations. There are usually three packets per bag: A dried veggie packet, a seasoning packet, and a sauce packet.

Ramen in China takes up an entire aisle in China. There are so many different varieties. It's where they hide the coke.Oh dude, you don't have to tell me that Tex-Mex has very little to do with Mexican, I know this, but you'd be surprised how many people can't tell the difference.

I think adding a map would be an amazing idea, Oaxaca has delicious food but its very different than the northern part, or even just DF or Morelos.Or they don't agree. The best peanut butter is made fresh. You don't have to make it. You can get it at health food stores  (some Whole Foods have it). There's a machine that grinds the peanuts, like a coffee grinder. You hold your container underneath and take however much you want. It takes really good and no need for sugar.Yeah, the article said that the logo, and the bottle with green cap are trademarked. ew
i think the noodles are one chemicla away from plastic and im pretty sure that peanut butter is soybean oil sugar preservatives with a hint of peanut flavor enjoy your pad thaiI will cover the basics in each post. From how to chop the vegetables to really get a nice flavour to how to choose the best ingredients.Yes! Do it please!!!! I lived in Veracruz for two years and haven't been back. I've been craving everything! Post the recipe for mole rojo, tacos al pastor, enfrijoladas, cabezota de perro, tamales de elote, esquites, medianoches, ropa vieja, sidra, posole, mole, todo que tiene mariscos especialmente el coctel de camarones! Post everything and I will make it all!!! And if you post a hard shell taco with lettuce and shredded cheese I will find you and I will cut you... At the Taco Bell just off campus where I am, they make you ask for packets and generally only give you 2 or 3. The struggle.For some reason not all Food4Less are owned/operated by the same people, it seems more like a franchise.  The ones in the Sacramento area are run by Nugget Market (northen california grocery chain) but the ones in the San Luis Obispo area managed by another group. You mean college peanut noodles? Because peanut noodles are a thing. Pad Thai is totally different. Just because it's some noodle dish with sauce doesn't classify it as pad Thai. Good to know about that!

^^Now ^^I'm ^^going ^^to ^^lurk ^^_____MACHETE_____'s ^^history ^^a ^^littleI used to be able to do that with OxyContin back when they were actually abusable. If you dumb them down a bit that would be good. I'm from Canada and haven't really had a chance to try anything close to authentic. Exactly at 212 degrees, you mean. Disregarding pressurized environments, if water is above the boiling point it's vapor. Boiling water is exactly at the boiling point, and as the molecules gain more energy they transition to vapor and escape. No you need to eat something actually really spicy for thatThis is not how it worksNot sure if we'll be able to get to a second list of samples, but if you're interested sign up here and we'll do what we can

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hBLC9efJsp_JYflclrCZ9cI5sfWlvYftACvTws6f5tk/viewform?usp=send_formHAHA! Those bring back some memories.Oh yeah, when I move out in 16 weeks I'll be giving them an earful about this.Reddit needs to know *salsa verde*!Holy shit. Tell me more. I'll keep that in mind ;)

Any other suggestions? I'm eager to find out!But is it the best ingredients? What is that meat made out of? Where is it coming from? what about that bread? Why does the bread get so gross if you take longer than 15 mins to eat it?

Point is, you get what you pay for. Pupusas are mainly from El Salvador. Please use water. Do not be the guy who sets off the fire alarm by not using water. Do the packs contain more? Maybe the portions are larger?http://youtu.be/7SjoE5F8EbY

I got Sriracha sauceI worked in a milk bottling plant when I was in college. I don't want to say the brand but its one of the big ones. We bottled almost all the local milk there, our main brand and the generic cheaper off brand. The only difference between bottling one or the other was we'd switch the packaging but it would be the same milk. Reddit needs to know and love chilaquiles KTrypophobics, BEWARE!Nice this could go on college humor.com because college jokes are funny lolDoesn't everyone in Alaska receive checks from various oil and mineral revenue every year?Phenomenal write-up, thanks! I agree with your thoughts re: fancy ingredients - if that's what I'm looking for, I'd rather go to places like Eleven Madison Park. I'll have to check out Ichimura and Nakazawa next time I want to treat myself.

It sounds like you're pretty knowledgeable about the sushi scene in NYC. Do you have any recs for more moderately priced spots? Thoughts on Blue Ribbon Sushi or Tanoshi?Same here. Sriracha has such a distinct flavor I try to avoid actually cooking with it because it can get overpowering. As long as you make it super patronizing and keep reminding how cheese isn't traditional. I'm not really sure if there is such thing as an "easy" mole recipe. I had the opportunity once to see the whole process . . . Oh, darn! That's the most complex sauce I've ever seen in my life! I'll try to synthesize that in one of the first posts.Sriracha is the garlic chili sauce that has been fermented and crushed.

Their Sambal Oeleck is better than both anyway. Upvote for Futurama reference no one else gotI thought I had provided the ingredients and recipe, but looks like it didn't appear! There are no photos of me making the actual cake either because I made them at work.

Here it is -

Ingredients

200g caster sugar
200g butter (softened)
200g self-raising flour
4 eggs
200ml double cream
Icing sugar
Cranberry sauce
1tsp. vanilla extract
Milk

Method

- - - pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees/gas mark 6

1) in a large bowl 'cream' the butter and sugar with an electric whisk until light and fluffy.

2) in a small bowl whisk the eggs. Add all of the egg a little at a time to the creamed butter and sugar, all the whilst whisking with the electric whisk.

3) once mixed, sift the flour into the mixture and 'fold' it in/mix it together using a spatula. Add a tiny splash of milk if you have to.

4)  add one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Keep folding the mixtures with a spatula.

5) line 2 circular baking tins/sandwich tins with baking paper. Evenly divide the mixture between the two, spreading the mixture around with the spatula (don't keep patting it down/flattening it)

6)  place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Use a skewer to check if it is done.
7) (the icing) in a separate bowl add the double cream and one tablespoon of icing sugar. Whisk for 1-2 minutes with an electric whisk until it holds its shape and thickens.

8) once complete, remove the two tins from the oven. Remove the cakes and place on a cooling rack to fully cool. Make sure they are fully cooled/'stone' cold.

9) once cooled, spread the icing on one of the cakes and jam on the other (I used cranberry sauce). Alternatively, you could make a coulis and drizzle that over one of the cakes or on top of the icing.

10) sandwich the two cakes together. Sift icing sugar on top and serve.

Chipotle =/= texmexWhen I read the title to this post I thought it was yours! Always considered you one of the best sources on authentic Mexican in the sub. Twisted Root has been wildly inconsistent for me. Some days their burgers are cooked fine, but most days it's well done and dry. I'd suspect the reason Twisted Root failed was because there were so many superior burger places already in Austin. Hopdoddy is the king of burgers for me, and they're always consistent. I've been looking for an easy mole recipe for a long time.  I need some mole.  I'm recently compiling lots of recipes with my family and really wanted to know if some extra effort would be worth it, since I'm going to include cultural and natural context for the recipes. It's been only 2 hours, but I'm hyped now.Just a simple steak seasoned with salt and pepper and grilled to medium.  Served with mushrooms, baked potato and broccoli and cheese.And packets of peanut butter stolen from the caf at breakfast.I like your style!You're going to sell your high-value, high-quality phone that will last several years so that you won't have to eat ramen for what, maybe a couple weeks? Right. Priorities.Yes, please do.
I am considering in including a map and some cultural context. Tex-mex has really nothing to do with recipes from Veracruz or Oaxaca.

Some recipes are what grandma, mom and aunt have taught me; I recently told them about this to clarify everything and share the best recipes with all of you. Some other recipes are from little towns where I've had the fortune to stumble upon and meet women from there. Most of them were very happy to share the recipes and talk about stuff, I really appreciate those experiences.Kudos to him. I feel like a granola bar would be dinner most of the time. Sure. Not sure why you posted asking.My family grew up in Boston's North End (all Italian section) &amp; I'm All Italian ...Why so? Are hard boiled eggs ruined?Unless the bleed is near the end of your digestive tract, blood will come out black. So instead of red shits they'd be black in most cases. No ass cancer, yay!What village is this? Manhattan?Also, I find the egg works better if you add chicken or vegetables too. Egg plus noodles alone sometimes doesn't fully dissolve for some reason.I think its a great idea, Mexican food is the best... but I'm biased since I'm Mexican :)

What part of Mexico will the recipes be from?  I think you might have a slight problem with people getting Tex-Mex (which is also freaking delicious) and Mexican getting mixed up, throw in regional dish differences and you might have a bit of a mess.You have a website I can buy it from? Looks amazing, I'm in. awfully big man to say thatYo can get Sriracha really cheap at H-Mart. I don't know why it's so expensive at normal grocery stores.Grandma's really know how to cook delicious meals. Forget about fancy stuff, food that makes you feel in home can't be beaten.Does it have a rooster or a goose on it? The one near me only has flying goose brand. Sriracha has some kind of "cool" factor going for it right now, but I find Cholula is a lot more versatile and has a better flavor overall. I only use Sriracha on asian noodles."like never not" replace with always.I'm trying to get my family to eat more vegetables, so we're doing the "meatless Monday" thing. Because the wife and child are picky eaters, I have to pick some really flavorful dishes in which they won't miss the meat.

So, if you and the date like Mexican food, I strongly recommend some corn and black bean quesadillas. The recipe I used is on Cook's Illustrated's site, so I don't think I can link to it (password protected), but there are plenty of recipes out there. It's easy and full of flavor, especially when served with some fresh guacamole (which is also easy to make).you look vileWe do have it here, it's just not particularly good/popular/cheap. There seems to have been an explosion in the number of places to get burritos, and recently the first Chipotles opened up in England. They weren't very good though, and very expensive, think I remember I paid around 7 ($11) for one.Those look wonderful!!! I always melt a little white chocolate and then drizzle that over the top. That little extra step makes them look store bought and impresses people even more! Mostly because you can only purchase 1 variety of garlic in most stores. Elephant garlic isn't true garlic but if you include that then 2 varieties. Pad kee mao is the superior pad anyways. Pad thai is for the poverty people.yes, please.back in the day (1998), maruchan were 10 for $1 and top ramen were 4 for $1.  not sure about today.  probably $1 for one:( I would definitely go with my wife at $125 and it's a no brainer at $74. $225 is tough though for each person. Looks like I might have to try elsewhere. I wanted to head to NYC to see that new Larry David play and figured this would be a good place to catch lunch or dinner. Too rich for my blood.TIL there are different kinds of garlicI would love a recipe for albondigas soup!Just kill them. Problem solved and then you'll have their stash. I hate name brands, not one in my house for anything. Finding small company products at health food stores or online is the only real way to enjoy good quality food.You are thinking middle of nowhere Canada. $9 for a sandwich that leaves you hungry is a pretty bad deal just about anywhere from a food truck.Can you explain this a little better maybe? Getting sick from meat usually results from cross contamination. Bacteria being deposited after food has been cooked, like if someone doesn't wash their hands often enough. Or if you don't reheat food to a high enough temp. A high bacterial count on meat pre-cooking  means the meat has been stored improperly. If you cook the hell out of it though it will kill most anything. However there are toxins that can be produced by bacteria/fungi that will survive heating. Parasites also die at certain temps freezing works too I think, but heat definitely. If you get your meat from a proper butcher it is actually pretty clean as beef can be eaten raw (beef tartare is really good)  and there is a place in japan that serves raw chicken. It's all a matter of how it's handled. It's treated so severely because it is better safe than sorry.[Generic](http://www.fuelyourbranding.com/files/generic_cola_cans_1980s.jpg)  [private label](http://images.sodahead.com/polls/002262731/1043102296_5820595348_572c6c6f61_xlarge.jpeg)Any suggestions for some dishes? On the priority list is *pescado a la veracruzana* but I've seen so many recipes, each with some of their own that it will be hard to process in a single post. But I'll try my best.Back when I went it was $125. They had a 4 course option at $74. Seems like they changed it now to $225 for lunch and dinner now. Shame :/ that's a pretty penny.

Fuck. I live in China and ramen is more expensive here than there. It's like 40 cents a bag. Granted, it's a helluva lot tastier.Please do it! :) I love Mexican food, and I love cooking which means I'd totally try your recipes! Why do I need to?Why so much hate on Imgur? Oh right because most of them are fucking assholes.Exactly this is my objective; grandma/home-feel style. Mole is on the priority list, it is one of the best sauces ever conceived.Most offbrands are repackaged namebrands.  This happens because the factories have excess capacity that can be purchased.  The manufacturer still makes a profit, just less than what they would make on their own name brand.

Example:
General Mills makse cereal and has the factory open for one shift: 8-5. Any retailer with a store brand, say, Walmart, Aldi, etc. Offer to take the excess capacity of the night shift.  As is, the factory is making zero dollars during night shift while being shut down.  This is not helping pay off their machinery. By partnering to produce more product, everyone wins.  Of course, this is why off-brand product isn't always consistent, as they can be switching manufacturers based on who has excess capacity.

It's common at sugar factories to see 5+ different brand bags at the end of the same line.
However, I do know that Coca Cola changes the formula for the off-brand products it manufactures.

**TL,DR:** Store brand ~= name brandSo is it good or...?http://i.imgur.com/6AY3zkx.gifYou're on! Prepare to host reunions every weekend, your friends and family are gonna love this.Nope, if you want the yolk to be uncooked, it doesn't take a long time at all. Remember that it's like, over 212 degrees. It is probably easier in a food processor. I should try mine, it's a cheap black and decker model so I'm curious about that too.I hate all 3 of my roommates, but the airhead one who makes peanut butter ramen noodles is the absolute worst. It smells DISGUSTING for days afterward (they don't do their dishes either).The issue is he is a Chef first and a buisnessman second. For him serving the best quality product is more important than serving one of an acceptable quality at a more accepted price.If you ever cook any single egg for more than 60 seconds, you're ruining the eggWhat did I just watch.White boy calling in from the frozen north of Canada, needs proper Mexican food or certainly death is imminent. Mexican food is the absolute best! I want your recipes! I go to Toronto regularly and can pick up any crazy Mexican ingredients you suggest! Do This.I think this depends on the area.  In Jacksonville, FL a food truck is generally a relatively higher-end place to eat lunch, with fresh ingredients and specialty menu items.  Most have a ca $10/meal price point.  But you're right that this is a marketing issue, and I think pointing this out on a yelp review could help establish that brand ("expensive, but high quality").It's not bad. Better with some green onions, chicken, and a bit of sesame oil thrown in.Maybe, I don't know, but personally I'm not a fan of nongshim or any of the others, its all about Maruchan in my house.that looks vile.

If the water's boiling, it cooks very very quickly.yeah.. i get that winndixie brandYeah there are a few Mexican places some good some bad. Probably not as good as the U.S. though! We do however have hundreds of different types of foods done extremely well... Just not my road we have, indian, Italian, French, Korean, Chinese, Turkish, greek, Persian, african, Jamaican, Japanese and obviously english.
I love curries and I've heard there not that great in the US.
Edit: forgot to add... Thai, Vietnamese and Mexican(not that great)Same with beet juice, but its red out both ends so....Yes please.Ooo that's brilliant. I wonder if my food processor is powerful enough to do that. Not just for college either!! this stuff rocks!   I would add some frozen vegies in for the kids, they loved it!

  Seriously, whats not to love?I call it my burning ring of fireclearly you've never had my dad's patented fire shit chile.Badia for those that like it a bit less sweet.only way to go, love the spice babyFairbanks? Never figured out why Thai food was so popular there, but damn do I miss it sometimes.no onions in Pad Thai[http://i.imgur.com/0306pmI.jpg] (http://i.imgur.com/0306pmI.jpg)Nah&gt; mine are a little wispy around the edges and might have stuck to some noodles.

They're using fresher eggs than you is my bet. The fresher the egg, the better the membranes hold together, the nicer the poach.I substitute popcorns for ramen and it tastes just as disgusting. Do it. Do it now!!I ate like a fucking king in college for like nothing. This isn't about being poor. It's about being lazy.Actually, I find peanut butter with sugar isn't really useful for cooking, especially for this stuff. Throws the whole taste off.seems disingenuous to use a 4x metric for restaurants to calculate price for a food truck when the whole stinkin point of a food truck is you have lower costs than a restaurant.

guy's not complaining about ordering a $9 sandwich at a sit down restaurant, he's complaining about getting it at a food truck.

No. The reviews are from people who have 0 idea of what they are talking about. Jason addresses the concerns and negative feedback by breaking down everything one needs to know in order to understand how it works.


Now you can say, "Oh boy am I hungry. I don't want a high end sandwich that is made with actual food though. I think I'll go to the dollar menu."


Leaving a bad review when you don't even understand what you are talking about is very popular and this guys LIFE can be shut down because people love doing it. Makes them feel special.I think America has a much wider variety of food than most countries (at least in larger metroplexes), because of the diversity. I had a friend who lived in London for awhile and she said it was impossible to get a good plate of Mexican food there. Since Mexican is my favorite food in the universe, that's a deal-breaker for me right there. I do this but instead of siracha I use BBQ sauce.what about the peanut butter!!?!?!?!?! you forgot the peanut butter!!  whyyyyyyy!?&gt; in my fridge.

It doesn't need refrigeration. Sodium bisulfite and potassium sorbate will take care of the nasties if you want to save the fridge space for leftovers.Mmmmm, meaty salt gargle.Philadelphia. Acquiring ingredients shouldn't be too troublesome. Would love to hear some alternatives, in case I want to change it up a bit.If you read what I typed, there may be a serious tone, but not angry. Care to contribute to the actual subject of the conversation?I didn't actually make me cry but two meals I have never forgotten are these:

Having kibbeh nayeh for the first time at a random Lebanese restaurant in London on vacation with my family probably 15 years ago now. The server asked 3-4 times if I was sure I wanted it. I guess Americans don't usually order it, because he kept checking to make sure I knew it was raw.

The other was more recent at woodberry kitchen in baltimore. Their steak tartare appetizer was absolutely the best I have had. Perfectly seasoned with just a little salt and a raw egg yolk on top.

I guess you could say I have a thing for raw beef. I think they have a poor diet and thus weird shit.

No, s/he means THIS [chili garlic sauce.](http://www.amazon.com/Huy-Fong-Vietnamese-Chili-Garlic/dp/B0006SKCVI)

It's like 100x more delicious than Sriracha.&gt; $2000

 One Starbucks latte per day for a year, according to dictionary of numbers.

So no, you don't have anything to back it up?The world is full of people who can't enjoy spicy food without acting superior about it. Your body probably reacts differently to spiciness than others do. It's really not a big deal.Hey OP, I signed up for this /r/freebies about a month ago. This looks awesome!Why does this make you so angryI agree. If I want to basically add hot sauce to something already made, I use sriracha. If I'm cooking, I'm more likely to use the garlic chili sauce.Logs of ground turkey are $1.50 a pound, at places like Costco and Save-A-Lot, and they sometimes put them on sale for 99 cents.

This. I eat more hot food than a normal person should. Literally eat chilis as a snack. I ate a whole big bag of those (was high), even though not hot compared to real peppers/sauces, it gave me the worst fire shits of my life the next day, made me cry. It looked like my shit was covered in the powder. Never again. It's a little offensive to call this stuff pad thai, not because it's college cheap, but because peanut is the wrong flavor. It's just kind of ignorant, like calling udon pho. It has nothing to do with the quality of ingredients, it's the naming.You forgot the egg!! Crack it in when there's still boiling water and scramble that motherfucker for extra protein.Right! You gotta use the government brands from the food bank. Beef salad: http://imgur.com/ccZnePR

And finally, the best of them all - Pork Satay: http://imgur.com/Tg0Vt3m,6CbQwQV

With all the Pad Thai fuss going on, I though I'd finally get round to sharing these. I spent a great day at this guy's house, with his family, cooking on the floor. We took a trip to the market, then came home and tried a bunch of recipes. At the end, we got this book, and honestly, the recipes are better than half the stuff you get from Thai restaurants. The satay will blow anything you've ever had out of the water. He's still there apparently - a really nice dude.

It was here that I learned one of the most important principles of cooking: in Thai cuisine, you need to balance sweet, salt, acit, and heat (chili). With the possible exception of the heat bit, this principle applies to virtually any dish. I've found that if a dish is lacking something, a splash of vinegar / lemon / line will often transform it. Don't be afraid to add a bit of sweet to savoury dishes, or salt to sweet ones, either. I've actually made it with my Vitamix, it's awesome to have fresh PB.Well, I no longer indulge in that "delicacy", but the college years were not the time to be selective.  At the time meat sticks were far more expensive.  Oh, and they make me sick.  Way too much salt.  In fact, I never used the flavor packets in the ramen for that reason.How to make it:

The original recipe uses meat instead of Leberkse and beef broth instead of vegetable broth.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaisburger_Marschhttp://i.imgur.com/YrR9lYI.gifYes pleaseOh, okay thanks. :)It's not about the genuineness. He means that pad thai isn't a proper name for this. It should be spicy peanut noodles or whatever. The flavors of these ingredients, cheap college style or not, don't resemble the cheapest form of any pad thai.post Mole recipes and like traditional grandma/abuela recipes of different things most non-mexicans would not knowMake sure to get the packets, don't mess with that cup stuff. I feel like they don't put enough seasoning in that one. Stuff is spicy mmmWell valentine's day *is* coming up...Sounds like you guys need a support group.What's the ratio?I'm not Mexican, but as far as I'm concerned ramen comes in one flavor: Tapatio.Some people like putting the egg at the beginning which is what most people might initially think of when egg in ramen. Imo, the trick is lowering the heat to a simmer the minute or two then gently cracking the egg in there so you poach it instead of dissipating it in the soup.Do you ever get the peanut butter from Whole Foods or similar stores that comes straight out of a peanut grinder? OMG. SO GOOD. I don't really like the jar natural stuff with the oil that separates and needs to be kept in the fridge.. but the super fresh stuff is perfect and doesn't separate at all. Tastes just like peanuts. My thoughts exactly.I think its a special way to cook your noodlesI'm from Thailand and I don't know this is called Pad Thai, it's different from where I live. Add some white pepper, soy sauce and an egg or two and you're sorted.That's exactly what is hope for. My italian grandmother wouldn't approve of all my recipe modifications but for the most part they are all hers from the old country and that makes them the best in my mind. Do you actually have people pming you rap music? Like just artists they like?Wait, is this actually good?You only cook the eggs for 30 seconds? Aren't they like... raw?That's noodles with satay sauce, not Pad Thai.That would be nice. Make sure to include what region the recipes are from, so that I and other Mexicans don't blast you for having different recipes than those from the ranch we grew up in.;) I'll cover the basics too, from how it should look like or how to know if you are doing it right to how to chop the vegetables for better results or how to choose the proper ingredients. Grandma, mom and aunt approved.Is it any good, did anyone try it?Uh, yeah. I thought there was just the one and only.That's how my grandma died.This isn't even close to the name pad thai... and I'm not talking about quality of ingredients because I understand that this is supposed to be cheap, but this is way different from the cheapest pad thais. Pad thai does not have any form of peanut sauce cooked in with it. This is like calling a pack of instant ramen pho.Well that was rude! The ones I made are more like Yum Yums here in the UK. Less dense and more chewy. To be honest though, any paczki is better than no paczki.Yeah, I think this is a marketing issue.  People generally expect food from food trucks to be cheap.

Based on the ingredients he's using, what this guy is selling is closer to high-end restaurant-grade food.  If he'd sold the same sandwich in a trendy upscale restaurant, I doubt he'd get the same complaints.Adorable and simple!You mean "homemade diabetes."I have tried this "college pad Thai".  It is pretty good!  But then again I love sriracha on almost anything.  iheartsriracha.  i went to Twisted Root (the one in Roanoke) maybe 5 years ago.  I wasnt too impressed. but i never went back. ive heard some people really like it. i think theyre opening one up in Austin.  (EDIT - just looked and they had an Austin location that closed after like 6 months. weird... but theyre opening up a new one in a different location in the next few months... and its location is like a 1/4 mile from HopDoddy. Good luck with that one. )

My favroite burgers in DFW were all on the FW side cause thats where I lived: Lilli's Bistro, M&amp;O Station, Rodeo GoatSeriously can't tell you how excited I am for real mexican food recipes.  I'd even love it if you'd go through the basics too. I try making my own tortillas but they never turn out quite right. I had a woman make ceviche tacos for us after we built her a house and they were absolutely to die for. Never had anything like it and can never recreate it right myself. The $3 per hour he pays himself is questionably a poor business decision but I find it challenging to shit on his business model completely.

The first thing he might do is set customer expectations on what he is offering so clients know up front he is establishing a niche of a higher end product. This distinguishes himself from those looking for cheap bulk. The second thing would be to actively solicit feedback at the POS, in hopes to avoid the verbal vomit which so often ends up on Yelp.

He's clearly passionate about his product but the last thing I would do in his situation is engage a client in an Internet fight.

Also, Yelp sucks.

I'll have to try that recipe. I was surprised the one I used called for so much egg yolk. They tasted more cakey than ones at the Polish deli, but still delicious. Cholula never really struck me. I like Franks for a hot sauce, and the spicy cock sauce (..sriracha) for a more paste like, milder, heat.

I use their chipotle or garlic flavors when I'm making eggs because it adds a little flavor, and I don't need to salt the eggs, but I've never really thought 'this needs Cholula' either.

I'm in Texas, though, so maybe that changes my perception of hot sauces?Wow, I didn't realize there were so many kinds of garlic! Nope, $3.89 for me.Also pretty good on nachos, though I don't know if you Brits eat thoseAll these people who love sugar were fed wrong as kids. My mom was so strict and I hated it then, but I love it now! Sugar, with the exception of brownies, cookies, and chessecake, is prettty disgusting. Natural PB for me, and Coke if I am absolutely craving pop-- Which is rare. I actually make a fancier poor man's version.  I use fettucine noodles, sriracha, peanut butter, fresh ground ginger, some minced garlic, soy sauce and sesame oil and I top it with scallions.  How sweetI thought sriracha is garlic chili sauce?chefs gotta be a little more cutthroat and piratical, i think, to survive. $9 will buy you a lot of different sandwiches...for $9 i think i can get a hardee's monster thickburger with fries and a coke. why the fuck would anyone spend $9 on a bahn mi sandwich? just because the name sounds exotic? maybe the owner should hype the quality more. that being said i've never been to portland and never had a food truck bahn mi sandwich. but, i have worked at a very popular restaurant that hyped their suppliers and made enough to expand, give the employees health insurance, and offer profit sharing (and this was in 2008). again, i have no idea about this guy's advertising. maybe his truck is full of it. in the end, though, it's better to be up front about the quality of your food from the get go than to use said quality as a defense mechanism when some aspect of your business comes into question. i understand jason's yelp response (any cook worth his salt is fiercely proud of their dish, if they've given a shit at all about it), but it comes across as a kind of holier-than-thou "fuck you, i'm the fucking chef and i'll do what i want" response to the customer. from what i've watched of bourdain's no reservations trip to portland and a smattering of portlandia episodes, it seems like portland is full of foodie types. which is fine. but chef, c'mon man, quit whinging.  I'd say it's more people see 'OMG COCONUT SUGAR' and just downvote because most of us are fucking tired of that shit.

Just like my friends going on long rants about how evil GMO crops are, and how evil BPA is, and how great Paleo is, and did you know that they're doing Crossfit, and using kettlebells, and etc.

Sugar is, for the most part, sugar.  How much sriracha and peanut butter do we put in? I'm at work and imgur is blocked so cant open the linkBetter the vegan in my dorm who *would* use the chicken flavoring packet.Yeah, it's either the emulsifying salts or you just not being good at sealing them - who knows. It's not just the egg. It's egg and Sriracha. I'm not entirely sure, but they are mesoamerican so, they are common for most of Mexico and Central America. I will write this in my to-share list.Battered fish - mix it in with the tartar sauce.Peanut butter is packed with nutrients! It's saving [starving children in Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumpy%27nut), you monster! Yeah I did this out of my own accord a couple weeks back and my flatmates are still giving me shit about it. This is a last resort not something you planI made these (http://www.mojewypieki.com/przepis/paczki-przepis-iv) ones last night/this morning. So light and delicious.Where are you from? I want to consider this because in Mexico getting your hands on some vegetables or spices isn't hard but it may be in other places around the world. So, I want to -also- give some substitutions for hard-to-get ingredients.Are pupusas Mexican?sounds really soothingI can assure you I'll post the most relevant recipes and I'll try to give some substitutions for ingredients. Here in Mexico basically every single vegetable or spice is available (we have climates that suit very well to the requirements of several plants) so it isn't a problem but I think it may be in other places around the world. Thanks for your response!You can't go wrong with a plate of Sauerbraten, Kle, and Rotkohl. That's a basic, hearty, traditional dinner. You can find a ton of recipes here: http://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/

Schnitzel is kind of a cop out. Yeah, it's German, but it will always be overshadowed by Wiener Schnitzel.Please do!They look almost almost like snickersS. And, assuming it's like my dorm was, that one building has about a thousand residents.As someone who is not Mexican, and loves Mexican food, yes.For some reason the Mango Habanero makes it twice as worse coming out than it is going down. That's the only time I actually sat on the toilet with tears in my eyes and covered in sweat. You can literally feel your body go through shock as you are shitting. I'm sure to have all my clothes off and a cool shower running when I have spicy shits so I can just finish up on the john and jump right into a cool shower to cleanse myself and cool down. &gt;It's all about priorities.

And they have different priorities than you do I guess.
"Oooof" was the sound that came out of me.  I'm off to lunch now.That's not the issue with it though.Good points. It was interesting to read the breakdown of his costs. What I gathered from his breakdown is he desires to be more of a higher-quality, higher-end sandwich maker and using more expensive ingredients as a result.

If that is his niche then maybe part of the problem is setting customer expectations via branding/signage, "We may cost a little extra, but we're worth it" or something. That way, when some tubby neckbeard shows up looking for a pile of cheap food, he can read the sign, move on, and waddle on down to Subway.Yes please. I love me some mexican food and can never find the real stuff where I live.

Uses to go down to Tijuana consistently and would love getting street food so recipes and the right way to make it would be amazing. I need those recipes!!!**Very honest question** ^^Probably ^^stupid ^^too ^^^sorry. Isn't milk almost 10$ in Alaska?

Edit : FormatNot sure but Top Ramen is the cheapest by me (with Maruchan coming in a close second).My only problem is I think I'd miss the more "fancy" Pad Thai that I make at home right now.Add a little sliced green onion and curry powder, you got yourself a feast.Food can't be authentic outside its originYou are cleared for take off.Did you make these?My phone won't stop playing this at work, I backed out and everything.
I'm just gonna roll with it and hope it's a quick songLol I made Pad Thai in county jail like this. No sriracha but you could get the chili ramen, and I'd put some crushed peanuts in it (you crush them by punching them against the wall) and butter saved from breakfast.If this represents the amount of effort you're willing to put into your meals, then just buy instant pad thai. It'll save you even more cash and contain the same amount of nutrition and taste.I'm concerned about how this post got more upvotes than the guy who posted an entire album of an NYC culinary trip...Came here to say that, also green onions and fresh herbs.You spoiled his joke : /Its still a jar of corn syrup...&gt; A sculpture of an anus should be made into chocolate. It just made some sort of poetic sense.

That kind of goes without saying. I thought you were being genuine. Have an up arrowYeah food snobs. That's it. Their standard is just too high. In a place for discussing food.Which GMO are you talking about though? Take corn for example. When this is modified to resist insects, a new type of corn has been developed. So what you're saying is that this needs to be studied, and it will be, as all foods generally are. But studying this one food won't show the effect that even a single other GMO will have in the human body.

I guess I just found the wording of your statements inflammatory and a little lacking in understanding when you say "GMO consumption". You're not consuming GMOs, you're consuming a new food (well, you are consuming GMOs, but these two are the same thing).Out pregnant each other, what is this, high school?Where are you pulling that number from? If he did all this in 2 days, sure. But if he was the 4-5 days and hit these very expensive places over the course there's no wayYes, as I stated.  Although after reading it again, I can see where you might have thought I was being sarcastic.  I wasn't.

I actually did mean that in some instances, undercooked pork can and will give a person diarrhea.  But no matter, you will not get trichinosis even if eaten raw.

It's not that it's not authentic. It's that it doesn't even resemble it. It's barely even food.That's discussed in Blink by Malcolm GladwellIs your username a play on Portugal. The Man?  Because they are also from AlaskaI have also only just discovered this awesome stuff. Got the real thing at my local ethnic marketI'd only be the happiest person ever if this happened.Australia here, wow you can buy edible things for under a dollar?&gt; Which was a reply to your opener "I'm an MD"

Which was a counterexample to someone's suggestion that only people without STEM degrees question GMOs, not an appeal to my authority.

&gt; You still aren't acknowledging the main point

You aren't acknowledging the point that the risk is not equal, since genetic modification is a new technology.Yes, please.Skippy or Jif "natural" versions are by far the best.  They're a fraction of the sugar, but they add palm oil to keep it from splitting.  So you end up with something that tastes like a natural peanut butter that doesn't separate.  Very tasty.  I think my parents each got around $2000 last year for living in Alaska. Sure it's free money but it's not that much. Though they can also pick (dip-net) 50ish free salmon out of the local river every season. You don't have to go there if you think $9 is too expensive. Ground beef? You can afford that?

Cut up store brand meat sticksAlso took a 3 day Denali cruise to see the glaciers and wildlife...that was a choppy ass boat ride, but the salmon bake was delicious.
Why?It can overpower a dish very quickly. It bugs the shit out of me when people add it to Pad Thai because the flavors are so delicately balanced. A perfect blend of salty, sweet, and spice then some asshole comes along and squirts half a container of Sriracha in there and proceeds to mix it all together. Why don't you just make pasta and add Sriracha to it at that point? Are a food truck burrito last week, came out of me like lavaWhat, is the Queen coming to dinner?I thought all of them were FoodMaxx now?Need sugar to balance things out bruh.Thanks for the recipe. They look delicious. Thanks they look awesome. I love trader joes but theirs is disgusting, runny and sweetAs a guy in WA, my wife worked in Anchorage for 6 months.  When I went up to visit, I thought it was pretty awesome up there.  I saw kids playing Quidditch in the park...yes...quidditch.  I had some awesome sushi and a lot of pretty good meals while there.  I would say Alaska is definitely a great place to visit.

because of the circlejerk mentality around lots of things on reddit[Right here](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Maruchan-Instant-Lunch-Flavor-12-Ct-Chicken-36-Oz/10450904)Sweet everyone should move to Portland!Yes. Just do it. Cock sauce is the best! I put it on ev-ery-thing.yup, misread the pint, i concede Boneless is more expensive. Let me break it down for you...You my friend have forgotten waterhahahahahahahahahaha This actually looks better than the ultra-pretentious image this is based on!Did you hear about the Italian chef that died? He pasta way. No wine actually! Tomatoe paste, Plum tomatoes, Tuna and Baby Clams, then anything else you like in your spaghetti sauce (onions, garlic, parsley, chili peppers). The tuna is the key.&gt; No sorry, fire shits are not a thing.

I once skipped Hot and went straight to Native on the Thai heat scale.  It hurt going down and it hurt coming out.  Fire shits ain't no joke. American Cheese due to it's emulsifying salts absorbs the blood/water out of the burger causing it to become more and more liquid so basically if the juicy sits too long (2 days) the cheese starts to turn liquid and leak through even the tiniest of cracks.American Cheese due to it's emulsifying salts absorbs the blood/water out of the burger causing it to become more and more liquid so basically if the juicy sits too long the cheese starts to turn liquid and leak through even the tiniest of cracks. Considering this was maybe 5-10 burgers combined out of a batch of 200. not bad. plus i didn't make the originals. However sealing this monster was not easy because cheese was mixed in with the meat.Yeah but that dish in the video still ain't even fucking close to pad thai.Don't tell me I can't polish my own shit. Who the fuck do you think you are mate?I am a peanut butter aficionado, and my two favorite brands came down to jif natural and skippy natural. I think that skippy natural is just a tad better than jif. But you lived to tell the tale! Similar thing happened when I was told no one could take three shots of this habanero vodka (the habanero were soaked forever in this stuff). A buddy and I did the first, I did the second solo, and the vodka provider did the third with me. I tried to do a fourth, but they wouldn't let me. I think they didn't want someone to break the record, but they saved the dorm bathroom, because nuclear was the only step up from my shits. Where I'm from, that is a slaw dog.You have to try them. They are amazing!Couldn't agree more.  Not to be a snob, but this is college pad thai is not even close to pad thai, it's missing some key ingredients.  Surprised this isn't the top comment. This really belongs in /r/shittyfoodpornNot in my area of the boonies.This isn't a good comparison. They're very different, sugar content aside. Anybody that drinks soda can tell the difference between coke and Pepsi. Coke makes my teeth hurt; like I'm chewing on tin foil. I actually bet this would be pretty tasty.Indeed. Using huy fong in a Thai dish that is looking for something more like sharks is going to be severely lacking in the garlic departmentThat looks great I was about to say the same thing happened to us.  I think it's because we lived in Atlanta.Probably because I live it Atlanta, but when did that in class, all ~25 students picked coke.If I was having to eat ramen because I had no money, I would sell my iPhone. Using a $100 Moto G won't kill you.

YepThis looks like a Chopped episode.http://imgur.com/4anudZm Among all the shit in this sub, finally, something that looks great.I zoomed in, it says 2.98 per pint. 23.89/8 = 2.98625.http://www.howsweeteats.com/2012/01/homemade-snickers-bars/Texas pretty much sums up the best parts of America, the rest doesn't really matter.why not just get peanuts.

Thats what she saidThat's suspect, that 2 is in a different font and the price below is 2.98  per quart

Ditto. It's about a quarter per packet in Minnesota.

The lowest I've ever seen it was 15 years ago at ten cents a packet ON SALE.Are you talking specifically food carts or food trucks at 20-22%? I would think volume needs to be considered. Buying in bulk is the most effective way to reduce food costs. For a food cart, I would have to assume a much smaller storage footprint and therefore smaller bulk orders which will increase food cost.

Larger storefronts generally have walk-ins and freezers and can get much better price discounts from vendors. So I'm a little skeptical of those numbers.

Source: I run a small place myself and we keep food costs at ~30%. Most of the other owners in my area run around 30% also.Peanut butter in ramen is actually amazing. If you add crunchy peanut butter while the ramen is still cooking, its REALLY good.This has nothing to do with Pad Thai. And it's actually quite cheap to make real Pad Thai, and it does not use peanuts. I see im not the only one who thimks so. I had an idea for a pepsi commercial back in the day where a person who reaches for a coke (such as at a gas station pit stop)on a daily basis, hesitates this time and grabs a pepsi instead. The theme or slogan for this comercial being along the lines of "when you need a break" or "even coke lovers need a break"Add one chopped carrot, one chopped piece of celery and one chopped piece of green onion while the ramen is cooking.

Once its ALMOST done, add 1 egg, and stir. Stir slowly until the egg cooks (should take about 45 seconds to 1 minute)

Prepare your tastebuds for awesome.Cholula and Tapatio are heavenly. I hope Tex-Mex becomes a thing in the UK, y'all deserve to live a little.How did you you reply to him? He disabled replies.I think it was like a gallon.

EDIT: http://i.imgur.com/LonyABw.jpgexcept if you put freaking corn syrup instead of actual sugar. I was dissapointed to have to drink pepsi in the states because Coke tastes funny.Yeah, but a foot-long hot pastrami should fill up a normal person (with maybe a bit left over).  If you paid $9.00 and didn't feel like your hunger was satiated wouldn't you feel negatively about your experience eating there?  The review clearly states that it was a small portion, and not the quality of the sandwich, that the customer wasn't satisfied with. You can never go wrong with Garlic. $25 for a bottle of OJ? It doesn't cost that much in the middle of nowhere either.

Source: lives waaay out in the boonies.I prefer the chili ramen for my Pad ThaiI let it rest about 8 mins while I finished the vegetables If he's like me, it's the only brand available at stores. Here's is an Asian grocery store that probably has other brands nearby but I've never been in there.My keyboard is coverwd in drool.

Wait a minute, wait a minute . . . where are the crumbled wheat thins?!The cheap part isn't the problem, pad Thai is supposed to be cheap peasant food.  You can make college pad Thai.  This isn't it, because it is not remotely related to Thai food.  You might as well call it college spaghetti."Ramen again, I'm so poor!" - sent from my iPhone.

While not an exact quote, I knew so many of these idiots in college...Sriracha is pretty cheap. 4 for like a month's worth of spicy everything, if you buy extra hot, that is.I wanna try!!!!  I love all things hot sauce!
No it doesn't. Why does reddit have this attitude that everyone is dirt poor in collegeYep! The garlic chili sauce is way better. Just ran out!Because kids in college don't have fully functioning kitchensThat's just wasting underscoresIt's also four paragraphs/a novel to making the simplest meal possibleReminds me of when someone told me to try Beef Ramen with 2 mayo packets &amp; 2 Tapatio packets - a rich &amp; creamy, spicy noodle soup. Not too bad actually!I don't think anyone ever adds eggs for taste bro Chola Lula is the best. If I'm not doing salsa on my tacos I always reach for Lula.at least buy real peanut butter. that fake shit is nasty. I honestly don't see the hype for it. It's kinda nasty IMO. Engineering school can be pretty tough. I'm sure I could easily have planned balanced meals for myself but there were definitely weeks where I was busy and didn't feel like fucking with it. No, that doesn't happen I hope you get a hemorrhoid so you can experience first-hand the reality of a fire shit.We had the foie gras appetizer with the maple syrup, whatever it was called.  Like 100 grams or something?  Incredible.

Then we had the guinea hen for two and it was seriously something special.  We were watching it being prepared in the big open kitchen (we sat at the bar, I guess) and literally for 15 straight minutes the cook basted the hen in a pan with melted butter.  Non-stop basting.  15 minutes.

EDIT:  I was going to get the chicken in a can if I couldn't get my wife to do the Guinea Hen.
It was sooooooooo good.  Saving for grocery shopping later Get your filthy sriracha away from my pad Thai. Gross This is NOT going to go well.

There are a few more things that you'll need.  This is so disgusting If you live in a dorm, your cooking abilities are going to be severely limited. We had one stove for the entire building and basically no communal cookware. Most people move up to an apartment or house eventually, then your options expand beyond things you have to microwave. AKA prison Pad Thai...I will eat pretty much anything and like it.

But Peanuts/peanut butter in soup is not a good combo.[Thatsthejoke.png](http://i.imgur.com/tEjeMu8.png)

Thatsthejoke.pngIsn't there an Alaska natives subreddit? i use both. the serve different purposes for me. WHY HAVE I NEVER DONE THIS!?Without smelling, your sense of taste is screwed up.Because they can't cook.to say he needs to practice at all puts undue weight on the situation. its cooking, unless someone ends up dead there is no way to fail. its cooking there is a huge amount of leeway for imperfection. This isn't fucking rocket science.

NAME BRAND peanut butter? Well looky at Mr. Ivy League over here.I have to defend skippy. Settling is natural, just need to stir it up. Lived in the UK for a year, was devastated by the peanut butter there. indeed; these small pack usually contains between 50-75% of daily intake of sodium by itself and has basically not real nutriment.They're right, it's the most delicious instant ramen in existence! I like to beat an egg to toss in while it boils and eat the broth leftover after the noodles are gone with rice. Awesome!  Thanks!I never had a crab cake, it looks really interesting, reading the recipe it looks like I need to fry them, Could I have the same result baking them instead?They have a Chipotle Cholula that is to die for. Just amazing smokey taste with a kick of heat. It goes in every single pot of chili I make now! Practicing is the opposite of unneeded stress. That's why you practice. Unneeded stress is trying something for the first time and failing because you don't know how to cook. Did you actually read what OP said? He has no cooking skills at all. You must be a child because you certainly sound like one.Washable silicone paint. I want to get a back-splash made out of milk-glass but just haven't had the time to get that done.Looks nice, I love all seafood, how do you generally cook your Clam sauce with red or white wine?Yeah, I'd bet anything that both the Huy Fong name and the rooster logo are trademarked.Wtf - heating a Teflon pot till it smokes... stressing the importance of "cooking it atleast once first" sounds a lot like unneeded stress to me.

and you're a pretentious, presumptuous prick. not everyones financial or life situation allows for the luxury of practicing every meal first. and to call me lazy or say that I've never tried to do anything special for anyone simply because I don't feel the need to practice first shows how small of person you are. I guess the people in my life just love me enough to not care about practiced perfection. Love the title "Gangnam Style" :)
by the way nice spaghetti bolognese too :)What a nice idea, I will immediately share it with my friends :)It looks like you don't have a back-splash? Do you not get grease all over your wall like that?I actually always buy generic peanut butter because Jif is to pasty and Peter Pan is too runny and you can't get Skippy anywhere.

I'd say it's just a matter of what you grew up with, but oddly enough I always had Peter Pan growing up. Anyway, my point is there's a lot of variation in peanut butter texture.As a former dining hall employee, I hate you.I think we all know that everyone making your tasty $4 bahn mi is related or working under the table in addition to sourcing ingredients from wherever. This guy is playing by the rules and providing quality ingredients. Eh.&gt; a while

like a month. that stuff needs to ferment. Where is this? Typical price for a Maruchan or Top Ramen in the midwest is 15-20 cents per pack in the multipacks, 25 cents individually.I actually didn't think much of Masa. I mean yes it's great sushi, but is it worth the $1000? Nah not really. (Ok it's less than $1000 but with liquor it easily gets there). Even if it were half the price I don't think it would be an experience worth raving about. I think my biggest gripe about the place aside from price, is that from a sushi perspective they stray from the pure edo-mae style sushi with fancy ingredients in order to justify the high price. Yes, I love truffles, foie gras, and Uni just as much as the next person but after a certain point it detracts from the essence of sushi which is fish and rice. Now that's not to say this type of sushi doesn't have its place in pushing the envelope, I just personally didn't think it was a great combination. Also, I didn't pay for the dinner (corporate expense) so one would think I'd enjoy it more but sadly I didn't.

Finally, I loved Nakazawa when it first came to NYC but one thing that worried me when I last visited, was the over use of imported Japanese fish. Why is that a bad thing? Well I understand the appeal of getting fish from Japan when you're paying a lot, but that doesn't mean the fish is objectively better than a fish that was caught locally. Additionally, a lot of the flavor gets lost in transport so in essence you're paying for fish that isn't as flavorful but just more "exotic". I actually think the chef was forced to import the fish because of the expectations of his customers instead of some superior flavor.

Really good edo-Mae sushi actually doesn't require super fresh fish, in fact a lot of it is aged a few days in order to develop nuanced complexities (much like aged steak). If you watched Jiro, you know the idea. So that being said, I really appreciated when Ichimura made it feel like the fish he chose was sourced because of it's flavor instead of it's exotic location.

Yasuda in NYC I can't speak of because I haven't been, but the one in Japan was very very disappointing. Not to hate, but you know it means something when the chef has to simultaneously lower prices and cater to foreign clientele in order to stay alive. Frozen chili pops0.24 in NJ, I think 0.05 boy is exaggerating.... or maybe from the south.I support the frugaljerk movement. Only fat cats use underscores in subreddit names.egg some crack in there!Get the Wild sauce next time instead. Almost as hot as  Blazin' but with actual flavor and no shitty extract aftertaste. Would using chunky peanut butter instead work?So all the ridiculous prices I sometimes see online like $25 for orange juice, is that just in the middle of nowhere, or does stuff cost that much in Anchorage and Juneau?Great stuff.I'm sure there is a recipe out there too make sriracha roasted almonds.Yep, just not very much.Subway - mustard.  Taco Bell - hot sauce.  McDonald's - ketchup.  Hit the grocery store for some bread and you could make three different sandwiches.  Ugh, where was this last night when I needed it? I settled for pasta with canned tomato sauce..I don't know about the peanut butter but when I was in college the sushi place had various bottles of Sriracha sauce mysteriously go missing. There is nothing stressful about practicing something you are not good at. What makes it stressful is when you try something for the first time. You've obviously never tried to do something special for someone because you're too lazy to practice.This is date night dinner, not the wedding feast for the sultan of brunei. there is no need to do practice runs of dinner. just go for it. if it doesn't turn out exactly as you wanted/expected so what? just take note and make changes for next time. these are supposed to be fun dinners, not stressful events.Doing this test blindfolded and without smelling resulted in an entire group of people incorrectly identifying a clear soda as coke once. I think it was sprite they kept screwing up.

It gets really funny to do those when they can't see the item or smell it.The only time I have ever experienced fire shits is when I have eaten from a takeaway or fast food, take out? They call it in the US or something. Usually something isn't being washed properly and the food isn't being taken care of properly.


Never experienced fire shits from home cooking or restaurants, no matter how spicy. Yeah just an uncomfortable fiery feeling around my abdomen but no fire shits.


This is likewise for many of my friends who somehow we have ended up with this conversation before. Bud this is nothing even close to pad Thai. The inspiration for this comes from Dan Dan noodles from the sichaun province of China.Sriracha makes scrambled eggs into the single greatest food item I can prepare in under half an hour. I have a bottle of that shit in the fridge at work too.Peanuts, butterNot horrible? Are you kidding me, they look delicious. Nice job :)I know this doesn't constitute a meal, but my sister bought me Sriracha popcorn; just when I thought I had seen it all... You never get good at something if you never practice.Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern regularly call food that they get from street stalls or hole-in-the-wall restaurants among the best dishes they've eaten, and they also eat at the world's best restaurants. Hmmm I don't think that's the reason Coke is more popular these days. It doesn't seem supported by the research. It also doesn't explain why Coke took such a big hit from Pepsi in the 80s, until after the [New Coke fiasco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke). Marketing and culture seem to be the bigger culprits.

There have been fMRI studies used to look at this, and as it turns out, when blinded to brand people prefer Pepsi/Coke about equally. Bring brand into it, and people prefer Coke, and it seems to activate brain areas we associate with higher brain functions and memory, while Pepsi only activates the reward-seeking areas.

If you know you're drinking Coke, you actually will tend to prefer it, but the mechanism seems related to higher brain function than just basic rewards/pleasure seeking.

1 packet of ramen
1/2 of the seasoning packet
1/4 cup peanut butter
1 tbsp-ish sriracha

Cook the noodles normally, in a bowl mix everything else and add a few tablespoons of the boiling water. Mix the noodles in.
Grocery store "Krab" sticks, soy sauce packets, Sriracha = SUSHI NIGHT BABY!worrying about fucking up food is what takes the fun out of cooking food. just go for it, learn on the way.If to mix a bit of oil with shitty hard peanut butter you have something that honestly tastes better than the name brand stuff.Hey /r/shittyfoodporn is a great sub.Its far too sweet and mild Toad in the hole is sausages, gravy and vegitables in a Yorkshire pudding you heathen.The time to mess things up is when you're practicing.Agreed. I had an extremely  underwhelming meal at the old Ko. The hype around that place was absurd and it definitely did not meet my high expectations.

Meanwhile the few meals I've had at EMP are some of the best I've had in my life. You didn't miss much. ;)I had a red powerade go right through me.. thought I was dieing until remembered what I drankI hate to be that guy but this is more like Dan Dan noodles and nothing at all like Pad Thai. It's actually /r/Frugal_JerkI'm a public practice accountant.

25% food cost is actually pretty high. Most places target 20-22%. 33% food cost is ridiculous.Tesco value Diito. More circular logic please. Cite your sources too, you ve barely given a hint of your so called demolishing sources.

As far as im concerned you are both talking out of your ass as well as being unable to back your comments up with any time of hard evidence.

Just condescending and offensive comments with no substance.I disagree. be confident in the kitchen. try new things and don't be afraid of messing up.Doesn't it have a lot of vegetables in it? You usually won't find that many vegetables in a student's fridge, even if it's cheap.Hello? One bite for both? I bet you take the stairs when an escalator is available. ;DMy tesco does one with extra garlic, it's so good!!

Also go to the 'ethnic' bit as they usually sell bigger bottles for the same price :)I thought I had won a hot wing eating contest. it was not til the next day that I learned I had only won the battle, not the war. And Kroger has their own tooI'm definitely ricist.Walmart brand peanut butter is a little dry and not as creamy as Jif.  Peter Pan peanut butter has a weird consistency, not really a fan.  Skippy is good, although I don't think its as good as Jif Natural.

For all my baking stuff I will buy generic, but for a peanut butter sandwich, I generally use Jif so I don't choke on it.   No no no... You need a sweet and sour juice. Just a couple tablespoons of orange or pineapple if tamarind isn't easy to find.Who knew people cared this much about Pad Thai hahanormally tamarind is rather sour, so I think it's rather for that taste component.[Like this but without all the garlic](http://www.31shots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/grilled-tomatoes-with-garlic-1000w.jpg)&gt; I'm fairly confident that the food in the bottom left corner isn't tofu but a kind of fishcake thing, i'm not too sure what it's called but this is what it looks like http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4544337541_5205762eae.jpg[1]   .


I'm pretty sure it's tofu, that fishcake thing is found in noodle soups etc, but I have never seen it in pad thai.Wow, way to nerdrage on a food post. I eat as close to this plate as I can every morning.Ice scream... Cock sauce... You're my favorite. LoooLCan you not call the UK England and vice versa please. You just come off as ignorant. I don't call the USA California, or Texas. England's part of the UK, not the whole of it.Much better.I don't know why but thinking about English people eating sriracha and cholula makes me so happy! Superb !! I liked this recipe, thanks for sharingDude. Did the same thing a few weeks ago. I struggled through those things, they're fucking hot! I'm usually the type guy that no matter the spiciness I'm shoving food down my gullet. Six of those fuckers took me 45 minutes to down! My girlfriend was shocked. Those fire shits the next day though, those were something else haha Nutella popcorn sounds great, what a great idea, I will definitely give it a go, love nutella :)But neither of those are high fructose corn syrup!?!?!?!?Never had peas in Carbonara, It looks like a good idea, nice to try :)Fucking REKTYup, ITT people who have never eaten Pad Thai. Funny thing is you can actually make something close to it with the right brand and flavour of instant noodle with a squeeze of lime, and as if it's THAT hard to get freaking peanuts. I love trying different kind of cousine, Never tried Polish food a part the polish sausages and they were so tasty, Love them :)Have you eaten pad Thai before OP? dude thats ricist Some of the few times I ever consider calling in sick to work are the days after I have had Blazin' Buffalo Wild Wings.  Me and the Lord have come to a few agreements on the toilet.If you get the fire shits, eat more chiles.

It goes away.schnitzel and kasespaetzle (like german mac and cheese), you'd really have to try to mess these up. as far as having a spaetzle press, you don't REALLY need one. i've even made it with a colander when i was in a pinch. in fact, all you really need is a cutting board and knife to get the job done.&gt; authentic pad thai

unless you're in Thailand... it wont be authentic There you go... putting on airs.Ate too many off brand firehot cheetos when they were on sale and got the fire shits. Liquid squirts and it was red too, thought I had ass cancer till I remembered. Lotta food dye I guess.Mexicans know how to eat, dat obesity Got anything to back that up, because it sounds like BS. All joking aside...this little trick is not bad if u get the ratios right.ipad thigh? lime, cilantro, and soy sauce will kick it up a notch. Also, if you are feeling extra fancy, add some beef to it. My brother and I call it hobo pho. if you leave it in the sun for a while....&gt; Dunno what else OP put on them though, prob just salt and pepper

Near the end, sprinkle with breadcrumbs (though that's optional) and grated cheese. That's the original recipe.Or out pregnant craving each other. Bacon wrapped pickles?More like Jailhouse Pad Thai. Carefully. :P

If you're a little shaky on your hand like I am, take a small plate (that you're not too fond of), put the potato on it and cut. Make sure the knife is longer than the diameter of the plate, and then the edges of the plate should stop the knife before it cuts through the bottom.

A similar trick is to put the potato between some matches or toothpicks, and cut down so that the matches/toothpicks prevents you from cutting all the way to the bottom. You get the best result if you cut off a part of the potato first so you get a flat bottom to start with.

EDIT: Oh, /u/IPFreely already stated the same thing in another answer. I agree. So would many other people. It does in collegeIMO peanut butter should contain 2 ingredients: peanuts and salt.That depends ENTIRELY on your goals, and the dependence of your goals on a single classes grade.

I'd prefer to not put myself in a situation where you can't say "Fuck this shit" at least once in a while, to keep your sanity.Shit... Those are better ingredients than most Thai restaurants use. I'm 32. I'm pretty comfortable with my job, my income, and my situation. It is what I make it, and I'm aware of my ability to change it.

Can you say the same? Or do you prefer to make blind comments on the internet assuming things about other people?We've all been there! Mkay you prove my point exactly. What exactly are you trying to prove? You keep repeating the same circle jerk shit that I kept reading about and seeing demolished.

Like literally, the same old bs

Many individuals organizations and scientists. Like this carries meaning. It doesn't when it's not the right ones. Anyone can call themselves a scientist, form and organization, and many individuals are ill-informed (evidenced by my belief as well until I did the research)

Regulators and scientists recommending more test does not equate to "bad bad bad bad bad" this happens all the time

Previous workers of Monsanto... Like really I thought we talked about this already

Again, I don't know what you're trying to prove when I already told you. I looked at all this same crap you're saying and changed my mind. So if you're trying to change my mind with the same crap... Yah not gonna work. I'm not trying to convince you cause it's obvious you don't want too. So I understand what I say doesn't matter to you. I'm just genuinely confused why you're acting like what you're saying matters.


&gt;I was just responding to your own appeal to authority.

Which was a reply to your opener "I'm an MD"

You still aren't acknowledging the main point, which is that the assessed risks for any new GM cultivar are no different than any new conventional.  Yes, no evidence until there is, blah blah blah, yet another principle which applies equally to both GMOs and new conventionals.  So for the last fucking time, your initial assertion that the risk/benefit ratio of GMOs is unfavorable, is flat wrong.[Sure,](http://irregulartimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/krogerramen4.jpg) [no](http://www.babylovingmama.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Target-Package-Comparison-Ramen-2.jpg) [problem.](http://irregulartimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/krogerramen1.jpg)Do you have no hands?you missed the point.Mind sharing your recipe? Unfortunately you are wrong about that.

What goes in must come out, and there is a limit to how much capsaicin oil your gut will process.  You don't have nerves in your gut.

Think about that for a while.

I'm not joking about this, BTW.  It's serious.  You really, really don't want the Fire Shits.The original Thai sriracha is a little different from what you get in the bottles. Huy Fong (or whoever first created the version we have now) pretty much made a chili pepper sauce and named it after a different chili pepper sauce that already existed.

EDIT: They do use the Huy Fong version in Thailand as well, now.Reddit is full of these people who shit fire after the slightest bit of hot food, there's something wrong with them.

I love me some chilis, and I'm yet to have a "fire shit".SweetMy college roommate's diet consisted of this, a 30 pack of PBR, and the occasional head of iceberg lettuce. He claimed to be vegan. He wouldn't use the chicken flavoring packet, but instead uses soy sauce. I guess he wasn't wrong,It's college food mentality. One upping by getting by on the shittiest food possibleVery informative, thanks!Love that movie. Which part of it does this remind you of?it'd be neat to get a recipe of this to try making it myself. love me some kimchiThe pan is cast iron. I tested sous-vide vs. non-sous-vide and came to the conclusion that searing--&gt;sous-vide--&gt;searing is the best method flavor wise.We have Food4less in Portland Oregon also. Just don't call it Pad Thai.About ten years ago I used to dip almonds into Nando's peri-peri sauce. Spice and almonds, great taste combo.What a tragic loss for the country.Totally, dude. 20 baht on any street corner. I started drinking around noon that day, soo..... probably not :(Ok, add Korea to the list. I haven't seen any Cheddar in any European country I have been to though.Roast beef is pretty much unknown outside of the UK or USA.

Gravy sauces originated in many countries, France is especially famous for it's sauce history.

Mashed Potatoes are thought to have been "invented" by a french physician in 1771. On the other hand it is literally just a bunch of mashed potatoes, it's not really a recipe or anything.

That leaves Yorkshire pudding which is typically English but again completly uncommon outside of the UK.That's weird because I live in Korea and it's in every supermarket. Also sponge cake, sandwiches, modern bacon, meat pies, this debate finished days ago, I won.Beef Ramen, BEEF trust me.That's noodles with an egg in it. Not Pad Thai.Pies have been around since antique times according to wikipedia.You can't even find Cheddar in most supermarkets outside of England or the USA. If there is a "default cheese" it is probably Gouda.[There is only one way to make Pad Thai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeZlih4DDNg)AKA laduzi!I have Thai food here in the UK fairly often, can confirm. Never seen any peanut butter.Because making genuine Pad Thai would be so expensive. It's like a luxury meal in Thailand.ick!Okay, so you like sriracha, glass noodles and veggie stir-fry. That's fine, but really there is no point to call it pad thai. It is just a sriracha stir-fry.

It doesn't enhance it completely overpowers and masks.&gt; subs for the fish sauce

just because tuna is fish doesn't mean it "subs for fish sauce"Agreed, you only get fire shits when you eat unclean food.


I never get fire shits at restaurants when eating stupidly hot but tasty curries, but as soon as I get a take away with some chilli or is very spicy then shit fly's up the walls.


Fire shits are attributed to unclean food, not the hot sauce or spices.All very nice.. but what's his wastage every day / week? Plus if he is really earning so little himself, what is he doing for food? He can't afford his own product, and it's bad business to be consuming your own stock when your cash flow is so tight.Tesco are stocking Cholula too, you might want to check that out, it also go's on everything. Sriracha sauce and peanut butter? That's getting very similar to dan dan noodle territory. For it to be a pseudo-western style pad thai, you need some tomato sauce. Unless if you got some shrimp/fish sauce lying around. If you don't have any of the above? Then that's not Pad Thai!

How to make this better and turn it into the easy form of Dan Dan mother-fucking noodles:

- Sriracha sauce is good. If you have other kinds of hot sauce, I'd recommend experimenting.

- Peanut butter is good.

- Get rid of the ramen. Ramen is great in most recipes, but using it in this does not increase the value of the noodles. Most asian noodles would be fine. Don't go for rice-based noodles (they look albino) or really thick noodles, because they don't mix well with the peanutty goodness.

-The most important thing is: soy sauce! Peanut butter makes it quite dry, and sure you could drain out less water from the noodles, but there's a lot of sweetness in peanut butter, and the vinegar stands out more than the salt in sriracha. So you need the thing that balances everything out. Salt and pepper works as well, but I do like the taste of soy sauce better.

Other ingredients: Green onions (OP with most noodles/ fried rice), raisins, eggs, extra peanuts, great neutral stuff like garlic and ginger.

If you add any more, then you're better off doing the real thing.

I think it's also what you're used to. Our class all liked coke better, but pepsi really isn't very popular here.

Also, in the blind test, we all could easily destinguish coke from pepsi, and the generic version. Most of us could even do it just by smell. Our teacher had bet we couldn't, she was very sure of herself about is aswell, so you can imagine it was a fun day in class for us 15 year-olds :)ITT food snobs who never attended college. smoother than a fresh jar of skippyI got some from Asda a couple of months ago and I've almost finished a large bottle, I live alone.

They. Are. Real.It was a joke bro relax lol. I bet you this richy rich isn't even gonna use the spice packet, and just toss it.They look like corn dogs... But I know they aren't.I asked my Thai friend if she would eat this. She thought the peanut butter was chocolate, and she thought the sriracha was "chicken sauce".Have you tried Thai srirachas?  Far and away superior to the rooster.Not for Sriracha I would agree but get the hottest wing sauce at BWW and I get the fire shits every time. I have a pretty strong stomach too.Usually it takes a week for Pad Thai to become Bad Thai but I suspect your version may have a longer shelf life Maybe America is just the first to do it right. M'kay!That's a pretty good analogy.  I'm willing to bet the stores that sell the generic brand peanut butter with their label on it send people around to different generic peanut butter producers to do taste tests and the producers are using the Pepsi effect to their advantage to get their products on the shelves instead of one of their competitors.

Then those same people who did the taste tests probably go to the store and buy the name brand instead of the generic brand that they thought tasted better when they did they taste test.I found another egg-hater? Holy shit!We called this Poor Man's Pad Thai.Wow that article is embarrassingly USA-centric.

Srirachas have been around a long time, Mr. Tran did not invent the term.  Can you trademark the words "mustard" or "ketchup"?Mission Hill?Looks like a Philly Torta to me.Oh, sorry, I didn't know "college" meant "genuine" in Thai.

In English, it means "a place where students go and spend little money on food".I tried doing this- i ended up setting my [n nguyt]  ( http://www.vatgia.com/pictures_fullsize/bzw1359451588.jpg)  on fire.

2 packets Chicken Ramen

1 spoonful Chunky Peanut Butter

2 eggs

Pot of water boiling on the stove. Both ramens in. You can put the eggs in any time - mix up with a fork for more like an egg drop soup. I prefer cracking it straight in so that it would cook with the yolk and whites still intact. If you do it perfectly the yolk will still be completely surrounded by whites and have a very delicious flavor. Move the noodles around and break them up - keep the eggs intact as best you can. Break 1.5 packets of chicken seasoning into the pot and stir. Take off heat. Put spoonful of peanut butter in bottom of serving bowl. The more PB the stickier the pad thai - sometimes I go for a soupy noodly pad thai but there are merits to a blob of peanut buttery noodles. Pour some water out. How much depends on personal preference. In high school I poured all of it out, but as my palate has refined i have learned at least some hot water is good for getting the peanut butter to mix better. Splash some Sriracha on top and you're good to go.

Advanced maneuvers: vegetables, different sauces, peanuts. Oh god i forgot how good bibimbap sauce is.

http://imgur.com/a/yMDTl here u go. i should probably mention i didnt eat often, this could last me a few days. not very healthy but, what can you do. you can scale down (or up) the ratios and stuff. i did make it as a dish for parties at my place (8 packets lol)Haha why would I not eat at the best restaurant in town!i love thai food, but im not the biggest pad thai fan. i believe that i could enjoy this moreIs that honestly for pad thai and not satay?I literally just melted Hershey dark chocolate chips for the dark ones and some white chocolate chips and oil for a drizzle on one's not picturedTried this just now, its awesome :oYou forgot the turd.

Thai food is my favorite ethnic food of all time.  Pad Thai is about 7th of the list of my favorite dishes of Thai. (and I love Pad Thai).

I understand college and the money situation; but damn just eat the ramen noodles and get a shitty job to help pay for the Pad Thai.

10/$1Its like being constipated, having diarrhea, with a little burning sensation. R.I.P. in peace butthole.We had a discussion in my cognitive psychology class tonight about Coke vs. Pepsi, similar to your experiment. Pepsi won more taste tests since it had a higher sugar content, making it taste better, and was more preferable, than the lower sugar content Coke. However, you will find Coke more often than Pepsi in the average home because, since it has a lower sugar content, you are likely to drink it more often and for a longer period of time. It is not sickeningly sweet and you would prefer to have that again and again as opposed to the good-at-the-time Pepsi, which has a much sweeter taste. hummmmm i dont think so. where are the chicken and shrimps? eggs? vegetables?

I have changed my method a bit since. I sear the steak (out of the fridge) on both sides before sous-vide cooking it at 48c for 2 hours. Then I sear it again. Yesterday I tested the difference in flavor between a seared--&gt;rested(10min)--&gt;seared and a seared--&gt;sous-vide--&gt;seared steak.

I don't have the energy to fry thing before work in the morning!Get the corn for popcorn (Less than 1 handful is what you see there, it grows a lot in size)

Get a pot covered in teflon with a lid and preheat it at maximum fire, the strongest you have.

Before it starts smoking add:

1 tea spoon of neutral oil (Sunflower, canola, corn)

1 tea spoon of butter

When the butter dissolves, add the corn, mix, put the lid on.

When they start popping lower the fire to med-high and move the pot in circles as the continue popping. Be careful not to burn it.

When they stop popping, take the pot out of the fire, add 2 soup spoons of nutella and stir until the big clump of nutella disappears and all the popcorns are covered. (Do not use metal utensils to stir or you'll damage the pot)

It's really easy and godly. You can replace the nutella with honey, sugar (and make a sugar caramel), caramel, salted caramel, melted chocolate. Whatever you want, experiment!you cant carch autism? explain 99% of comments to anything on the internet then.Good choice of chocolate.

(sorry i remember clearly an argument with ex inlaws going batshit insane when they mistook 'busted' (lit. broken colloq. caugjt, found out, sprung) with 'bastard' (lit born out of wedlock. colloq. areshole)http://i.imgur.com/JKsDCgV.gifWas referencing [This Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2vjp9b/pad_thai_everything_you_need_to_make_it/)Pasta is way cheaper than ramen per serving.

Its so delicious and only 50cents. I'm not in college but I still buy this in bulk because it's so good. I add crushed red pepper and/or sriracha for some spice.

I snort it.... Since my veins couldn't handle it for long. It's eating my nose. What should I try next?I got real pad Thai with my
meal plan. Fuck "college" anything as if makes it less nasty/idiotic lol.I love Smitten Kitchen. Everything I have ever made from there turns out great.We need an update article Careful. Have intestines made out of rice paper (or be a toddler) and you'll be like the rest of these assholes who can't even go to Chipotle for lunch without going out of commission.

No sorry, fire shits are not a thing. Eh, I live around the area. Driving by you can smell it year long. When they're actually crushing the peppers and everything it gets stronger. I can see how nearby residents would complain, but that's just life. Yeah I saw I was just referencing a [famous post too] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over)BlobsGrilled cheese Because college taxes even the most brilliant minds to maximal exertion such that even basic considerations like nutrition are impossible.

Can't even say that with a straight face. Even the easiest majors work out far more interesting problems than planning out meals that don't challenge even the tiniest of budgets.Hmm, looks at username.

Hello JustGreatStuff employee!!I've drank champagne that almost has. Ninja squirrel The bland food part is long gone. I think it was derived from the rations during the war. There is a fantastic food scene everywhere in England now. I think saying you are better off in America is a little wide of the mark. Different strokes for different strokes though Crunchy? What on earth is wrong with you?&gt; Sriracha and RIce!
FTFYand yet their sriracha is garbage for anyone that's ever bothered to try their garlic chili sauce.

seriously, after you've had it, there basically is no other worthwhile huy fong product.Put it on hotdogs!I don't know why they don't just buy vegetables, beans, rice, and whatever meat is on sale. They always act like they have to eat some hokey piss-poor imitation of an actual meal when they could *be* eating an actual meal thats equally as inexpensive. The added egg is the best tip I can give to any blossoming ramen chef.Dont fool yourself, they are just as fake as you are because Alasaka dasnt have internets.No problem. I may not be right on every detail, so if anybody can correct me they should speak up so that I can make an edit if I need to, but I've done my homework, and this is a pretty accurate set of basic data about the different ways you can have Pad Thai.I struggle to think where I'd be without Sirarcha sauce in my life. That's love.And rice stick noodles instead of ramen, just as easy to cook and more authentic.Safe bet: chances of me visiting Thailand  none.Hahaha I enjoyed this. Dude literally knows nothing about what he's saying. I've been in California for the last 16 years and I, as well as plenty of people I know, LOVE unhealthy food... as in actually unhealthy food far worse than an English breakfast. You want french fries with a shitload of cheese, meat, and assorted sodium-packed toppings on top? You got it. Additionally, an English breakfast is not that nutritionally different from a typical American breakfast. I might even argue that the English breakfast is more nutritious than say a stack of pancakes, sausage and toast (holy crap Americans eat sausage and toast for breakfast?!). The portion indeed is huge but uh almost every mid-level sit down restaurant in California is going to serve you an unhealthy amount of food. I don't know what part of California this guy lives in because even pretty health conscious cities (Berkeley,  SF) love their fix of deep fried empty calories. WOW! Thanks for the time and effort that must have taken. This is one of the reasons I love reddit.This looks vile. I'm trying it.Yay us. As a purist hash browns wouldn't be on there as delicious as they are, way back you might have fried potatoes or a bit if bubble and squeak if they were leftovers from yesterday's cooking.
In a Scottish breakfast you might replace the black pudding with a slice if haggis and/or white pudding. Oh also you might have a cup of "builders" tea to wash it down.Pb&amp;j with Pl jelly and siricha is good as f@#sCan not upvote this enough!Did ya know it's destroying a town.  Might not love the stuff so much if I lived there.

curry wurstcheers, mate!Add an egg if you're a gourmet. I'd try all of it once. You weren't wrong The best peanut butter is made with coconut sugar! I bought a jar recently, out of curiosity. It was eleven dollars and wasn't even in "butter" form when I got it (just add water) but damn if it wasn't the tastiest, most mouth-watering peanut butter experience I have ever had.

Edit: WHOA judging by the downvotes, someone must actually think I am advertising... that or they find my preoccupation with peanut butter incredibly lame. Either way the correlation between my username and the type of sugar in my new favorite peanut butter is strictly coincidental, folks.Gotta hit up /r/ramenTrader Joe's has one. Neat, will try. Thanks.Gross!! Why peanut butter?? Why?!If you look up peanut butter and bacon on the Google, it'll like lead to a Wikipedia article on the subject.  Elvis probably helped popularize it (with bananas). OK, here a comparison between this recipe and a more authentic recipe, based on my own research and experimentation, as a person who lived there for 8 years, interacted professionally with the Thai restaurant industry for much of that time when I was there, and as somebody who speaks a very broad segment of the Thai language- certainly enough to interact there professionally for 6 of the 8 years I lived there.

So I'm not pulling this out of my ass.

So, this looks like the recipe from [Alton Brown](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pad-thai-recipe.html), adapted the American way: with Chicken, and the best approximation of what would be used that can be done with what is available.

The picture, from top left to bottom right, shows:

* Bean sprouts

* chinese spring onions- the ends are trimmed down, and then from the trim down to ~1/2" from the base, which is a bit fibrous and chewy.  Typically cut into long segments of about 1-2 inches long when added to pad thai.

* 2 eggs. The rule of thumb is one egg per serving.

* This- though I could be wrong- seems to be daikon. More on this in a second.

* Tamarind paste ( 90% sure)

* rice noodles (cooked 99%, drained, rinsed, and cooled to slow the cooking process, kept in a bowl under a damp cloth- in Pad Thai restaurants they'll then flavor these noodles with the sauce, so that they have a large batch of pre-flavored noodles ready for the day)

* rice wine vinegar. This is more of a chinese ingredient than a Thai one, and I have only seen this used in the US and never in Thailand, but I don't know for certain that it is not used there.

* Palm sugar paste, dissolved in water. This stuff is the most wonderful way to have sugar. It's like sugar play-dough, and you can dissolve it into anything to make it taste sweet- without being overpoweringly cloying, the way white granulated sugar is.  This looks like about 1/2 tablespoon in about 1/2 tbsp of water.

* dry roasted peanuts, crushed. just get the cheapest peanuts you can find, throw them (dry) into a frying pan and roast them so they are turning dark, and scorching a bit. then take them out, put another pan into the first one and crush the peanuts with the bottom of that pan. you want some powder, because this lends volume and an umami flavor to the whole of the dish, and it also helps absorb stray sauce.

* chicken.  This is, strictly speaking, not a Thai ingredient in this dish, although you are welcome to have it.  The one place I am aware of in Thailand that serves Pad Thai with chicken is Pattaya, and it is worth noting that this is a city that entirely exists to cater to foreigners, most especially adventure tourists and sex tourists, and that many of the foreigners living there are also in this industry- and so the reason this is seen in Pattaya, and not the rest of Thailand, is because the demand is by foreigners- not because it's the way the dish is normally served.  It's also worth noting that this version includes ketchup as an ingredient, which is also a big no-no to Thais- who have different dishes they prefer if they want dry noodles with meat (like pad see ew and kuay tiao kua gai)

* Dry shrimp.  This is a cheap source of protein. Pad Thai, originally, was a cheap junk-food; some sort of an equivalent of a McDonald's hamburger.  Posh versions- literally called "VIP" at one restaurant I went to in Chiang Mai- included 2-3 medium prawns, cooked in their shells- so a variety of shrimp can be used, the smallest of which are generally the cheap chewy dry ones about 1/4" in diameter- which I've actually found at Winco, since being back in the US.  I think I may have seen them in Walmart before as well.

* that shot glass, right there- it looks like a particularly clear fish sauce or brine.  This is down to the preference of the cook- but certainly a salt-flavor sauce is used here.

* bottom left: tofu. The thai tofu is extremely hard and chewy- a bit like cheddar cheese, just out of the fridge, although it is springier.  there are varieties of tofu that are deep fried before being sold that work particularly well, although they are a substitute for the genuine thai one, which has a bright neon yellow rind and white flesh.

* Garlic.

* lime.

***Not pictured:***

* Daikon jerky.  These are covered well in this excellent article: http://shesimmers.com/2011/06/pad-thai-recipe-part-three-notable.html

* granulated raw sugar, chili pepper flakes, and fish sauce.  These three are used together to counterbalance flavors, are added late in the cooking process to make any adjustment to flavor that may be needed. The dish is also served with these on the table, so that the people eating can make any adjustments they find they need.

* peanut sauce.  This is not pictured because it is not actually an ingredient in this recipe.  I'm not aware of any Thai recipe for Pad Thai that uses peanuts in a pre-made sauce, or uses peanuts as an ingredient in the sauce.

***Things that are also on the table when you eat Pad Thai***

* banana flower wedges.  These are very starchy tender vegetables. You peel them, a bit like an artichoke, and eat the leaves raw. They are best when fresh cut, have a mild tartness and a vegetative dryness to them that makes you want to pucker slightly.

* more dry roasted peanuts, lime wedges, bean sprouts, granulated raw sugar, dry chili pepper flakes, and fish sauce

* chopsticks. This is one of the few dry dishes thai people eat with chopsticks.

***The rough order of preparation***

* noodles are prepared first. You boil them, then drain, rinse, and finally cool them to stop them cooking. This is the standard practice for however else they will be used- normally as is, in soups, where the broth gives the flavor rather than the noodle. But with Pad Thai, there is no broth: so the noodles are flavored with a few flavors in mind as a "target": you want the noodles to be sweet, but not cloying. You want them a bit tart, so that it makes the other flavors stand out more. You want a bit of umami brothiness; you want some salt, to bring it all together. And you want a decent aroma.  So the standard seasonings are based on tamarind, with fish sauce and palm sugar paste; but additional ingredients that might be used (family secret recipes, that kind of thing) include dark sweet soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, oyster sauce, white soy sauce, regular soy sauce, and probably others I'm not aware of. However, to cover the basics, it's tamarind, palm sugar, and fish sauce. This turns the noodles kind of an orangy brown, which is how they appear at all times in the restaurants that specialize in Pad Thai.

 So noodles and sauce together at the beginning. Don't put the sauce on at the end.

* First into the pan: oil. Then the tofu, garlic, pickled daikon, dry shrimp (or fresh shrimp!), peanuts, and a handful of bean sprouts.  These are cooked first.

* Noodles in, give it all a mix so that everything is distributed, let it cook for just a second, and then push it aside and get the eggs in. Crack the yolks with the spatula and spread them around the base of the wok, so they cook as quickly as possible. flip them over and scramble them. then break them up and stir into the noodles to distribute it.

* one more handful of bean sprouts, a generous handful of the chopped chinese spring onion, and a sprinkling of about a tablespoon or two each of chili flakes, granulated sugar, dry roasted peanuts, and fish sauce- and then this is stirred one last time to distribute the flavors, and then served, traditionally on a banana leaf  but now more commonly on a bit of plastic-lined paper, maybe with a little patch of banana leaf in the middle.

* when it is served, there is still no lime juice on it, and it is deliberately served under-seasoned. This is because the person eating is expected to use what is also on the table (see above) to further flavor their dish, adding whatever they like to make the flavor what they want.  Typically, a spoonful of each is the rule of thumb.

I think that's it. Hope you guys find this useful.I like it here! It's a little bit Stockholm Syndrome but still.commander datadrain, set phaser to killI thought you said there was food in those pictures?An advertisment [from 1966](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19650701&amp;id=AdBKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5515,82412)...

Skippy's brand was meatless (not real bacon), but there were other companies who made real products with less shelf life.

Here's a newspaper article [from 1933](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19331116&amp;id=OGYhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vYcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1788,3221653) with a recipe for Heinz peanut butter and bacon.Putting it on everything is exactly what you're supposed to do.Only evil communists and vegans hate eggs. You're telling me. It's been quite a few weeks getting all this stuff ready, and there's no immediate end in sight.  Though if a bunch of people like the sauce it will totally be worth it.What am I doing, I'm about to go try this...

I see posts all the time from British people visiting the US saying something like "Americans really know how to eat!" And there is the clich idea that traditional British food is a little bland. So while we may not have everything in the states, you are probably better off food-wise here in the US. And you can always make your own Full English, because the ingredients are pretty basic. I made one not too long ago for my family nToasted O's ftwSriracha and Ice!

Wait...Literal tub. You scoop it out with your hands. That's nacho average philly cheesesteak that's for sureSkippy is like never not on sale if you have time to look at coupons I was making a joke. That tuna looks like deathHm. Saw them stacking a floor display at Costco the other day. Didn't think too much of it, but maybe I'll go back for a case.

Better be right, dreucifer!Siracha is a sauce style not a brand. Look at this fatcat here.

/r/frugaljerkYuck lolWell now noodles almost every day isn't good for your liver.Literally (as defined pre 2013) the only reason why I logged in. You are full of shit. I don't have anything to say except I'm overcome with excitement to randomly find some other Alaskans on hereOh I've done it, it tastes okay. Although I'm Asian, so our feelings about rice meals may differ.I can't agree with that.Looking forward to college so I can escape this place for a little while. I do this. It tastes amazing. Using cheap shit 5 cent ramen doesn't make it work.

Buy Nongshim packets. They're like $1 a piece. Boil water. Drop everything except the egg(s) in, wait until 2 minutes, 30 seconds. Drop the egg(s) in, 30 seconds later, turn off the heat and pour into a bowl. Breaking the yolk is optional. Some people prefer either or.Yes, actually.

I can't speak to technique though, because mine always come out looking terrible compared to, say, my parents', because any time they do it, it comes out perfectly poached and coherent, but between-over-easy-and-over-hard in the middle. By comparison, mine are a little wispy around the edges and might have stuck to some noodles. Not quite the right kind of consistency of yolk, either.

But still, I do like me some egg in my ramen.I do it all the time. Protein!In what? Please say pockets.This has nothing to do with pad Thai at all.  None of these ingredients resemble those used in pad Thai.

Crushed peanuts can be used as a garnish on pad Thai but 'peanut sauce' is not a part of the dish.  Except in American Thai restaurants

Somehow Americans got it in to their heads that 'peanut sauce' on everything is a central facet of Thai cuisine.  It is not, American Thai restaurants do it to cater to white customers.  Satay sauce is Malay and is not even very common in much of Thailand, and is used only as a dipping sauce for small sticks of meat.  You never see noodles with any kind of peanut sauce in Thailand.  No. even for college this is not Pad thai.Add some chunky peanut butter to one can of coconut milk in a saucepan (I prefer a balanced texture, equal parts each ingredient. Just so long as the sauce isn't soupy.) stir on high, thoroughly. Add as much chili powder as you can handle. Kill heat after 10 minutes. Top it on some stir fry veggies, noodles, and/or meats. Or just throw it on top of rice and serve!You need a decent ramen to make it good. Stuff like Maruchan and Oodles of Noodles suck ass. My go to is the Nongshim Ramyun in the red pack. Why not some truffle too while we're at it?Gross. I just got a justice boner.OMG I love eggs in ramen. How can you not? Heresy. Damn it I want some now. Looks good :)Careful. Eat too much of it and you'll get the Fire Shits. It's like soft-serve fire coming out of your ass.PO

IDontBelieveYou.gifOh probably right. I usually use a dash of sauce and a teaspoon of nut butterand $.60 a loaf is very expensive for bread. Once you get caught for animal abuse from the dog/peanut butter "incident", parole should keep you indoors long enough to perfect something along the lines of an EBT-restricted pad thai recipe.In college I only did this to gain additional nutrients, not for taste
i think he was probably looking for a certain peanut butter to siracha to noodle ratio. That's what she said!.
It made me feel very uncomfortable.TIL. though I'm colorblind so I probably wouldn't be able to tell.I took a class in middle school called "Foods &amp; Nutrition" and one day the whole class did a blind taste test of 4 brands of peanut butter.  The generic brand won the taste test by an overwhelming margin, if I remember correctly it was something like 80% of the vote.  I think the teacher's theory was the generic brand had more sugar but it really surprised me at the time since we are so conditioned to prefer name brand products.It depends on what you're after and what you think she would like, I dated a serious vegan for a while and food was never a big deal even though I joked around about how much I loved bacon and steak 99% of the time. if you can still use cheese and dairy it should be easy. You say not pasta, but any eggplant parmesean type dish is absolutely awesome, a lot of mexican/hispanic style dishes are amazing with good vegetables and don't lose a beat without any meat, a lot of indian/asian dishes are naturally vegetarian and are easy or quick, and for american style food a homemade veggie burger is something that can be incredibly amazing done right.

What does she like? Is she an exotic eater? are you an exotic eater? You have any dishes you or she loves? Vegetarian options are much easier than most people think. Before I started eating predominantly vegetarian, half the time I would get vegetarian burritos at chipotle bc i would get free guac in my burrito and I didn't think it made that big of a difference. Esstentially any dish without a meat smacked on the center of the plate can be good without meat, any rice/hash or potato dish/sandwich or whatever can be good. Let me know what you are confident with and like/dislike, what you are willing to experiment with a bit, and whatever details you might have and you can come up with something great, healthy, and satisfying with some thought and effort.
N my american ass would be standing there like bro where's the beef at[Our struggle is real](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Black-man-Crying.jpg)Sure, but this doesn't help me with the recipe!befriend a dog.I know, I just want someone to be serious :(You guys, come on. I'm all for this eating cheap and quick in college and shit.
But this doesn't even resemble pad thai.

It's closer to [peanut butter chow mein](http://www.food.com/recipe/chinese-lo-mein-with-peanut-butter-sauce-288077) to which you just add some soy and sesame sauce and it's dope.

And if you want to try authentic pad thai [look here](http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/recipes/pad-thai-recipe.html)

but basically i think it's kinda rude and basic to mix this shit up.
That is how I normally eat it minus the peanut butterPooping back and forth foreveroh no, sorry, I was just joking lolI just drink it straight out of the bottle. No excuses necessary.I'm right there with you. I've tried a few times and it just does not do it for me. Maybe I'm just not interested in the egg-drop-soup feeling. I might be able to go for it if it were hardboiled, but I can't do the scrambled egg-shreds.so you were the cunts doing that. OP could have at least fucking made something. Who on earth hasn't heard of this shit yet?God I hate Skippy Peanut Butter. brought one back from America to the UK and the top layer was just pure oil.... The taste wasn't any better. But I heard the chocolate spread is quite goodVariation:  Cheap ground beef + sour cream + ramen

Equals:  Beef stroganoff!  use Sambal instead of Sriracha and add a bit of fish sauce... so much better. lolWait what do you do with the peanut butter?I have to wonder if anyone on reddit has ever actually tried cracking an egg into their ramen, because it is seriously lackluster. I have tried it many different ways and none of them were good, and this is coming from a person who loves eggs. Sesame oil is a much worthier contribution to this combination.Or you know, go to the local Asian supermarket and get enough ingredients to make real Pad Thai for a week for the same money. Not as funny as what OP said I will grant but at least you won't end up with diabetes.Nah, authentic pad thai doesn't have any of these ingredients. But college pad thai? Yeah! This is all you need.I was working 6 plus hours in the summer without a break and a friend brought me a strawberry bubble tea. Sent me over the edge
http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-sriracha-trademark-20150211-story.html#page=1The heat from the sriracha, but then there's the neutralizing from the milk. It's the Cheerios that are the problem they're way too name brand.OnionsImpressiveYeah but that's Alaska bro let's be honest with ourselves.

Something tells me Elvis had something to do with the trend you're talking about.There are others? if you look at their other banh mi sandwiches  they're pretty expensive too... Where I live, they are $3-$5, and I really doubt those type of restaurants are making 4x off these cheap banh mis. Even his tofu banh mi is $6 and that's about as cheap as you can get from ingredients. I've had cheaper seafood banh mi sandwiches than that. *shrugs*Bruh. For mexicans its Maruchan + tapatio or valentina + lime. Did anyone else have sauce runs in their dorm floors? Where once a week everyone would go to Taco Bell or McDonalds and get as many packets as possible. This would last us weeks and we'd just trade around fast food places weekly. By the end of the semester we had every flavor of condiment one could even want. Sometimes i go hack down some corn stalks if I want some for dinner in the fall.

Boom! Lawyered!
Holy crap dude. Just because I have nothing (literally nothing) better to do at the moment, I'll SparkNotes this conversation for you.

1. OP says he/she is surprised that it's so hard to find this breakfast offering in the states

2. YOU say that most Americans would consider this food unhealthy (therefore implying that this is the cause of the problem)

3. I write, as a joke, that nutrition doesn't get in the way of the USA and its food

4. You make smug comments about how this would never pass in California

5. I, as a lifetime California resident (I also might add that I've lived in three different parts of the state: Davis, Los Angeles, Berkeley), say that that's just wrong, sighting the mass popularity of In-N-Out as an example of Californians not giving a shit about nutrition

6. You say, and this is where you lose me, that most people in the US would identify the food as unhealthy

And, the best part, is that I agree with your last point, but that wasn't the fucking point of the discussion. You swerved the argument in a different direction.

Also, I'm curious as to what areas of California you live in that can allow you to ascertain that the entire state is turned-off by unhealthy food. That's just blatant stereotyping.finally, someone interested in my mixtape.Yeah, cause Maruchan is like 5 cents.make it sohttp://freakonomics.com/2015/02/05/how-efficient-is-energy-efficiency-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/What's taters?Yep. I always apologize in advance to my family when I cook thai but promise it'll be worth the smell.You forgot the MSGSo saltyI'm... I'm gonna try this...Have you ever had pad that was more red than brown, and on the sweeter/milder side? Probably sweetened with ketchup (sometimes with and sometimes instead of tamarin and/or Palm sugar). for the inner city alternative substitute Franks for the Sriracha and save the peanut butter for munchies induced sammiches latter on. Empty bottle, this is indeed College Pad Thai.OP, if you're going to hijack the top post spot like this, the least you can do is give us the cooking method (i.e. how much Sriracha and peanut butter, how much water should be drained from the noodles, how much of the seasoning packet should be added).What about pickled ginger from a sushi shop? I can afford that.I just tried peanut butter in a cup o noodles.  Not bad but would taste a lot better with shiracha.##Engage.With pad thai the egg is supposed to be scrambled.Have you ever had pad that's more red than brown, and on the sweeter/milder side? Probably sweetens ketchup (sometimes with and sometimes instead of tamarin and/or Palm sugar). I'm so sure OP does that. It's also easier to not buy them in the first place. But keep justifying it.Does the cost vary by region?  Maruchan is the cheap brand where I am.Cook on stove, with 1 minute to go throw in an egg.I'm crazy about Thai food, I order it all the time. It took me a long time to have any success making pad thai though. The biggest mistake I made over and over: trying to cook three days worth of pad thai in one wok (my motives were always to have leftovers). Smaller batches are a must if you want to execute it well. Thanks for the tip!Did you know it's American made? I'm so proud I have mixed feelings about sriracha cheerios.Sriracha is amazing in every way. Hypebeast actually made a cool film about the founder. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLVpu4X9jH8More like a prison spread pad thai. No seriously, check out some of their creations. It's incredible what you can do with ramen noodles and random saved state foods and commissary. One such creation uses ramen, peanut butter, a saved bag of unsalted peanuts from lunch, chili packets from a Thai Noodle (noodle package) and a few other things to make just what you are making there.I put cheddar on a cracker with a blob of Sriracha.Can you ask your local thai restaurant for a tradition pad thai made with tamarind rather than ketchup? There are a couple local places around here that offer both. Ketchup based pad thai tastes like something horrible from a kids menu IMO.The red sauce is tamarind. You can get bricks of it from any asian market, but usually not at more major chain stores like walmart/winco/albertsons/safeway.  This is the pre-prepared version, which is also available and convenient, but not as authentic: Normally dried tamarind fruit, taken out of the shell and seeded and allowed to dry, is put in boiling water and allowed to dissolve into a paste- which is then filtered to get the fibrous veins that run through the flesh of the fruit (as well as any straggling seeds) out.  An acceptable cop out is to put 1-1.5 tbsp of tamarind paste in 1/2-2/3 of a cup of water and microwave it, and then strain that over the noodles to flavor them.

Also, the top right appears to be daikon, which is technically correct- it is an ingredient- but this is the wrong kind (the correct kind is a southeast asian sweet dry-pickled preparation of this kind of daikon- but the readily available chinese salty version, available at all asian food stores everywhere, is an acceptable substitute).  It's one of those ingredients white people don't seem to know about yet. Essentially, teriyaki turnip jerky.

Working on a post to give some data about this stuff. look for it if you give a shit.Peanut butter and bacon was very popular in the 1950s time frame...you used to be able to get it in a pre-mixed jar.Don't disgrace Pad Thai by trying to make it with these ingredients.;)Soda, cheese and beer.If you separate the egg white from the egg and crack it in there while its still steaming and put a plate over top of the bowl.

I'm no pork expert, but I've done my research... When cooking the buh-jesus out of a pork belly to the point where it's dry (which is probably undesirable on a sandwich), I'd expect it to shrink by about 40% and lose about 30% of its mass (in water and fats).

If the owner is so good at mathematics that he can run a business smoothly as he's subtly trying to convince us, then why is he implying that a 25% volume reduction definitively results in a 25% mass reduction? Since the reduction involves evaporating the less weighty, yet more bulky substances (eg. water), I have my doubt regarding his figures...

Then again, perhaps he could improve the quality of his food by cooking it on a more regular heat, and drying it out less?Hacking is anything unorthodox done to reach a goal without the correct toolsWhy make it? Its Only 50 baht :-DPeople who can't afford pasta to mass cookYou're really asking for a ramen recipe? It says it on the packet dude. As for the hot^cock sauce and the peanut butter, just mix them in with the other flavours, or when you would put the flavours in.Wait. Peanut butter + Sriracha + instant ramen. This sounds amazing. Peanut butter, bacon, sriracha, toasted bread.  Doesn't sound like an awesome sandwich... but it is.  Either that or the cigarettes and broken nose have messed up my taste/smell senses to the point where I'm like my uncle who used to lather everything in prepared horseradish just so he could taste it.  But don't take MY word for it....It's not if you should, it's if you willIt does
Correct, because hacking has nothing to do with food.i always snag as many sauce packs as my poor fingers can grab.
i have a whole drawer full.
perfect for ramen, manager special meats, and fappinIt's all about ratios. Don't glob an ice scream scoop of peanut butter in. Just a little bit, to give it some flavor other than cup o noodles. A tiny squirt of cock sauce will also go a long way.

^^^You ^^^pervert. Can confirm. Eating this now.  My mouth approves.Man, I have been to a huge shake shack in Istanbul.

I remember when it was a small place in a park, now its thinking of going public. That said, the food deposit seem to have suffered.
Aw man, wish I had seen the first thread.  Missed mah chance fer a sampull : (true. but to be clear, 3-4x is a pretty standard food cost multiplier in the restaurant industry. how much or how little you do depends on all the fun stuff like labor and overhead.

that said, it's $9 a sandwich cause the pork he uses is nice. can you buy $1/lbs. pork from a reputable meat vendor? kinda tough these days... but I think possible if you really look around and try to cut deals. this guy is using the good stuff, and people who care will care, and it'll be worth the $9 to them.

that said, i love the $3 banh mihs i get from Oakland Chinatown (Cam Huong, I'm looking at you). I also know that they're not using $4/lbs pork in their sammiches.

i think the owner's tone is inappropriate. this is a free market situation. the customer is entitled to his opinion, and certainly has full control over where he spends his $9. if the good people of portland think this guy's sammiches are worth $9 a pop, their demand will keep him in business. otherwise, the market will correct. mmmmmmmmm, market correction. so delicious. too bad we didn't let that happen with banks in '08... but that's a tangent.It's pretty easy to compost/recycle paper platesCan I just say as a British person I have heard a lot of good stuff about Sriracha and saw it in Tescos the other day. Holy shit this stuff is godly. I've been eating it with literally everything. I've started putting little blobs of it on almonds.

Poor man's Pad Thai.Our college always had a tub of Sriracha in the dining hall. we would snag that stuff and bring it back to the dorms all the time. I don't understand why people feel the need to hate on your post, but personally OP I think it looks fucking delicious. I'd probably add some lettuce and tomato to my slice but afterwards so help me god I would wreck the shit out of it with my face.Sounds like one of these food cart sandwiches wouldn't fill you up like a subway sub.  Delicious foot Longs. I'm going to subway right now.

Onions...check. Cheese Whiz...check. Looks like a Philly to me.Seriously worth trying...I just need some peanut butter! I've always got sriracha in my dorm, it's a necessity for us college students! Always add eggs to your ramen as well :)
Challenge Accepted.wow that's quite an impressive operation! very hot indeed ;)Def thought that's where I wasSeriously best response ever? Is this how he responds to any and all criticism? The owner shouldn't have to write a saga to make a $9 sandwich worth it. upvote for tofuWell this seems disgusting.The Thai and tomatillo looks awesome. I'd love a sample. What kind of stores do you expect to sell these at? I'll try not to reveal my exact location, but the kickstarter page lists San Francisco...which got me excited. My current hot sauce of choice is a green sauce that I just get at Safeway (lame). This!Thank you for that recipe - just tried it a few minutes ago, it is absolutely superb. Have you even been in the real world yet?&gt; Grades (especially in a single class) do not mean much in the scope of life. Helping others to see both sides of an issue, learning to counter a false argument in a calm and kind and coherent manner, these are things worth learning - and they'll outweigh this shitty classes GRADES in terms of lifetime earning power.

People who say "grades don't matter" have never been on the wrong side of the GPA barrier.  I can confirm this. Growing up my family owned several food trucks. Turns out fees vary GREATLY from city to city, county to county, state to state, etc. Some cities go out of their way to make it IMPOSSIBLE for there to be a strong food truck presence. Others make it so easy, you see one every 2 feet. Fees, permits, licenses, not to mention the fines if you ever make a miniscule mistake when the powers that be decide to be looking over your shoulder. Special events like parades? Forget about it unless you're making a few thousand dollars from the parade sales themselves, the cost to set up anywhere near the parades is ridiculous.  Anyone who says otherwise has clearly not tried running their own business.

Edit: Fun story, I once cost our business a roughly $1,500 fine for.... you ready?..............the inspector was staring at me as I sliced vegetables and I looked at him and asked, "What?" He said, "That's gonna cost you." I had a dumbfounded look. Turns out my mistake was looking away from the cutting board area without setting the knife down first. This was a safety violation that, having taken the FHC (18 hour back then Food Handler's Course) and passed it, I should've known about. Had to pay for it out of pocket. Good thing it was a family business. Family always has your back. How about some steamed hams?Subway charged me 9 dollars for a footlong hot pastrami the other day, I'll gladly pay for this sandwich where people took time to make and create over subway any day.They have tubes of ginger paste next to the herbs for like $3 and it will last you all semester.Oh oh, and the mushrooms from the bathroom floor! MmmMan, I made it with shin Ramen (that spicy good stuff)  with an egg and peanut butter. I gotta say, probably the best Ramen I've had. Crack an egg in there! Like /u/IceCooro said, Papaya Salad, and also other salads (called Yum). If you like Thai food, you should look into a northern Thai dish called "Nam Prik Ong." It's a chili sauce made with tomatoes and minced pork. It actually tastes very similar to marinara sauce. He explicitly said that was standard.OWNEREDI think his response is get a better job you cheap fat fuck.  Sounds fair.Masala**His response came across as more condescending than anything.  The reviewer had a fair opinion regarding the price point of the product, one that seems to be shared by many other reviewers.  There was no need to lecture them on the pains of running a business.Soups are easy and can pair with just about anything. A fine baguette with hummus or other spreads. Wine. Bean or pasta salads are quick to mix if you're sure to have the ingredients. Have some fresh fruit to snack on and YOU'RE IN. Avoid the processed, frozen "meat-imitation" products. If you've got the time to put in I've had many absolutely delicious and filling vegan "meat"loafs. Google it, sorry I lack a real recipe for you.Recipe?
Hmm. Why did he multiply the cost by 4 at the end? Is it the standard way to calculate the price?
Lol, that is such an asinine statement. Every city has their own sets of rules and regulations. You literally cannot compare a food truck in one city to the next. There is not *one* food truck in my city because the fees the city places on them to protect the restaurants are so high that no one is willing to do it. I suspect not every city is like this, because, as I said.. it varies between cities.so you decided to be a dick.

i actually don't think anyone in california would eat eggs fried in lard.  and i don't think anyone would eat caramelised beans for breakfast, or eat british sausages, even if they could be had here, and i really don't think anyone would willingly eat toasted wonderbread - at least not enough people for it to be put on the menu in a widespread  manner where it could be readily located.

but no, someone here actually thinks that saying there are 39 million people disputes the spirit of what i am saying - although they have no explanation for why it is so hard for the op to locate a british fry up in the states.  and perhaps no explanation for why people running b n b's in britain have frequently asked me 'what *do* americans eat for breakfast.'  but no, you know best.

if you think it is so easy for people to locate a british fry up on the menu, because americans will eat toast and sausage, then take it up with the op who finds it so difficult and explain the incongruity to him, not me.  i have my answer: most americans would find a british fry up to be unhealthy.  and quit bothering me with your horseshit.You're ruining the narrative!When I was up there for about six months LBB was where I went for burgers. After I got back home I went to In-N-Out and it just didn't taste that good because of the quality difference, it took a few months to like them again. And the truffle oil on the fries, by the time I remembered to ask for no oil it was too late, they tasted wrong without it.well then today you are going to learn something new I hope.

there is a relatively closely followed 'ancient, ~1200-1400' Pad Thai recipe, it is from the sukhothai era.  Do not try to google it, what comes up is wrong.

Back then there wasn't access to the ingredients we have now and there is NO tamarind in that recipe whatsoever.  Use of tamarind is considered a modern (modern as in) Krung Thep style pad thai.

You can have a sukhothai era pad thai recipe, the ingredients, and even watch an old Isaan woman make it all day and you will royally screw it up, I consider it one of the most difficult simple recipes to perform.  This number is purely pulled out of my intuition but I'd say that of the sukhothai style pad thai carts only a handful in the country can do it right every day all day long.  Outside of Isaan the greatest concentration of these vendors/chefs is in Pattaya.

There is one in the 'germantown' area of pattaya...my wife who never liked pad thai growing up in the usa will eat two orders in one sitting there.Add a slice of lime and you're good to go! Throw in an egg for a more satisfying meal.it's tough to figure out without the OP. I got most from your comments on that post but what's on the top right corner?Any professional restaurateur would tell you otherwise. Costs for food trucks are about the same anywhere...My wife is white and cooks with tomatoes.Damn. I wanted to reply to /u/BigBearKitty and tell him that California is a diverse state of 39 million people, many of which would definitely eat eggs, sausage, toast, and some other stuff while not caring it was unhealthy, but... he disabled replies. The clever bastard.There is no standard because every type of business has a different set of rules to play by. I doubt you really know the exact fees, taxes, etc. that food truck owners in Seattle run into. Perhaps 4x *is* the standard that they all adhere to.All this just makes me glad I cook for myself most of the time.I agree. It's a neat concept, but it just looks disgusting. I couldn't even begin to entertain the idea of eating that. I mean.....calorie overload!I don't mind paying a little extra for something that someone clearly has spent a lot of time and effort on. And I'm not one with a lot of money to throw around - I just think it's important to help out other people trying to make a living. I would pay $9 for a pork belly sandwich from this guy. I guess I'll be that guy.

You can use all of the math in the world, at the end of the day, $9 *is* expensive for just a sandwich. One of my favorite aspects of Vietnamese food, other than how damn delicious it is, is that it's dirt cheap. I get great Banh Mih sandwiches around here for $4-5. I would be upset, as I'm sure most of you would be, if I spent $9 on lunch and got only a sandwich that left me hungry afterward.

I understand the cost of business. I also understand that if you're marking up your product 4x cost and you're still only making $3/hr end profit, you need to fix what you're doing. I realize pork belly can be a little expensive. Perhaps this is an item he should consider more of a loss leader and not mark up 4x. It's not the only thing he sells, so he can get away with not making the same profit, and he'll avoid all of those negative $9 complaints. Less complaints, more business, more profit. Running a business is all about being creative - if you're just going to steadfastly stand by your "4x cost" profit equation, you're going to hit a little resistance like he's seeing. His whole yelp is littered with this sentiment. At what point don't you listen to your customers and try to fix it instead of sticking by it?Holy shit! This is my OC from a while back (some folks linked to it below; you da real mvps). I've been reposted for like triple the karma I got originally... Oh wells. Yes there is tamarind in the red bowl, and there's crispy fried onions and garlic in the little bowls IIRC.Red sauce is sriracha sauce, just below it's hoison sauce teammate.That's what I was thinking... 6.75 sounds WAY more fair for a sandwich from a street food vendor than $9.  For $9, I'd like to be seated indoors in a restaurant at the very least for one sandwich with no sides or drinks.Where are all the bones to make the broth?I suppose the more accurate dish to say that every family has their own variety of is, at least in my experience, kalbi jim. Even within my own family, people cook it differently.

I actually agree with you that the bo ssam that Chang does is really his own particular style (my family also just boils it) but it still looks really tasty. I think he calls it bo ssam because of the way that they end up eating it, not sure why else. Other post said Maenam - looks like 4th avenue is a hotspot for good Pad Thai :)Thanks I'll try it !I much prefer the salmon!Lol! The only reason I tried it is because a friend of mine had already had it and didn't have any issues from it.Let me know for when I go to Seattle next !
Damn that sauce is delicious, we have a bottle if it at home. We call it cocksauce.Actually met a guy thru-hiking the A.T. who made this.
4x? 3x is standard increase to cover costs...Thank you.Will some poor bastard try this and tell me if I should eat it with rice?EPIC!!!You don't need much - a teaspoon will do. Peanut butter is legitimately used in some Asian dishes. It's not a hack. :)"pad thai"Yummmmm I just ate dinner two hours ago and I'm hungryI wouldn't really say that every Korean family has their own bo ssam recipe. Bo ssam is pretty simple stuff - it's boiled pig with kimchi filling and other stuff. Any differences in "recipe" would come from subtle things like spices used in the liquid, the contents of the kimchi and what it's garnished/wrapped with. Furthermore bossam isn't really a popular home dish anyway. It would be almost be like saying "every other American family has their own corned beef and cabbage recipe."

And for the OP...I really hate to be "that guy" on /r/food but this isn't really "bo ssam style"...it's "momofuku style." This kind of roasted pig simply doesn't exist in actual Korean cuisine and would be completely unrecognizable to anyone in Korea. The only place in the world where this is called bo ssam is at Momofuku.Nice job, They look great! My family goes nuts for these on the holidays! Per a [recent comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2v7gw8/my_first_time_making_pizza_i_think_it_turned_out/cofzoen)...I'm sorry what? o.o


BUT FLOWERS--ps how did you do those?no idea but I saw the video and in the comments lots of people mentioned tamarind being used a lot in pad thai so I thought that's what it was. I would have guessed oyster sauce thoughIt was to me. I'd never eaten a bagel that good before. And pretzel milk is strange but really good. It tastes like pretzels soaked in milk that's been sweetened. Hard to describe, but strangely satisfying. I studied at Manchester for a semester. Damn I miss English breakfasts...I made this the other day and it was pretty good.  We used beef ramen, though.  I would eat it again.

We also made it once with spinach and that was good too.tldr; owner of food cart that gets 2 star review breaks down cost of food and running a small business, won't sacrifice on quality to make it cheaper, pays employees fair. Then, refunds the customer's card $6.76 of the $9 to eliminate any profit that could have been earned by the owner. ...smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy!
Borscht is the only preparation that I've loved the flavor of beets. Many years ago a girlfriend of mine had a 6 month teaching assistant position in Novgorod and came back with a wonderful recipe. We made it a few times and I thought it was wonderful. The teacher she worked with came here to the states a year later and helped tweak the recipe a little. I really wish I had a copy so I could make it again. I'm afraid I'd make the effort and find myself disappointed not being able to replicate the flavor from my memory. Regardless I suppose I should give it a shot some day.How much liquid did you put in the slow cooker to start?The one time I tried to do pasta in the slow cooker it was HORRIBLE. Inedible.I've definitely had issues with beans not getting mushy (kind of crunchy almost? mostly the skin...) if I add salt early.Whats beef consomme? Not heard of it before, similiar to beef stock?As long as you don't put it in the crockpot and in the fridge you should be good. If you put your whole crock pot insert in the fridge and then put that in heat, it may crack in the middle of the day.  It's safer to prepare all the ingredients in a separate container (big mixing bowl with saran wrap over it) and dump all of that into the crock pot in the morning.

Just a friendly tip :)I did this last week.  I believe I used a different recipe and added a crap ton more spices and some extra chicken. Also, add okra in.  Adds a great flavor and texture!

I didn't brown anything, but I did make it more of a soup instead of a chunky plate of food.  I did about 5-6 cups of chicken stock and that way the juices were soaked up by the meats (why you brown the stuff in the first place).  The roux takes maybe 5-10 minutes to make so I would suggest just doing that in the morning and cut stuff the night before so you can just toss all of it in the crock pot in the morning.

Good luck! It should turn out wonderfully! I added some rice 30 minutes before the end and that turned out pretty well.I have put cheap steaks right on the bottom with whatever other vegetables in it on low for eight hours and it shreds into ridiculously tender carnitas.  I don't think this is necessarily trueAll of your ingredients should be fine.  They even sell roux in a jar that has a shelf life of 3 years.  What I personally would do is start a pan on the stove and brown all my meats and saute all my veggies (to get a nice fond going) and THEN throw all that in the crock pot.

Source:  From LA and been cooking/eating gumbo for as long as I can rememberI pretty much always go from fridge to crock. Prep the night before, throw into the cooker in the morning before work, meal ready when I get home.

Also thanks for the recipe.  I'm gonna try that one next.That's why I'm skeptical and don't use sodaParsley instead of dill?

Maybe it's a polish thing, but I feel like every one of my grandma's recipes incorporates dill in some way. It was always fresh from the garden too *sigh* those were the days. Everyone here has posted good answers, but something you might want to keep in mind, as it is a mistake that I've made, is make sure that the cut of meat isn't touching the sides of the slow cooker. This also might be obvious, but the part of the meat touching the slow cooker will be cooked way faster and get tough and burnt.&gt;Polish borscht, its white and uses potato

Not *all* Polish borscht.
No it won't, when the meat releases the liquid in it it'll shrink accordngly, so about the same volume will be used.Nah. Technically you don't need to add any liquid, there's enough liquid in the meat to cook it, I've done it that way a couple of times. Whatever liquid you add is just for the flavor, not because you need more liquid.if the acid wouldn't, why would CO2?  I think the point here is that it doesn't actually help tenderize.

Thanks for posting a traditional version. I'll probably try that one next.I imagine a lot of people feel the same way about grocery store sushi.The meat will release a lot of juice of its own.  If you start with too much liquid, it will overflow.Fresh beets are great. I like them in a salad with goat cheese, baby arugula and thinly sliced red onion.Now I'm wondering what kind of monster would toss in spaghetti or soba noodle.I totally make this recipe all the time and I love it with the tomato and I use ground pork instead![This one](http://youtu.be/_BwbD6iqaRc) is similar to how my family does it except we don't add garlic, but that's up to you.

Also if you use pork instead of beef I think it tastes better.You sir, have insulted my pig.

:pMight try pork sometime. Tomato juice sounds like an interesting idea. Thanks. :)

Do you think the celery-like stalks of the beets are too bitter to add in?Me too. I actually skipped the tomatoes altogether when I made it and doubled the beets.

I've been informed this technically stops it from being borscht but i'm a loose cannon that doesn't play by the rules.It looks a little too tomatoey for my likings, but that was nice of you.  I'd still try it.Agreeing with the comment above yours. As long as you keep the environment at 100% humidity (e.g. steamy under a lid), it will braise evenly. It can't dry out because the moisture has nowhere to go in a 100% humidity environment.

You might want to flip the meat though occasionally to get the flavor of the braising fluids to penetrate evenly.Since you remove the meat from the cooking liquid to shred it anyway, the soda doesn't really stick around. I also use more of a Carolina-style BBQ sauce (mainly vinegar and tomato) that isn't sweet at all.That is precisely what I do everyday. I prepare the food at night, and my GF pulls it out of the fridge the next morning and lights it up. I have heard about issues with the crock going from the fridge straight to the heat. I'll state I haven't had problems with this, but better to be safe than sorry.

Perhaps give it a try on a day when you'd be there in case everything goes to kittens. Hope that helps.Very good recipe.

Word of advice though, this is called gumbo, which is more soupy than jambalaya./u/boh_my_god has it right!  Also, note you can ask your grocery store to cut it up for you - most of them will help you out!Just raw, the slow cooker drains out all the fat.please share the correct recipe, I would love to try it, and hate to do it wrong and like it.I have polish and Ukrainian heritage and even within my family there are 3 different types, borscht really only means "eastern European soup" in my mind, I have had some polish versions based on potato!To me borscht came in a jar and tasted disgusting. Then I was convinced to try it at a Kazakh restaurant, it was fantastic!

My fault! The list is supposed to say cream cheese. Fix'd.Yup, either works fine! Just happened had penne lying around.I am from here and have never heard of a place that did an all you can eat, but there are tons of places to get it.Manitoban with Ukrainian ancestry checking in, there us also Polish borscht, its white and uses potatoCame here to say this.That sounds reasonable enough, thank you!If you leave the lid closed for the whole time, the whole cut of meat will be moist.  You can turn the meat over during cooking time though, if you want.  If you put too much in the crockpot , it takes forever for the food to start to cook, I think.I love beef stroganoff and this looks delicious. I'm definitely going to give this a try. Thanks!Cut it up and freeze the chunks you don't use.  I don't think the amount of soda or the other ingredients are critical, just put enough liquid to cover it half way to two thirds or so.  Some onion and seasoning makes a difference, but again, not critical. The barbecue sauce will pretty much outshine all the other flavors anyway.



Tl;dr: just go for it, you'll be fine. :-) Do you cook the bacon first to render and drain some of the fat?  Or just start from raw? In my experience, all salt does is make the skin of each bean less likely to fall apart. But that's just me.If you eat beans regularly they stop making you fart after a while. I keep trying this with beer...We also cook a lot of black beans (stovetop), never soak them, no problem.What's that?lid on, on the counter. :) Chicken will cook quicker than beef, depends on the cut and sizes though, right?Just to clarify, you said cream cheese in the description but sour cream in the list?Traditional Borscht is all over the place, with the only constant being beets. The recipes vary in so many ways. Some use potatoes, some use cabbage, some use beans, some use beef, some use pork, etc.. You're right that this is the first time I've seen MSG, red wine vinegar or brown sugar, but I use white vinegar (only because my grandma and aunt use sour salt and I have no idea what that is or where to find it) and occasionally table sugar (depending on how much sweetness I get from the beets).

Anyway, these are all small changes that were made, it's not like OP added noodles and broccoli or something weird like that. I want to upvote you for your confidence, but I want to downvote you because you're wrong.  I'm so conflicted. I have suggestions, because the recipe is not too far from mine:

* Use pork ribs instead of beef (the pork is much better flavor and texture and the rib bones make for a better broth in the end, just remove the meat from the bones later in the process)
* Use tomato juice instead of diced tomatoes or tomato paste. Your borscht won't taste tomato-ey and you won't lose the beet flavoring, but I absolutely would never make my borscht without the tomato element. It just balances it somehow. I think it needs the acidity (in addition to the vinegar) to balance the sugar and the beets.
* More dill. Always more dill than they call for :) and it has to be fresh. None of that dried flavorless dill.
* Diced celery. &gt; liquid from the pork fulfills a roux's fat requirement (it doesn't need to specifically be butter[1] ).

It does not fulfill that requirement.  You're using flour and cornstarch as an emulsifier and while a roux is an emulsifier, a huge part of the emulsification, flavor, and texture from roux is based on the the fact that you're cooking the flour in a fat.  In your instance, yes, you're thickening it, but there's nothing roux about that approach because you don't cook the flour.Borscht originated in the Ukraine and is a soup, not a stew.When I was about 3, I turned a bowl of it upside down on my head (this is usually served cold in my family). Parents left it long enough to take a photo, but I can't imagine how long the clean up was.I hear you guys have all you can eat perogie nights quite often out there. Is this a true fact?[This one](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-carolina-bbq/) is pretty good. I also add ~2 tbsp liquid smoke, and I make [this coleslaw](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/creamy-spiced-coleslaw/) to go with it.No but my husband has, he was quite fond of pyramid pizza though. Pizza is his thing The texture and taste are definitely different, just like anything else pickled vs fresh. They're firmer and sweet, not salty and vinegary. They still turn your pee/poo red, though.

They're cheap enough to buy one, peel it, cut it up and steam it if you'd like to try it. You'd spend way less than a dollar for a small one. I'm not a big fan of pickled beets, but I do love some fresh, steamed beets!

Thanks! Thought it had posted but it must not have gone through.

8 strips of bacon

3 chicken thighs

handful of fresh spinach

1 tub of onion and chives philladelphia cheese

herbs and spices (I used mixed herbs, garlic powder and pepper)

Criss-cross the bacon into a weave, then using a meat tenderiser, tenderise and flatten out the chicken fillets. Lay the fillets on top of the bacon weave, spread out the philly cheese and sprinkle herbs on top. Stick the spinach on top of that, then roll it all into a log. I wrapped mine in tin foil, then cooked for one hour on high, 4 hours on low. I think 4 hours on low might have been too much as you can see in the first photo, it's so tender it falls apart but was a bit dry. I think it would be fine on 3 hours on low. At the end, I unwrapped it and chucked it in the oven so it could crisp up!

This recipe is awesome because you can tweak it to your own tastes and add whatever fillings you like! There was about 1 litre of liquid left in the SC after cooking and I reduced it and made it into a nice sauce.Don't forget to post the recipe! I put 6oz of crappy beer (coors light, miller light, bud, PBR, etc) for every lb of meat. Carbonation helps break down the meat, little bit of hops, and you don't get the sweetness from soda.Thanks, Jim. You just can't beet it.Some people shyed away, which I find pretty funny. It's weird how people can have an aversion to something you can get fresh at pretty much any grocery store I've ever been in.What size baking dish do you use?It always looks like a crime scene by the time I'm done.I made this! So good. I had a bunch left, made it into soup, and it lasted even longer! I pretty much use it the same way I use salt and pepper. The crystals are kind of large so I want them to have time to dissolve. In this case I put everything in at the beginning. It would probably work pretty well in stroganoff as well.That's actually kind of an interesting fact. Borscht is kind of known for having beets, but I recently saw that not all of them actually use beets. Now I learn that a lack of tomatoes makes it a completely different soup? I feel like the American educational system has failed me.

Still tastes pretty good though. ;)\*shrug\*

Might not be traditional, but it sure tastes good. I tried a traditional one stovetop last time, but it was very bland. Don't worry - I'm just pushing through a bunch of variations right now. :)Yeah I was wrong there. Usually it is a soup. This specific recipe came out much more like a stew though - not much liquid relative to the other ingredients.

I really need to learn to make perogies as well, actually. It's been a while since I've had them.Thank you for the dinner recipe for Friday night.i always use some liquid smoke and really adds a great flavor. And then use some smoked paprika in my rub. Tasty!You have a good point. Honestly I had never considered the matter that way..Borscht isn't stew, it's a soup. It's also Ukrainian. It's really popular in Manitoba, as there's a lot of Ukrainians and Mennonites here.

Edit: [Perogies](https://twitter.com/SafewayCanada/status/524190839908491264) are also popular here.Traditional Borscht is not slow cooked, has tomatoes and most of these ingredients are wrong. Russian and Ukrainian foods don't use msg, red wine vinegar or brown sugar.

Sorry don't want to sound negative, but for someone who grew up on Borscht, this is not it.. I would hate for people to get the wrong impression when they first taste it.
Well Done Dwight!Oh, the Putin bit was pretty good. I just recently found out myself, and just thought I'd share some knowledge.What's funny is that I've always associated borscht with Poland, but before posting a comment I decided that I'd better be certain and check.  A quick skim of [the wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borscht), and the joke just kind of punched me in the face.  OP isn't wrong, I just thought it was funny.That looks like penne not egg noodles.I have the same slowcooker as you are, but one digit stopped working..

Borscht should be made with tomatoes as well, otherwise it is svekolnik (from Svekla - beet) - other beer soup with veggies.

I am going to give this recipe a try! I bought some MSG recently. Do you find that putting it in with the rest of your seasonings, or right before serving, is the better option with slow cookers?There's Russian and Ukrainian borscht. I have no idea what came first, but there's a distinct variety for each.3ish pounds of pork shoulder cut into 3-4 inch chunks dry run on top and bottom of the pieces. 1/2 bottle of liquid smoke (~1/4 cup) and a shot of bourbon. Cook on low for 10 hours. Makes the perfect pulled pork that tastes like you actually smoked it. Add whatever sauce you feel like. I love borscht but every time I make it I treat it like nitroglycerin.  If it slops on anything, it shall be stained foreverI married into a tight Polish-American family. Barszcz (borscht) is a staple during the winter ethnic holidays.

It's pretty cool actually. We celebrate all the holidays as any American family would, then we re-convene and celebrate the same holiday as an ethnic family would.

Same people. Different foods. Different customs, different conversations, different etiquette. I don't know of any health reason why you could not use it again. But I would probably throw it out or use it to make some rice.I'm the type of person that hates pickled beets, buts loves borscht. Not trying to start anything, but polish borscht is one of the most satisfying soups you can find. Soooooo good and warms up the very core of your soul. My dad referred to everything my mother cooked that he wasn't a fan of as "borscht." I never stopped to think about what it actually was lolHey Putin, borscht is actually Ukrainian.  You may have taken Crimea and Donetsk, but you can't have our beet stew.You have to cook it longer if you do it like that, that's why rouxs are superior even if you don't want to use proper nomenclature. The roux uses fat to cook the flour quickly.I do the same thing. Amazing flavor. cold sour cream in hot borscht! you can stir it in to make the texture creamier and the temperature acceptable for consumption. OR you can spoon off a little of the sour-cream along with the soup and get a fun surprise of creamy coldness in each mouthful.

also, rye bread goes super good with it!I've only ever had pickled beats, do real beets taste better? I want to try them, but don't want to waste my time/money if it's a vastly different flavor. That was a pretty ballsy move. I love beets, but I tend to be in the minority on that opinion where I come from. Looks great tho. I'm glad to hear it was a success.

I'm gonna give this a try soon if I can get my hands on some nice beets. I also like how you kept the ingredients in chunks. The few times I have had borscht it has been pureed. WHAT IS THIS EASTERN CRAP

Lexington-style is the one true barbecue.Now nothing in my house could possibly fulfill my appetite. God that sounds good. Beef Slowganoff?

Looks delicious!You've never been to Kansas City?after i reuse the frozen stock/broth for another batch, should i throw it out?Once beans are hydrated, it "wakes up" the germinating seed and will start to sprout. I don't about all these fancy words and technicalities, but when you do this to thicken sauces you are supposed to slowly bring it back to a boil while stirring it before you eat it otherwise you can taste the starch/flour....so you actually do cook it. Or...you should if you don't want it to taste crappy. I love white chicken chili!  Never made it in a crock pot before, please let us know how it turned out.

(The recipe I use is a bit different, no corn and adds heavy whipping cream and sour cream right as it's taken off the stove)

I'll have to give this one a try!

Why would the acid break it down that much better? There isn't a lot of contact between the soda and the inside of the meatI agree that dry-rubbed and smoked is superior (that tasty bark), but this is definitely the easiest method I have tried.  It is not too sweet and still quite tasty. Well you have to consider your audience.  People who regularly like to super-size a meal and drink an entire soda of that size probably like their meat that way.  If people are used to drinking soda, I'm sure its something they really like...the sweet, sweet meat...Never heard of borscht. Awesome! Low and slow, baby. Low and slow.Cool, thanks for the info :)Oklahoma Joe's FTW. Or Jack Stacks FTW. Or Gates FTW. Or Bryants FTW.


Damn we have some good BBQ here. I love white chicken chili. My wife hates it.

I might just have to make it again. Not to make her mad, but because it's so darn good. If you ever find yourself in Memphis, go to the original location Central BBQ (it's in Midtown by the Zoo). Best Memphis ribs ever.Gotta try this next week.  What kind of onions did you use and how did you cut them?Ahh okay, thanks :)Then why not say "Because the seared meat is nummy." It's more accurate.You and me both.I live in KC... I pine for Memphis dry rub ribs.I've not tried either recipe yet! They probably both work.No, because it doesn't fully saturate the meat and you don't pour it over the meat after it is shredded.

Personally I prefer fruit juice over soda. I usually put a good hearty rub on my meat, pour an orange/pineapple juice mixture in my crock pot, then place the meat in. Sure the rub mostly washes away on the sides and bottom, but it gets a good ratio of spices into the pot if nothing else.

I much prefer a juice/spice mixture to just dumping some bbq sauce in with the meat. You can always add bbq sauce when you serve, might as well get a different flavor profile on the meat when cooking.Chicken breast: 3-4 hours on low

Chicken thighs/dark meat can go up to 6-8. Yeah I don't really use a recipe for pork shoulders..just apple cider viegar, a little Texas Pete hot sauce, some crushed red pepper, some black pepper, and a pinch of salt.Yep! Sour cream is the usual condiment for borscht. I tend to stir it in.NC here as well - I put a half cup of apple cider vinegar, 1 can of Dr.Pepper, then some garlic salt/black pepper rub on the meat. Dee-licious! You can also add half a cup of BBQ sauce of your choice, it'll still turn out tasting like NC style BBQ.I'm with you. Once you develop a taste for the vinegary Carolina style its hard to go back to the overly sweet, syrupy varieties of BBQ. So good.Well that is very strange. I would have to guesses then.
1) Not hot enough
2) Bad beansMy first stop at a Tx BBQ joint left me completely confused. The menu said : Beef, chicken, sausage. Where the pulled pork?!I just made pulled pork last night! No added sugar and it was super delicious!

I cut a lemon into slices, placed it in the bottom of the crockpot with like 1/4c chicken broth. I rubbed the pork in a mixture of ground ginger, garlic powder, salt, and chili flakes. Left on low for 8-10 hours and it was amazing!How long in slow cooker on high or low?Same here.  Cup Or two of red wine vinegar and the pork in the slowcooker.  Not from the Carolinas but have always been partial to the east Carolina pork. I generally use root beer. I think it adds a really nice background flavor when you add a sweet BBQ sauce to it. Like others have said, you just cook the pork in the soda and then discard that liquid. I don't think it makes the pork taste sweet at all, though I've never done it with Coke; if you use root beer, the meat won't be sweet until you add sweet BBQ sauce to it. My pulled pork is literally carnitas with bbq sauce I've tried both, and it really depends on who I'm sharing it with. I personally prefer to use beer and a little bit of rum instead, but I'm also an alcoholic so I'm kind of an outlier.Late to the party, but this kicked ass.  I was worried the sriracha would be too hot, but it worked out perfectly.

Thanks for sharing!

If you don't cook the flour it's not a roux.Everyone that had some loved it!

Here's the recipe I used:
http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/109254/slow-cooker-borscht/

Main changes were:

- Added about 1/2 teaspoon of MSG (makes it more savory - great in all stews)
- Leaving out the tomatoes and tomato paste (I like my borscht more beet flavored)
- Extra beets (added a can of sliced beets to suppliment the fresh ones)
- Put the cabbage in from the start instead of waiting until the end
- Cooking on High for 5-ish hours instead of low so it would be ready by lunch time.I do think a lot of it has to be where you grew up. I live in KC and love BBQ. I've gone to other places through the country and anything is ever as good as home.Holding in the juices misnomer doesn't bother me at all.

Anything that keeps people searing meat.The recipe that you linked to says to fill the slow cooker with water while OP's link says to just put 6oz of BBQ sauce on them (which doesn't sound like enough to submerge them). Which would you recommend?Hello!  Former food science guy here.  The soda doesn't contain "ingredients that will begin to break down your meat."

This is right up there with people talking about how searing "holds in juices."Ha of course everyone has their preference. I've tried many types of BBQ, but having grown up near NC I'm partial to that style. My dad makes it nc style, with his own smoker too. Its to die for. It's probably the one meat I would never prepare in a crock potNothing is best in TX. No one wins there.Yes, which I why I corrected him in that thread the other day too.I lay down a raft of sliced onions, add a can of petite diced tomatoes, then the pork.  Let it go 8 hours.  The acid in the tomatoes helps to break down the meat; the tomatoey-ness won't clash with your barbeque sauce; the onions add moisture and glutemates for flavor.  After 8 hours, the onions are basically disintegrated. Then I add my bottled sauce and take off the lid until it reduces to my desired sauciness.yes, he wasDisagree.  TX BBQ is the best.Disagree. KC BBQ is the bestI guess this poster was wrong

http://reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2v97bh/pulled_beef_wow/cofshz2
That's what's up. When I was writing my comment above I thought /r/smoking might be cigarette enthusiasts or something.I use diet soda I find it cuts down on the sweetness. Also I rub my pork with garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper prior to pouring to soda on it. Honestly I've never really measured it. maybe 1/4-1/2 cup? Just enough so the pork is (almost covered) ~~covered~~ while in the bag. Worce about 6-8 dashes, its really up to how much you like the stuff though.Amen.As you can see from all the comments it depends on your personal taste. For me it does make it way too sweet.

I just cut up an onion, put it on bottom, put about a cup or so of apple cider vinegar in there (pork shoulders are fatty enough to not need much liquid), then put the pork on top after giving it a nice dry rub. Then about a half hour before I'm ready to eat it, I shred it, add a vinegar based bbq sauce, and let it marinate some more before eating.Well i don't think it's the carbonated water that's supposed to do it but rather the acid in Cola.Never use diet soda, it will not be edible.i use this, every time i slowcook pork...whether its for carnitas, or pulled pork......it adds enough citrus and a bit of smokiness.

http://c4.q-assets.com/images/products/p/khr/khr-1784b_1z.jpgI just cut up an onion, put it on bottom, put about a cup of apple cider vinegar in there (pork shoulders are fatty enough to not need much liquid), then put the pork on top after giving it a nice dry rub.I don't think so, but then I like sweet.

If I'm going for a more savory palette, I like braising in beer.  Works great in ghetto carnitas.Its just a cheap and easy way to get some sugars into the cooking process.Seriously... I have no idea how winter vegetables make it into Filipino dishes, but it's a must.how much vinegar and Worcestershire do you use? Aprox is ok, just trying to understand if it is 2tbps of vinegar or 4 cups... and then the Worce ratio. Can you provide me your recipe, pretty please? I need a fellow North Carolinian to trust! I'm not sure about it making the pork to sweet, but the soda isn't necessary at all.  I make a pork shoulder every week in the crock pot and I've never put any liquid in during the slow cook.  The rendered fat from the pork cooking is the best sauce for keeping the pork moist in my experience.  Why not just add club soda if it breaks it down? You could then save the juices without being too sweetI've always been skeptical about this too. I've cooked this recipe, but it hasn't turned out any more tender than the normal low and slow cooking. If coke was only used in this recipe to break down collagen, then why aren't we soaking brisket? &gt;sugar is one of the first ingredients in most of them

Sadly it's high fructose corn syrup for most of them.Not being negative, but /r/smoking is a great sub if anyone's looking for something like that.In my opinion NC style BBQ can't be beat! Love that stuff!I'd put money on this person living in Texas or another big BBQ state.  And therefore it's sacrilegious to not do it "low and slow" and my god it's like putting ketchup on a steak.. :P&gt;  All the soda does is introduce ingredients that will begin to break down your meat

Source?

Its the long cooking time that breaks down the collagen in the meat and makes it tender.I love to slow cook my potatoes with swiss chard, but lately I like to use some butternut squash.  But really, you should be making home-made chips. As with all things, it's a matter of personal taste. To answer your question directly, NO, the soda itself does not make the meat overly sweet, but YES, the barbecue sauce at the end abso*lutely* could.

  Not all sauces are created equal. Some are thinner and more vinegar-based, others might as well be smoky-red molasses (I think sugar is one of the first ingredients in most of them). Some people use a whole bottle of sauce on the final product, while others will add a little at a time until they are happy with how it tastes. Still others may leave the pork alone and let people decide how much sauce they want on their individual serving.

  People are all up in arms in this thread about "the way it SHOULD be done", but that's a garbage philosophy. Different strokes for different folks. The only absolute of cooking is that there are no absolutes! This is much better than adding crappy soda to it.#####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;__Roux__ /ru/ (also __rue__) is a substance created by cooking wheat [flour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour) and [fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat) (traditionally [butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter)) as the thickening agent.

&gt;A roux is used in three of the [mother sauces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_sauce) of [classical French cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_classique): [bchamel sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9chamel_sauce), [velout sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velout%C3%A9_sauce), and [espagnole sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espagnole_sauce).

&gt;[Clarified butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarified_butter), [vegetable oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil), bacon drippings or [lard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lard) are commonly used fats. It is used as a thickener for [gravy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravy), other [sauces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce), [soups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup) and [stews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew). It is typically made from equal parts of flour and fat by weight.  When used in Italian food, roux is traditionally equal parts of butter and flour.

This is a crock pot sub.  It's not the same method as smoking it.  I don't think I can explain it any further without sounding condescending.Well, I do add a teaspoon or two of flour/cornstarch to about a quarter cup of liquid, whisk, and reintroduce to the rest of it (to avoid clumping). It's making a sauce from a roux base, but in reverse. The dissolved fat already in the liquid from the pork fulfills a roux's fat requirement (it doesn't need to specifically be [butter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux)).

But yes, I see what you're saying. It's a sauce with a thickening agent added in after the fact.Cool, I'll have to try that next time I slow cook something with lots of drippings.Interesting! I'd love to try, any good recipes? Lamb is quite cheap where I live.Yes, a roux is really just a fancy word for a thickener.  The longer you cook your roux, the darker it gets and the less thickening power it has.  You'd probably want to make the roux then add it to the warm drippings slowly to thicken the drippings.Can you add the drippings to a roux?Use diet soda?The beans were well covered the entire time, I was using a smaller pot than the recipe suggests.I bought them from a bulk ingredient store about a month ago, I'm not sure how long they were in the store for before I bought them but I know they have fairly high stock turnover so I can't imagine it would have been too long. &gt; with instructions from a person in the Philippines

There are regional differences in cooking adobo and even differences between family recipes.

Carrots and potatoes? WTF kind of blasphemy is this. I may have to try it just to see the difference.I soaked them for around 12 hours overnight, and they swelled up but not to the point of being out of the water. Should I have waited for them to do so?I soaked them for around 12 hours overnight, then put them in the slow cooker where they spent another 10.5 hours.I'm just saying if we're talking about the way the pros do it, we're in the wrong sub.

Get a smoker and go to /r/smokedmeats or something.Which is why I said "most".Well no shit.&gt;That's how every decent barbecue place in the country does it.

They don't throw it in a crock pot either. They smoke it.
Not my kind of bbq. In east NC we use a vinegar based sauce that isn't sweet in the slightest. Some times you will have a sweet slaw and sometimes the slaw won't be very sweet either. But our sauce is never sweet.You don't reduce something into a roux. A roux is simply flour cooked in butter for a period of time, which usually becomes the basis for a sauce.The BBQ sauce you use will definitely make more of a difference than the soda you cook it in since it is drained later. Pick your usual BBQ that isn't too sweet and it won't be too sweet. You can also use the sauce sparingly since a lot of flavor comes from just cooking it. I use ginger ale instead of cola.  No risk of too sweet.Not at all too sweet. In fact, I'd go as far to say that it's the best way to make it IMO. This super bowl, I didnt make it for the first time in 5 years and I actually had people mad at me because they love it so much. If it were too sweet, I dont think I'd be having people clamouring for it.

Just to be safe though, I add vinegar to give some tang when I remove the soda and add the bbq sauceYou could use some dark beer too. One or two for the pork, one or two for you!Because I'm right and on the internet you have to listen to me!I've used soda in a slow cooker and pressure cooker with excellent results, the result flavor was not overtly sweet.Honestly, I just take the pork out of the wrapper, dry it off with a paper towel, and put it in the slowcooker.  Put the lid on, turn it to low and go to work.  I come home and add a trace of liquid smoke and pull while using the drippings to keep things moist.  If desired, I'll toss some into a hot cast iron skillet to get some "bark".

Then you can add whatever BBQ sauce you want.  I'm particularly fond of a mustard-based Carolina type BBQ.

I'm not a big fan of adding liquids to pulled pork.  I like the taste of the pork, not marinades or rubs....YMMV. :DAre you trying to start a slapfight here?

It's not like you're going to even be eating this pulled pork, so why is it so important to you what other people like?

And why do I have the feeling this whole thing is going to wind up with me putting you on ignore?You can also reduce the remaining liquid in a saucepan to a roux and store it for other meals, or to 'reintroduce' in condiment-sized portions when reheating the pulled pork leftovers. Extremely tasty and I don't feel like I'm being wasteful dumping it down my sink.If you pour a bottle of sweet baby rays into your finished pulled pork like most people here do, it's going to be too sweet.  I don't care if you drained the soda first or not.Depends, if you water a soda down to about half it's original strength, would you say it's too sweet?  Because by the time you're done cooking that's about the strength of the liquid - I typically start with 12oz of soda and end up with about 24oz of liquid at the end.

As for the BBQ sauce, they do make varieties that are significantly less sweet than what most people think of when they think BBQ sauce, but they may be hard (to impossible) to find depending on where you live.Because you're being a snob.

And let's just ignore the "it's not too sweet"  posts all over.  you say so so it **must** be true. /s

TL;DR  You might want to stop pointing your nose so far up.  You're going to drown if it rains.Why?  Have you ever had good pulled pork?  The shit that get posted on this sub would only taste good to a 5 year old with a sweet tooth.&gt; ost barbecue sauce it just as sweet as soda.

I nodded at that part, cringed at the rest.Old family recipe we use. Half a cup of soy sauce, one cup of vinegar and 3 cups of water. small container of pickling spice with lots of garlic.

Pork, chicken, whatever meat really. Lots of garlic to flavor.

served over rice its amazing.

I normally make about 6x this with a fistful of pickling spice in a seasoning pouch and 6 heads of garlic.

pepper is normally added in the bowel. I haven't tried bay leaves yet. It used to be made with brown sugar but we stopped that a while back.Do you put a lid on the tupperware? Also on the counter or in the fridge?Not when you throw in a 12oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce the way i do it.In a pinch I can just pour in equivalent of water and drop in a bullion cube.Personally I'm a fan of Garlic-Rosemary pulled pork.

Give it a rub with fresh rosemary, salt, pepper and cumin. Cut slits in the roast and insert slices of garlic all over. Marinade overnight in apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and a bit of olive oil.

Slow cook fat side up with all the marinading liquids, I usually throw a couple extra sprigs of rosemary in the juice too. The drippings make a delicious gravy afterwards, perfect for mashed potatoes.I only ever use vinegar..however I'm from NC so I think my taste buds are permanently attuned to that.Have you tried turning it off and back on again?You have to soak the beans. This happened to me the first time I made black bean soup. I was all, "Soak the beans? Ain't nobody got time fo dat." So then my soup took like forty hours to cook. Ever since, I'm a tried and true bean soaker, and my soups are perfect in a reasonable amount of time.Every time I make pulled pork everyone loves it.  I use the simple recipe where all I add is a sliced onion and cup of ginger ale.  Afterward I add in Sweet Baby Rays.
As others have said, you remove the juices afterward, and it isn't sweet at all.  Last time my wife used that to make a delicious french onion soup.Just recently I concocted a recipe for Superbowl and it came out amazing. I love mac and cheese and it was some of the best I've had.

I don't have it down to a science, but this is basically what I used.

* 1 small container of sour cream
* 1 can of cream of chicken
* 4 cups of Mexican shredded cheese
* 1 small can rotel
* 1 box of elbow macaroni cooked al dente
* 2-3 chicken breasts fully cooked, shredded, and seasoned

So for the chicken I made a big crockpot batch of taco chicken separately and beforehand (another recipe). I make the chicken and freeze into bags so I can make chicken tacos whenever I want. I had leftover and dumped about 2-3 breasts worth of the shredded chicken into the mac and cheese. Came out incredible. I haven't tried it without the chicken so you may need to tweak the recipe. I put the crockpot on low for 2 hours, stirring a few times. It will start burning after a while so once you hit the 2 hour mark keep an eye on it and drop to warm setting when you like the consistency.Well, Im speaking about the traditional recipes used here on Reddit.  I  typically use a rub for the pulled pork myself.  And then if I think it needs something, I add it at the end.  Most barbecue sauce it just as sweet as soda.  Pulled pork is much better if you just use a dry rub.  That's how every decent barbecue place in the country does it.  Sauce can be added to the sandwich if desired.Thanks! Going to find out tomorrow for lunch!!No! The grocery was out of all the cuts I wanted to use and the lamb was what was available.That's ok. I get into work at 6am and usually eat somewhere around 12-1pmWill do!
I never taste soda or any kind of sweet flavor. Just deliciously tender and juicy artery-clogging pork.Nope.  It really doesnt.  Typically the drippings are discarded and then you add bbq sauce and cook it more.  But I actually use the leftover juice a bit and mix it with bbq sauce and cook it down on the stove.  Its delicious.  And its not sweet at all.  Trust me, I totally understand why you would think it would be really sweet.  Its not.  Good to know. Thanks!A leg of lamb takes 2-3 hours to cook in the oven at 350F. Unless you have a tiny, deboned joint it's going to take at least that long in the slowcooker.Pinto do not. Don't chance it with other beans. Orange marinated lamb is huge where I live. You should try it, it's amazing. It's better to use an orange liqueour than plain orange juice in my opinion thoughI saw on cook's country they brine the dry beans. Basically let them sit in salt and water solution. I tried it once and it came out pretty well.Same here. That's too much soy sauce. No sugar, no ginger, but I do use bay leaf.PM me your address! It's only too sweet if you leave it in with the rest of the meat. Once your pork is done, toss the leftover cola and the drippings. All the soda does is introduce ingredients that will begin to break down your meat, leaving it tender.

Pull your pork, use your own sauce. You should be good to go.Thanks for this comment! Your recipe removes all the things I don't like (picky picky me). Sounds delicious! :)Alright, I'm back, so here's a rough outline of the recipe (sorry for the lack of formatting, I'm on mobile):

-one orange, quartered and sliced as thin as possible

-one cup water

-one half cup of sugar

-one half cup corn syrup*

-one quarter cup mint chiffonade (more or less to taste)

Put all ingredients, except mint, in small sauce pan. Simmer uncovered on medium low to medium heat until meat of orange slices has fallen off and the pith (white part) is translucent; ten to twenty minutes. Let cool until room temperature, check for desired consistency, adjusting by adding water or corn syrup and reheating, and stir in mint chiffonade.

*I'm pretty sure that's the right ratio of corn syrup, but I'm not entirely positive. Regardless, it should be close. Also good to note that leaving the pith will make the final product somewhat bitter, which may or may not be to your liking. If you're unhappy with this, then a sectioned orange and its zest could be substituted, I suppose. I ate a lot of beans growing up and my mom never soaked the beans. She always cooked with pinto beans. They were always fine so I don't get why beans need to be soaked. I think at most she would rinse and let them soak until her pot of water was boiling and then throw them into the boiling water. Do pinto beans not need to be soaked like other beans? not always. If you have to large a croakpot the liquid could be spread out so much that it does not cover the beans. You are right that normally this does not happen, but thought it should be something to look at.How old were the beans?

If you find some that have been lurking at the back of the cupboard for years, they might have reached the stage where they never cook.  They're best if they are less than a year old, in which case you can generally just chuck them in the slow cooker with enough water and they'll cook fine, no soaking required.  When they're too old, no amount of soaking is gonna rescue them.Soaking beans like this also mitigates the presence of phytic acid and other antinutrients in beans. Also, soaking reduces the amount of raffinose (which causes the err hmm musical effect of beans.)Yeah I think the main change I would make next time is taking the advice about the ratio of soy sauce and vinegar,  like others have pointed out. It was a bit a strong. I'll    mix around the other suggestions too,  thanks! Lots of soaking suggestions but I haven't found that to be necessary if you cook the beans in DISTILLED water. The minerals in water can fuck up the cooking of beans.

I've been able to cook black beans in four hours and garbanzo in six. That's with no soaking at a all and cooking them in the slow cooker on both low and high.When I soak beans they usually swell more than 2 inches in the bowl. Were your beans still submerged after the soak or did they grow so much the top layer was out of the water?Lives in the Philippines for a couple years. And you are correct, except some people would add the sugar. That was a personal tasteI also made this a couple weeks ago.  I love ginger, so this was fantastic for me.  For the average person I'd suggest cutting the ginger back by half (at least).  Also I would go with a closer to 50/50 vinegar and soy mix.  I think the sugar and bay leaf ad a nice texture.  While this may not be an authentic adobo, it sure was tasty.Adobo is an interesting beast.  I traveled a few of the islands of the Philippines for a few years, and every time I had Adobo it was different.  Sometimes it was a strong ginger and vinegar flavor.  Others were more sweet and sticky because of lots of sugar.
My favorite had a nice sticky and sweet sauce that contrasted very well with the vinegar and peppercorn flavors, and had very little ginger in it.
Tl: dr, there really is not right or wrong way to make adobo.  It's all preference as long as the base ingredients are similar.  [really?!](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-11044-Breaking-Bad-WHAT-gif-WAT-WOT-qP9W.gif)I'd say  no longer than 2-3 days, but I honestly don't know!I really like this idea, thanks. Dumb question: you've got to use them at that point, right? You couldn't just leave them soaking in water in the fridge for a while, could you? I'm sorry, I just have very little experience with dried beans haha!You don't even need to refrigerate! Just leave them, covered , on the counter. There's never a bag of bean in my pantry cause they go right into water!Not with a slow cooker but a few days ago I baked 4 chicken breasts with a tbsp or two of olive oil, I shredded the chicken in the ceramic dish and that soaked up most of the water and added back some of the flavor that rubbed off.I don't want to be one of "those" people but I made adobo with instructions from a person in the Philippines and it's a bit different and came out amazing.

* Carrots &amp; Potatoes
* No Ginger
* No Sugar
* 50/50 ratio of vinegar to soy sauce (also, they use cane vinegar which is more pungent than rice vinegar, if you can't find cane vinegar, use coconut vinegar)
* Pork belly

All this makes it a completely different dish. I tend to tout my version since it was absolutely one of the best things I've ever eaten. I think the secret was deglazing the pork belly with some beer.I'm actually down to do that. Filipino here:  I would never use this recipe.  Use a 50/50 mix of soy sauce and vinegar (1/3 cup each is fine).  Garlic, onions, black pepper are a must.  Type of chicken doesn't matter.  You can use pork too.

Never sugar, never tried ginger, and maybe 1/10 times I make this I use bay leaf.

Start there and modify next time you make.  My sister prefers more vinegar than soy sauce.  This recipe prefers more soy sauce than vinegar.  My wife can't get past the 50/50 mix.This is pretty much dried bean cooking protocol, i cant believe people don't do this.I would try adding more liquid and let sit somewhere cold, like a fridge, or if you live in the northern hemisphere, the garage or porch.  Let sit overnight or longer in the liquid.  Then cook again for at least 8 hours.  I have done this with bean soup and saved it.Make sure you are soaking your beans completely submerged. I tend to do it for a full day. Secondly don't add any salt until they are done cooking. It's a weird trait beans have. If you add salt too soon they simply don't cook right. Thirdly check the liquid level periodically and make sure your beans are covered fully until they are done. You can always reduce the liquid if needed.This is a great idea that I am stealing.Even in a larger crockpot the beans will spread out and so will the liquid. they should still be covered at the same proportion in any vessel. Could have been the salt content in the recipe, it makes beans stop cooking and can lead to odd bean textures if salt is added before they are cooked.I tried this same recipe a few weeks ago, but mine was just full of the ginger flavor. If I had to do it all over again, I would use less ginger, and maybe add another bay leaf or two.I love mint and and orange but I've never used orange juice in a slow cooker. Whatever you do please post an update to let us know how it goes.Even if OP is not interested, I'd like the marmalade recipe. Not too many people notice that!Orange and mint is such a good combo in my opinion. A quick Google search of Orange mint lamb gave lots of results. You could definitely braise the lamb in orange juice and use the liquid to make a sauce.

Alternatively, at work we make an orange mint marmalade for savory foods, but mainly cheese. That might be a good substitute for mint jelly in this case. Let me know if you're interested and I can give you a rough recipe (I'm not at work today). Eye of round roast holds up well.
Here's a [taco soup recipe](http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/16678/slow-cooker-taco-soup/?ast=taco%20soup&amp;asas=Mobile%20Home%20Page&amp;asat=Quick%20Search&amp;ase=event10,event8) to get you started with the ground beef, pretty easy and hard to mess up. Search that site for other slow cooker recipes, many good ones. Enjoy!I didn't have wine on hand, and a few recipes called for dark beer, which was easier and less expensive for me to get. It probably changes the taste a bit, but I'm not sure how. I've never knowingly had FOS with wine, so I don't know.Thanks, that was what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure because the ground beef is the only major source of fat in the recipe.The best mac n cheese I've ever had I made in a slow cooker. I like them creamy though, not crispy or together like baking often is used for. I likely could bake it too, it just is easier when I don't want to have to time it exactly right and grab it in a more forgiving time range.Definitely want to brown and drain the beef before adding, as with any ground beef in a soup.I wrap. I'm afraid if I cut the ribs, all the mojo will be lost. Pork spareribs?

Username checks out.I use onions, mushrooms, and carrots, sometimes asparagus. Don't really mess around with corn because it doesn't really have much as far as nutritional value goes. Why use beer instead of wine? Ive only ever made this kind of soup once admittedly but that called for wine.Anytime I work with any type of dried bean, as soon as they come home from the market they're rinsed, put in Tupperware, and covered with water. They can stay like this 1-2 days before draining and slow cooking. I never get undercooked beans anymore. Orange Juice and lamb? Quite a funky combo that one!

Do you have any beef, or even better lamb stock cubes?toss em, but they should have been soaked through. All I can think of is your crock pot is bigger then the recipe calls for and the beans were not completely covered.It came out super dry though I had plenty of liquids. I think my crockpot it reaching too high of a temp too quickly. . I cooked it on "low" for 8 hours. I also just made ribs for the first time ever in my slow cooker (first slow cooker recipe ever also) they turned out AMAZING. I feel yaYeah it can be really hard to find up north!  Sometimes you can find a bag of frozen sliced okra hiding amongst the peas and stuff.Sobey's carries it in Canada.. at least where I am.I had this happen once, also with baked beans, years ago. Still not sure why, but I've heard either too much acid or too much salt too early in the process can stop beans from cooking thoroughly. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to salvage them.If you send me a bottle of dat maple syrup..

I'll send you couple of bottles of Stubbs Was the cooker plugged in and turned on?was nice with black beans, corn and diced tomatoes, so goodI must be a mutant because I don't like Stubbs or Sweet Baby Ray's at all. :(Really appreciate that :) thanksThank you very much!Huh, my mom's ironing board has a row of mushrooms on it. I guess it's from the 1970s.I cut mine with stone ground mustard. It's the goods.The roast i did 2 days ago in the crock was a big steak, and it turned out great. It had 2 big sections of fat, so the meat didn't dry out in the crock and it was easy to pick out after it was cooked. http://www.foodsubs.com/Photos/chuckpotroast.jpg This is what mine looked like. Slow cooking is very forgiving, but I have had some dishes fail. Why was your roast a failure?My wife and I do slow cooker ribs all the time and they are amazing and tender. Literally wrap the ribs so the flat meaty side is against the wall of the slow cooker. Also when they are done pour more BBQ sauce on top and broil them quick. Crispy and tender and perfectI'm alive!Cooked for 5 hours,  came out really good! Had a pretty strong soy sauce and garlic flavor with a distinct cut of bay leaf in there. Lots of onions, but boy do I love me some sweet slow cooked onions.

Here's the recipe:

http://www.chow.com/recipes/30473-slow-cooker-chicken-adoboI stupidly did not take a picture before cooking* it, but will next time if I am in doubt. I will also look for fattier cuts.. plus aren't "roasts" supposed to be cylinder in shape? Mine looked like a big steak. Lol. It was an all around fail. I love vegetarian curries, pasta sauces, and soups in the crockpot. Desserts are also good in the slow cooker if you want to just pull something out of the fridge from last night and have a left over night but want something special to accompany it! (crisps, puddings, etc.)My only concern is that it would dry out and overcook much quicker with the lower volume. Perhaps on low and if you check it often to make sure it doesn't overcook? Stubb's &gt; Sweet Baby Ray's all day longI probably have a little more experience than you in slow cooking, but take what I say with a grain of salt. In my experiences, anything with a healthy amount of fat is good for making a pot roast. Big cuts that have a few big pieces of fat like chuck roast, bottom sirloin, and possibly round are all good. London broil and skirt steak are generally thin cuts, so I don't like them for pot roast, but they are great for chili. Last time I made pot roast (3 days ago) I didn't even look at the label, just the marbling on the meat.

If you upload a picture of the actual meat, we can probably tell you more. it's usually 160ish core temp for 10 minutes to safely kill all bacteria..


chances are it's okay, but certainly wouldn't call it safe, more borderline.It's also in Washington, DC (and Virginia &amp; Maryland).Meh BBQ sauce that people who only buy barbeque sauce from Walmart think is good.

It's not bad, but it's nothing special. Pork seems to do better when the long cook is in a thinner liquid (water, beer, [Dr. Pepper](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/yuqst/pulled_pork_using_dr_pepper_and_a_slow_cooker/)) then drained and add the barbeque sauce at the end.  I would guess that would be the same with the sweet Asian sauces.If the chicken didn't reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees, I wouldn't eat it. I only use a little. Can't imagine people using a whole damn bottle.Thanks!  I'm apparently spacially challenged, but don't think my question deserved downvotes!?!I'm off to find some purple potatoes!! Anything that tastes like bacon is a-ok in my cookbook!Cut them into 2 piece segments, rotate them up 90 degrees and place them in on the side that's been cutStubbs is amazing. Thanks! It was tossed with olive oil, a bit of minced garlic, salt and pepper to taste and cooked at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes.well....try eating it then?

if i dont hear from you in a couple hours i'll sound the alarmsSurprisingly it's not, it's all intact stillSame thing but now with better spelling! i feel like it would be reduced to textureless mush.....Cook for 10 min.

 2 tbl spoons liquid smoke

 2 tbl spoons brown sugar

 celery seed

 salt &amp; pepper

 2 tbl worcestershire sauce

 2 tsp spoons grape jelly

 14 oz ketchup

 1/2 cup water

 3 tbl spoons dry mustardMade this today... IMO  there's too much soy sauce, next time I'll try less soy sauce and more honeyCurly's is fantastic and also uses real sugar.I did. I cooked them stacked for half the cook time, turned them on their side, encircling my crock pot for the other half, and then finished them under the broiler. I was surprised and disappointed at how bad they turned out given how often I see wonderful, successful posts such as this one. I'll admit to still being confused. Can someone clearly define "side"?Recipe:

3-4 chicken breasts

2 cans, cream of chicken

3 cups of chicken broth

Garlic

1/4 stick of butter

Shit ton of Buffalo sauce

Onion (optional)

I served this over rice.
I use the "Good Eats" recipe, slow cook in the oven for a few hours in a foil package with juice and vinegar, take em out, add sauce, put under broiler.I always make my own simple BBQ sauce and never measure, so can't give an exact recipe, just ketchup, molasses, liquid smoke and something like Mrs. Dash, my friends and co-workers all really like it.  Only tip is more ketchup than molasses.No. I've just seen a few recipes for it online when looking for new slow cooker ideas. Wanted to try it out to compare to how I normally do it.I do enjoy stubbs a great deal. Did you put them under the broiler before eating them?  That made a big difference. I cut them in to segments,  but that should definitely also work. Stubb's makes decent BBQ sauce and uses actual sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.&gt; you just want to eat food you are used to sometimes.

yeah, most of my international travel has been aligned with heritage so I'm very lucky that even the strangest food doesn't seem too abnormal. but if you asked me to eat raw carrots/broccoli/ranch dip regularly I'd probably go batty :-)That's just how my family always made it, gave it a nice crisp top layer =p. I might have it once or twice a year these days.  The recipe says to cut the ribs into 2-rib segments. So I would deduce OP means put these segments onto their sides, rather than wrapping the whole rack around the inside of the pot.

EDIT: If you want to cook the whole rack without cutting it, you could just wrap the whole thing around the inside of the pot, [like this](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-baby-back-ribs/).Roasting pan?? For mac and cheese???? Get a Pot get anything its not a hard thing to make.I'm just gonna assume you're a subscriber there and ask you what is generally considered a good/great store bought sauce? I've made my own a number of times and prefer it, but sometimes I *just don't wanna*.Probably for the same reason I did it, no roasting pan available at the time and a good one wasn't in the budget.

I should probably remedy that situation.I'm guessing those are the downvoters. Ha. I cooked ribs for the first time not too long ago.

I removed the ribs and pures out the glop about 3 hours in. I only used dry rub while can owing.

Will mop Pwith BBQ sauce next time, but they came out nice and tasty. I was thinking like chicken or pork with some asian sauces like sweet and sour or just some different barbeque sauces Dude, if it was just me, that'd be every meal. Some people don't like bbq sauce to have any flavour besides sweet. It also tastes like pure sugar. I don't get the appeal.I found the recipe here: http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/223464/slow-cooked-white-chili/

I halved the recipe and decided to shred the chicken instead of cubing it. Only a few hours left and we'll see if it's any good! I was just about to poise the same question, glad I'm not the only one confused by this! I would highly recommend using a few already-written recipes to get comfortable with your slow cooker before just throwing stuff in. If your sauce has a high sugar content, and you're cooking on high for a long period of time it can be prone to burning.

What cuts of meat/sauces are you considering? If you can find a similar recipe, chances are it will work out fine.Thats good..Mac and cheese is so easy to make and so easy to make GREAT! Every other day seems like people try to crock pot it.I only tried it once.  The results was _okay_, but I doubt I'll do it again.Thanks for the reply, I am probably worried over nothing. CheersQuestion!! And I really hope it gets answered :) when the recipe states, "place ribs on their side in your slow cooker"... I feel so dumb that I need this to be explained. Do you cut them individually and put them on their side? Or wrap the whole rack around in the slow cooker. I want to try this tomorrow night! Thanks. I leave the lid on. I don't know the science behind it but they end up brown and tender, with a nice sweet taste, as if I had done it in a pan (or even better in my opinion). They do sit in some juice but the result is still amazing!They taste even better if you slow bleed the pigDo you leave the lid on or off? I know carmelizing  the onions requires taking all of the moisture out of them so I am worried about them sitting in their own juice and bit working their magic. mmm... gonna try this out.

Does anyone have good homemade BBQ sauce recipes? My mom has those same ceramic canisters!!!Why?Can I ask why for the love of good do people want to make mac and cheese in a slowcooker?Are you a Student?Nice!Did you create this recipe?I live here too...got mine at WalmartUsually I do 4-6 onions, but soup pan that I have doesn't have the widest bottom (I mean, I can do a pot roast in it) and I cook them on  low. So it usually takes me around 2 hours. But that's still really only enough soup for about 4 ish people.I really want to try this, those look amazing, and it will be a nice change up from all the soups I've been making.

Thanks for sharing! just a big heaping pile of meat. nothing else.I've been having some bad times w/ using BBQ sauce for ribs or Chicken Thighs. I always end up with a soup./r/bbq would like a word with you, /u/southernboy90walmart sells themPurple peppers are totally a thing! As are purple tomatoes, purple carrots, and even purple potatoes!

I made purple mashed potatoes once using just milk, butter, garlic, and some S&amp;P, and I swear they tasted like bacon. Mostly high fructose corn syrup. You can make your own BBQ sauce super easily! Keeps for a long time.Removing the lid releases very little heat. The crock and the stuff inside contain the majority. I stir and baste several times throughout the cooking. I've never an issue. Experiment and find what works best for you.

Through my own trials the only thing that makes a difference is salt content. If salt is needed, add it when served. Otherwise you risk making your ingredients dry despite being submerged in liquid. Even doing several onions at once, you're looking at about an hour. Onions caramelize at about the 45 minute mark.

I imagine it could take a couple hours if you were doing a ton of onion in a small pan, but I cannot imagine spending 2 hours caramelizing onions...People seem to love it but I think it's *way* too sweet. I hadn't seen a Safeway until I moved to Winnipeg. It seems to be more in Western Canada.I've started to see Sweet Baby Ray's sauce in Canadian grocery stores....What the heck is Safeway? I'm not even kidding. I'm in Ontario. It turned out just fine, it was only a few items that we above the broth.  My question we more generally speaking, should you ever stir your slow cooked meals, and if you do how should you compensate for the lost hear.The first and last time I made slow cooker ribs they turned out grease/fat covered. They were inedible. They come out much better for me using the oven.You can find it in Canada pretty easily, I would think. My local Safeways in Winnipeg stock it, and I've seen it in Fortino's when I'm visiting my parents in Oakville.one of the best sauces in the land

also amazon is amazing.

http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=sweet+baby+raysHow did it end up turning out?
I'm still very curious if there is a max time on each meal were you need to cap the cook time at.I use these guys for wraps. [Gem Wraps](http://www.newgemfoods.com/products/gemwraps.html) Supper helpful.I will do what I want. Seriously, fuck off with your bullshit. Basically, artificial sweeteners aren't like regular sugar when heated. Sugar caramelizes when heated. Artificial sweeteners begin to break down into other stuff that just doesn't really taste good.

It's not poisonous or anything, just isn't something that tastes remotely good. Yes you are entitled to your own opinion, but there is no need to be rude about other people's opinions because they differ from your own. Anytime there is sauce discussed on this subreddit it's ALWAYS Sweet Baby Ray's _____. I live in Canada, what the hell is this stuff?!Spring rolls are out for low carb. Just serve with vegetables (minus potatoes). Add fresh parsley to brighten up the roast.

/r/ketorecipes is a good place to startBut have you ever cooked anything before besides a bowl of cereal?I am entitled to my own opinion. So fuck off with your bullshit.I'd better upgrade from my old crock pot before they start background checks. Don't do it!!!

the defense rests.I know, right?  When I first heard that someone was killed by a cooking implement all I could think was "Please don't be a slowcooker."  Lo and behold, now people have more ammo for their prejudices and stereotypes.Politicking and slowcooking.... not even oncewhat about bacon? are kids into the adding of bacon scene? cook them onions in some bacon fat.

Did you try to search for "without evaporated milk"?

http://www.101cookingfortwo.com/easiest-and-greatest-crock-pot-creamy/Since you use a slowcook, don't use any liquid. It's only in the oven that it is necessary to add liquid to prevent burning. I've done plenty of roasts in the slow cook and I never added any liquid. I generally just put whole garlic or vegetables in the bottom of the slow cook. The meat will produce some liquid over time anyways and I hate having too must liquid in my food.Blue Sky drugs CanadaSo I went ahead and did it whole. It turned out way dry :[ something might be wrong with the heating in my crockpot or something, though. Bleh. Still going to eat it with sauce :PLettuce rolls, spring rolls.  Roast with veg.  Stir fry. Salad with beef. Soup.

That's all I have.  The America's Test Kitchen is incredible too:


Slow Cook French Onion Soup adapted from from Cook's Country (serves 6-8)

2 lbs. of beef bones (the bones I used weighed about 1 1/4 pounds)
4 Tbsp. unsalted butter
5 lbs. of yellow onions, sliced into 1/4 pieces
1 Tbsp.  brown sugar
1/2 tsp. dried thyme
5 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
3/4 cup apple butter
3/4 cup sherry
1/4 cup soy sauce
4 cups of beef stock
Salt &amp; pepper



You start the recipe by microwaving the beef bones on HIGH until they turn brown (it took 8  minutes).

While those are cooking, put the butter in the slow cooker and set it to high, and then start slicing those onions!

Once the onions are all sliced, add them to the slow cooker along with 2 teaspoons of salt, the brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of pepper, and the thyme.

Then it's time to add some unusual ingredients (unusual for French onion soup).

Mix together the flour, apple butter, sherry, and soy sauce until smooth (be patient and use a whisk). Then add the mixture to the onions and toss it all together.

Now, get those beef bones from the microwave and nestle them under the onions toward the outside edges of the slow cooker.

Put the cover on the slow cooker and cook the onions on high for 5-7 hours (the original recipe instructs you to cook the onions for 10-12 hours, but the onions turned soft and golden brown after about 5 1/2 hours in my mom's cooker).

To finish the soup, remove the bones. In a pot on the stove top (or in the microwave) bring the beef broth to a boil, and then add it to the slow cooker. Continue cooking the soup until you're ready to eat. We served this with some good chewy, crusty bread and salad. If you're a traditionalist, feel free to ladle the soup into bowls, top with a slice of bread and some Gruyere cheese, and melt the cheese under the broiler (just make sure your dishes are broiler safe.

 http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-slow-cooker-boeuf-bourguignon-recipes-from-the-kitchn-196361

This is what I'll be slow cooking, this saturday :-)Awesome, thanks. Will be trying soon!low on 6 hours.[Here's the recipe.](http://slowcookd.com/recipe/bbq-pork-loin-back-ribs/) My wife says it's the best thing I've ever cooked.It shouldn't be. But I would like to add in that I prefer Brandy in my recipe for French onion soup. I use about 50mL (one of those mini bottles) for four servings of soup (we don't really drink brandy, so it's easier than buying a whole bottle and measuring). Meh, even on the stovetop, you've got a minimum of 2 hours depending on how many onions you're caramelizing. If you're doing a LOT of soup, I can totally understand sticking it in the slow cooker.

I don't, because I want to eat it as soon as possible and NOT wait until the next day.How long?1/2 cup might not have enough moisture and could burn to the bottom of the crock. I'm not very familiar with porridge, but would it be acceptable to make a larger amount, store some in a refrigerator, and heat it up the next day in a microwave? Rice reheats fairly well.super! thanks!Makes sense--thanks!Suggestion was 10-12 on low, so I went the high end to be as tender as possible.  I guess I am not sure how people can stir when you cook something for that long.  I usually cook my meals over night so start it at 6:30-7:00 and it will be done in the morning, and I am asleep like 10:30 or 11:00 till then so I couldn't possibly stir it for the last 7--8 hours.I think it was simply a matter of not stirring it for 12 hours. The exposed food is probably dehydrated and easily burnt after that long. It probably isn't enough to make it any less tasty though! :)

I'm really not sure if that's an excess time or not. Would be curious if there was a suggested time limit for any reason. I made french onion soup last week and, same as you, didn't have any sherry around. What I did have was a part bottle of home-made mead that was left over from when we bottled up two weeks ago. So that got used instead.As someone in the same situation as OP "Local Cuisine" stops being local after about 6 months and you just want to eat food you are used to sometimes. yum, thanks for sharing. i'll check this out too.I would probably just makes the bean soup just like the recipe without the ground turkey in the crock pot because you have to put the beans in a blender after to puree it. I don't think ground turkey would be good pureed. So, I may just mix in the turkey with a bowl of the bean soup at the end and add greek yogurt/avocado on top of it. Would you prep it at all or just throw it in the mix at the start?Thanks! No, I froze the base, so after stage 3. Add the salt, let it cool down completely, and freeze it in a tupperware. I did freeze a bunch of bread slices too in a Ziploc bag because I can't go through them before it goes bad. This way as long as you have cheese in your fridge when you thaw the soup, you're good to go!This looks so good! And I love how Budgetbytes has the total cost and cost per serving on their recipes, it really helps as a student to know what I'm getting into!Yeah I figured I would have to freeze a few batches, so I wouldn't sicken myself of the same meal lol. Did you freeze it cheese n all? And it's so easy to make for such a tasty result! You get a lot of servings too. I had it once a day every day for a week and still froze 3 cups of it...I didn't have sherry or cognac, and beer was just easier to find. I've seen recipes that use either, but I've only tried it with beer (that I know of), so I'm not sure what the difference would be. Why did you choose beer instead of the more traditional sherry or cognac? Was it just what you had on hand, or does it make it tastier? Onions overnight and soup stage while at work all day actually seems really manageable to me. I like this setup. Properly caramelizing onions for French onion soup takes a long, long time, even on a stovetop. This looks delish. I'm going to have to try it!! no just taste, and I was not thinking when I was typing.
BUt, saying that salt can help in holding it together if you used a ton of salt. but then you would be trying to make jerky, in a slow cooker which is such a bad idea.Could just be a manufacturing defect. Can you take it back or at least compare to another unit? You really don't want food leaking into the main heating unit.No, I always treated it very carefully and never put any cold water into the hot pot or anything like that. I also noticed the pattern on the coating, but I don't know if it was like that since the start. I use water because I'm poor Have you dropped or bumped the pot? The coating on the ceramic appears to have crazed, and if the material underneath is porous, would explain the 'bleeding'. AFAIK the coating on the pot should be uniformly smooth, not crazed.Awesome! I do love Hoisin though.Recipe:

* 2 pounds stew beef (I picked up cube, chuck roast?)

* 1 large yellow onion, chopped.

* 1 red pepper, chopped.

* 1 orange pepper, chopped.

* 1 yellow pepper, chopped.

* 6 medium white potatoes (I used Eastern Potatoes) cut into bite sized pieces.

* 24 oz. tomato paste. I used 4 6 oz. cans.

* 1 1/2 Tbs. Curry Powder.

* 1/2 tsp. black pepper.

I dry brined the meat the night before hand. It's easy, tenderizes the meat since slow cookers can sometimes dry out beef, and makes it tastier. Not gonna go into much detail but www.amazingribs.com has a great write up on dry brining and I do it for all my meat now.

Mix all the ingredients and cook on high for 4-6 hours. This mother will be THICK! at the begining 'cause of all that tomato paste. I added everything in layers and had trouble mixing it without risking a big mess so I had to mix as it loosened up. At the end it's still a pretty thick stew, so if you want something thinner I'd recommend adding a cup of water or maybe beef stock.

I used my vegetable chopper to cut the vegetables so they were all uniform, which is what I like in my soups and stews. The potatoes I cut a little bigger.

As for curry, I just used a generic spice aisle brand. I'm sure there are people here who make their own, which I'll try one day.

Overall this stew was great! I did throw some salt in as it cooked, which I recommend.
How did you prepare the asparagus? It looks delicious.People have a wide variety of tastes and preferences in this world. What is gross to you may be delicious to someone else and what is mouth wateringly wonderful to you might very well be vomit inducing for someone else. There is no need to be rude about it. If it's not your cup of tea then move on to another post. This sub is about sharing recipes and experiences so that we can all learn from each other. It's a supportive community, not a negative one. Please bear that in mind when viewing posts here. It will make your experience and everyone else's better.When I do whole chicken's in the crockpot I'll add 4-6 cups of water to the post cook juices, add some onions, celery, and onion, let it cook on high for a few hours then strain and freeze. You have a delicious stock to use in future cooking. This looks so yummy, will definitely be making this. I'm currently paying 9000 a year for this knowledge, I thought I may as well put it to good use. thanks guysi it was beef stew left for nearly 5hours cooking turned out ok everything was cooked meat was okay, was a little bland but i think that was due to lack of herbs more than anything elseMe too. Still eat stuff like this, though, but I keep the door to the freezer open for a while while it's cooking.WooooNot cooking so long helps.; if I am going to be Late I reduce extra end the last of the cooking finish in warming setting


Also down Playing acids / vinegars Try with different onions next time. I like to use at least 3 different sorts.I cried a little thinking about that.Spices keep the meat strong? Saved. Favorited.

I've been making due with a more poor man's version.

1 large onion. Beef broth. Butter. Herbs of choice (I use Herbs de Provence, Parsley, and crushed Bay Leaves).

Cook down onions with spices and butter. Add broth. Add more butter. Simmer.

If I'm ever in the mood to treat myself I'll definitely give yours a go.Report back and say how it turned out. I think you will be fine however you do it.

Good luck! I have my fingers crossed for you too :DDid you ever have to pop a zit that had gotten red and sore?

Imagine that instead of a little dot of goo coming out of it, a pound of goo came out.

And instead of the zit being on your face it was in a rump roast.

And instead of knowing it was there because you saw the bump and could take care of it in the bathroom, it was a surprise and it exploded all over your cutting board.That's reallly good to know! I was kind of shocked at the price of red meat as I'm used to chicken breast which is typically like.. ~$6 for three breasts. I thought the shape of what I purchased was "off" as well. Now that Good Eats is on Netflix I should probably watch all episodes concerning meat cuts. :P thanks for the tip!Oh interesting. Meat cuts confuse me so much (nonetheless abbreviated meat cuts, lol) and since I go to a typical grocery store rather than a specialty meat place I'm always to nervous to ask questions. I'm going to try it in the crockpot without cubing. Fingers crossed it turns out okay! Thanks for the help [:Based on an episode of "Good Eats" and family word of mouth...With PotRoast it's just the cheapest cut of meat.commenting 2remember this 4dindinYes.
* Good -- time often means flavors get leeched out into the broth and wake up.
* Bad -- the long cook time means I can't eat it until tomorrow.Gravy?This is so far my favorite beef stew slow cooker recipe. It is seriously out of this world: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/10/slow-cooker-rosemary-garlic-beef-stew-slow-cooker/I don't see how your plan could go wrong. Worst case, you could cube it up and make a beef stew.

As per your cut of meat, I believe the 'CH' is for choice. So you have a cut of choice texas beef shoulder. Broil refers to exactly that, most times I have seen this cooked it gets broiled.  Thank you for your easy recipe! I put it all together just now, minus the okra because I couldn't find it in the store. This stuff must not be too common way up north, I don't think I have ever seen it.I believe the term for the blood-like fluid is sarcoplasm. Then myoglobin is the hemoglobin equivalent.Well yessir!  ...Yep, I think you've combined all the top-o-the list ingredients for the ultimate French Onion soup (which is a treat during the winter-time, btw)I'll PM you :) Me neither, its about to be 80 degrees (26.7 celcius) this weekend.

Beach weather in february? *Fuck yes.*I defer to your more accurate assessment. Jolly good.I love caramelized onions- i have meant to try it in the slowcooker.  Ill probably do a mass batch and freeze portions so i can make this soup on the fly. :) looks greatTo be completely honest, the first time I made FOS I caramelized the onions in a pan but wasn't too happy with it. They weren't caramelized enough to my taste, so I decided to look into a different method, and here you go! That's what they call me.Wow, you really took your parent's cooking advice as literal as possible.

Next time be sure to look at reputable recipe sites before jumping into a new type of cooking.You would waste the power on a crock pot for 10-12 hours instead of dirty a pan?

That is the kind of commitment to laziness I have only heard of in legend.Chicken breasts for 4 hours on low. But that's ONLY chicken breasts. I think it can help make the soup a bit thicker, but by adding it to the onions you also make sure it doesn't 'clog' together. I'm not exactly sure though, I'm only assuming from what I've seen on some recipesI haven't started experimenting with stews yet -- next on my list, the Irish stew, but I will for sure try yours right after. It sounds so good!I've been playing around with a french onion soup based beef stew crockpot recipe. This really helps me solidify what a good french onion base should look like. Thanks!

(So in my recipe, I'd do your first step, then during the second step I'd add less broth -- maybe half -- and beef, onions, carrots. 1 hour before serving, add a bag of frozen peas.)is that... good or bad?Flour thickens the soup.If you want you could make a gravy by taking the chicken out then whisking in a little flour until it is a good thickness. Or you could mix a little corn starch in a little *cold* water then throw that in for the last half hour to thicken it up.What's the flour do?The small ramequin pictured doesn't hold much, but I would say at least 6 regular sized bowls since there are 9 cups of liquid + the onions.Freeze it and use it in place of water next time you cook chicken.Step 1 caramelizes the onions, which you could do on high for about 4-6h, and then add the rest of the ingredients for another 3-4 hours on high. I just did it that way because I wasn't in a hurry. I think it is less about amount of liquid you use and just more about how you handle the final product.  Corned beef, for example. Cook in a lot of liquid to pull the salt out but then slice and serve. No shredding.Ill check tomorrow, they are probably under $20 with the lids. I only saw the small one with a lid. But I stacked them for the pic. Pans in my area GW are usually $2-5 and lids are $1-2. Im not looking to making any $. I think its awesome someone else loves the 70's stuff. Wifey made me stop buying after a lil bit to much Tupperware. But let me know what the most you would want to spend. Ill send the receipts so no worries.How many servings do you get out of that?ladies an gentlemen we have found the 24 hour soup!That's awesome! I would do the same thing. I would totally live in a Brady Bunch house!!That's gross...Ahoy hoy, fellow Oilers/Slowcooking fan!I make a very large batch so I can freeze it (with some raw broccoli and some turkey breast) for lunches through out the month.

I take 5 cups long gain brown rice, 11 cups water, and 5 tablespoons of chicken bullion, with a splash of olive oil. Then you cook it on high for 3 -5 hours stirring every hour after the first two. Then as soon as it looks fluffy turn it off. Don't do this.

http://science.howstuffworks.com/aluminum-foil-in-the-microwave.htmHow did it taste?Oh man, those are cute! They'd probably only be used as a decoration, but I'd love to have them! How much? I can send you a prepaid USPS shipping label if you have a printer and a box to throw them in!


Edit: Make sure you put the slash before the u/username too to link to the person! So wait, in step 1 you cook for 10-12 hours, then in step 3 you cook for an additional 6-8? So like, a total of 16-20 hours worth of cook time?Recipe for brown rice? Good to know! I usually add some red wine to my broth but could see the beer giving a better body. Will try this week!use a recipe, plain beef is plain, then it had nothing to cook in but what liquid was in the meat. the jelly stuff is GOOD, yeah it's odd to those not used to the kitchen, but good stock is thick like that when coldBut if your slowcooker is round, you can spin the lid and centrifugal force will give you a clear view for a moment without lifting the lid!In a spoiled Californian. I can't even imagine I'm an excitable boy.Ah, ok, though this seems a little weird - 2 hours to reduce on the stove? How much liquid did you have? 5 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar is almost nothing. I only added 150-200ml of chicken stock, and even that was too much in the end. In total, the meat juices, plus marinde run-off, plus chicken stock equalled about 1 litre of sauce. Pretty thick gravy type thing.

Perhaps your sauce for marinating was different? Mine was quite thick to begin with, so it wasn't like I was adding thin and liquidy soy sauce. It was a thick marinade.

I fished all veggies and meat out, and then reclaimed the gravy. I never reduced it.

I'll have to experiment with drumsticks next time, haven't been game enough to stray away from thighs yet.

So, things I'll change:
- Less liquid
- Less cooking time
- More veggies
- bigger veggie cuts
- smaller slices of meat (no shredding, just for something different)
- toasted sesame seeds
- kimchi[This Cornish hen dish](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cornish-Hen-in-Port-Wine-and-Fig-Preserves-51200420) is so perfect.  It is super easy, only has four ingredients (you can use any dark/rich kind of preserves - I used a 4-fruit blend of cherry, blackberry, currant and strawberry), it is unique, is the perfect blend of sweet and savory, and if you baste it it comes out a beautiful purple/red color.  Just make sure you buy the hen early enough to put it in the fridge to defrost for a couple days since they usually come frozen rock solid.Decribe it to me, I dont want to google it.I would get them in the freezer, especially since you used broth. A week is about the limit in the fridge.No, you can't taste the 'beer', but it does give the soup a richer taste.Depends on what you are making. Chicken can be done in a few hours, but you wouldn't want to eat it if it had been sitting out all day.I'm drooling over the pictureis the beer taste very prominent? I've always put meat on top .. either on top of veggies, or sometimes in the case of chicken, on top of tin foil balls to keep if out of the fat. Keep in mind, in this case, by time the veggies had rendered all of their liquid, the meat was pretty much covered.

I thought the meat was fine. It was tender and wasn't dried out. However, I probably would not have enjoyed the meat by itself. I quickly shredded it into bite sized chunks. returned it to the broth, and served it like stew ... at which point I was wishing I had had added some lentils, barley, or split peas to it at some point.Or a winter in Montreal --but you get the idea!Hey u/Calexandria, I found this at Good Will today. If your interested I can check on it tomorrow(if they are still there) they looked really clean. http://imgur.com/vZWXhyJI've made this with a similar recipe: sriracha sauce, bbq sauce, root beer/dr. pepper and hot and spicy taco seasoning. Just a footnote to this comment:

Don't wrap them in foil if you're putting them in the microwave. It should go without saying, but I figured I'd mention it as a precaution.Thanks for the answer.

Any reason not to just cover the whole roast with stock or something?Tried this recipe out tonight -- AWESOME. The Sriracha gives it a bit of a kick but not enough for it to be way too spicy. Thanks OP :DI always found it funny that hoisin sauce, which translates to seafood sauce, is almost never used on seafood.This sounds perfect for a chilly weekendHad this happen with some oxtail yesterday. I've never cooked it before and was really surprised at the amount of gel that came out of the bones. But.... I used caps lock... You should have known I was serious!also works well with Root Beer...&gt;  wrap the whole potato in foil and microwave for 5 min

Something tells me this is how you make a fire in your kitchen...Just wondering, why didn't you put the meat on the bottom. Also I haven't slow cooked much with chuck roast, what was the consistency like when you served it? Thanks.Did you accidentally put in jello instead of beef?

^^^^I ^^^^ask ^^^^because ^^^^I ^^^^may ^^^^have ^^^^done ^^^^something ^^^^like ^^^^that ^^^^beforeOops, I wasn't very clear. It took me 2 hours to reduce on the stove. This is already with the chicken stock and about half of the vinegar omitted. I marinated drumsticks, and they were fine. It was basically too watery and therefore bland. The skin comes out a little bit like this Chinese dish I really like where drumsticks/wings are basically boiled in soy sauce. The skin isn't browned first, but they absorb a tremendous amount of flavor. I prepped it the night before, so then it was ready by the time I got home from school! It fit perfectly with my schedule, but of course it's different for everyone. :)Well his user name is relevantYes, wrap the whole potato in foil and microwave for 5 min.  You will be shocked how good these turn out.Thank you!Looks like a lovely recipe, but I think I'd just caramelize the onions so I didn't add a 2nd day to the soup! :DFrozen, believe it or not. They come out better that way because they aren't over cooked. They don't get mushy or dry out. :( dat anxiety.I had been craving French Onion Soup but wasn't happy with the recipe I had, so I decided to mix a few of them (from here and the rest of the internet). I have a 4 quart slowcooker and it was FILLED by the end --just how I like it!

Ingredients

* 5 or 6 yellow onions, thinly sliced
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/3 cup butter
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 3 tbsp flour (optional)
* 1 cup of  dark beer (I used Guinness)
* 8 cups of beef broth
* 5-8 sprigs of fresh thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* salt to taste (I barely added any because my broth was not low-sodium)
* sourdough bread, cubed (or sliced)
* gruyere or swiss cheese, grated or sliced

Directions:

1. In your crockpot, place onions, butter, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, and garlic. Push all onions to the bottom so they don't burn on the sides and set on low for 10-12 hours (or overnight) or on high for 4-6 hours. I found this was the best way to caramelize the onions without having to dirty a pan. The smell is also amazing, so that helps.

2. Optional: Add the flour, and let set on low for 30min.

3. Add beef broth, beer, thyme, bay leaves, and pepper. Cook on low for 6-8hours or on high for 3-4 hours.

4. Taste, add salt if necessary. Pour in an oven-safe dish. Add cubed bread (I find it easier to eat than having to cut up the slice in the soup) and **cover** with cheese. Place in oven under the broiler until the cheese is bubbly and golden browned. Voil!

Edit: added approximate time on high.Real sugar caramelizes and the flavor develops.  I can't say what happens with artificial sweeteners, but since they are different chemically they don't just act like sugar when heat is applied.Still sounds like beef stew to me.

[And bell peppers do come in blue/violet.](http://images.dpchallenge.com/images_challenge/0-999/96/1200/Copyrighted_Image_Reuse_Prohibited_21115.jpg)That's awesome. I just ate more of the beef tonight and it was still really good. I just made a batch of Frank's pulled chicken and it is delish.  I may have to try a beef roast version now.Usual recipe. Chopped onion, can of Dr. Pepper, 3 garlic cloves, spices to taste, and a mixture of Sweet Baby Ray's with Hoisin sauce.I make these awesome tobasco panko breaded chicken bites and it uses the same sauce to dip them in. I'm really excited to try this now as my fiance loves those things but they are so time consuming to make, thank you so much! I've made baked potatoes like this before and they were great. The recipe I used was pork chops and gravy, then your foiled potatoes, then foiled corn on the cob. It was a great one pot meal.I roasted a whole chicken today on a bed of onions, with no liquid added and by the end of the 6 hours it was swimming in at least 2 cups of liquid - pretty amazing how much one chicken can produce while still staying incredibly tender and juicy.#####&amp;#009;

I use this slow cooker http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZI26C8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

I've done 72 hour short ribs and they were fine, my friend has a vacuum sealer that we used for that, but normally I just use a normal freezer bag and try to get all the air out by putting it under water.Steel cut oats are really good in the crock pot. [Alton Brown's Recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/overnight-oatmeal-recipe.html)You need to take the roast out of the plastic wrap / styrofoam first.Hahaha! Classic. I imagine for my purposes it will be more than enough, doubt I will need a circulator for quite some time.

Unless like all my hobbies I jump head first into it.I saw "horribly wrong" and thought either explosion or fire.

One meal getting screwed up sucks, but it's still usually a pretty successful way of cooking. Just got to try the recipe again!I think it depends on the cut. Some people swear by braising for long/slow cooks, so to them, water in the crock pot is essential.

When I roast in an oven, I more often than not do it dry (as long as the meat has plenty of fat to self-baste.

occasionally I do braise in an oven, but never cook "dry" in a slow cooker.A couple of things
- reduce on the stove! Using a slow cooker to reduce is not a great way to do it.
- I'm not adding chicken stock next time because there was enough liquid from the meat, but it definitely didn't come out watery for me. Did you marinate the chicken overnight? I mixed through some extra sauce at the end when I shredded the chicken.
- what meat did you use? I had skinless thighs. I imagine that, unless you brown thighs with skin, you're gonna have a bad time. Is that what happened? I believe the troubled mind behind Hemlock Grove had a similar acid trip.So nice,  you posted twice? I did the same thing! Tried to make pork and beans, like my dad used to make when I was a kid - the house always smelled fantastic. I literally threw diced pork and some cans of beans in, no spices. Turned it on in the morning, left for about 12 hours, came back to the most disgustingly overcooked mass of goo. It smelled terrible! Lesson learned...I do beef roasts in my crockpot and just use less liquid than I would for a pulled meat. Chalk it up to experience and learn from mistakes.  I'm kind of hungry for chicken and dumplings now!  Better luck next time for you.  That is one of the most comforting foods I enjoy, especially on a cold winter day.I think I'm going to just scoop out the biscuits. I mixed them up in there before I put it away in the fridge, but hopefully they've bobbed back up to the top.

I think I'm going to just pour whatever remaining chicken/sauce over some fresh-baked biscuits or puff pastry and call it a wash.

What I don't get is I made this exact dish a week ago. I think the issue is this time I went from warm to high to cook the biscuits instead of low to high like last week. I'm definitely going to try the Bisquick method next time.I would be more worried that your food was sitting out all day with no constant heat or refrigeration and that the meat is spoiled.the butcher told me to do a poke test, pretty much feel the roast you buy and look for any squishy or unusually hard spots. the abscesses are more common than you think, but good butchers know how to spot them.

funny thing was, while i was reading that post i had a pork roast in the crock pot &gt;&lt; Sucrose is regular, granulated sugar. Sucralose is the fake stuff.Sucrose is regular, granulated sugar. Sucralose is the fake stuff.Wow, that's kind of scary.i'm no chemist but this post explains it pretty well: http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2f4ayi/when_making_dr_pepper_pulled_pork_can_i_sub_diet/

just the way things break down.  i've never done it but i hear it results in a stinky black sludge. mmm. Ah. That explains it.  Use broth of some sort (probably vegetable or beef) and you'll have a fine roast.We just eat right out of the slow cooker. I made the big mistake of cooking meat in diet coke recently. Care to elaborate on why fake sugar, aspartame, sucrose are bad?I made a pot roasted lady minute, I thought, I'll make some baked potatoes to go with it. Wrapped two whole potatoes in foil, chucked them in, they cooked perfectly. But how can you serve anything without the matching bowls?  http://m.imgur.com/4W9kOv3
Probably 6 hours on high...Whoops you're right - one can of diced or crushed tomatoes go in at the beginning with all the spices.Absolutely. I make potatoes this way when I have a campfire going. They are commonly referred to as hobo potatoes. They cook a lot faster than eight hours. I usually add butter, onions, and garlic to them and just toss them in the coals. Maybe add a cob of corn (unpeeled) and some sort of mammal flesh on top of the grate. It's a quick and easy meal that really sticks to your ribs.

I know that's not entirely what you were asking, but the answer to your question is yes and that's why I know it will work.using water, to me, is a cardinal sin.  there's so many delicious liquids, why use *water*?! use beer (literally any beer), wine (red for red meats, white for white meats), beer or chicken broth, a can of soup, salsa, even the liquid from a can of corn, non-diet sodas. anything but water!

edit to add more liquids i'm thinking of: ever buy a jar of pepperoncinis? The remaining liquid makes delicious liquid to cook a chuck roast in (but is salty enough that no additional salt is needed).  i make crazy good carrot apple chicken with about 1-2 inches of apple juice in the bottom of your crock (can't contain any fake sugars/aspartame/sucrose).  pineapple juice also does magical things with pork.I made C&amp;D just last week for the first time and I read that a LOT of people had problems with the dough not cooking all the way.

So my recipe called for 1 can of torn up biscuits, to be added during the last hour of cooking. (Soup would cook for a total of 6 hours on High)

Instead, I cooked it for 3 hours on High, then added the biscuits, and cooked another 2.5 - 3 hours on High. This gave the biscuits plenty of time to cook, and I just stirred the soup about once/hour.

I was home and able to add the biscuits halfway through - but if I wasn't able to do that, I'd probably make the soup like normal, then transfer to a pot and boil the soup with biscuit pieces added so they'd cook faster.

I think if you were to cook the biscuits in the oven and then add them, they'd be too airy and fall apart in the soup - then you'd just have really thick chicken soup. Actually myoglobin is just the protein and its role is certainly not oxygenation of blood, that occurs at the lungs. The body has different oxygen-carrying proteins for different purposes. The most commonly known is probably haemoglobin, which is found within your red blood cells and transports the oxygen from your lungs to your muscle. When blood is said to be oxygenated, it means that a high proportion of the haemoglobin in the blood is currently bound to oxygen.

Myoglobin is another oxygen carrying protein, but this is only found within muscle cells(myo meaning muscle, globin being a family of proteins) and it acts as a store of oxygen as opposed to transporting it. This ensures that the muscle cells don't run out of oxygen and they can keep respiring.

You're right about the colour of myoglobin though, both it and haemoglobin contain iron pigments which gives the proteins (and muscle/blood) the red colour as well as allowing for binding oxygen. Also as an aside the brown colour you get when cooking meat is due to the iron as well, which reacts to change colour in the exact same process as the formation of rust.I don't flip it, but if it's looking particularly dry on top I might use a baster to add some liquid over top. Yeah, especially if you're cooking it dry. If I don't add liquid, there's always gelatinous fat in the crock pot after. It still happens when I cook with broth or another liquid, it's just less noticeable. It still tastes fine, you just have to scrape out the overcooked fat first. This might sound silly but... is there any tomato added to this? To make it saucy? Crushed tomatoes? I'd definitely try it again but add a nice helping of red wine in the slow cooker. Well, best of luck! Let me know how you like it! :)Thanks. To be honest, this is how I cook at home but am looking for new recipes for work. This will have to be a 'make it at home first' kind of deal.If you're not melding flavors, I'd look to just microwave them or boil them separately and mix them in prior to serving.Honestly, I didn't. I'm pretty comfortable with how I season things (and also very lazy) so I never bother dirtying my teaspoons. My best guess would be about  .5-1 tsp each to start, and then when I tasted it towards the end of cooking, another tsp or more of a few things like garlic and chili powder. Just play with it and don't be afraid to taste :)Tablespoons :)and now we see the issue, it would need some juice to keep it wet and juicy.

Also I would guess with no spices, all the meat just lost its strength and oozed away.What measurements did you yourself use for the spices? eehhhh, I mess with my stews and chilis all the time to stir it around and taste the seasoning. I'll frequently add more salt, pepper, spice, etc. while it is still cookingHmmm, this presents a bit of a timing challenge for a weeknight... I was hoping to set this up to cook after my lunch break so it will be ready for dinner. I'm not sure if it will keep on the auto "warm" setting, either. Anything I can do to make this work over 4 hours? For the Olive Oil, the "2 T"...is that tablespoons or teaspoons? I've done this when making pot roast. It kept the potatoes from getting overly mushy. Worked great.I would salvage the chicken stew base and remove and discard the biscuits.  They're only a couple bucks or less anyway.  I use Bisquick for dumplings and have never had a problem with them being mushy.  You can do the Bisquick dumplings in the crockpot too, on high, just before ready to serve (it takes about 20 minutes to cook them).I would remove the layer of biscuits and bake it on a sheet pan (better put a silicone mat or parchment under it so it doesn't weld to the pan). Then you can put it back on once it's cooked through.Yup, proper broth can look pretty gross when cooled, but it makes for great soups! Same with bone marrow I'm sure it would still have an awesome flavor! It'll just be closer to chili than soup :)i always use Mojo Criollo...its basically orange/lemon/garlic/onion....and its awesome

http://c4.q-assets.com/images/products/p/khr/khr-1784b_1z.jpgHuh, that's a cool idea.  I actually do some thing similar where I marinate chicken in a porter for a day or so.  I am gonna try this.Awesome - thanks.  I've been thinking of attempting to cook chicken some time in the next few weeks and I have no idea what I'm doing.  The crockpot seems the simplest way for me to go.Interesting.  Thanks.Either way will work. Just might take slightly longer from frozen. This recipe seems to imply cooking time for frozen though.Here's the recipe I've used a couple times really enjoy it. http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2h02uq/the_perfect_fall_curry_sweet_potatoes_chick_peas/I DID IT JUST TO SPITE YOU AND I REGRETTED ITReally?  Never heard of slow cooking with meat alone.  I guess it makes sense though since you can "slow cook" a roast in the oven with no liquid.It sounds kind of "normal" to me. Without a reference picture is hard to say.

Meat ooze liquid, lipids and collagen while cooking which forms a foamy/gelatinous substance. I never cooked meat by itself alone so my foam has some of the coloring from spices i added.

Meat could look grey if you cooked it for too little time, magic happens around 8 hours. So it could be that the crock pot you used failed and turned off while you were gone.

Sounds like a case of bad luck for your first time.You don't need to, technically, but it helps immensely. I think it was probably a combination of rendered fat and myoglobin, a mixture of water and protein that allows the muscle to oxygenate blood. It also gives red meat its color, so it is often mistaken for the "blood" in a rare steak. I think there was a TIL post about this not too long ago.Am I the only one who thinks it's normal to have this thick gel? Lots of good meats give off the gelatin from the tendons/marrow/etc depending on whether there's a bone in or not. I don't think you necessarily did anything wrong, just perhaps you were seeing meat be cooking for the first time.Exactly my thinking. When I make beef broth, it gets "gelatinous" but oh it's so good. We are eating animal parts here, people. It's not a soylent green wafer.Question - did you halve the recipe or something? The recipe calls for 1 lb of chicken breast, right?No, nothing.there was a post about that to WTF a year ago. a butcher came into the thread said it was not uncommon but experienced butchers know how to spot them and will toss the chunk. he did say they had a couple pass inspection and explode on the cutting table. he said it was gross....Couldn't tell you for sure.  I tend to dislike hoppy beers and wouldn't try it that way myself.  I actually learned to brew my own so that I could have less hoppy beers made exactly the way I wanted them.Indeed the easiest way is to foil em with salt, toss em on coals while making bbq or the oven, after that just cut it in quarters, some butter, grilled. Meat or bacon with cheese and your got a papa asada You don't really need to, meat's got plenty of water in it.Try a dark beer. I use my homebrewed mocha stout and it adds a great flavor that isn't sweet.TOO LATEDO NOT GOOGLE OR YOUTUBE THIS!Did you add water?Do you think something hoppy would carry through, or be overpowered by the flavor? just wondering, i think i'd sooner try a stout but an ipa might be interesting.At room temperature though? Seems fishy.I really like making sweet potato curry in mine. Chippah!Sounds like it cooked like meat cooks in a moist environments - oozes liquid and probably dissolved a lot of the collagen in the meat. Because it wasn't browned and probably had zero spices it would have just been grey. Then it looked gross and you let it cool before dumping it. The goop would have formed a gel like consum as it cooled. I had a similar experience after cooling home made stock for the first time. Never said anything about safety, you seem a bit obsessed with the topic.  Aluminum is reactive to acidic foods and can alter the taste.
From Reynolds own site:

Occasionally when aluminum foil comes in contact with a different metal or a food that is highly salted or acidic,
small pinholes are formed in the foil. This is a harmless reaction that does not affect the safety of the food. It is
difficult to predict, but may occur under the following conditions:

1. When aluminum and a dissimilar metal are in contact in the presence of moisture, an electrolytic reaction
may occur causing a breakdown of the aluminum. To avoid this use aluminum, glass, ceramic, plastic or paper
containers. Do not cover sterling silver, silver plate, stainless steel or iron utensils with aluminum foil.

2. A similar reaction may occur when salt, vinegar, highly acidic foods or highly spiced foods come in contact
with aluminum foil. The result of these reactions is a harmless aluminum salt. Some aluminum salts are used in
medicines to treat stomach disorders. The food can be safely eaten; however, the aluminum salt particles can
be removed from the food to improve the appearance of the food.Did you taste it first? Because it actually might have been delicious.I assume you used some kind of broth or liquid and not just the meat itself???4 hours on low does dry this recipe out, yesDid you put anything in with it? Or just the beef?don't have to go that far; setting macros to Carb/Fat/Protein = 40/40/30 should help.Just when you thought /r/slowcooking was safe to read while eating lunch!  LOLBoom. Sciencethanks poopface tomato nose*tsssssssssss*

Yeah maybe ya shoulda used Pepsi insteada Coke or sumthin!

*tsssssssssss*It's worked well for me. I am probably going to upgrade to an actual circulator soon but everything has turned out great. True circulators are under $200 now.Yum lolIn my copy of Slow Cooker Revolution they frequently suggest packing carrots and even chicken breasts in foil and resting it on top of the liquid to prevent overcooking. Wrapping the potatoes should work great. Make sure your foil packets have well crimped edges or some liquid will seep in. If you used pop, did you cook it in diet instead of regular? This myth has been widely debunked for decades. Breakdown of aluminum foil's structure through heating has been documented, but it's in such miniscule amounts that it poses no threat for the consumption of food cooked in or on foil.

  You'll hear it said that aluminum collects in your brain and bones, but that's not entirely true, as your body is amazing at eliminating small amounts of foreign substances with remarkable efficiency.

  Consider mercury, which can be far more harmful than aluminum (I've never heard of anyone getting aluminum poisoning). As long as you limit your intake of mercury by, say, not eating ten pounds of fish per day, there is no significant risk of it lodging in your body forever. It will eliminate as any other inorganic material would.

  You can find a slew of websites on both sides of the argument, but those who "fear the foil" also post things like the benefits of coffee enemas and the best kind of berries to realign your heart chakra.

  Tl;dr - cooking with aluminum foil is completely safe.What ya gonna pick? PUS POCKETS!I've tried a similar recipe in the past and definitely got better flavor from a heavy stout or a really malty lager than I did from cheap beer.  That being said, even the cheap beer was still pretty tasty.Never heard of aluminium leeching into food, I don't think it's possible or happens in any significant amount.

Edit: Also doesn't affect taste.Congealed fat was my guess too.
Sure, but try this, if you have a steamer basket use it instead of foil. if you want it out of the cooking liquid prop it up on a small bowl turned upside down in the slow cooker. Dude, do live in Kazakhstan or something?Try orange juice and cilantro with a pork shoulder. The best pulled carnitas you'll ever have. That's perfect!

Not a terrible price either, I'll just change the cooker I buy.

Thanks a ton!I think its worth a try! I used Yuengling both times I made it. I would say a decent enough amount that they type of beer would change how it tastes!Maybe it cooked and rendered the fat while you were away, and then turned off automatically or accidentally before you got home. When cooled, the rendered fat will congeal into a gelatinous mass like you describe. It wouldn't happen if the pot was still warm, though.The tastiest of sins.Yes, 8 hrs on low will be more than enough time at a high enough temp to cook a potato.I wouldn't want the aluminum to leech into the food, depending what you're cooking (anything acidic particularly).  You might try parchment paper.Also, black eyed peas, I make mine with a ham bone.Pump your brakes, Captain Condescension.I made this the other week and my god is it good. I altered it a little (added some chicken breasts, omitted the carrots, used a bag of frozen mixed veggies, used chicken broth as I had some on hand). I'm always looking for good, healthy food so this was right up my alley. Also, to note: using the chili powder realllyy makes this taste like a vegetarian chili (duh), so if you want to shy away from a predominantly chili taste, substitute that powder for something else.

http://skinnyms.com/skinny-slow-cooker-savory-superfood-soup/Is this worth doing if you can't blend at the end? Are you using whole potatoes or chunks? There are recipes out there for making baked potatoes in the slow cooker wrapped I'm foil so theoretically it can work. how much does the flavour of the beer come through? like is it worth trying a good stout v. an ipa v. some swill?Angels are over-hyped.

I had sex with one. It was mindbogglingly awesome without question. But not as good as I expected.

Overall 7/10, would bang an angel again.Maybe the roast had a hidden puss pocket that escaped when it was cooked?Toast it under the broiler for a few minutes to get a pseudo bark on there. It's not the same but adds some texture. Null argument. This has nothing to do with carbs. All else equal, eating the same roast without the fat will lead to less calories consumed, and therefore better for the waistline. Looks freakin delicious! Thanks!Looks really good! I liked the suggestion on the recipe that said to use the stew like a pot-pie filling.

What kind of ale did you use? Agreed, broccoli might be a more conventional choice. I think you're right on the money with 2 cloves.I see these at antique stores all the time.  Depending on where you go they can be ridiculously priced to relatively cheap.  Keep your eyes open.  I currently have 2 (nearly) complete sets.. I fear the day they will break.  By the way... when they do break it is awful, tiny slivers of white glass everywhere!I have a roommate that opens my slowcooker AND my oven when their in use. I die a little each time :(I was thinking broccoli, but I can see spinach working well, too. I am going to bookmark this recipe and try the garlic. 2 cloves sounds like it should do the trick. "Because the meal isn't over when I'm full, the meal is over when I hate myself." -Louis CK

Why the high cook time? Does the chicken come out rubbery or does it dry out? Nothing. Just let the meat render down to create the juice. My fear was dryness, but by the end of the cook, there was liquid halfway up the chuck by the end. It is really yummy!


**Ingredients:**

32 oz chicken broth ( or veggie broth to make vegetarian friendly)

12 oz beer

1 cup of carrots, finely diced or shredded

1/2 cup celery, finely diced

1 cup onion finely diced

2-3 cloves of garlic, minced

1 tsp salt

1/2 tsp pepper

1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

3 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

1/2 cup heavy cream

1/4 cup cornstarch

**Directions:**

1. Place all chicken broth, beer, carrots, celery, onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper into your crockpot. Cover and cook on LOW for 6-8 hours.

2. Once time is up, remove lid and stir in shredded cheese, and heavy cream. Stir until cheese is melted. Next whisk in cornstarch. Recover and cook for 10-15 minutes longer.

3. For a smooth soup (which we prefer for this soup), use an blend soup in batches, or use an immersion blender before serving.

I got the recipe from [This](http://www.familyfreshmeals.com/2014/01/crockpot-beer-cheese-soup.html#_a5y_p=1270569) website. Its really good!Just finished making this. I would not recommend the recipe (maybe with some major tweaks). My whole pot came out super watery and bland!

EDIT: I ended up cooking this for 8 hours on low, then taking everything out to reduce the sauce. I probably spent 2 hours doing that. If I were to do this again, I would trim the meat of all the excess fat and skin, and add more vegetables. I used 3 carrots to begin with. I would probably make it 5-6 big carrots, add a whole (small) cabbage, and MAYBE reduce the amount of onions to just 1.I've made a great vegetable soup a few times. My other go to is a marinara sauce. No meat needed. You are correct. The can of sugar water is for flavor, nothing more. http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/health/low-carb-vs-low-fat-diet.html?_r=0&amp;referrer=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/health/low-carb-vs-low-fat-diet.html?_r=0&amp;referrer=I'm glad your degree keeps you from keeping up with current studies!

Source? I can't imagine that ~10 minutes of fizzy, if that, would do anything. The tenderizing comes from the long cooking time and the collagen breaking down.Dump a jar of coconut oil in on low for 30 mins.  Warm lube.I used to not want to use soda because I was afraid of the sweetness.  Now I *really* don't want to use it.  One of my biggest problems with slowcooked pulled pork versus smoked it that the texture is so mushy.On kiwis? for real?I have a Dorkfood temperature controller for my slow cooker. It only works for manual models. It works by cutting the power to keep the temp at what you set.Chicken plus onion soup mix plus cream of mushroom soup&gt; food for thought.

HehThat's.... Probably a pretty great point, actuallyMind.Blown.

The skins are the best part!! Rub 'em down with some sea salt and olive oil and they are freaking delicious! My whole family eats the skins (except for my little sister, but she's just odd).

But we also eat the skins on kiwis, which I KNOW most people don't. I guess we're the odd balls. Same here, I sometimes just use the "it wont cook right" excuse because I'm so damn bothered that she can't keep the lid on. I think part of it is the fact that I took the time to prepare this meal and it's ready when I say it is, not to mention that she could just as easily learn to cook things in the crockpot but instead she just stares at it like it's magic.....I can polish off way the hell more than my TDEE without feeling sick.  I've never been a fat person, but if I had no concept of nutrition and just ate however much I felt like eating, I feel like I might end up kinda fat.There are mixed reviews, but I would say most don'tPeople don't eat baked potato skins?The lids get all full of condensation and you can't see the beauty of the food correctly!!This sounds delightful. I've been craving black bean soup for a few days and this is EXACTLY what I was wanting. Heh. Hello, r/keto.This is true in most study's I've read as it's the most popular option among test groups. I have believed this for the longest time as well. There's some study's I've read though that conclude that the hormonal response from fat consumption can lead to a longer sense of satiety. Don't know how that compares to the initial feeling from protein, but it's food for thought. I can dig up the paper when I'm not on mobile.But, let's not forget that OP's roast is sitting in Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure any of this matters, once you pour corn syrup over the thing.Maybe not much,  but I haven't seen any from the "fat makes you skinny"  side of things. Protein gives the most satiety, and fat has more than twice the calories per gram as protein.Actually, there is. There's a lot of fuss lately over the carbs vs fats argument, but the fact of the matter is that gram for gram, fats have the highest calories. Considering protein has the highest satiety of the macronutrients, trimming fat off of meat to cut back calories is some pretty sage advice.

Now, you can totally be like me and not care because flavor means to much to you :PBut don't they feel sick? I always assumed fatter people just didn't feel "full" till after they'd exceeded their needed calories, or just never excercised in any way.Uh... Gluttony?What did you use as the liquid for your recipe?Just made this overnight -- I'll be having it for dinner and it smells delicious!

http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/vegetable-chickpea-curry... why not? that's clearly when you're done?You can do what you like with the chicken thighs - if you've got skins, perhaps you should give them a fry before you pop them into the slow cooker to get some chicken skin flavours into the whole thing.

Love chicken thighs!Fat doesn't run into meat.

http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/mythbusting_fat_caps.htmlA little late to the game,  but [this is delicious](http://m.campbellskitchen.com/recipes/slow-cooker-chicken,-broccoli-rice-25994?utm_referrer=direct%2Fnot%20provided). We over at /r/keto would disagree.If it runs into the meat it's there.... things don't vanish into thin air.And ~5ml love juice as an aphrodisiac. Have you watched Louis C.K's bit about overusing superlative words? Cause I think this is a textbook example.

Absolutely = without exception; completely; wholly; entirely

delicious = Very pleasant; delightful

In other words, you were expecting something more than "completely full of delight"... that would be what, sex with an angel??Long enough for the meat to reach your desired temperature minus three to five degrees (for carryover).You don't have to use soda, fizzy booze works wonders. Cider, Guinness, ale, etc.Try hard cider next time (for pork, not beef).so... cut carbs?

Check this link out, a lot of the recipes aren't vegetarian, but there are a ton of great looking recipes.  I think they mean dried vs fresh. You can use fresh herbs, but they'll taste different and you would need different quantities. Not sure on the tomatos, probably since it's easier and there is a different taste to it, it's winter and tomatos may be out of season. Garlic is in your vegetable section of the grocery store, probably near the onions. You can buy cloves and cut them up yourself, or get jars of it pre-minced.That delicious, tasty food. The food that makes you sit back in your chair and think to yourself "I'm not stopping until I can't eat any more"I think everyone needs to remember what the soda *does* in the BBQ Pulled Pork recipe. The carbonation softens the tissues. It doesn't really flavor the meat. I've found that getting a little creative with the seasonings and sauce is best. Use a bold-tasting sauce (or make your own). A little spice helps offset any sweetness, too.

Also, whatever you use for soda make sure it's real sugar, not corn syrup!For the love of everything what is that? I must have the recipe. You make your grandmother very sad.Actually, just checked.  That time is for medium or high.  Have to admit, I've never used the Low setting (it's a Ninja cooker).  Maybe add extra 30-60 min. for minimum time to get to the "target" zone?that titleI just made the Dr. Pepper pulled pork tonight.  To be honest, I expected something more... I'm not sure what I expected, but with all the fuss about Dr. Pepper, I thought it would taste out of this world!

It was absolutely delicious though...I rarely cook that well, and meat of any variety or preparation is always a good time for me.

I'll have to try yourFranks Red Hot dry rub recipe!One year we stayed in and made a roast chicken dinner complete with potatoes, carrots and gravy straight from the slow cooker. We shared a bottle of wine and it turned out pretty well :)Mixed it all up, but forgot to take a picture of it before I plated it up. [Here's an action shot](http://i.imgur.com/KPeil2d.png) right before I ate a bit!

It was friggin' delicious! I threw a bit of fresh cracked pepper on top. I think next time I'll add a bit of minced garlic into the mix; it's great, but I feel that garlic will bring it to the next level.

Edit: Weirdly, I think Spinach might work well in this. Might try that next time as well.-2# butter

Cook low and slow for 18 hours.  Serve.  Propose.I normally flip every hour.&gt; around 2.5-3 hrs or so

On Low?
Can't blame the food for that though!Beer cheese soup! I'm not sure I even got the sweetness from the soda. It was just kind of bland shredded pork. Not a bad thing, but not the same stuff I had done all summer in my smoker.

As for the beef. I'm really pleased with the finished product. Has a nice spice to the finish and all of the liquid rendered down from the meat, not added in. Had I know it would have tasted so good, I would have done a better job documenting my process.

Can't wait to see your effort posted!True. But depending on who you're talking to you'd be better off getting rid of high GI foods. Fat is very calorie dense, though, so there's that.I'll add ground turkey into it for a protein packed gym meal. I didn't care for the Dr. P sweetness when I made the pulled pork.  I substituted Ginger ale, and II felt it really let the meat and sauce shine through, might help.  I will try but I want to try your recipe though next time I do Beef.Looks good! I'm making this for the second time today. The first it went way too quicklyIf you stop eating at satiation...a lot of people don't I am! I just started it shortly before I posted that. I have about 2 hours left. I just snapped [a picture of it](http://i.imgur.com/IhcbGVz.jpg) in the crock pot. Sorry about the picture quality; it actually looks pretty decent and smells VERY good. I'll be shredding the chicken in about an hour, and another hour after that. Then just some rotini and I eat!

I also like to make super large batches of beans and rice to freeze for later meals/side dishes. Eating fiber makes you more satiated.The fat usually melts quite a bit so you aren't eating it, it is juiced into the less fatty parts.Are you still cooking it??! How is it?! Thanks!This message sponsored by Adderall^tm.At least baste that mofo
I had no idea what this was in response to at first, haha.

That's totally fair though. In retrospect, the severity doesn't really seem like it matters a great deal - food poisoning is food poisoningAnd the result?Green lentils get really soggy for me. I've heard red ones hold up better but haven't tried them (they're not stocked at the store).Wife's mother had a saying, "if it tastes good, spit it out, it's bad for you."Eating fat makes you satiated. Therefore eating less calories in the long run.Based on this it looks like OP needs to leave it in for the full 8 hours. "High" or "low" apparently only affects the first few hours. Once it's all hot, the cooking rate is the same between the two.Cutting the bulk of that fat out will reduce the calories per serving.I've had gastro and had to put on a drip and lose continency for a couple of days, both ends, and I've had food poisoning that's just the world falling out of your arse a few hours after you eat, then you're fine again, no harm done.

It may depend on the particular pathogen.Sounds great I'm gonna try it, thanks!Etsy has a lot, too. This is great everyone, thanks! I'll have to try every single one of these and report back!Scientifically speaking,  if you start it fat up the fat will baste the meat as it cooks. However, the lower half will be more well done. So by flipping twice, fat to non to fat, you allow equal cooking time and allover basting. Think rotisserie chicken. That said, the difference is fairly minimal with most size cuts. I think the answer is all personal preference though. There really isn't a way to screw it up; there are a dozen differing answers in this thread but everyone is unanimous in saying it turns out delicious whether you flip it, pre cut it, remove the fat, don't remove the fat, etc. Wait... sorry. didn't realize I was in r/slowcooking. Please ignore, unless you want to try it.Ranch Chicken

If it's a Dr. Pepper type stock, I don't think health is primarily on OPs mind.I did chicken breasts with soy, ketchup, honey, paprika, garlic, and a dash of liquid smoke yesterday. I did them on high for three hours and they were a little overdone, but I think 2 on high or 3:30 on low would be pretty good. The flavor was great. Salsa chicken, honey garlic chicken, lemon garlic, white chicken chili, chicken burrito bowls. The possibilities are endless. I almost always flip, hasn't given me any trouble except with the ribs that were falling apart.Google lentil recipes. I never make lentils in the slow cooker but I'm sure you could and they're so versatile That's already in my rotation. Basically a normal chili recipe (or white chili recipe) but minus the meat.

Stir, and put on low until it's done.I love this question and really hope someone answers that is not just stating a personal preference.Yeah, that's what I love about slow cookers, it's hard to screw things up.I flip because the part below the liquid line is going to be cooking faster due to the greater thermal conductivity of the ~~fluid~~ liquid (EDIT:gasses are also fluids)./r/theydidthemonstermathPlease do and pics if you can!

I wonder if I could do a sous vide using that...http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2dhk8g/pepperoncini_chicken/

One of my favorite recipes. I posted it here a few months ago.I made this tonight. Thanks for the inspiration and idea!

I only added one soup can of water ... and still feel like I could have gone entirely without it consistency-wise. Volume-wise, it was about right.

Kids enjoyed it (three of them). My picky-eater barely complained, and even gave the carrot and mushroom a taste-test (probably because she's grounded from her phone and is doing anything she can think of to get it back) ... but still declined eating them. They all enjoyed the gravy/broth and meat, but who doesn't?

At 8am, I seared the chuck with just salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Added 2 quartered onions to the crock, the carrots, whole small red potatoes ... and some left over celery. Meat on top.

Mixed the soups and a can of water, mixed in an entire head of garlic cloves, and poured over meat. Realized as I saw the bits of mushrooms I completely forgot the fresh mushrooms. Had to quarter them because they were huge ...

Lifted the meat and spread out the mushrooms and barely had room in the crock. Meat was touching the lid in some places. Around 11am, it had receded.

Around 4pm the liquid had risen to just below the lid.

Plated at 6:50, cooled enough to eat by 7.

Delicious!

... and four 1.5cup meals saved for during the week!Just like a Jean-Ralphio rap!

Actually, I picked up a pie pan and 9"x9"x2" dish yesterday too! $7 for both! Stupid question but I've only cooked chicken a couple of times in my entire life (and I'm 41!) - do you put the breasts in the crock pot frozen, or do you thaw them first?

With the slow cooker there is no wrong answer!I got the Hamilton Beach Set 'N Forget slow cooker for around $40 at Best Buy and it is fantastic. I think it is a 6 quart slow cooker. You can set it to cook for up to 14 hours and when it finishes it goes into "keep warm" mode until you get there (or 14 hours has passed, then it turns off automatically). The settings on it are high, low, warm, and thermometer. It comes with a meat thermometer so you can tell it to cook for a certain amount of time once the thermometer reaches a certain temp&gt;Bad for taste, good for the waist~~line.~~

Just about nailed itGirrrrl, get with the cult of pyrex. This set was from Sears, even. Called merry mushroom.
It is my vintage canister holy grail. I have so much jealousy. LolNatural fats and fat from meat are not necessarily unhealthy, just eat it in moderation and you will be finedepends on how healthy you want to be. i'm lazy and think fat is tasty so i keep itAh...gotcha.  I was wondering if it made the protein cook up differently or something.  I dig the tea ball idea as well!The high/low setting on slow cookers is kind of deceiving because they both reach the same temperature, high just gets there faster than low. 8 hours on low is about the same as 4 hours on high, so you may be good after 2 hours on high, but it depends on the cut and weight of the meat. Here's a handy reference chart for converting times.

High | Low
----|---
3 hrs | 7 hrs
4 | 8
5 | 9
6 | 10
7 | 11
8 | 12I don't like the texture of fat AT ALL, but I always cut it off after cooking. Still get all the flavor cooked into the meat, and it's easier to cut off imo.Except, as far as I know, there hasn't been much recent evidence supporting the "fat makes you fat" movement in nutrition science.

And yes, I'm super fucking fun at parties.I flip, but I leave the fat on until the end and remove it during the shredding process. Leaves richness and moisture but you don't have to actually chew it./r/theydidthemathDefinitely making this. Looks delicious!Leave it. Perhaps baste with a ladle a few times if you're worried?My friend Lynn's Amazing Chicken

sprinkle both sides of chicken breasts liberally with chile powder. Wrap breast with bacon (I use 2-3 slices). Sprinkle both sides with brown sugar. Bake at 350 F for 1 hour. Turn breasts over after 30 minutes.

Coat chicken breasts in flour, season with seasoned salt. Cover with chicken broth (I use around 4 cups). Sprinkle generously with tarragon. Bake at 350 F for 1 hour. Serve with rice.I've make something similar (not slow cooked though) and I tend to use the garlic and herbs philly instead. Or if you can't get hold of it just add heaps of garlic with basil, oregano etc. I cannot think of a more accurate response that I've read on reddit today.&gt; I could quickly duck into the corner bodega where I got the first bottle and just get a second bottle...

I was looking at Corelle dinnerware recently, too. I thought [this pattern](http://www.amazon.com/Corelle-Contours-16-Piece-Dinnerware-Service/dp/B00352KSWA) was kind of a retro nod.How much basil? Well, that escalated quickly. Bad for taste, good for the waistline. Wow.  I always cut the fat off.  Is that bad?Mine came with the manual! Autoshift is 1 3/4 hours on high and then it automatically switches to low. Thanks for the feedback. Yeah, I meant "splash of red wine *vinegar*" there. Unfortunately I dumped the whole bottle of wine in the crockpot so there won't be any pairing happening, but I took a few swigs before throwing it in.

Actually, I could quickly duck into the corner bodega where I got the first bottle and just get a second bottle... Thanks for the idea!

Next time I'll brown that shit. Love me some maillard.My rule with slow cooking is don't touch the lid until it's done: no poking, smelling, flipping, nothing.  Just leave it be.I do see what you're saying, but the heat lost due to opening the lid doesn't reduce the cooking time by very much. Most of the heat is contained in the liquid and solids. Because meat and veggies are mostly water (muscle is 79% water, carrots are 87% water), we'll approximate that the contents are 3 quarts of water (75% full crockpot), multiplied by a percentage that detracts due to the difference in specific heat between water and protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

Convert 3 quarts to liters: 2.84 liters

Mass of 2.84 liters: 2.84 kg

Specific heat difference multiplier (rough): 90%

Mass of contents * multiplier: 2.56 kg

Volume of air: 0.95 liters

Specific heat of water: 4.184 kJ/kg *C

Enthalpy of vaporization (water): 2,260 kJ/kg

kg of water vapor in 0.95 liters of steam: 0.000558

Heat required to vaporize 0.000558 kg of H2O: 1.26 kJ

Heat lost from contents: 1.26kJ

Net temperature change of contents: 0.117 *C

Even if the contents have much higher amounts of lower specific heat stuff, a 50% difference only yields a 0.21 *C change in content temperature. Definitely hot enough to continue cooking, if they were near boiling before.

We also need to include the steam lost while the lid is open. Assuming (there's that darn word again) that we lose 0.2 volumes of steam per second the lid is open, 20 seconds results in 4 volumes of steam leaving. Yikes! That's gonna take quite a bit of energy. We've already calculated how much heat is lost due to a volume of steam leaving, and how much the temperature changes. If we multiply each by 5, we'll get our final numbers.

Total heat loss: 6.3 kJ

Net temperature change: 0.59 *C

Net temperature change (worst case): 1.05 *C

The transition from liquid phase to gas phase is the overriding factor, since the water and steam stay around the same temperature. I could calculate the difference, but I would need to do some measuring of the steam temperature and water temperature before and after lid lifting.

The next question is: how long does it take to get back those fractional degrees?

My crockpot says it draws 240W at 110V assuming 75% of that is directed into heating the bowl, this results in heating of 180W. A watt is a joule per second. If the heat lost was 6.3kJ from steam leaving, it will take the slow cooker about 35 seconds to replace that lost heat. Assuming that the slow cooker is on the low setting (half power), this rises to 70 seconds. On the warm setting (quarter power), this rises to 140 seconds.

While opening the lid does cause a large amount of heat to be lost, the temperature of the contents will remain fairly steady. Because they will remain near their cooking temperature, the contents will continue cooking, even though they've gone down in temperature a bit.

As Bill Nye says, "don't take my word for it, you can try this yourself". Next time you're cooking something and it's boiling, get a stopwatch ready. When you lift the lid off, start the stopwatch. At 20 seconds, put the lid back on. Stop the stopwatch once your delicious dish has reached boiling again. Depending on the setting, this could be as long as 2:20, or as short as 0:35. Of course, this was all done with estimates and assumptions, but it should prove the point.

I may have gone a little overboard, but hope you have a fantastic day! :)

Also, I agree with you, OP's dish looks fantabulous.

EDIT -

TL:DR - Lifting the lid off of your crockpot won't change the temperature by much more than a degree, the food keeps cooking while at the slightly lower temperature, the heat is replaced in a couple of minutes.&gt;I could probably still take the beef out and brown it for a few minutes.

Nah, keep going, it's too close to midnight!

For next time, browning adds flavour and rendering some of the fat early on doesn't really make it less fatty, as most of it goes into the pot to cook!

The recipe looks fine. If you like the balsamic flavour, a splash of red wine vinegar might do more than a splash of red wine, which you might serve in a glass alongside instead.

Enjoy!Chicken Alfredo

1 chicken breast,
1 shallot (an onion is fine as well),
2 cloves garlic,
cream,
chicken stock,
pasta,
cheese (parmesan works best I think but whatever you have lying around is probably good)

Cook the garlic and shallots in a frying pan and brown the chicken with them, you don't want to cook the chicken through.
Add the chicken stock and a bit of cream with the pasta into the pan.
Boil it till the pasta is cooked and the chicken will be too.
Add cheese.
Eat.
Bask in the glow of this amazing and simple one pot pasta recipe.

Edit: Didn't realise this is the slow cooker subreddit, but it's still worth a try.I don't flip, but I shred it and let it all simmer in the juices a while before serving. Sesame chicken https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2ioa8k/long_time_lurker_first_time_slowcookerslow_cooked/

Cook for 2 hours on high much better (I've learned from cooking this 3 additional times)Browning it probably would've been a good idea, but it's already in the pot. [Here's what I'm going with](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2v8kgq/i_was_planning_on_making_oxtail_stew_but_i_forgot/cofgh5c) if you've got any advice to add. I only turned the pot on about a half hour ago, so I could probably still take the beef out and brown it for a few minutes. My cuts don't look particularly lean though (super fatty, actually) so browning them might melt off a lot of the fat. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. I'm accustomed to oxtail stew being really fatty.Yes, nostalgia can be a powerful thing.. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Spicy-Asian-Marinade-232058Thanks. I'm still gonna give it a try. Maybe add some Tabasco and lemon pepper to it after it cooks to spice it up a little. No idea in your case but my slow cooker has warm, low, and high settings. I cook 6-8 hours on low or 3-4 hours on high and warm is just for keeping things warm.

If your slow cooker doesn't have a high setting then you can't shorten the time. Most recipes that call for 6-8 hours means low setting afaik. Your low may be a warm setting but I think you can check the temp by loading with water and using a thermometer.

The 6-8 hours on low is usually around 190 degrees F and high is usually around 200 something.Hooked rugs, macrame plant hangers, and terrariums.

We bought a 70s house that was really nicely remodeled and de-70sed a couple of owners back, but some of the houses, especially the one-owner ones, are still fairly pristine examples of 70s houses. I've said if we'd ended up with one of those, it would have been cheaper to switch out our furniture and go for a full-on 1970s Brady Bunch look than to rip everything out. Just have fun with it. The way mid-century has gone from dated to cool, we'd probably be ahead of the trend curve.I made an oxtail soup about two weeks ago, and forgot to add beef broth. My hubs and I swooned when we ate it-- *best evar!*

I browned the oxtails in a little oil, and, because they were so lean, I added a little honey (a heaping teaspoon or so). The sugar aids the Maillard reaction. I added some water and a little bit of chicken broth.

I braised with the oxtails peeking an inch or so above the water/broth. Braised for hours. I think it was about 6 hours, iirc.

Added veggies at the 4.5 hour mark, and then tossed in some of the more aromatic seasonings and kept it on warm until serving time. The broth was a nice deep colour. The refrigerated leftover broth was gelatinous, and to add to the sinful goodness, I further reduced the broth because I only needed about half or maybe 3/4ths of it for the meal.

Any of your options sound like they'll do fine! If you want to go on the balsamic beef flavour side, then cider vinegar and wine/wine vinegar will add to that. If you find that the flavour needs chicken broth, you can add it then. I'd save the pork drippings for another dish!

Enjoy!My wife opens it all the time and it is the most annoying thing ever!Peacocks? I don't remember peacocks. I'd go for those before owls or mushrooms. Mom had mushrooms, and Grandma had owls.

There are peacocks near us, and apparently I'm one of the few people who likes them. Then again, I like bagpipes too, so I'm probably just weird, lol.My wife won't open it, but we have a house guest every few months and I no longer slowcook when she is staying with us. She opens the damn thing and while I know it has cooked for 6-8 hours already, it irrationally bothers me that she is so rude to intrude on my cooking routine.I'm impatient. Here's the recipe I'm attempting (FYI: I have a small crockpot):

3 garlic cloves
1/2 onion
1 carrot
tsp thyme
tbsp paprika
pinch celery salt  (I also forgot to pick up celery)
pinch black pepper
4-5 mushrooms
1 bottle red wine
1 pound oxtail (two vertebrae)
2 bay leaves
half tbsp chicken bouillon

dice onions. crush/mince garlic. chop carrot and mushrooms.
add that shit to a bowl and mix it all up. lay one bay leaf on top of the
veggies and put the other along the side of the bowl (probably doesn't make a
difference but that's how I did it). sprinkle in the chicken bouillon (should
be a pretty light quantity).

layer the base of the crock pot with the veggies

mix thyme, paprika, celery salt, pepper. coat the oxtail in the seasonings mix
add the oxtail to the crockpot. pour in rest of veggies, filling gaps and
covering the meat.

pour in the wine.

cook that shit on high for 4 hours (just started now at 7pm.
Gonna be a midnight snack).

After cooking, add a splash-2tbsp of red wine vinegar (to taste I guess) to "brighten
the flavor" or something. Haven't gotten to this part so let's see what happens.I've got a similar Crock Watcher that was my mom's with an even more earthy 70's motif. I've never figured out what the "auto shift" function is for. Still use it all the time....and with a glass lid... you don't need to lift it!I do something similar, but I take chicken thighs with salsa and canned beans, season it like chili (cumin, etc.) and crock it for 8 hours.

Easy and super tasty. Yum!Cool, so I am just going to make a list below. A lot of them call for green onions or regular white/yellow onions. You can just leave the green out and replace the regular with onion powder. The same goes for celery (although I do just fine with celery as long as it is cooked really well). I am a big fan of soups as liquids leave the stomach via gravity and don't have to be pumped out.

I hope this helps! Also, you can check out /r/Gastroparesis if you haven't. I also recommend this blog: http://livingwithgastroparesis.com/My great aunt had a set of the containers. I had no idea there was a crock pot that went with them as well (No idea if she had it or not either). TIL.. I got a slow cooker over Christmas and never even considered this! what an idiot.Just an FYI, I found that recipe to be pretty bland. But of course, that doesn't mean you won't like it. Don't even get me started ;) Seriously!! Those are nothing short of amazing!I usually get around a 2 lb roast and cook for around 10 hours.  I would say check it at 8 hours.Good. I put 3lbs of chicken in 5 hours ago. I'll have a tasty lunch. Always! I just set it in the morning and come back 5-7 hours later and eat. I'd definitely be willing to buy them from you.

I already hit up OP, but she wants to keep them. I don't blame her at all. They're awesome. Kitchy as hell. They're real real cute! /u/kinggutter talk to this guy/gal! You know what, from my own experimentation, with sizes from yours to around 3lbs or so, (that I've tried), the magic time is around 2.5-3 hrs or so.

Hey, going for 5-6 hrs might be better, but I couldn't tell the diff once I was over about 3.5 hrs.  ...Magic angels bless the chuck roast around 3 hr mark?  Dunno., ...But, I did notice that you posted this about 30 min. before now, so you should be just about there, even right now - yum!Looks like there is no real answer. I dont think it *really* matters, it will all cook and be seasoned/juicy regardless. That and the whole shredding and bit.

Personally, I like to keep the fat at the top the whole time (so no flip). Probably as that is how I've done roasts in the past. Anecdotal-ly i like to think less fat will melt into meat-sauce this way.Holy shit, those are cute as a motherfuckI've got a whole set of these collecting dust in my garage. I thought no one would be interested in them, so I've just left them be. Good to know someone might appreciate them!Cook on low ? Bonappatit.com has an article called something like 27 ways to make chicken not boring. It's worth looking it up. I would link, but my phone isn't working the best right now :(I cut my roasts into pieces before cooking, that way much more of it will be in the juices. I mean you're gonna pull it all apart anyway.Chicken in a pot is easy. Chicken, onion, carrots, celery, potatoes, and any other root veggies you like (radish, etc.). 1/2-1 cup of water or chicken broth. 1 tsp of salt and pepper.

Delicious.[Chicken Philly Sandwiches](http://foodfamilyfinds.com/slow-cooker-chicken-philly-sandwiches-recipe/)

My only advice is to go easy with the seasoning sauce and do NOT add salt to your chicken breasts because it will just taste like pure sodium lol. Otherwise an awesome recipe. **TRAINWRECK?!** Those are my *favorite* colors/styles, but only when combined.

I've had my sights set on a set of Corelle dishes, but when I look at the patterns, I hate how *modern* they all are. All of the things I like (mostly 70s motifs) are stoneware, and they chip too easily. :( yeah, i don't think you need to strain it. delicious fat makes the sammies better. i also leave the onions in. And the fat will get crispy and delicious too.Oh, man! My gramma had those when I was a kid! She made amazing chili in that crockpot (in the 1990s).I do chicken in the slow cooker with spices like hot pepper flakes, chili powder, salt and pepper, and any other spicey spices that sound good. Cook that chicken until it falls apart then shred and add Sriracha as desired cook for a little while longer to let the flavors melt together.

When I make them into tacos I do sour cream, shredded cabbage, lots of avocado slices, some cheese and any other delicious taco toppings of your choosing.

Alternative method of eating would be over rice with avocado. Also delicious. :)We had the exact canister set when I was little. We had the crock pot too but it was orange-red-ish.That is far to simple to have actually been thought of by myself.

Once I am finished making supper in it I will do this.

Thanks!Take a 1 quart pitcher.  Fill it with water.  Pour it in crock.  See how many times you can do that.  Double that number.Yep. Stupid easy.

It is SO good - my 6 and 7 year old boys even liked it and they are pretty picky.I'd flip it,  and finish it fat side upEveryone here seems to really like them, but as I don't have the childhood nostalgia to fall back on I can only look at them and see them as... pretty ugly.I make parmesan chicken breasts last night, turned out great. I did mayo (2 tbsp), dijon (1 tsp), seasoning salt, pepper, basil, paprika. Mix together, paint chicken breasts with, then roll them in seasoned panko and parmesan and bake on a baking sheet at 425 for 20-30 minutes.

It's going now, and looks pretty good! Instead of mixing the marmalade &amp; broth in a bowl, I just scooped some of the marmalade out of the jar, added the broth (well, the Better Than Bullion and water), and stirred/shook it up. I didn't want to have to wash another bowl, and I got every last bit of marmalade out of the jar. Win.Stamped 1978 on the bottom! They predate me by 10 years! :Pi don't flip. cook fat side up, so that fat juice gets into the meat. if you pour the dr pepper on the roast it it will be fine.Cool.

Yes, flip it, i do that because i think that the meat doesnt dries up and it gets flavored evenly with the juiceNow I know where all the cookies went. This post makes me really happy! And jealous. Awesome find!!!Honey+sriracha+soy sauce+lime is nectar of the gods, works so well with chicken and meat and greens.That's why I do it. My husband will eat baked potato skins too so it's nice that it saves me a stepOMg I'm the same way. Anytime anyone tries to open my slowcooker I get irrationally upset. I know it's a little thing, but everytime you open the lid you are losing all that fantastic heat that is working so hard to make it all ready at the right time. General rule of thumb is you lose 20 minutes when you open the slow cooker. You let heat escape and it has to build back up. I contemplated duck taping the lid one day lol.

That being said this looks amazing!

I had it passed along to me after my grandmother passed away. I love it! I found a good medium for me was to use some of the bacon in a stew or gravy and then stir in some bacon I crisp separately. The gravy turns out great and you still get that texture. Me as well.

Your crockpot will actually take 8 hours to cook a meal unlike newer ones which cook everything at higher temperatures and burn things at 5 hours.The 90s is vintage now...never mind the 70s.I prefer it but a lot of people would rather have none to very little. I leave most of the peel on because it has a lot of fiber. Plus we like it. Probably hand mixer.  Immersion blender would make it mush.   A hand mixer separates it quickly and easily! I like to peel about 50% of mine, because as /u/adminbeast said, it's kind of like pulp in orange juice. I need these.Recently got a new oven in my apartment after complaining about it the realty company asked if it was a "Harvest Gold" oven, and it was. They decided to just give me a completely new one rather than fix that relic from the 70sPeel in potato soup is sort of like pulp in orange juice. Some people like lots and lots of pulp; some people find any pulp at all to be unpalatable; but virtually everyone will drink pulp-free juice, even if it's not their preference. Potato soup works the same way: some like loads of peel, some find peel unappetizing, but everyone will eat peel-free soup.

Unless you're going for the peel-heavy effect, make your soup without peel.You're entitled to your opinion, and that's fine! :)Thaw it in the fridge. It's a large piece of meat and if you cook it without thawing, the outside will cook before the inside becomes unfrozen which can possibly introduce bacteria. I have the large mushroom cookie jar.Yeah it was a little oily thought it was just the chicken fat... So I told people not to have all the chicken skin in there.

Hah good luck and thanks for the tip!Lol we had the same set!Thanks! I'm going to try it - but I'll use less olive oil when I make my own vinaigrette. Oy, the calories!!! :) Good catch! Now I know the difference.

http://m.skinnyms.com/slow-cooker-balsamic-chicken/Ah ok - you probably didn't need the excess oil in there then. Do you have a link to a recipe?Maybe I did it wrong but I used balsamic vinaigrette. I used the left over salad dressing I had.My parents have the matching dinnerware set for this that they received as a wedding gift for "formal" dining pieces.This looks so good. I too have been wanting a Ruben but am not pregnant. I'm grocery shopping today or tomorrow morning I think this is a must. Lastly, thanks for the heads up on rinsing I hate extremely salted anything.My grandma had that set. After she passed I took the cooker and my mother sold the rest. I cherished that croc pot till my ex wife stole it when we divorced. Now I have a modern one and I hate it... I miss ol reliable...Are you using balsamic vinegar or vinaigrette? Vinaigrette is balsamic plus oil. Is it straight balsamic vinegar? I think you made a typo?Does that work in all cases?  A lot of people are saying to put it on a "warmer" setting when it's done cooking, which I don't have.  I've got "low" and "high."  I was under the impression that high didn't mean cooking twice as fast, but I could obviously be wrong.  Can I just cut the wait time in half?Removes a bunch of the salt/preserves.  That's hilarious! Also: suck it, Rachel Maddow! Fabulous find!I've been doing Siracha, honey, and garlic for a couple years. I drizzle it on shrimp and grill them on a skewer. So good. Knew I was on to something. What benefit do you get from rinsing the brisket?My kitchen towels *may* have owls on them........Anything's breakable when there's three kids in any house.  Picky eater here... And no offense to the OP but I definitely wouldn't eat. Not many times does actually LOL when one types LOL. This is one of those times. I worked at Sears in the 80s in the paint dept., we had to handle housewares as well. They still had that Merry Mushroom crap then. I wasn't a very good Sears employee. :(What kills me is that they consider the 70s vintage.Nice layering skills, OP.Chicken breast is done in 3-4 hours on low. Chicken thighs can go longer (up to 8 hours or more on low).I'm totally with you on these cheese selections.Recipe dammit!

Or "sauce", if you will. In the recipe, it gives the ingredients at the top and says
&gt;"For the drizzle:"


lolThese make me so nostalgic! My parents had this whole set.or peacocks.After mushrooms and acid were discovered and before they were banned... Yep.This is the COOLEST slow cooker ever. Plus, I collect mushroom ceramics. I have a jar similar to your biggest one. Seriously though, I'm insanely jealous of your find. You have no idea. e___eOk cool, and that's good to know because while I love me some mashed taters, that's not exactly what I want with a pot roast.I remember those.  Still ugly as fuck. Give your Mother a brand new set - something she would like.

Bam - free set.You got that backwards. That is a burrito. I would go with some Asadero cheese if you have access to a place that sells the Mexican cheeses. That or Queso de Oaxaca. Both are the types of cheeses that melt fantastically.Nobody will be snatching up those ugly blue geese on crock pots made in the 90s. The 70s were weird, but the funky style is so much more than the 90s could've ever hoped for!Oh.  My.  God.  My girlfriend is going to hate that I found a searchable name for these items.  I've had an eye open for the containers for years since my parents had them when I was growing up.  I'm always looking out for them at Goodwill stores and yard sales.  I had no idea that there were so many matching items.

Nice score.My parents had them, too.  I keep hoping I'll find them when I go to the Goodwill store, but no luck so far.  I've never seen the crock pot, though.  Now I need that.You mean "70s Mercedes Brown".OMG you got Rachel Maddow's cannisters!I only have two sets of the canisters... You may have changed my world. I'm sure my wife thanks you.BADASS! If you overlap two tortillas like a ven diagram you can get some extra girth. Also, always use a warm tortilla. Holy crap this comment just gave me a flashback. We had a GIANT hooked rug on a wall that was just a giant owl. Hooked rugs, another 70s thing!They keep talking about renovating it &amp; I get sad every time they mention it!Can you tell I was a kid in the 70s? LolTry adding a bit of garlic and paprika to that next time you're experimenting.  I can't get enough of it.My grandma has the same biggest ceramic canister. It's been her cookie jar for as long as I can remember. My cousin's brat broke it last year. Omg...my mother had that set when we were kids. I've wanting to get the small canister to make a fairy house for my fairy garden.I always use this and just sub the chicken in place of pork (I don't like pork).

http://www.chow.com/recipes/30356-easy-slow-cooker-pulled-pork

Make some coleslaw to go with and bam! Yummy easy meal :)I've got a truly ugly 70s Carletonware coffee set in brown and orange... the cups are too small to be useful as I drink out of mugs, I've no use for the coffee pot, or water warming jug, but I refuse to part with a single piece.  It's too hideous not to love.My mom has those jars! I've never seen another set until now.I gave that to my husband several years ago!It was a fun sort of time to be a kid in the suburbs. Bright colors everywhere, popcorn ceilings with glitter in them, riding in the way back of a station wagon the size of the Titanic and making faces at the people behind you.Sauce of saucesBrown cabinets and avocado green counters. So much avocado green.I don't know how my mother missed the Merry Mushroom Corningware. She had to settle for some with herbs on them (in French, ooh la la).

I just had a Sudden Clarity Clarence moment: she had mushroom decor all over the kitchen, and a fridge that was a fungal paradise. I used to cry uncle from time to time and clean out the tupperware in the back of the fridge. You should know it's gotten bad when a teenaged slob, later a college student, draws the line at the state of a fridge.#####&amp;#009;

Wild Mushroom Vol au Vent- Flakey puff pastry filled with forest mushroom &amp; cognac creamDon't over blend. The last few times I've gone to make a creamy soup I've ended up blending a little too much and turning it almost frothy. It's a lot more gross tasting than it sounds. I should probably stop using my Ninja blender on soups.It says English Mustard in the recipe.  We used the brand Grey Poupon.I kinda squashed the healthy part with the sausage. ..lol

But they're good, have an earthy green taste like you would get from a root vegetable. Texture is like cabbage and they can be spiced a million ways.


Y'know, having been on Reddit four years I knew the moment I posted that exaggerating for comedic effect doesn't work.  Someone is almost obligated to reply, "Why the heck would you do that? when the answer is "Never, of course.  But you'd hate to be in the way if I ever did, wouldn't you?"Aw, sometimes it's not about perfection. While the might remove more oil, placing something deepfried on a flat surface creates steam below the item and makes the breading/batter/crust soggy.


Personally I just use a baking rack with a board or paper towels underneath it.Yes! Just posted about a tamale party I hosted. Poop on whatPretty easy, just watch a couple of videos. You live in the information age; don't sit there wishing! The first one you have listed.  We used Grey Poupon for the mustard.I have a dinner club that meets once a month to cook and share food with different themes. Last month we made hundreds of tamales, which are really fun to assemble together.

I also add cream to mine at the end and start with onion and garlic sauted in butter.Create a fond with tomato paste and anchovie paste.  Hit it with some garlic and deglaze with a white wine.  Use San Marzono tomatoes only.  Don't forget the bay leaf.
  Add a handful of rice.  When you blend them up, it's a smoother sort of thickener.  Finish with a splash of cream.Why would you be walking around with a knife in one hand and screaming hot pan in the other?  I can't think of any circumstance where that would happen. Which one:

Damnit, now i have to make this.Back in December I made curried chicken for the first time.

The best tasting dish I've EVER made! High-end restaurant quality good!

The only problem was that my house smelled of it for almost three weeks; yes, seriously.Save your money. A tall pot and a thermapen are just as good (if not better) and aren't counter-space hogs or one-trick ponies.  It is also better to drain on paper towels rather than racks or in the basket, as very little oil drips out of the food. In fact, Serious Eats did a test on this and found that the paper towels remove four times as much oil than food left on a rack. Just get a good spider skimmer and transfer onto paper towels. I feel like saganaki could be a great warm up into oysters, and it's a lot of fun.I'm half hispanic half white too.  My dad is white and makes better rice than my mom.  Whiteboy can cook.This, yes. This is how my (thai) mom taught me how to make Thai curry. Whenever I make it from scratch, I always add the meat into the pot, raw. Chicken, beef, doesn't matter, add it raw. Try it.Stir-Friday!Antarctica is a desert.Since tamales were mentioned elsewhere in this thread, I thought I'd mention that you can make a great layered tamales "bake" with cornmeal mush. Slice it a half inch thick and layer with meat, cheese and sauce and bake. Boom, mock tamales.Brown some white rice in oil with onion and garlic.  Add salt, pepper, and cumin.  When sufficiently brown (not burnt), add chicken broth, cumin, bell pepper, cilantro and simmer on low heat while covered.  Add one to two spoons of tomato paste for color.  You can even cook the chicken used to make the broth with the rice if you want.  Will probably need more salt and pepper.  Use cumin to your own liking but I find it to be critical to the taste of the rice.  Simmer until rice sufficiently cooked.  Be careful to not add too much broth or the rice will be soggy.Love is cleaner with a packaged wiener. Cover your stump before you hump. If youre not gonna sack it, go home and whack it. Wrap it in foil, before you check her oil. You cant go wrong, if you shield your dong. No glove, no love. Dont be a fool, cover your tool. Sock that wang, before you bangI usually brown about 3 cups of rice with some butter while I chop a half yellow onion, about a quarter cup of cilantro and a glove of garlic.  Let the onion, cilantro and garlic saute in a separate pot until 'cooked' then add a can of rotel, a can of tomato sauce a cup of water and about a cup of leftover drippings from a roast chicken.  Bring the mixture to a boil and dump in with the rice.

Cover and remove from heat for about 20.Always prep ingredients safe to eat raw before ingredients that need to be cooked, so vegetables before meat. Ideally, get a set of cutting boards and use them for different purposes- one for vegetables, one for red meat, one for chicken/pork, etc.

Wash your hands with soap and warm water every time you handle raw meat. Try to get a kitchen faucet with a lever handle like [this](http://www.faucetconnection.com/images/faucets/Delta/467.jpg) so you can turn your tap on with the side of your forearms instead of your contaminated hands.

Have separate cooking utensils that you switch out once all the raw stuff is cooked.

Store ingredients in order of food safety from top to bottom, with the most dangerous at the bottom. That is, ready to eat items at the top, things that are safe raw under that, meat at the bottom. This way, meat juices won't drip on your other food.
Substitute chicken broth for the top ramen chicken flavor packets instead. Little trick this hot mamasita taught me when I complimented her on how her Spanish rice was the best I've had in a long time.

This was at a legit Mexican restaurant too. Tacquitos are a great meal to make as a group. Someone can cook, someone can stuff, someone can roll, someone can put the toothpicks in and the other can fry! I have done it with my friends and it went great! You should really go take a food safety class. Most places offer them pretty cheap because restaurants need access to them.

Using a pair of tongs to touch raw chicken and cooked chicken is very dangerous.

Now, my brother has meds that kill his immune system. He has to eat everything cooked through, and has to be careful with cross contamination when he cooked. He keeps hand sanitizer everywhere and often washes his hands thoroughly.Lasagna!  There are so many components that need to be put together. He definitely wants to wrap his spear.Pierogies from scratch! That's my Valentine's day date this year (i.e., my gift to my SO is me being patient with him in the kitchen). We've done spinach &amp; feta pockets, too. I think something that involves 2 steps is ideal for partner cooking.My suggestions are to get him something unique, simple enough to cook with.(Should be way enough to blend into whatever else she wants to with the other ingredients). Perhaps squin ink, or an expensive blue cheese? Something easy to prepare, fancy and delicious. Scallops, fillet? And something to flavor a desert that you love. Maybe a chocolate candy or expensive cherry preserves?Watch your huevos (or ovaries) works well for us. If you're not going to make a rice crispies type thing, then cereal with milk is really your only other option. Ah thanks, I was confused and for some reason thought you just put like a full orange not cut or anything into a chicken. Leaving it in the fridge overnight is going to make the final product taste better. Even two days, but not more.

You do not have to do this as it will rise much quicker on the counterSushi night has been good for my wife and me.
The ballet of reaching around each other for different ingredients.
Making custom rolls for the kids.
Packing healthy, delicious lunches for the next day.
Finishing up with a big plate of goodies to share.
Retiring to the bedroom.Hmm I've never tried brussel sprouts, but I hear theyre very healthy!I like to pour honey nut o's into a bowl, and then add milk. I use about a 2/3 cereal to 1/3 milk ratio. After that, I eat the mixture with a spoon. You want the milk to be refrigerated beforehand, but not the cereal. Let me know if you have any questions.That's pretty sad, actually. I still live in crappy, tiny apartments, and my first kitchen was a galley, but still big enough for two people if one used the stove and one prepped on the table. Eggplant parm, lasagna, stuffed veggies, crepes n things. Almost anything reallySo much this. My friend used to host sushi parties and they were a lot of fun! You have everyone prep the fillings (pitting and slicing avocado, chopping carrots, etc) and then two people at a time pick whatever they want and make a roll. Roll it, slice it, swap out with someone else. You get tons of sushi and everyone gets fun combinations to try!And not one from bed bath and beyond, go online and find an asian one (big round cheap looking plastic) that looks like the ones at small chinese restaurants. They cook rice perfect and if you are so inclined can keep it nice for a couple days. (I challenge this proposition, but my korean fiancee says her mom did it her whole life and she does it and never gets sick, doesn't seem safe to me though).We have both of those problems but there's more to it than that for us. I'm the controlling one and she's the obstacle but we operate at cross-purposes: I'm trying to put dinner on the table and she's trying to clean up, two tasks that are to a significant degree incompatible. Layer in the reality that she doesn't like cooking and we have learned that it's best if preparing dinner is a one-man show. I cook, she sits and we talk. After dinner we share cleanup and then we can go to bed happy.I've been posting this like a mad man, but [cast iron deep dish steak pizza](http://i.imgur.com/IFY5lox.jpg).  I took a couple of recipes and just slapped them together and it turned out fantastic.It's also fun to do this at parties with pitas for crusts."Calzones are like pizzas, but theyre harder to eat. Theyre dumb and so was that idea."Fiancee is Korean, can confirm.

She can't cook anything for the life of her, BUT rice. And damn can she cook rice.

I on the other hand, feel I am a very impressive cook...still struggle to get rice perfect.I'm wondering why you think the raw cast iron is better for frying instead of the enameled? I tend to do it because it helps season the raw cast iron.

If the two pans are of equal thickness, they will both have the same heat capacity. The enameled one will just have a slightly higher thermal resistance between the metal and oil, but that shouldn't make a difference. I've fried in raw and enameled cast iron, and didn't see a difference.Tacos and burritos.. different tasks like getting the meat cooked, perepping the veg, making the tortilla, have never had trouble with my girlfriend in the small kitchen and is loads of fun to assemble at dinner time.Uh... serve in a bowl with milk?

If you have a mini-fridge, buy some milk and put it in the fridge.

Reply to edit: I think if you really want to make snacks out of it, your best bet is to add it to a trail mix, with nuts, granola, and maybe chocolate chips.  You might mix in a couple of different cereals... and maybe toss the grainy stuff with some oil and seasoning (maybe salt and cinnamon).  I don't think you'll do well substituting the cereal for oats in a granola recipe, though: oats are much denser than the cereal.  You could substitute cereal for other cereal (like Rice Krispies) or maybe popcorn.Yeah, well said.  I actually went out and got a Scanpan which is some kind of special titanium blend and not a coating.  I had one for about 5 years once and it served me well.  They are rather expensive as well but if it lasts a while and doesn't stress me out I'm ok with it.Yep. Very high smoke point, I use that or grapeseed for cast iron steaks.As in, using the oven to cook a meal?  I can use an oven just fine.  I meant baking as in cookies, cakes and pies, other desserts that require actual measurements.I'd think it would be good for some seafood based recipes. My old world italian grandmother will role per in her grave for saying this but I'd think it would be good with a seafood risotto subbing it in in whole or part for the broth. Maybe a nice base for a polenta recipe with scallops etc?  Would I have to use anything different if I used non-canned tomatoes instead?Hugely important detail: fold in the tomato **after** mashing everything together. Otherwise you mix the tomato juice/pulp into the bulk.

Also, make sure to add enough salt, and balance that out with enough lime juice.This sounds really good. What about swapping out the balsamic for apple cider vinegar?  I'd think the flavor profile would be nice with the blueberries. &gt; rutabega

This is my absolute favorite vegetable. Unfortunately, you will get gas from it. Not a great idea for valentine's day.Agreed. My fiancee and I aren't huge cooks, but sometimes I like to make large meals for leftovers for the week, or she'll make something she saw on Pinterest to bring to a girls night.

Either way, the unspoken rule has generally been "One of us took the initiative to cook/bake this dish, so that person is in charge, and the other person is only there to help then get out of the way."

We almost never have multiple dishes being made, except for the few times we've hosted a big holiday dinner. In those cases, I'm literally only there to help her look for equipment, get things off the top shelves, mix, and clean bowls. Makes you wonder about public smoking and even vaping bans outdoors like on college campuses to prevent exposure to second-hand smoke and vapor. There in your little apartment with the windows closed cooking, browning things, some oil and smoke arising just about every day. I dunno.

EDIT: Oh, and also whatever non-stick surfaces put out. I have the same problem. Very small kitchen, with no ventilation to speak of. Cooking anything over high heat and even turning the oven on above 400 is sure to set off the smoke alarm, which is installed right outside the kitchen.

Not much I can do about it at the moment....I just use a splatter guard to avoid making a mess of the stove range and the walls, and turn on the floor tower fan whenever I cook. That usually dissipates any smoke and lingering odor pretty quickly. If not, I'll open other windows around the apartment to hasten the process. All these answers and no one has pointed out the obvious.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabuWell, I found it, but it's a secret recipe, apparently...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_de_Paris_sauce#Ingredients_and_preparation

Fucking amazing, I must say.I'd do bread and cheese as your ap, it's easy and I think it'll pair well.  For variety you can have some kind of pat maybe.

I don't do canned shellfish so I can't help you with that.  But I bet if you made a dip with the oysters and boursin or cream cheese it would work.My wedding party is coming up next week. Despite being legally married for five months, I am still feeling pressure to look good. So this fried-carb-aholic has been eating lots of veggies and trying to cut carbs when possible.

I made shepherd's pie with ground turkey and a cauliflower topping and it was amazing. Like, lick the plate good. Husband and step kid agreed; they never would have guessed that was "healthy" food.

Moral of the story? Things don't always have to be fried carbs to taste good. But I'm looking forward to carb-ing it up with a vengeance after next week.If you like lemons and capers, try chicken piccata. Traditionally I think it is made with veal, but veal is so expensive where I live that I couldn't bring myself to buy it. I subbed thin chicken cutlets and it turned out just as good, I daresay. Just make sure they're pounded really thinly.

[Chicken piccata](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/chicken-piccata-recipe2.html), from Giada

n.b.: If you're not into capers, banana peppers in brine are a fine substitute. yeah, I do the same. I love how bright and cheery they get when you peel the skin off.

I do the same with sweet potatoes, but not regular potatoes. This is an awesome recipe and how I make my adult Mac and cheese. But to add a little flavor try subbing some of the milk for a dark stout. Very little is needed, but it adds a whole new level to the flavors of the cheese sauce. So then what is a meal that requires baking and cooking?My kitchen is about 10 sq feet.  It's literally two steps from the cutting area to the stove, with the sink on one side and the refrigerator on the other.

I have a simple rule that I make everyone follow: when I'm in the kitchen cooking, you stay out.  No exceptions.  You can stand on the other side of the counter and talk to me.  If you want to wash your hands, use the bathroom.

No, you don't need anything from the refrigerator.  Wait.  No, you can't help me cut anything.  To be blunt, you're too slow.  No, I don't need help washing up while I'm cooking.  After I'm done, maybe, but until then just sit down, watch TV, and enjoy being catered to.

The only time I can imagine asking someone to help is with the few things they can do outside the kitchen and which most people don't know how to do anyway.  Hey, you want to help me shuck 3 dozen oysters?  That I'll let you do.  What, you don't know how?  It's easy, let me show you ... too hard?  Ok, sit down, watch TV then.

I love my wife's family, but if I didn't put my foot down they'd naturally gravitate to the kitchen to stand around and gab while taking up half the space.  Not a good idea when I've a wickedly sharp knife in one hand and a scorching hot (and heavy) iron skillet in the other.This was super green.  Almost like a pesto.  Might not have been au poivre at all.Test proper heat for a sear by getting your pinky wet and flicking a droplet onto the pan. If it sizzles and dances you're good to go.

Far as smoke goes you should be fine long as its not thick but try and not let the pan smoke.  It's bad for the oil. Worry about smoke detectors. Apply some restaurant tactics here.  Say things like "Behind!"  "Oven open!" etc.


Get a rice cooker! That shit is magical.For valentine's day my gf and I rant don't like going out so this year we will be making sushi together. Nothing.  I cook, she bakes.  End of discussion.I'm totally a wuss for trying new things so I have to force myself to try a new meal or food at least once a fortnight. This week it was squash (edit: or "baby summer squash" in the USA) They'd always freaked me out a bit. I don't know why but I guess they look like weird yellow blobs. Anyway I decided to try this meal : http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/1101/lemon+zucchini+and+chicken+pasta with squash instead of yellow zucchini (couldn't find them) and it was delicious! Also I never make recipes with shredded chicken as I hate shredding it up by fork but I read a tip on this subreddit about shredding it with the flat beater in my kitchenaid. I was doubtful but it shredded two breasts in 30 seconds on speed 2. :-) Research some afrodesiacs (no idea how to spell that). Fill the basket with those.Won tons! They're a pain to sit and fold by yourself, but with people it's a great time to be together. We will often have guests and prepare all the fixings beforehand so that we can work and chat with them before we eat.One thing to remember is that he a) uses small chickens and b) rests it for a while. I've done the recipe, it works.Make sure you eat all that nice stuff in the head. A lot of people are squeamish about it, but that's some of the best stuff in the lobster. If it's too intense for you to eat by itself, consider filling the head with some bread crumbs, minced onion and tomatoes, and then baking. Homemade scallion pancakes. They are very simple, and require few ingredients. One person can be rolling out the dough making fresh pancakes while the other is in charge of frying. Add this to the fact that I think there's nothing cuter than when the girl your cooking with gets flour all over her face because you keep flicking it at her.I've made this 3 times so far. The flame is huge when I do it. Goes to the ceiling. But only for a second or 2. It's worth it. Chorizo and brussel sprouts.

1/4 lb of the sausage broken up into bite sized pieces, 1lb of brussels, teaspoon of diced garlic, salt/pepper.

Heat the pan and toss sausage in when hot.
Quarter the sprouts and when sausage starts to release oil, toss them in.
Cook for about 5 minutes then add garlic, salt, pepper (amount is to taste)
Stirring occasionally cook for another 5 minutes.

Made this after finding recipe in a magazine, made a quite nice lunch
That looks really good. I wish my wife liked lamb......I got a set of wooden spoons at Walmart for a few dollars. There were like 5-6 different ones in there, and one of them was absolutely perfect. It was kinda shaped like [this](http://st.depositphotos.com/1602672/1918/i/950/depositphotos_19186591-Old-wooden-scraper.jpg), but a little bit rounder and thicker.  It's amazing, and I use it for everything. Just goes to show that you don't need anything particularly expensive, just find something that you like. [You've got a kitchen in your kitchen?](http://ic.f.tsatic-cdn.net/1310/635_340/2a7a0_1310235.jpg)That panade looks perfect for winter! And don't get me wrong, I'll cook things I like anyway just for myself but it's more fun to share. I like the idea of a dinner party too, that could be a fun way to share the love  :) My dad and I kill each other most times. But we can collaborate on enchiladas. One person makes the sauce and starts the tortillas, the other preps vegetables and sides and stuffs and rolls the enchiladas.Sounds yummy.Corn bread We have a small kitchen and this is how it works: She's the chef. I'm the guy she delegates a task to. When I'm done, I just wait for another task.

And most importantly, if she's moving or looks like she's about to move, get out of the friggin way. I'm not the co-star, I'm the assistant. Oh I know the feeling. Sometimes I think about dropping out just so I can see my family again. But I long have two years left!! I'm a control freak in the kitchen.  I let the kids help sometimes because they need to learn how to cook, but other than that, stay out of my way. Cooking with my husband sounds like a night in hell for me. I'd rather he stay out of the way and enjoy the food when it's finished.Green Peppercorn sauce maybe?  It's a similar pan sauce made with stock, cream, brandy, mustard and green peppercorns.  When I made it, the sauce wasn't exactly green though, so maybe not.Check out Tamales by Stephen Pyles. It shows you how to make basic tamales, fancy tamales, and even dessert tamales.

They're a lot of fun to make and most non - local ingredients can be cheaply ordered onlineThere's aloooootttttttttt of work to it but the reward is more than worth it. When you say "dumpling" I thought of dumplings, as in the soup. Got totally confused lol I have done this a lot!! Pair with the board game Risk and you have a great night ahead! I like making thai spring rolls with a friend or SO! You can have little contests to see who can wrap the most, etc.A big stir-fry dish is perfect.  There's tons of prep which everyone can help with and then during the cooking, on person is stir-frying and the other person/people are getting the next ingredients and putting them in the wok.

Sushi rolls are fun.  Get three bamboo rolling mats and pass the california roll down the line.  The first person adds the rice to the seaweed wrap.  The next person ads the avacodo and crab and the last person rolls it and cuts it.  Fun.Based on what you're looking to get out of this, I'd say:

Throw them into a slow cooker with equal parts black bean and corn salsa.  Cook them on low until the chicken can easily be pulled apart.  Excellently tasty and excellently easy- great for leftovers.  Just throw it into a corn or flour tortilla and enjoy!Me either. I have three bedrooms and my kitchen is quite large. My husband and I can cook together comfortably.My grandmother owned a deli and ran a catering business and all my aunts, uncles, and cousins would help out. Some of the nicest memories I have of my family involve peeling potatoes, shucking corn, or snapping the ends off of green beans from the garden.hey i'm new to this brine thing, can you tell me how to do it properly?Tamales or Chinese dumplings are best done as a team effort...otherwise they take goddamn forever.I followed America's test kitchen blueberry pie recipe. The recipe contains a lot of things to solidify the filling without adding weird flavors--their secret ingredient is apple flesh and gelatin. I wasn't sure what i was expecting but i was super happy when i realized just how solid the filling was (combined with the awesome buttery flaky vodka crust mmmmmm)My wife and I make this recipe together quite frequently in our tiny kitchen: http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/thai-beef-with-basil

There are a few simple elements making up the dish (meat, rice, slaw, sauce) which makes it easy to divide the effort. I also just made beef bourginon on a whim and it turned out fucking delicious. French food intimidates the fuck out of me but the experience inspired me to buy Julia Child's book.I like to call it *al dente*#####&amp;#009;

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OFGXEK/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687582&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B000JLOOO8&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=138ZBA4BY4A6X74KDQP8I wish I had a cousin like that :) Or better yet, I wish I had a kitchen of my own like that!It adds a cheesy savory flavor. I do mine in steps: paste fried a bit, coconut milk solids, then the liquid, then the meat (cook this as long as you'd like as long as the heat is reasonably low and you stir it often), adding cilantro at any point you would like, then the veggies for 5-10 minutes at the end.

If you use a wok or a pan you can cook the meat for a long time, the veggies don't really absorb that much flavor.

Also a spoon or two of peanut butter works wonder and you cant even taste it in my opinion. Makes it smoother and more robust.My husband is the "sous chef" and I'm the main cook in the kitchen if we're making a big meal. He does the chopping and the washing, and I do all of the stove work/assembly/seasoning/etc.

That way we don't get in each others' way, and I don't have to wash my hands 20 times by chopping something, then touching spices/utensils, then washing and chopping something, etc.The peel on for a little extra flavor. I cut the citrus in quarters.Grate some pepper jack or Monterrey jack (no pre shred), toss cheese with a spoonful of corn starch and set aside.

Then sweat some dice onion and chile (Serrano, jalapeo, hatch, etc) in canola or even a little bacon fat. When aromatics are soft add some mexican oregano and dash cumin, allow to bloom for a minute. Pour in a can of evaporated milk, then mix in the cheese and whisk on low heat for 7-15 minutes until warm and thick. If you like throw in some pre salted dice tomato. excellent call! and thank you, hope it sparks some ideas for you as well!

Oh my goodness this makes me want to breed.  Too cute!It's not about that. The kitchen is a stove, a sink, a kitchen, and about 2ft by 2ft of counter space. Its annoying having someone that close all the time when you are holding sharp things, hot things, etc.This is our problem. We have a 3 bedroom house with a kitchen the same size as the bathroom. Why? Because why would you need more than a square foot of counter space?Perogies! My friends and I used to get together, make the dough from scratch, then make a pile of mashed potatoes and go to town on toppings. Rolling them afterwards is a blast and everyone gets covered in flour. Best toppings were roasted broccoli and cheddar, and we did a sauerkraut one that was really tasty. My girlfriend and I will, once a week, pick out a couple different recipes from Julia child's book and make a meal. I think it's pretty fun. We are slowly learning some good cooking techniques and get to enjoy a good meal. It's fun to cook together because we usually split cooking duties but also help prep for each other I always like a Malbec with my steak. I also agree that meal portion is totally key. Thanks for sharing your menu, looks good!I like this a lot. I could make a few different salad type skewers with accompanying salad dressings. Thanks for the idea!I always sous to my wife, much easier to clean the trail of destruction than vie for primacy.Oven roasted with salsa verde. If you can avoid eating the salsa verde from the bowl with a spoon, it would be great on leftover reheated chicken. Or cold chicken. Or tossed through pasta like pesto maybe with some creamy fetta or goats cheese and cherry tomatoes. Hmmmmmmn.  &gt;On my way to job interview to hopefully get out of kitchen

&gt;start to agree with you

&gt;thing about getting paid :/ I'm guessing that he's trying to imply that space that could have been for the kitchen is now used as a spare bedroom?I grew up with regular dumpling parties (my family lived in Japan for a time and brought lots of great food traditions back with us). You don't always get the prettiest dumplings, but people enjoy forgiving out how to put them together and then funding the ones they made once they a cooked.

Korean Bbq is also a fun cooking activity. Get a couple electric skillets and cook at table!

I really want to have a summer cobbler party where people bring fruit to share and everyone  assembles a small cobbler. Ice cream making would have to be part of it too!well, I figure I might as well just post the menu I put together.

Starter: baked goat cheese caprese bruschetta

Soup: Cream of mushroom

Salad: Caesar salad

Main: Steak + mac and cheese

Dessert: Framboise Lambic Chocolate mousse

I was trying to put together a drink pairing for each as well. and as always with multi-course meal, proper portion sizing is a must so no one taps out early.It was meant to illustrate how low a priority kitchen floorspace is in my area. If you have more bedrooms, you'll have more bathrooms and more living area to accommodate the extra people- yet the kitchen stays the same size as an efficiency apartment's.

I've never had a personal kitchen that could support two people working simultaneously. Flavacol and coconut oil for me and mine.If I'm going to cook with someone, I usually have us both make different parts of the meal. That way we're engaged in an activity together, but nobody gets territorial. The nicest way to do this is usually having one person cook dinner while the other makes dessert. Absolutely. But it depends on your position on the line. Working the fryer side can definitely be like an intricate tango, but if your on the broiler, it's more like a shitty interpretive dance that only has a bunch of flailing arm movements. Excellent! It's a bit rich but not heavy, I didn't use mayonnaise or cream cheese to add richness, just butter and good olive oil.  So it puffed a tiny bit and stayed light when I baked the stuffed mushrooms. I only ever used it with Japanese food, but you might try adding it to your western style soups or stews to up the umami I guess.Pizza rolls. In Germany we have those pre-baked rolls that need another 10 minutes in the oven to be nice and crispy. Now prepare whatever people put on pizza and cut the unbaked rolls in half. The guests can now choose their favourite toppings and combinations and put them on the rolls, and when a tray is full, you put the pizza rolls in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes.You know if you make them you'll be able to eat them too. I've had wonderful experiences cooking stuffed dough foods with friends. I've made pierogi, dumplings,empanadas, etc. You can chat while you are stuffing your food, then keep chatting while stuffing your face.[Loco Moco](http://norecipes.com/recipe/loco-moco-recipe/), except for my patties being pure beef burgers.

Damn, it was awesome.I dont understand the parallel between # of bedrooms and kitchen sizeMilk and orange juice. If he can pull it off, marry him.Great phase, totally going to paraphrase that about some other dish, since I've never eaten a tamale in my life.

If you can even call it a life, what with the absence of tamales...I had a lovely moment with my ten-year-old daughter last weekend. I gave her the task of halving a bowl of tomatoes. Half way through, she confided "usually people think I can't use a knife and they say 'Let me do that for you,' but I can do it. They're just being nice, but it's still disappointing. Thanks for letting me do a real job."

Meal turned out fantastic.&gt; At my place now- a three bedroom house- my kitchen floorspace is effectively as big as a public bathroom stall.

Holy shit, dude. I have a 2-bed apartment and my kitchen is almost the same floorspace as my second bedroom (which is about big enough to put a double bed in).Pizza Funny I hate eating in front of people. Hate watching people eat while I eat. Hate letting people see me eat. I prefer to go to restaurants alone. You are making me feel more of a freak than usual. Here's mine:

 stick of butter
 cup of flour
2 cups half and half
1 lb extra sharp cheddar grated
1 lb elbow macaroni
salt and pepper

Boil the macaroni uncovered for 11 minutes then drain it in a colander.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan on medium/medium high.
Gradually stir in the flour until a roux forms.
Gradually stir in the half and half then remove from heat.
Gradually stir in about  of the cheese.
Salt and pepper to taste.
Stir in the macaroni then transfer the mixture to a greased casserole dish.
Top the macaroni with the remaining cheese and bake covered with foil for 25 min at 350.
Remove the foil and broil the macaroni on high for about 5 minutes.
Now I want to eat a great Beef Rendang.

Indonesian and Malaysian food has a lot of coconut curries simmered for hours and hours.  Also Nonya cuisine too. May not be fancy, but my absoluse fav chicken breast recipe is just marinating the breasts for 24 hours in dill pickle juice and black pepper, then sauteed in a mix of 50/50 olive oil and butter.  Add whatever veggies/condiments you like and boom: delicious chicken sandwiches...I've always meant to experiment with a pan-fried batter to add to it too....think I may tomorrow...Thanks for sharing your story! I grew up in a small town, too. 450 people. I used to have to help my dad farm in the summers and hated it. Sometimes now I wish I could help him farm in the summer! My better half usually wants to murder me after being in the kitchen with me for only a few moments.I've been trying to figure out a good pandan flavoring to use for other recipes, like pandan coconut rice. Do you have any tips?Pierogies or dumplings. Any of those foods that require being folded up individually. It goes much faster with more than one person.Pressure cooker for cooking dry beans and legumes. Much faster to cook, and they come out much softer.basically, I boiled bowtie pasta until about halfway done, put them in the oven with a mix of: a simple roux plus grated Kerrygold Dubliner cheese and milk..Kerrygold   I used I think the proportions from the first or second rated oven-baked mac and cheese recipe from foodnetwork.com (or Epicurious, cant remember )If you want an everyday pan you can put in the dishwasher, calphalon came out with a dishwasher safe line of pots.

I usually make pizza parties , just serving pizza . But the great thing is everything is homemade !(except toppings)
The great thing is about it is people can have a try rolling their own dough , it's really hilarious with all the different sizes and odd shapes :D
Making ravioli. Easy task to divide between two people. I roll out the dough, she fills and cuts. Once we get a rhythm going we just crank out massive quantities while chatting and listening to music. Fun times and a freezer full of quick meals.If I'm strapped for time, instead of using spices I'll use one of the Indian spice pastes that are available, like madras curry paste. Rice and lentils is a staple in my family, and I make it the best!Congrats on your good luck! I have yet to ever encounter a double yolk egg, sadly.Making Pizzas. We sometimes have a lot of friends over for pizzas. We prep the sauce and dough then cover a table in cool things to put on them. Everyone gets half a baking tray to work with!The activity of the yeast at different temperatures depends on the type (strain) of yeast used. Regular bakers yeast leavened dough tends to rise well at around 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit. Are you making a sourdough style bread, where you let the sponge develop at a lower temp for several hours? That's not something I'd recommend speeding up, because it wouldn't taste sour.Good quality, free-range bird, around 1.5 - 2kg

Wash &amp; dry skin

Massage in lots of room-temperature real butter

Season with salt &amp; pepper

Roast at 200c in the moddle of the oven until done

Rest for about 15 minutes before carving
Moong dal. I bought a pressure cooker just to see if it would help make the lentils cook to the creamy softness that they are at restaurants. The result was even better than I thought it would be. Just ordered a bigger pressure cooker for my mom, because she liked what I made so much she wants to learn how to make it too.Don't! The coconut milk is the first one to add after the curry paste. Also, don't fry the meat, put it raw in the coconut milk to boil. It will be super tender.There are 3 steps to a good roasted chicken.

Step 1: brine.

Step 2: roast the chicken in the oven at a low temperature (&lt;100 celcius) for a long time until the internal temp is around 60 C.

Step 3: brown the skin by turning up the oven really high.

You can add spices, vegetables, lemons, whatever you wish, but that's the basic method for roasting a chicken that's moist on the inside and crispy browned on the outside.That thomas keller recipe video is bullshit. If you cook a chicken to that color in a single temperature the outside will be bone dry if you want the inside to be cooked. Also the bottom of the chicken that was resting on the vegetables is brown too, obviously fake. So clearly they *did* the right thing, but it's *not* what the video shows. The right thing is to separate the cooking into two steps: step one it getting the inside of the chicken cooked at low temperature, step two is to brown the skin. You *cannot* get a perfectly cooked moist chicken with a browned skin in one step.Have a fire extinguisher nearby, just in case!This year for Valentines Day the wife and I have invited another couple over to make home made ravioli. Why keep the peel on? Do you slice the citrus in half?My biggest problem is that I have a small kitchen.  There's not really any practical way to squeeze both of us in there without running into each other.

On a good day, we split prep.

On a normal day, I cook &amp; she cleans.

On a bad day, I cook &amp; nobody cleans.

...and then some nights we're drunk &amp; just order pizza.*"Too many cooks"* was never so apt.

Just as in any high risk situation, you need a clear chain of command.  One person has to be sous-chef.I like making risotto with my girlfriend because besides being damn delicious, risotto gives us an excuse to hang out in the kitchen an hour, leisurely enjoying some wine while we take turns adding broth and stirring. I love it.I prefer using fresh lime leaves (kaffir lime) instead of lime juice/zest. Lime juice or zest is often used as a substitue for lime leaves in Thai reipes, but I'd give the leaves a try it if you can find them where you live. They keep extremely well in the freezer of you can get them fresh.It won't make much of a difference, but I also don't think you have much to worry about. In a TV program they of course try to get the maximum flame for show, probably by adding extra cognac, and by getting the pan really hot so those alcohol vapours are maximized, and by shaking the pan while the flame is burning in order to get even more alcohol in the air. The only danger is getting your ventilation system on fire, so turn that off. Then make sure that the pan is not very hot, don't shake it vigorously while burning, and you'll have a very low flame.I just remove a very thin layer of the outside by scrubbing them with a steel brush. That part tastes muddy. If the carrots are particularly big or old I peel them with a potato peeler.Crepes. Especially if you want to prep them ahead of time and just assemble them together !Whole roast pig on a spit. Bring lots of friends.Friday night is curry-cooking beer party night for sure! You can cook a curry as long as you like, as long as you don't add your veggies too early. Most Thai beef curries take at least 2 hours of stewing, which means your coconut milk will split up some even if it's stabilized. This is absolutely no problem though, just stir it back in once in a while or scoop some of it off at the end if you think it's too much.

Specifically for yoghurt, you will probably need to add that in the end but it seems you already got some other more knowledgeable replies on that one.My kitchen is too small, so when friends ask if they can help I say no because they just get in my way. But my ex girlfriend used to help me put toppings on my homemade pizzas, that was always fun My partner and i enjoy making sushi together in the kitchen.I'll give it a try, thanks.The best way to cook together and have the instant gratification of eating what you make!yeah, pizza is good because most of the work goes into making the dough and the marinara, then prepping ingredients. If you can divide those tasks, you'll never get in each other's way, since they involve totally different stations.

Then at the end, your work is easier, you take turns rolling out the dough, and can give advice and then show an example. Then pop the pizza in the oven and wait.

There's enough totally seperate work that it actually becomes easier with 2 people.Any kind of soup. Chicken pot pieCleaned and trimmed of fat.  Montreal chicken seasoning 35 mins at 350.  PerfectStirfries are great, wherein one person can do the cleaning and cutting of some of the ingredients, and the other can do the cutting and cooking of all the ingredients. Both do clean-up. Jager schnitzel.  Pork mushrooms heavy cream.  Smells so good tastes fantasticStuffed shellsI don't get along with anyone in the kitchen,  or near a bbq,  or any other space where food  is prepped.  Just stay the fuck away from me when I'm cooking,  because i am a surly prima donna when i cook.I wish i knew how to prepare tamales.

Ah man, that takes me back!

My parents, father really, had quite a sizable garden.

Summer mornings I'd wake up to help my dad dig and peel potatoes and get them ready for canning. Then we'd pick green beans and string them and get those ready for canning.

Then we'd pick tomatoes, some of which were canned, some frozen, and others turned into salsa (and then canned.)

Sometimes my mother helped us pick, but other times she was in charge of canning.

Even if I didn't help cook dinner, I still helped make it.

Not going to lie, I absolutely hated every minute I was down there until summer break last year. I finally spent some time at home and helped my dad out in the garden for the first time in years. It was hot and humid, but peaceful. I needed that after so many years of chaos in the city with people and school. Even better, I had just got back from studying in Seoul, which was much much larger than my college town (and infinitely larger than where my parents live)I don't need *extra* spaghetti with all this falling out of my pocketsMy girlfriend and I finally got two days off together, so Monday has become our day to cook together. Our first meal was beef stew, which was delicious. Our second meal was chicken  pot pies. She made the dough and gravy, I made the chicken and veggies. It was amazing.  I had a tradition going for a couple of years where my friends would come over and we'd make a gingerbread house around Christmas time. Highly recommend. It's a fun weekend project. Doesn't stick together. Titles like these make me think of Buzzfeed writers scrounging for ideas.

Anyway: [Peach Giuliana](http://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipes/peach-giuliana) (warning: autoplay video).

Peach halves poached in prosecco syrup, served on zabaglione with a scoop of berry granita. The flavours were all nice but the textures were what complemented each other in an amazing way.Make something that people can **assemble** together.


Make some flatbreads, tortillas, steamed buns or whatever and provide toppings and fillings for everyone to assemble their food.

It's the closest thing to cooking together without people ruining the food you're cooking.Paella. I made simple corn tortillas with the wife and kids the other day. They were as easy as playing with Play-Doh, so my three- and six-year-old had no problems fully participating, and the end result was absolutely delicious. It ended up being a fun little craft activity that we could eat.ah, kitchen rage.  Someone should make a subreddit for this. I love it!  Happy for you that it all turned out.Same for us, except I always make her do the rice because she is Japanese and I'm rice challengedKorean BBQ.Are three bedroom houses supposed to be small or something?[Yup! ](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0B8ZUtO95Co) Made chicken piccata on an at-home date recently. It worked out well, he did the chicken (tenderize, dredge, fry) while I did the chopping of garlic/herbs/lemons. The rest was pouring wine, minding the timer, and adorably sharing the spoon to taste the sauce as it reduced.

One-pot pasta meals would work well for this too - just divvy up the prep/chopping and share the stirring/keeping an eye on things part.

Stuffed shells would also work - much lower skill level required than doing dumplings or even tamales, and less fuss than lasagne. Prepare them together, then as they bake, one of you gets a head start on dishes and the other works on a simple green salad.

My ex used to get excited about making curry with me (usually he would let me do my thing and then hop in to do dishes after). Lots of prepping and enough phases to the recipe to keep 2 sets of hands busy.


Most things should work. The only time I can see not wanting help is for things that come together quickly and that you have down pat. For me this is my mass-burrito making process, or the quick morning breakfast sandwich routine.Roasted red cabbage with prosciutto and balsamic vinegar. No recipe  - I just made it up.Actually for me it would be Penne, but I admire your voraciousness.Fresh pasta. Whether it's feeding sheets of pasta through a pasta machine to make fettuccine, rolling gnocchi or folding tortellini. You can either both make it together or have one person supplying the other with a constant supply of stuff to put in the water.My wife and I enjoy making pizzas together. Our boys love being involved with it also. It's a fun family activity. But I've also been a part of pizza parties where the everyone gets involved making pizzas. Pizzas are easy to make once the dough is done. Some were held with all the toppings already there, but my favorite were when other people brought their favorite toppings. Some would bring special cheeses or vegetables I didn't think of for pizza. I often ended up trying combinations I otherwise wouldn't have. This works even better with multicultural groups because pizza seems to be a universal food, but the toppings can differ greatly from region to region. But most of all, it gets everyone doing something together, usually resulting in lots of laughs and good times.Your story is repeated elsewhere with stews and soups across cuisines. Refrigeration makes the difference. Observe the icechests used at chili cook-offs- the chili is cooked, then transferred to the ice to cool down for an hour or few, before being reheated for judging.
Edit: your other details are spot on, as well. Spices need heat in oil and time to bloom.&gt;   Heck, I sometimes even get nostalgic for those days... And then I remember how much I was paid.

I know this feel. Sometimes I think about going and getting another weekend gig in a kitchen for a few months, just for kicks.Stuffed chicken breasts!  I made a recipe that called for the stuffing to be ground chicken with sauteed mushrooms, garlic and fresh thyme.  It was really really good.  What was the surprise though was I had some extra stuffing left over and I also had some extra lasagna filling left over (ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella, and basil).  I mixed the two up and stuffed another breast with it and it was *awesome!* If you could have any one food for the rest of your life, what would it be and why is it spaghetti?Spaghetti wasn't the only limp noodle in the kitchen that day.Thank you kind stranger! http://imgur.com/9k3TyzhI sent this to my sister asking for help: http://imgur.com/eMyT7JJ Figured it out before it got to throwing, phew! Outdoor, slow stuff like chili,  bbq, crawfish  boils, etc.My gf and I make a lot of meals together. Just about anything where you can split up the different tasks as you go will work. We frequently make bacon and haloumi salads where I cook the bacon and haloumi while she chops and prepares the salad ingredients. We made ramen last night very successfully together.15 1 star replicated restaurants aren't that difficult to finance when you have made a ton of money from becoming a reality tv star. Which Gordon Ramsey has undeniably done.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syvvxx3eGpI watch your celebrity chef sharpen a knife.  Don't be a dickhead and disrespect thomas keller who is one of the most accomplished chefs in the world.One can make some guacamole and prep sides while the other makes meat for carne asada tacos [or whatever you like].Making dolmas (stuffed grape leaves)  is an incredibly fun group project. This also works for stuffed cabbage too. What happen is everyone sits around the table stuffing a prepared mixture into leaves.  This gives everyone a chance to relax and just chat, while still preparing the meal.  Children are also able to participate, just make sure to supervise.Pork wontons and crab Rangoon. A modest amount of each will go long way, and having two people stuff/glue the sides together is definitely a bonding experience.My husband flees in terror. I um may have turned around stabbed him with a knife a couple of times because I didn't see him behind me and he didn't say anything. No serious injuries and no blood. I may also gesticulate wildly even when I have a knife in hand.

But when it is time to make potstickers and I have everything pre chopped, he will help me make the wrappers and fill them. Tamales. In the words of Diana Kennedy:

"Tamales are made for an occasion, and an occasion is made out of making them."Licorice! it screws everyone up!Saving this for later!  You're a godsend! Baked winter squash, parm, and a bit of maple syrup. &gt;rubbing against each other

go on...Gorgonzola, pear, caramelized onion panini.  Maybe bacon. Gorganzola, pear, carmelized onion panini. Maybe with bacon also. My family has a great time cooking together several times a year.  Always Thanksgiving and several birthday parties and national holidays, too.

We do it at my cousin's house, who is a professional chef.  He has a complete kitchen, an outdoor kitchen and a fireplace with a rotisserie and a bread/pizza oven built with the fireplace.

We can have 10-15 people working all of that and it works well because my cousin knows how to manage a kitchen.  The meals are wonderful - usually a dozen or more dishes and we make extra so there will be plenty to take home.

Anything can be good to cook in a group.  You just have to organize and get people going on separate tasks.  Thanksgiving is the biggie.  My cousin will do some prep a couple days before, then at least ten of us show up 5-6 hours early to do the rest.

A gigantic side benefit is that he's been training us for the past 20 or so years.  My cooking isn't anywhere as good as his, but I have learned to cook and people seem to like what I make.Agreed During a winter rental I had with some friends, we all worked together to make some delicious beef stew with mashed potatoes. Everyone was peeling, and chopping and drinking. And it was magnificent stew. my girlfriend and I make a lot of pizzas togetherPretty much anything because you can just help each other out. While one is draining the pasta the other is stirring the carbonara sauce. One can be chopping up one thing while the other chops another.

One has a glass of wine the other has a beer. Haha the onion with the bread knife. I feel your pain. Runzas! Bread dough wrapped around fillings (traditionally hamburger and saurkraut) and then baked. Of course, the fillings can be mixed up or added onto. Since my mother became a vegetarian our family has been using imitation hamburger that works just as well. It's fun to roll the runzas up with family while we combine filling ingredients in different ways - one of our holiday traditions.Did she ever show you how to make that salsa?Thanks mumBeat kidney problems and overweight by changing your diet to a healthy one.

I hope this will help you! :D This is a very basic recipe, but delicious

Brown a small onion in olive oil until very soft (add some salt and occasionally I crush in a clove of garlic). Cut up 1 or 2 tomatoes and fry for a bit more.  Throw 2 cups of rice in, fry it up (try get it all covered with the oil/tomato/onion combo, but not let it stick to the bottom).

Add 4 cups water and 2 bay leaves, bring back to the boil, cover, turn down heat, and simmer for 20min.brine the breasts. it makes all the difference; it's the x-factor. if you don't know what that is, in short, it's basically marinating your chicken in a salt-sugar solution for a period of time. it makes your chicken so tender, juicy and delicious that you just can't get that result without brining. with that said, here is the brine solution i put my chicken in for 4-6 hours before cooking (which ill get to):

in a container (tupperware, anything big enough for the breasts with a little extra room), fill it halfway with water so when you submerge the breasts, they will be completely underwater (don't put them in yet). put in 3 tablespoons of salt, 3 tablespoons of sugar. then, chop up garlic, lemon and rosemary/thyme/herb(s) of your choice and throw it all in and mix. then put your chicken in. i like to dump some pepper in there too, and let all of those flavors soak into the chicken. put this in the fridge and let it sit for as long as you can before you cook it. some people recommend 24 hours, some people do a quick 15 minute brine. if you're gonna be around, stir it every now and then. if you're gonna be out for the day, no problem.

once the chicken has sat in the solution, follow the cooking directions in the link below, and don't cheat like it says! trust me, it will be so worth it. also, before you actually cook the chicken after taking it out of the brine, pat them dry. you can sprinkle on some more salt and pepper before putting in the pan if you'd like.

note: if you try brining a chicken breast or two and cook them using the method in that link (it's an extremely simple and easy method), compare them to the other breasts you don't brine. the difference in tenderness will be impossible not to noticeJust get a food thermometer broI want to see you throw it, and I want to see the photo of it afterwardsTamales!  just know that the whole process can be a bit time consuming but a great way to cook together.  One person makes the masa and the other prepares the desired fillings.  Then you both get messy hands while forming tamales tamales.  Tamales take about 45 minutes to cook. you now have 45 minutes to "clean each other's hands"Still on the line. It's those moments that keep me in the gig. It's also why I rarely cook at home. Someone cooking for me is a luxury I get once a week. Bless her for it, too.My ex and i used to do calzones a lot.  Same premise but with the added benefit of getting what you want.  Worked especially great for us considering she was a vegetarian and i am awesome.It's clear from your videos how much you love spending time with each other. Independent at 98 is amazing. Enchiladas! I would make them with mom. She would heat up the oil and home made sauce in two separate pans while I would crumble up the queso fresco and hand her the tortillas.

She would them fry the tortilla then dip it in the sauce and I would put cheese in the center and roll them up.Bacon fat, butter, sriacha, onion and garlic powder all melted together with more salt. So good. So, so good.Came here for this... One person makes pasta, the other makes sauce, or salad or garlic bread.

The pasta can be made of to the side, you just need a space to mix and knead it. Helping with space issues.Sounds familiar.  My best "Hey, let's cook together!" experiences have been either "Why don't you have a drink *right over there* and we'll chat while I cook" or (with my parents) "Why don't I do a mise en place for you, then grab a beer and we'll chat while you cook?"  The latter saves me from cringing while my father laboriously dices an onion with a bread knife and does a pretty good job of forestalling questions about why I haven't produced grandkids for them yet.That's a good theory, but it doesn't work when I'm carrying a giant pot of water to drain and he magically appears in front of me.

Even a "k, gotta drain this now!" will cause him to turn around and magically appear in front of the sink.

We're both happier when he just stays in the doorway to chat with me as I cook. Do you like dirt in your food?I know the feeling. The kitchen I work in now is tiny. The line is thinner than some hallways. I did dishes for a few months and carrying loads of plates down the line was pretty difficult. Luckily I've moved out on to the floor. The cooks seem to do really well though. I feel if two people are cooking in the kitchen one should be designated to a side and another to a separate area. If something is needed from the fridge, request it rather than get it yourself and get in the way. Just my $.02Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup (from scratch).  It's so simple, it's delicious, and its just engaging/messy enough to keep it relaxed and fun.  Both are virtually impossible to fail (if you over salt your soup, use raw potatoes!).  Plus they're both amazing and are eaten best with a healthy dose of netflix.

This is actually my go-to first date with girls, also.  So that's a thing.She has some pretty darn good recipesChinese hot pot, not sure if this counts. Beef Bourguignon. It was really delicious. I followed [this recipe.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/beef-bourguignon-recipe.html) I'd probably skip the cognac next time. First time I made it without the cognac, second time I used it. I didn't notice that much of a difference.If I'm cooking for less than ~9 people, I generally want everyone to just get the fuck out of the kitchen.  If my significant other wants to watch and talk, they can pull up a stool and have a glass of wine.. Is the word to google forhttp://chudo-povar.com/belyashi-domashnie-recept-belyashej-s-foto.html. Can google translate Why not make a basic Alfredo sauce and add some sweet Italian sausage, should go very well with polenta.I'm roasting a chicken this weekend, just to try this. Thank you, kind sir or madame.Pizza with friends can be casual but tasty. Most supermarket bakeries stock freshly made pizza dough. Load up on all the cheeses and toppings you like, maybe some spicy, zany ones too, and let people make their own the way they like it. It's not a couples thing unless it's a casual date, but it great for college buddies or with family and a few beers.Thanks!  I particularly like the brussels sprouts suggestion because I think they can be made ahead of time.  While I love eggs on polenta (it's my go-to for leftover polenta), I think it may be too much of a PITA to prep mid-dinner party.I'd want some nice seafood, like shellfish of some sort. Leeks, sriracha, aaaaand... I dunno, maybe something sweet that he can incorporate into the sauce? Some type of plain candy? We're trying live lobsters this valentines day! We'll see how it goes...

In the meantime though, we do love to grill together. Making side dishes and prepping the meats and drinks, it's always a lot of fun and not a whole lot that can go wrong until you burn it. But it's fun seeing him smoking up the grill and I always enjoy the part where you get to wait and sip until it's ready ;)so many times asked on reddit.  but i like sriracha, butter, honey and if i have it truffle oil in the butter.  but without it is sweet and spicy. deliciouswonton/rice wrappers, a new veggie (purple cauliflower, mini potatoes, collard greens), exotic fruit (dragon fruit, kumquat, star fruit, pomegranate), a microbrew/foreign flavored soda (tamarind, pineapple, or other unusual flavor), your favorite cookies/cookie dough, some sort of prepared item (frozen tv dinner, pot pie, pizza) and Jello (either powder or prepared) Thank you!

A cyst of some kind maybe? Did...*did you bite it??*I miss my Grandma now. Yours is adorable!a year ago i started volunteering with food not bombs we do a free meal downtown every saturday at noon. the people i met there are now my roommates and among my closest friends. what we cook is a little different every week, but typically there's fruit salad, green salad, stir fry with seitan, tea, garlic bread, etc.

I know you're particular about your thingsGet a meat thermometer then you'll never have to guessThe brown sugar is supposed to make them chewierPolenta party! Slice up a package of corn mush/polenta and fry it up in a bit of olive oil. Everyone helps fill bowls with tapenade, poco de gallo, goat cheese, hot sauce, sauted shrooms and whatever else fun you can find in the kitchen. They're like tiny taco pizzas :)My entire family gets in on the action on pizza night, it's great!My husband and I like to cook curries or stir fry. We usually put on some music, pull out all the veggies that are on the brink of going bad, open a beer, and start chopping. It's pretty simple prep work so we can just relax and enjoy each other's company. I've been on a [Dutch Baby](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/dutch-baby-recipe0.html) kick lately.  I'm also a fan of meatloaf in cast iron too.I make my wife clean the dishes. I like to make Japanese curry together with my friends. There's a fair amount of prep work you can divide around and it's easy to play around with the flavors as you go.i use a smoker, and an empty can would work fine, just like a wire stand almost.That looks delicious. How did it taste?My husband just won't gtfo of my way.

It doesn't matter what I'm carrying... Knives, hot pans of boiling water, parchment paper full of flour...After I was done frying some meat, some flour accidently got poured in when i knocked the bag open on the cabinet above the stove. I decided to continue to cook it and it formed a rather nice paste with the fats that burnt off the meat. I put this paste on top and it turned out pretty good in combonation with the meat.Pop them on a grilled cheese with a little barbecue sauce. Heaven.

Also, blend some with ACV, mustard, and honey, then mix the puree into mayonnaise. Best dip ever!I always liked to compare working the line with a good crew to dancing. Not that I know how to dance. But  if I could, I imagine it would be as much fun as tango dancers have with good dance partners.Mushroom and onion stroganoff. DESERT contest?  I would go with the Atacama, there are areas where rain has never fallen in recorded history.

If you are having a DESSERT contest I would do cookies.Making pasta from scratch. It's a little messy, but a lot of fun...especially with extra hands. You can make ravioli which is fairly simple and always tasty. my boyfriend and i didn't. then we identified why and worked on our problems (mostly i'm way too controlling and he was scared of making mistakes.) now we can cook together and our communication skills have improved.An old roommate and I had a pair of cheap pizza stones and we would throw pizza dinner parties: provide a few crusts and sauce and have friends bring over toppings. Tons of fun! My mom makes the whole family peel potatoes together, does that count?

My buddy and I used to live together, and we didn't cook together too often, but prepping/chopping veggies together was always a good time. :)Word of advice on the Fagor pressure cooker lid - it has a notch on the pot handle that HS to be lined up with a notch on the lid to give you the starting point for getting it sealed properly. I used mine a few times before I discovered that handy feature...Bitches love steak, put steak in it.I was trying to keep in mind the heaviness of the meal given what day it is.  That said we are both girls who enjoy a good meal, and dinner will be done earlier in the night.

I think I'm going to keep the portions small,  especially with the potatoes and asparagus.   "Backen macht Freude" (translates to "Baking is Fun") from 1979. I got some details mixed up though: The pictures weren't black and white photos, but handdrawn and it wasn't a cook book, but only had recipes for baking.On that note, Crme Brle is fairly easy to make and feels light. Also, it's delicious. Try a Grand Marnier Crme Brle!I live in a tiny Brooklyn apartment. My ex and I cooked wonderfully in a tiny intimate space. Even better that you're constantly rubbing against each other. I always pull the fat out at the large cavity opening and slip it under the breast skin. I think it's better than using butter. If you're doing it as a main course, it's more involved. Cut up some raw meat and veggies, put at the table with dipping sauces and the fondue pot with hot vegetable oil. Everyone basically cooks their own dinner at the table. My husband and I rarely cook dinner together, we have...uh...cooking personality conflicts? LOL. (He likes to use tons of pans and dishes and likes things made a particular way, whereas I prefer to make as little mess as possible and I'm a little more adventurous when it comes to trying new recipes)

Anywho, the few times we have both cooked together, usually one of us would do the main dish and the other would do the sides. Eg. He would roast a chicken and I would make the stuffing and veggies.Bummer.Goat cheese, pecans, cranberries, lemon, and mushrooms!Huh. I think it works well as a base, and then you can tweak it. Not sure why there would be hate.How to you make it a two person process? Seems like it takes one person to mix it all in the fondue pot and that's it.I hosted a dumpling party once. People really seemed to enjoy it. Made shrimp and pork dumpling in a variety of shapes, and cooked them in batches two different ways (steamed and pan fried).This only works in really big kitchens. At my place now- a three bedroom house- my kitchen floorspace is effectively as big as a public bathroom stall.

Any time someone needs to get in to the kitchen while I'm cooking, all work stops.


But to answer your question: My most fulfilling 'group cooking' experiences where long shifts cooking at a busy restaurant. When you have a good team and the workload is putting you almost in the weeds but not quite, you fall into a cooperative rhythm that I've since only ever experienced doing drill in the military. It's really quite something to be a part of. Heck, I sometimes even get nostalgic for those days... And then I remember how much I was paid. Whatever you just described, I want it.OP has a fagor.This sounds like an awesome meal. But as a girl I think it's a bit heavy for Valentine's dinner. You don't really want that whole 'OMG dinner was amazing, I'm so stuffed' feeling on a night like this. It kinda ruins the mood for most girls. Although it depends on how comfortable you guys are in the relationship, if you've cooked like this for her before and how that worked out bedroom wise.

If you want to lighten it up you can go with a different app or make the dessert more simple. It would depend on your timeline for the night. If you're planning to cuddle and watch a movie after dinner you may not need to lighten it up at all. You can space out the dessert and have some time to digest everything.

If you are planning more of a straight to bed night then I would change it up. Maybe do half the strawberries filled and the other half dipped rather than both, that way she can choose. Or even just strawberries and cream with a nice light wine would work well.

I really like adding the asparagus as others have mentioned. I would not add this if oral is involved in your sexy times though.


I know you only asked for menu feedback, but there is just more to think about when it is for a night like this. Hope this was helpful.I second this! Also for leftover peeled tails, make crawfish bread! Take about 1 1/2 c peeled tails, one small onion diced, a bit of tomato paste (3-4 tsp), splash of white wine,  fresh basil and garlic, and one tube of Pillsbury French bread.  Pre-heat oven per bread instructions. On a cookie sheet with parchment paper, carefully take bread dough and unroll. There will be a visible seam. This is tricky, as its not really meant to do this. You will end with a sheet of bread dough. Saut onion and garlic. When onion is translucent, reduce heat and stir in tomato paste and wine. Throw in tails and cook until warm (this is assuming your crawfish tails were refrigerated). Salt and pepper to taste. Toss in basil. Pour onto center of rolled out bread dough sheet. Carefully fold bread around crawfish mixture and roll edges under to seal. Bake by package instructions. About 5mins before you pull out, sprinkle the top with shredded cheese.I'm from Alabama, but got this from a gentleman from LA.  This is my version, but you could experiment and do amazing things with the same basic idea. Sorry for any typos, on mobile.[My family recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSrEysi2Ro4)My wife and I did this once.  I had polenta, lamb chops, maple syrup, and...I think asparagus.  Wasn't too hard, reallly.  I'd say pick 3 main ingredients and one odd thing!Apple and walnut stuffing, roughly ground walnuts under the skin, then rub it down with maple syrup.My wife and I do not get along in the kitchen most days.Yeah it was in another post I saw and people either really hated it or loved it Surf and turf with pasta:

Steaks on the grill will take 3 minutes to prep, and 8 minutes if you like medium rare.  Boil up some pasta.  Saute some shrimp with some shallots and garlic in butter.  Pour the shrimp and butter over the pasta, and toss, adding a squeeze of lemon.  Asparagus takes 7-10 minutes to roast, and you can heat a loaf of french bread while you're at it.  All told, this meal can be on the table in 45 minutes, max.  Hope it turned out well!Chocolate, Editable panties, Flavored lube(your choice), [Cool wHip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lich59xsjik#t=53), and a bottle of yours and his favorite  wine/beer...

Americas test kitchen is a good base recipe.Indeed. Also, if you begin with the aromatics first (onion, garlic) and sautee until translucent, then brown the rice, it adds another awesome layer into the mix. NoI had to spend a week early in my relationship in a hotel room with a kitchenette.  I was impressed with what was available even though it was kind of a shithole. My SO was impressed with the quality of meals i could make in such a tiny space. Just walk through your meal in your mind  beforehand, and make sure you won't need any complex tools. It can really fuck things up if it's crunch time and you don't have a cheese grater/can opener/whatever it is that you need.thanksI should up my game and try to make this fusion.You can TRY contacting the folks at:

http://www.lacrawfish.com/

I've seen in another forum where somebody from Montreal said that they were able to get crawfish from that source.  That may be old information though, so you'll need to check it out.  Bringing live plants or animals through customs can sometimes be a problem.

Easy Oreo truffles !
WHAT YOU NEED
1 package Double Stuffed Oreos
4 oz Cream Cheese, you may add up to 8 oz, I just like the consistency best with 4 oz.
Dipping Chocolate, almond bark is my favorite because it hardens faster and quicker and doesn't melt as easy as chocolate chips after it sets up.
INSTRUCTIONS
Chop Oreos up finely in a food processor. Save some of the finely crushed Oreos for poop garnish later and set it aside. You don't need too much.
With hands (or a spoon, I just think hands are faster), mash softened cream cheese and crushed Oreos until well combined.
Roll into 1" balls and place on a wax covered cookie sheet. Put in freezer for 15 minutes.
While balls are in freezer, melt chocolate according to directions.
Pull the Oreo Truffles out of freezer, and dip into chocolate. Garnish with reserved Oreo crumbs before the chocolate sets up.
Let chocolate set, refrigerate and enjoy!I made it last year for vday. Almost burnt the house down. My wife to this day calls me flamb. Steaks were great, though.I'm sure these two threads would be useful for you

At least in Texas they sell it at all major grocery stores, I usually buy it at Kroger or Walmart. Luckily he spatchcocked it so no fisting required.This is how I make mine.  Very consistent - very yum.  If you have people who like spicy food, you can add some heat with a finely diced jalapeno or two.

* 6 Tbsp. olive oil
* 2 cup long grain rice, uncooked
* 2 tsp. fresh minced garlic
* 1 tsp. kosher salt
* 1 tsp. cumin
* 1 c. tomato sauce
* 2 (14 oz) cans chicken broth
* 6 Tbsp. finely chopped fresh cilantro

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the rice and gently stir until rice begins to lightly brown. Add the garlic, salt, and cumin and stir the rice til it looks golden. Add the tomato sauce, chicken broth, and cilantro and turn the heat up to medium high. Bring the mix to a boil then turn the heat to low and cover the pan with a lid. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and fluff with a fork.

Serves 8.I like your style. Damn thats a lot of seasoning.  I'm wishlisting it though, I'll give it a try sometimeCheesy as it is (sorry), fondue is always a winner.that's not my Shinjo. Cactus salad with sand-coal cooked scorpion.That sounds amazing.  Do you have a recipe for this?its good to cook curry for a long simmer but never over cook. it will destroy all your vegetables in the curry. cooking a liquid longer means the flavor will be more concentrated since the water evaporates. but that also means everything else is submerged in liquid longer and the original liquid will be thicker.I almost burned the dorm down in college because I didn't put water in the Mac and cheese.  Fire alarms went off on the second night of college... Oopsas a Canadian, where can I buy some crawfish?Nice!  I am half Hispanic and half white,  this is actually my white dad's recipe. He loved how his mother in law made rice but thought it needed more color so he came up with this (adding bell pepper). The reason it kicks ass is the browning of the dry rice. Delicious. I wouldn't be able to tell you without tasting it.  Give it a little bit of a taste and then describe it and we'll try to tell you what it is Cover the thing with salt, inside and out. Like [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4z_N0GjqCY) The salty drippings are great for vegetables or whatever else is going with your meal. You can do other stuff, too, in addition to proper salting.This. I tried a ton of Spanish rice recipes and they always tasted totally different from restaurant's.

cook on convection at 425. it wins every time.Are you talking whole chicken?

On the skin, I put lots of lemon, olive oil or melted butter, and some salt. Sometimes herbs like rosemary or bay leafs on or under the skin.

Inside the uh, chicken carcass butthole, I put half a sweet onion and half a lemon with the skin scored. And sprigs of herbs (thyme, bay, rosemary, dill, whatever).

Most importantly, I put the chicken on top of a bed of vegetables. Potatoes, onions, carrots, sweet potatoes, celery, beets, whatever "long cook" vegetables. Even stale-ish bread crumbs if I want something stuffingy. Dried fruits if I want sweetness (these are good for going on top of or in the chicken too). All the delicious of the chicken melts into the vegetables and you end up with this chicken fat impregnated lemony orgy of nutrition.

I will never understand people who go for boneless skinless breasts. Just...why?Gross! What color is that thing that shouldn't be there?That's the desert bro.  So no salt at all?**Chicken Tacos**

**Ingredients:**

3 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 garlic cloves , minced
2 teaspoons minced chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
1/2 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds)
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
 Salt and pepper
12 (6-inch) flour tortillas

**Instructions:**

**POACH CHICKEN**

	Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat.

	Add garlic and chipotle and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

	Stir in orange juice, Worcestershire, and  cup cilantro and bring to boil.

	Add chicken and simmer, covered, over medium-low heat until meat registers 160 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking.

	Transfer chicken to plate, leaving the sauce, and tent with foil.

**SHRED AND SAUCE**

	Increase heat to medium-high and cook until liquid is reduced to  cup, about 5 minutes.

	Off heat, whisk in mustard.

	Add remaining cilantro to skillet and toss until well combined.

	Using 2 forks, shred chicken into bite-sized pieces.

	Season with salt and pepper, and return to skillet
Yep...what they said...seriously...good eats,,,try it with tomatoes out of the can over the rice after cooking.Coconut oil under the skin.If the chicken isn't cold and pink, you won't get sick.

Fact.Sounds good.I use the same recipe, but instead of canned tomatoes I use my favorite jar of salsa in a 1-1 ratio with the chicken broth.

It's delicious both ways.Circle of Life, baby.....I added more than a hint, and it tastes great. I definitely taste the difference. I have 3 cats so this is a pretty good idea.Flip it upside down and feel near where the wings meet the bird there are 2 dollops of meat on each side of the spine they are like jewel shaped or circular. If you push with your finger they kinda pop out because behind them is pure bone it is like hidden meat jewels. The texture is inbetween dark and white or a lot like a part of the thigh but slightly different.Butter and salt.I only peel them so I can use the peels for making stock.It is kind of like the salmon head, cheek piece, it is just so different than the rest of the animal or fish. That is my conclusion of it. My favorite part on a chicken is kind of a dick move to take, but you slice off the meat and skin where the drumstick meats the thigh like the protruding meat and skin off of the part where the drumstick meets the thigh if you know what I mean it is so tasty.I baked some chocolate chip cookies, and I SUCK at backing.

Didn't have any brown sugar. So I subbed in regular sugar and agave nectar.

Holy shit they blew my mindI make this all the time. Super easy and tastes just like any Mexican restaurant around. I usually just buy the Queso Velveta when I can't find white american at the deli. It works great to.

Queso Blanco Dip (White Cheese Dip),

1 1/4 (1.25) lb block White American Cheese (Land O'Lakes brand preferred), cut into 1-inch cubes

1/4 cup diced green chiles, from a can

2 pickled jalapenos, chopped

1 ounce pickled jalapeno juice

2/3 cup whole milk

1/2 cup cold water

pinch of cumin (optional)

Toss all ingredients into a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 5 minutes, stopping to stir after every minute. The mixture might seem watery during the first few stirs, but should come together as a nice runny dip after all the cheese is melted.

Serve immediately as a dip with tortilla chips or as a sauce over your favorite Mexican dish.

*Recipe Note: White American cheese is found at most deli counters in your local grocery store.

*Reheat Instructions: Store any leftover cheese dip in the fridge. Reheat in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds until creamy and hot. Yo don't add asparagus to your Valentine's Day dinner... It makes your cum taste extremely bitter, which it already will be from the steak.Add a little sodium citrate. You are welcome.I don't cook meat often because it intimidates me and I'm terrified of making myself sick if I do it wrong. I successfully made a delicious chicken stir fry only loosely following a recipe. I was so proud!

I still maintain that baking is way easier than cooking. But even if the surface appears to be jerky, the total moisture loss is pretty insignificant. Kenji from food labs did a test, and any surface moisture lost in that manner would only have been lost through cooking to begin with.Gee, thanks!No asparagus on Valentine's!!! No no no! Within two hours, you'll both have the asparagus pee! Goat Cheese (or feta, or gorgonzola)
Sundried Tomatoes
Peppered Bacon (or panchetta or proscuitto)
Jicama
Basil or Cilantro
Curveball like Cheez-its, Pretzel Flips, Ritz Crackers, Raisin Bran. Something processed that can be used, but requires a ton of ingenuity
Maybe its just me but I've always slow-cooked the curry without the coconut milk. Then added the coconut milk last thing.

Also curry as a leftover the next day tastes 10X better!Brown some white rice in olive oil and garlic,  add canned stewed tomato, onion and bell pepper. Add chicken broth until your liquid (including tomato fluid) amount is double the measurement of your rice, bring to boil. Cover, turn down heat, simmer 30 min. that was goodSo i just tried to make some. Advice to anyone who sees this Don't use queso blanco, queso quesadilla, or queso fresco. The cheese won't melt and it stays likes grainy kurds.Toast them in a separate pan, or after the onions.  Just let em chill on some heat before adding the other stuffI like a beef stocked based red wine sauce w/onions for my wellington.I did this, thank you. Smells/tastes great. Can't wait to eat it for real.Yes to this. Thai style curries aren't the same without the fish sauce especially. A hint  makes a world of difference.If you have small heart shaped pans....make a pretzel crust (rather than graham cracker), cover that with a layer of either caramel or peanut butter, and then fill with chocolate mousse? Boil a whole lemon (or two for a big bird) for a few minutes, take it out and stab it a few times with a sharp knife then place in cavity.  It keeps things really tender vAlso disconnect the closest smoke detector. When I do this, it the column of heat produced can be enough to set mine off. The resulting flavor is awesome however!strap on dildoWhite people be crazyWontons come to mind for me. Each person can make a handful of them, and since most people probably aren't expert wonton makers, its fun to see whose turn out better or who can make them faster.

Also, home-made pizzas where each person makes their own, but that feels like the easy answer.Nutritional yeast has a sort of cheesey umami flavor. It's like the health food solution to MSG. Word.Ho Lee FukHubby and I enjoy making homemade pizzasGarlic fried green beans are also good. Although, maybe not on Valentine's dayLooks like you've got a lot of good advice here. I can add one more piece that has nothing to do with the flame.
Consider toasting your peppercorns first. Either in a medium -high pan or a 375 oven. The dimension of flavour it adds is phenomenal.   Then smash them with a mallet and your ready to make your meal.  Good luck!Not really. You make the sauce, and once it's fully cooked you add the pasta and cook it as in water. I have always just put the spices in after the onions, but maybe I'll start toasting the powder stuff. Next time! Thanks.I do it with powders and suchDoes anyone know how to make the dough at a pizza restaurant?Heirloom tomatoes, romanesco, fennel, champagne/wine (depending on the protein), and a tomahawk steak or mussels.

There are quite a few different directions that you/he can go with all of those ingredients.  You also get the added benefit of having a glass of champagne or wine together while cooking too.  I'm also a fan of the purple sweet potatoes that have already been suggested.  Perhaps a spicy ingredient? Is this only true for fresh spices? All the spices I'm using are pre-ground and dried. I know I should use more fresh stuff but I'm a student and still slowly building my arsenal.That depends entirely on ambient temperature and humidity. A refrigerator, where most people would do it, is pretty dry. It won't take anywhere near the long for the surface to dehydrated with the appearance and texture of jerky. I know this from experience.wait, i'm assuming the can is empty, right? this sounds awesome, but i don't want to explode my oven.Toast your spices in a hot pan (don't burn!) to get some richer flavors.  I'm sure google can tell you how better than meHot and fast with a small chicken.  I prefer less than 4 lbs.  I follow Mark Bittman's minimalist roasted chicken.  Just salt and pepper the outside.  Preheat a cast iron skillet either in the stovetop or in a 450 degree oven place chicken in pan, pan in oven.  Turn down to 400 after 10 minutes. Take out when chicken hits 155 in breast for me the whole thing takes about 30-40 minutes. This is deliciousI'm sorry for being the amateur here and asking the stupid question, but... What the heck us the oyster? I do roast chicken often and I guess I've been missing out.I use a dry can. The standing roast allows all he skin to brown and the empty can i think helps conduct some heat into the bird. I put the livers and gizzards on the top of the can.

The chicken comes out moist and perfect, but that is because I dont over cook it.

As far as him doing it on the grill... I am against chicken on the grill. Its just a pain in the ass and adds zero value to the end product.Put everything except the coconut milk in the slow cooker and you can leave that for hours, add the coconut milk at the end with some fresh coriander.yeah i'm sort of divided on that, but... if the smells aren't coming off the chicken... and it's an important part of taste.... but yeah, maybe they're just locked in.  idk.   Once it's all cut up and it smells like nothing though if that's the case, then that'd probably be bad.Sounds so ghetto... I'm gonna have to do it.Pop on the stove in lemon flavored grapeseed oil and just add salt and a pad of butter half way through poppingAhahah thisguy is mad as fuck m8.

Ahahahahaha, try harder again plz.Will have to try this, as it sounds delicious! We ate them with butter and sour cream. Oh, the taste...Oh I definitely agree that smell is an important part of taste. I just don't know if his assertion that the smell of roasting chicken in the house = losing flavor in the bird. I have tried several of the temperatures, times,oils, and spicing methods but the best whole chickens every time are when I preheat to 500 degrees F.  Wash the chicken off and out and then dry it completely.  I use a standing rack much like a beer can rack, but have used just a rack to get the bird off the cookie sheet. Salt and pepper it inside and out and add Thyme when i feel like it.
Then put it in the oven for 50 minutes.  When that time is up I pull it out and let it sit at least 15 minutes before cutting it.
It has always been very juicy...even more than when I tried brining it.   It's simple and everyone loves it.A valid opinion, Ill even agree go so far as to agree with you about having far to much time on my hands. Subtract chicken, insert pig. flavocol and peanut oil here, this is the correct answerSri Lankan here: add the coconut milk right before the end, when the meat is tender and juicy and the sauce has been reduced slightly, basically right before you're ready to go - let the curry simmer for about three minutes and then turn off. I say think romantic. Strawberries, raspberries, champagne, chocolate...Maybe a couple of petit filet, or lobster tails (I'd do both), some asparagus (prosciutto if you want to wrap the spears), some pasta, shallots, garlic, heavy cream, parmesan etc. Maybe that makes it too easy, but I'm sure you both want a nice dinner in the end. Fucking fagors...Purple sweet potatoes, goat sholder, jicama, red onion, and leeks.I was a Chef in fine dining restaurants for 10 years before changing careers. Panna Cotta is a cream dessert, almost like a set custard, It's very easy to make and most people find it impressive. It's my generic go-to to impress people without putting in a whole bunch of effort (Like making deconstructed macroon platters with wild fruit).Ahh yes, exploding fetus syndrome, this occurs when contaminated food has caused the fetus to start rejecting it from both ends if you know what I mean. This usually results in pissed off fetus. I'm starting to like oven-roasted broccoli and brussels sprouts in place of the pasta.  Gives it a bit of sweetness and crunch; only problem is there's no starchy pasta water to adjust the consistency of the sauce.My favorite is salt pepper and stuffed with lemon and thyme. Simple but delicious!This is wisdom ^

I didn't know about the site you linked, but it looks pretty helpful! I'm browsing it as we speak. I guess I just fell for the uniqueness of the blade. The cleaver likeness of it attracted me to it, but it seems the heft and metal used wouldn't really fit my uses for it. Gordon Ramsay has two 3 stars as well and 15 others with 1 star each, Thats a hell of a more successful career than Keller, not a 'reality TV star'. Thomas Keller also isn't some 'final authority on roast chicken and everyone else is below him' nor does he have 'the most famous recipe for roast chicken'(lol what? The guys unknown here in Europe.) like that guy was making out. I imagine you're a talented cook, I am shamed to admit I do not know what Panna cotta is? You can't mess up the combo of: pasta, cream, shallots, parmesan-reggiano. Optional fifth ingredient for me would be lemon, parsley, dry white wine, etc. Virtually any protein can be worked in to this, I've done everything from fish, to shellfish, to sausage, pancetta, chicken, even steak.Both Thai and Indian curries are supposed to break. The oil slick on top is a sign that the sauce has been cooked enough. Perhaps yours didn't break because you used a brand of coconut milk that contained an emulsifier. If you use straight coconut milk, the sauce should start to break before you even add your meat.

Yogurt-based curries can curdle, though, which can be a little unappetizing. I add yogurt close to the end. Crme frache is less authentic, but more robust against curdling.

(Of course, if you like your sauce unbroken, there's nothing wrong with that. I think it's good to know the traditional way to make something, and then decide whether or not you want to deviate from tradition.)Strawberry Panna Cotta w/ Lime &amp; Black Pepper sorbet.Butter and Old Bay.  So simple and delicious.When I make thai curry I saute the onions in coconut oil and then add all the spices and cook it all together for a minute or two. Supposedly this wakes the spices up. Then I add the coconut milk. I've simmered it up to 45 mins.

What's interesting is it is more flavorful the next day. Instead of cooking it longer perhaps let it sit a few hours before serving?Pelmeni I had growing up were boiled... This dish was fried.There's no need to use a nasty word like 'fagor'. I will do this. Thank you. Pelmeni are also similar. In the restaurant where we actually ran this dish, we only ever had just the breasts. You could try what my dad and, pretty sure, what traditional Chinese dishes do... They make a very light soup out of the leftover carcass/bones and small amount of meat. Even the wings. The legs and thigh you should definitely try to roast/confit  but the leftover wings and actually body, try and make a light soup.
Now I've never actually made a soup out of it myself but I've seen my dad do it and could definitely easily recreate it. Try this:
You'll need....
-Onion(about a cup of chopped onions)
-Garlic (2 cloves minced)
-Bay leaf (1-2 leaves)
-Star Anise (1 piece)
-Vegetable oil (just eyeball this)
-Scallions, Green Onions whatever you would like to call them (half a bunch, sliced thin and straight into small rounds)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Water

Start off by oiling a little bit and seasoning the bones just like you did the duck breasts. Sear the bones and the leftover bones of the duck, you just want nice colour just like the duck breasts. Take the bones out and set them aside. In the same oil, you may need to add a little more, sweat the onions, garlic, bay leaves and star anise. You just want the onions and garlic just cooked. At this point you can deglaze if you with a LITTLE bit of white wine or rice wine. If using Rice wine you'll want about 100mL, less if using just regular white wine. Add the bones back in. Now it may look awkward because the carcass is still intact. You can and should compress the bones here and just press them down and break the bones down a bit to create "space" if you will. Add in your water. Should have enough water to just cover your bones and crank the heat. Once it comes to a boil you can turn it down and let it simmer on medium-low. The longer you let this sit, the more flavour you get out of the bones. Now, when my dad makes this he adds in potatoes that have been peeled and cut into medium sized chunks when he adds in the water and once the potatoes are cooked he leaves the soup as is and tosses in the scallions. Potatoes or not, once it's simmered enough for your liking, add in the sliced scallions and leave the soup to sit for a few minutes before eating.

Hope this helps and have a great Valentine's Day meal!&gt; And 40 minutes is the minimal time that Kenji recommends in that article, but it actually takes a lot longer for the surface of the steak to dry naturally. I'll probably salt my steaks a day in advanced now.

It's important not to let them dry too long, though -- you don't want it too dehydrated because that will change the shape and texture of the steak. Just check it once in a while.

Thomas Keller has 2 michelin 3 star restaurants I'd stick with lighter proteins and vegetables and skip the starch and cheese because potential after-dinner Valentine's recreation. Maybe shrimp or oysters, eggplant, radishes, blood oranges, and sorrel. That would be fun for me, anyway.I'm sure his recipe makes a great chicken, but that video has a whole lot of misinformation.

1) High temperatures don't automatically make a chicken dry (see the Thomas Keller recipe that is tried and true and everyone loves). Overcooking the chicken makes it dry. The part where he says those high temperatures would hurt your hand so they must be bad is just ridiculous.

2) No shit the brined chicken is more moist than the other, it's because you literally put more liquid into it and he didn't overcook it. It just bugs me that he's not accurately explaining why his is more moist.

3) Aroma doesn't necessarily mean lost flavor. The amount of molecules required to produce aroma is so small that it's not like you are using it up to make it smell good. It smells less aromatic because less of those flavors exist at the time.I love Cook's Illustrated's. Salt, pepper, olive oil all over bird. Tie legs, tuck wings. Preheat oven to 450 with stainless skillet in it. Put it thigh sides down for 30 minutes. Turn off oven, don't open door, and leave chicken inside for another 30 minutes. In winter, I do it 45 in oven, 15 off (oven cools down faster). Perfectly moist, crispy skin.What's the purpose of this?foods you likeLiving in a Dominican neighborhood.

Just tent the chicken for the first 45 minutes and uncover for remaining time...also larger chickens should be cooked a little longer


I've made this recipe at least 2 dozen times with tons of great feedback from the family[Fernand Point's Ma Gastronomie](http://www.amazon.com/Ma-Gastronomie-Fernand-Point/dp/1585679615) is a great book that writes recipes in this manner. One recipe, for example, is for Oeufs  la Gele, which is as follows:

"Poach 2 eggs for each person to be served, and prepare a jelly with pigs' feet and some veal and chicken bones. In the bottom of a mold, arrange a little foie gras and the poached eggsPour in the jelly, allow it to set, and serve chilled."

Fun fact: When Thomas Keller wrote his book, "The French Laundry," his initial intentions were to make his cookbook similar to Fernand Point's, which he calls the most inspiring to him. The current edition now has an intro written by Thomas Keller. Had he had his way, his recipe for clam chowder would have been written as "Sweat open some clams in white wine and herbs, incorporate the juice into a cream sauce, spoon a little sauce onto each serving plate and top with a pan-fried cod cake, then a piece of sauted cod fillet, and, finally, a 'chowder' made from the reserved clams." Chicken is actually quite a simple but versatile protein. To answer your question directly, 500 degrees 10 minutes per pound...season however you like.

Perfect every time.I never really got the oyster love. I don't think it's significantly better than anything else around it, and I feel like Thomas Keller gushes about it in his recipe.Hey David, 60 C is a little bit hot for a sous vide steak. I did a delicious sous vide tbone yesterday at 55.5 C and I don't like rare steak. But you also could have ruined it in the sear. I like to put mine on ice for a little while before searing and you've got to remember to get the steak really dry with paper towels before you sear. It should be a smoking hot (preferably cast iron) skillet for about 45 seconds per side.#####&amp;#009;

This is my advice whenever this subject comes up. I'm going to straight up copy and paste one of my previous posts:

---

I'm still not sure why carbon steel frying pans haven't caught on yet.

Basically carbon steel frying pans are a kind of happy medium between cast iron and your standard non-stick pan. Like non-sticks, they heat up pretty quickly, but like cast iron they are very durable, can tolerate very high heats (unlike a non-stick!) and once properly seasoned are pretty non-stick. I love it for making eggs in the morning because unlike a cast iron, I don't have to wait 5-10 minutes for it to get properly hot.

If you recognize the metal from their use in woks, which are pretty bad at holding heat, skillet style carbon-steel pans like the kind I'm talking about tend to be a little thicker and hold heat better.

There are downsides: fast heating means fast cooling, too, so unlike cast iron, they can't hold heat as well and you're not going to get the kind of sear and heat you can get with a cast iron or a stainless steel pan. On the other hand, they're not terrible at holding heat, and if you get a bigger pan (which you might want anyway) and leave yourself some breathing room, this isn't a problem most of the time.

They're also more expensive than cast iron and most non-sticks, but not by much. They also last forever (unlike non-sticks) so it ends up paying for itself over time.

If you're trying to minimize kitchen items, the carbon steel frying pan is a great all-around, utility player.

A good option is the [Lodge Pre-Seasoned Carbon Steel Skillet](http://www.amazon.com/Lodge-CRS12-Pre-Seasoned-Skillet-12-inch/dp/B005U93RYW), which like their cast iron comes pre-seasoned (but it's a good idea to do a round or three of seasoning anyway). If you get this, I highly recommend you pick up a [silicone handle](http://www.amazon.com/Lodge-ASCRHH11-Silicone-Handle-Holder/dp/B00C61O4ZI/ref=pd_sim_k_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=078K4JVKBRCB70YP352Y). It's almost a necessary accessory as it turns the pan from painful to hold due to heat and form to a friendly handshake from your frying pan.

That is the one I have and it's easily my most used pan. That said, I do eat way more eggs than seared meats. On the other hand, if I had to I'd still feel comfortable cooking a good, well-seared steak in this pan if for some reason I couldn't reach for my cast iron (I couldn't say the same about a non-stick).

If you want a little bit better heat retention, the [deBuyer](http://www.amazon.com/DeBuyer-Carbon-Steel-Frying-Diameter/dp/B000ECQ83M/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421116664&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=de+buyer+carbon+steel) is in the same price range, but it's a little heavier, which'll help it retain heat. It doesn't come pre-seasoned, so you'll have to put a little bit more work into it. I don't own this, but it's generally a good, popular brand.This plus a little fresh ground black pepper is my go-to popcorn recipe.I have no cooking advice, but...

If you really want to make this unforgettable, make another mystery basket with heels, lingerie, and whatever else tickles your guys' fancy. Hand it to him after dinner. I'd never forget that valentine's. I have this recipe pinned on my pinterest but haven't tried it yet. Seems legit. http://eatingonadime.com/mexican-white-cheese-dip/As Kriegenstein mentioned, thickness and cut are pretty important. To elaborate, if you're searing a thin steak, you're probably also cooking to the center, undoing all the good your sous-vide did. Get steaks that are cut 1.5-2 inches thick (or buy a whole Prime Rib rack and cut your own steaks!).

One other reason your steaks didn't turn out could be the fat content of your steaks. Fattier meat with more streaks of fat (marbling) will come out juicier. If you bought Select or Choice grade steaks, it's possible they were too lean. Prime grade steaks generally have better marbling (and are more expensive). I have seen some pretty choice (heh) Choice steaks though, so just use your eyes and remember that more streaks of fat is generally better.

Less likely explanations:

How much fat did you use to sear? You do want a decent amount in the pan in order to get the best searing. If you used little or no oil, the steak is only getting properly heated where it's coming into contact with the pan, which could be a few concentrated spots. This could make the sear slower (and make the inside cook more) since those parts that aren't in direct contact with pan or fat are just relying on the radiated heat/steam to cook.

Last answer, probably least likely, but what material is your grill pan? If it's anything other than cast-iron, enameled cast-iron, or stainless steel, there's a good chance your pan isn't good enough at holding heat to quickly sear your steak before the insides cook.

For more tips, Serious Eats does a pretty good primer on doing steaks sous-vide. Read here:

http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/03/how-to-sous-vide-steak.html

I also recommend this article, which isn't directly about sous-vide but is a pretty good compendium on steaks in general:

http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/05/pad-thai-popcorn-how-five-seconds-of.html140F is actually more straight-medium than medium-well/well-done, which for a lot of people is still a pretty tasty steak (see links in other post). That said, I do agree that 54 (130F) is probably where you want to aim, but going up those degrees probably isn't so bad depending on your tastes.What style does he like to cook?

I would suggest ingredients that go well with that flavor profile, but something that's new and exciting for him.

Like maybe buy some pancetta or smoked sausage if he uses bacon a lot.

Instead of carrots or parsnips, get a different, lesser used root vegetable like a rutabega.

I would stick with things that are similar to what he uses a lot, but just different enough that it really gets his brain working. Copied and pasted from my answer to a similar post yesterday.
I would cook the breasts sous vide, that is put the raw breasts in a ziploc bag and submerge the bags in 140 degree water for an hour. My crockpot on the warm setting will hold water right around 140-141. It makes the most tender, moist chicken you've ever tasted. Get the cooked breasts cold again in the fridge or some ice water, pat them dry, rub them with a little oil and a generous amount of cajun or creole seasoning and sear them in a smoking hot skillet for about 45 seconds on each side. Now you've got perfect blackened chicken that you can slice and put on a nice big tossed salad or put in a big flour tortilla with cheese, peppers and onions and grill in a skillet for quesadillas.I would use a shallow dish otherwise, as others have suggested, it won't be cooked in the middle. I did this once and it wasn't the prettiest creme brulee I had made but it was cooked evenly. I usually cook mine whole in a crockpot and then broil it for about ten minutes.I usually add two forkfuls of sauerkraut to the liquid and let it brown up a bit too. Id recommend leaving the dairy/coconut out until near the end (last 10 mins), as I've had them separate and it looks pretty bad. Wine Pairings?


White Zinfadel or Bianco for your app and either a Bordeaux, an Australian Shiraz, or a Pinot Noir for your main. For your dessert champagne would be nice, BUT Id probably shoot for prosecco. Its lighter and cheaper.This is the right answer
Usually the way Thomas Keller shows if it is just salt and pepper, trussed, is a skillet in the oven if I roast in the oven. I have a countertop rotisserie though and normally truss with some twine and either salt and pepper or Old Bay Seasoning. If I use just salt and pepper I will usually rub some olive oil on the bird so the salt and pepper will adhere. I like my chicken pretty simple. Rub the skin with a mix of butter, salt, pepper, garlic, lemon zest and time. Then shove a lemon it its butt, along with some of the butter mix. Roast until done (using a thermomemter is best). The gravy you get from this is sexual.I'm not convinced about their mixers. I found my mum's 20 year old Kenwood Chef to be a million times better than a Kitchen Aid mixer. I use the Kenwood constantly as I run a small cake business. Did you calibrate your thermometer first? Boil some water and take its temperature. Make sure the thermometer reads 100C.

How thick was the steak? Because searing on high heat adds a fair amount of heat to the steak. If it's too thin then you're going to be cooking the steak all the way through just on the sear. Also the heat will continue to coast up even after you take the meat off - by as much as 5 degrees in some cases.

You did use a vaccuum-sealed bag right? You didn't just cook the steak in water?

Here's a pretty good primer. Maybe you can tell where things went off the rails. http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/sous-vide-steak* 1/2 C Yellow Popcorn Kernels
* 1/2 t Flavocol
* 1 heaping T Coconut oil

simple, and deliciousI would say cook it normally, with the only added cooking time being to reduce your sauce. I find leaving to cook for a while breaks down the onions and such too much.

Also, consider putting in the juice and rind of a lime, and a tablespoon of fish sauce and brown sugar each (per about 4 portions).A lemon and lime. Both smashed on a countertop, rolled, holes cut in several places. Both stuck inside the chicken with fresh garlic cloves. Do the same prep to a small orange and put that in the butt end.

Before stuffing with citrus and garlic, salt the pepper the cavity. I make bread a fair bit and I usually leave my yeast dough to rise for a couple of hours. I wait until it's doubled in size. It really depends on how warm it is though. The only dough I leave in the fridge are for flat breads like chapatis and naans.  Those I'd leave for a couple of hours minimum too.Vegetables are a necessity, and never too much!Butter and seasoning salt I recently switched from peeling to not peeling because I lost my peeler. Long story short, I won't be buying a replacement any time soon. Newfoundland savoryI honestly wouldn't worry about it. A slow cooker on warm isn't really all that hot. It depends on brand, but most don't even keep meat hot enough to keep it food safe (which is why they don't recommend leaving meat on "warm" longer than 4 hours). I've never peeled a carrot, always seemed silly to me.Please don't forget the andouille sausage! My mom always showed and told me this, ever since I was little. OMG YES!!!! Thank you!!!!Muh gawd that sounds amazing. Trying that tonight. Thank you. Dijon mustard rubbed all over! Pizza! I used to make homemade pizza using cartelized onions as the sauce, topped with fresh mozzarella and prosciutto. I see you requested meat-free recipes, the ham provided a nice salty counterpoint to the sweet onions. You could probably substitute sauted vegetables or mushrooms instead. YesBelyashi?Only if I'm cooking for people that get grossed out by peels. I also almost never peel potatoes. I can't relate to people thinking skin-on is disgusting or crude. It usually adds flavor and a substantial amount of nutrients. For my tastes, the only exceptions I can think of for root vegetables is when something calls for mashed potatoes to be creamy and, of course, onions.Does nutritional yeast add flavor? Or is it for the vitamins? I always add a little bit of MSG to my popcorn, adds that certain je ne sais quoi.Skip the boxed macaroni and just get [this](http://amzn.com/B0099XPG94)I love to pair caramelized onion with blue cheese on a burger. So for a veggie option, how about a nice burger bun with a portobello mushroom as the burger patty (preferably grilled, but you could cook it in the oven), with some crumbled blue cheese and caramelized onion on top, on a generous bed of arugula and a bunch of super thinly sliced raw red onion, all drizzled with some balsamic vinegar to brighten it up and balance it out. Umami heaven - and an absolute flavor bomb!Start with a really good chicken.  As fresh as possible.  The makes a huge difference.  If you can get one slaughtered the same day that is best.  I really should up my game, apparently I'm mixing techniques from both Indian and Thai curries. Maybe I'll do a bit more googling and stick to one or the other. Or just stick to my plan and call it fusion. Thanks for the info!I go very simple, I rub the whole outside with vegetable oil, sprinkle with salt, and throw a handful of peeled garlic cloves and a few thyme sprigs into the cavity, and roast it super hot, like 450 if it's a smaller bird.Just make a steak salad, heavy on the steak. [Butterfly it.](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/05/butterflied-roasted-chicken-with-quick-jus-recipe.html) There's no better way to roast a chicken. Hands down.If you cook a dairy/coconut oil based curry for ages in a crock pot or the stove top, the sauce will break and you'll be left with a big pile of oil floating on the rest of your ingredients.  Thai curries can be cooked for a while without this happening; I've kept them on the stove for about an hour without any ill effects.Shit yeah, man! And I'm a big supporter of both drinking heavily while home cooking, and also a bunch of big ass fresh basil leaves. Well done!Way back when she was still among the living, my grandma would do a homemade fried chicken dinner for the whole family every couple of Sundays.

I don't know what we little brats did to deserve it, but every time, she'd give one of the oysters to me, and one to my sister. She was the best. I don't usually cook on Valentine's Day, but when I do I go for light and sweet. If you're planning on some downstairs high fiving you don't want to have just gone through several courses of rich, heavy food.You sure about that? I'm pretty sure my oven would stand up to a fire within better than my microwave would.I do this all the time, it's delicious.  It's really the only reason why I buy boxed macaroni now.I froze in little ice cube potions, and pull them out for mashed potatoes, as a quick savoury add-in to pasta, chopped salads. They defrost really quick which is great.Maple syrup and some salt. **Inside:** apple, onion, lemon, salt.

**Outside and under the skin:** a pureed mixture of butter, several cloves of garlic, and rosemary (or basil, or sage).

350 'til it's done.I baked them in a jumbo muffin tin so that they would be the same size as the English muffins. I did break the yolks, though. My boyfriend is opposed to peeling almost everything and I've come around to everything but carrots.  *sigh* I may have to give him a chance here, too.You can cook this in the normal time and then let it sit in the fridge for a day. The flavors will definitely get more intense. The bonus is you get nice crispy skin from roasting a patted dry bird.  My kids love the skin and ask for it.  Weird little dudes.I thought that too but NOPE! Juicy juicy juicy! The wings were abit darker but still moist and delicious!I've just done an experiment, as I was cooking carrots to go with dinner. The core tasted kind of fresher and cleaner. Bitter is definitely not a word I would use to describe it. Sweeter maybe but less so than I remembered. I'm a fat fuck but I think the dessert sounds amazing. How do you keep the schmaltz that renders out from smoking and spattering? A bed of root vegetables like Keller does?As long as we're talking about it...I had some variation of this while in Paris where the sauce was green, and I really have no idea what it was, but it was delicious.  Anyone have any ideas?Thanks for the recipe/ideas man.dude I have been waiting for your comment all day and just got it now. Ive been drinking cooking this and supringly I did it basicaly the way you described without seeing you comment, Im glad. Ive also drank a bottle of red throughout. I a bunch of cilantro and thia basil and im gonna cook flounder in it (I cooked chicken thighs for the stock that I made). Nice and easy would be some sweet pickle juice mixed with some dijon mustard and a touch of red pepper flake. Acid heat sweet will complement the fatty richness well. not usually. if i'm eating them fresh then maybe, but only if its a big gnarly carrot with tough skin. if i'm cooking them no way. Brine.I tried boiling last time and it worked like a charm! I put some kosher salt in the warm pan and scrubbed that off with a dish rag (I'd heard that suggested) and that got it super clean! This is why I love reddit! I've gotten so many awesome ideas! Thank you for your input!Oh okay, thanks for the clarification. Some people say they refuse to eat vegan food which is pretty silly. Fantastic idea. I'll do roast chicken. Totally slipped my mind. Thanks!keep in mind she probably wants to enjoy the meal...Oh it can definitely be a vegan dish but we eat eggs and dairy so didn't want commenters to think it was a requirement. Perhaps I worded it poorly.Cook as others have mentioned, but stuff with soaked couscous with onion, raisins mixed in olive oil. Lovely. If you can get your hands on some red palm oil, it turns the popcorn a very yellow color and adds a fantastic savory taste!! It's delicious and super healthy too!Good questions. Eagerly waiting for the answer.I rarely peel them, because I feel the outside of the carrot has a very earthy flavor that imparts extra depth to a lot of dishes.  Do a quick taste test between uncooked peeled and unpeeled carrots.  Notice that extra flavor in the unpeeled?  That little oomph of flavor is great in stuff like chicken cacciatore, pasta sauces, shepherd's pie, roasts, etc.Same here.  Inside was always like a special treat.Make sure the underside of your hood is very clean. Otherwise you're risking a grease fire. That said, it's highly unlikely. But wiping it down well will at least minimize the risk.Why not vegan?Cat food?I would just go without the show. It's the taste that matters (and mot burning your gf's eyebrows)*Really* easy to find. If you're in Canada, Bulk Barn always has it. US? [Here](http://www.amazon.com/Cheddar-Cheese-Hoosier-Hill-Farm/dp/B008GG9ZS8/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8).

Kraft used to sell canisters of its orange cheez product but it looks like they discontinued it.Make chuttney and can it so you can enjoy it all year.Butter.

Butter under the skin on the breast. Butter at the leg and wing joints. Butter in the cavity (and an assload of salt and garlic).

Wrap that thing like a football in eight layers of tin foil.

Bake that bitch.

Take it out of the foil. Turn up the heat to asinine levels and crisp the skin.

Amazing.I recommend buying knives buy the type of steel and the fact that they are NOT a popular brand name/ celebrity endorsed, if you want a good deal. Popularity results in price premiums. German forged steel, like used on the knife you mentioned, usually means some generic steel hardened to low to mid 50s HRC. Not usually great.

[chefknivestogo.com](http://www.chefknivestogo.com) has an amazing selection of knives and they guy that owns it has designed his own line. Richmond. The Artifex series are his budget and if stainless is what you are looking for I highly recommend the AEB-L. Holds a fantastic edge and sharpens easily.

As zac503 mentioned the Tijiro knives are very good budget knives as well as the Fujiwara stainless and carbon knives.

And most importantly... buy a couple whetstones. No knife stays sharp forever.

Edit: I just remembered the knife you were looking at is blunt ended and cleaverish style. I don't know any restaurant cook who uses a knife like this as their primary chefs knife. Tips are nice to have.

 I make a kinda shitty quick-fix kettle corn by adding a quarter cup or so of sugar to the oil with the salt, giving it a stir, and popping normally.This. The skin of carrots is bitter this time of year. Sweet young carrots are fine unpeeled. Old winter carrots need peeling. I like the pears idea , I will do this next time I beercan a chicken[Panade](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-a-panade-114846).

I wouldn't find it very pleasant or rewarding cooking for somebody with that bad a relationship with food, though. Don't set yourself up for frustration there. Have dinner parties...I never used to be much of a veg washer, but then people kept getting salmonella and listeria from veggies, so I started giving things a quick wash. I still wasn't rigorous about it until I was pregnant, because apparently if you're pregnant and get a food borne illness the fetus explodes or something.The potato's skin is where the flavor is.That's certainly a plus. I rarely fuss with deserts that require much prep mid-meal. It's not like I'm a chef at a restaurant, and not only does it interrupt my meal...it interrupts my interaction with my fiancee and/or dinner guests.Not really a true roast, but i layer onions and apples dusted with flour, salt, pepper, and (insert seasoning blend of choice) in a baking dish. Then put the chicken quarters/eighths on top and fill the dish up to halfway on chicken with a mix of stock and brandy.  Cook at 350 for bout 60-90 minutes.  put chick on a platter, dump liquid and bits in a large sauce pan, add a bit more liquid as needed, and thicken with a slurry.  Once it is at the thickness i want i dump on the chicken and serve.

Random add-on, if you want some good sausages, rinse the brine out of some sauerkraut, layer with apples and onions, salt and pepper, put your sausages in, put a bit more kraut, apples, salt and pepper around and then fill up with a nice (german) beer.  350, 60 minutes.I get what you mean. However I found it sorta fun to treat cooking like a science class. Do try this technique and let me know what you thought of it Kernels popped dry
Toppings:
Unsalted Butter,
Zesty Lemon pepper (From Costco),
Fresh Grated Parm,

SO. GOOD. Yeah...it'll make it a bit saltier, but just leave it as is after the brine and don't put any more salt on it.  Should make it just nice and flavorful.  You can always salt your plate! :)

60C = 140F.

That's why, 140F (60C) is medium well/well done, plus a few degrees increase from the sear and a rest and you probably ended up close to 150F (65C).

Make the water bath 50C (122F) and then sear and then rest and you'll end up at 54C, which is medium rare.

edit: this depends on the thickness of the steaks too. Also, what cut of steak were they?Season first with garlic salt and oregano.

Then cook them 3-4 minutes on a side in a pan lined with olive oil.

Then add 1/2 cup of chopped yellow onion. cook them for about 3-4 minutes until they are brownish.

Flip the breasts again.

Then pour 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar over the breasts. And pour a 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes on top. Cover and cook for 20 minutes.Yeah, that's what I thought too - I'd love to get me a good Chinese cleaver. But the site specifically mentions bones, which would put me off buying the knife because of the factors mentioned above.It might help to post a link to the recipe for full context.  Also, is this recipe already underway?A friend of mine has started stuffing frozen hash browns under the skin and then roasting as normal. It's pretty great.Why *baked* eggs...?

You can get reliably re-heat-able "egg McMuffin" things for the freezer with an egg that's been gently stirred and fried. Egg plays a lot nicer with the freezer when the yolk and white are mixed -- quiche freezes flawlessly but a frozen boiled egg's a disgusting mess.Thanks! That sounds like a good idea. Any recipes for good sauces? The ingredients can be used for any course, mainly the entree. thanks for the suggestion! Use this [random ingredient generator](http://www.springhole.net/writing_roleplaying_randomators/recipeingredients.htm) for ideas. I'd include chocolate to stick with the Valentine's theme. :) Remember that no one is going to be happy if you pick ingredients that are too out in left field. I'd start with your favorite things (favorite protein, cheese, etc.) and get different cuts or flavors. Then throw in a curve ball for him to make it really interesting.enjoy dinner!I was able to pry it open!!! I was trying to lock on the lid from the wrong side (it's my first time using it). I broke a nail and a wooden spoon. Sigh. Thanks again! I recently came across this really neat idea of salad skewers. Since you're looking at small courses, might be something to consider. The one I saw was a tiny skewer with a cherry tomato and a tiny piece of cheese wrapped in basil. Arrange a few on a serving plate,  season lightly and drizzle either with olive oil or a reduction of balsamic. I've got a couple Shun knives and I love them. This one looks decent but I have no personal experience with it.

You can usually pick [this one](http://www.chefknivestogo.com/kesawihoed.html) up on amazon for like $80. And it's probably my favorite knife ever, I use it for just about everything.
just white button, I may ahve thrown the baby bella (crimini) in there before but after they boil I dont think you can really tell the difference. If they're small leave them whole, if larger, half or quarter. They do shrink during cooking thoughI haven't tried it yet but I just watched that episode last night, and I agree with him about the way he does steak, and his usual 'slow and low' methods, so i'm anxious to try out the chicken as well and figured it could be trusted.


I'm not really one for the fancy molecular gastronomy type stuff - i'm more practical and into simple easy ingredients/techniques so I was surprised about how he does many things in his show.I'm sure they have an oven? Make a roast chicken. Or perhaps pasta with homemade red sauce? There's a lot you can do with limited supplies. Yum. Make sure he's not allergic to scallops. Which course? I assume you want unique ingredients. In that case, they get hard to find. But for the main course, give him bitter melon, fish sauce, corn flakes and deer. I would love to see a composed dish.  Okay it won't fit in the freezer but I just dumped all my frozen foods on it. I'll report back in a few minutes. Thanks. put it in the freezer,try again in an little whileWhat mushrooms do you use?Make sure the air can get under the chicken with a rack or pile of veg. For a 3 to 4 pound bird I roast at 425-450 for an hour, flipping it every 20 minutes.

Super juicy. A caprese salad with cherry tomatoes, good buffalo mozzarella and a simple olive oil dressing takes literally 5 mins.

You can follow that up with any kind of pasta. A very simple accompaniment with pasta is some aromatic garlic bread. Grate a small amount of garlic into some butter. Smother on sliced French bread (pick up fresh from any good Baker on your way home) and pop in the oven for a few mins. Again 5 minutes of work but your whole house will smell amazing.

You can also always make your dessert the night before. Most are really yummy chilled overnight. Tiramisu maybe? Or a simple chocolate moose.

Also, if you decide to go with a red pasta sauce, roast the tomatoes before you puree them. Takes the taste to a whole new level.

Edit: Go easy on the garlic. Very little is enough to flavor the bread. It is a romantic night after all This method I've done has not failed in almost four years.

In one large bowl, combine salt and black pepper. I let it sit for a bit so the ingredients combine. I pour olive oil over the bird, then roll it in the salt/pepper mixture. stuff the cavity of the chicken with a mixture of half a white onion, garlic and lemon. When the oven hits 375, I cover the roasting pan and chicken  in aluminum foil and leave it in there for one hour. At the one hour mark, I remove the foil and rotate the pan 180 degrees, and then leave it for another hour. It's now done, juicy and perfect.

I have tried to also do a faux roast but on a propane grill. Same method of prep and same temperature, but it's a little faster. I do not like doing a whole chicken in a slow cooker, it has come out dry.

The mushrooms really soak up the spice which is good and the garlic is great too, it's a little less universally loved than the mushrooms though, you either love it or pass.Here kitty, kitty, kitty. You know, Pasta Carbonara is very quick to make. It is super yummy and rich. Have it with some fresh crusty bread and wine and you have a meal.Sounds great, full stop.  But if you have a chance to try something out ahead of time, consider, instead of wine sauce with the scallops, trying some vanilla butter.  (Melt butter with a little vanilla extract and vanilla beans.)  I had vanilla butter on seared scallops recently and I swear I've never tasted a better sauce on a scallop.  It was awesome.  I recently cooked mine in a slow cooker for around 8 hours, before finishing it in the oven to get the skin crispy. I don't think I will ever go back to just roasting it! The flesh was super moist and just fell apart!

edit: I know this isn't technically a "roast" chicken, but it is still delicious.Brine it, cover it in my favorite spice blend, and stick it in the rotisserie. I came here to post the Heston link. I've tried this trick, works like a charm. Even if your chicken has no skin. I remember slicing into the breast... A nice crisp crackle followed by meat so tender and juicy you could see the kitchen light shine in it. The best part, it was thoroughly cooked without being overcooked. I like placing mine on the chicken breast itself, inside the skin.  Especially if it's infused with herbs, the butter-herb combination will still be in there after it cooks.Honey mustard popcorn is tasty, if a bit messy to eat.After popping the corn however you want, put in some salt and butter and mist some red wine vinegar on there. If you want to get fancy and have it look nice throw some finely chopped chives in there too. It's super tasty and every time I have a group of people over they always ask me to make it!I add a little bit of butter or oil and then a whole lot of cinnamon and a more reasonable amount of sugar. Sometimes I'll add chocolate chips in.Brine
I just want to second the artichoke. I've done it a few times now and it's quite good. It's a good addition to the typical crawfish boil accoutrements such as potatoes and corn. I've not tried mushrooms, though. Might try it out this summer!The first I do after pulling a roast chicken out of the oven is eat the crispy skin like a wild savage. It's one of my favorite things in the world.I never peel b/c lazy and no reason why.(Sorry if this doesn't count but it is amazing)I cut mine up, save the backbone for stock, then parchment paper on a sheet pan, season with salt, pepper, garlic, thyme (skin up), Roast at 375F Convection, for about 40 minutes and all the pieces come out crispy and juicy. drippings are easy to use b/c of the parchment. And clean up is pretty easy too. Note: This is my go-to recipe. If I cook a whole bird, I give it to my hubby for a charcoal rotisserie delight.I've never had issues with that, but I think there are two things you need to do to be successful with the butter: 1) start the chicken off HOT, like 450 hot, to get a nice crisp going, and 2) rub some under the skin on the breasts, so that it almost bastes itself as it's cooking. My chicken always comes out delicious, plus I like that some of the chicken-flavored butter melts into my roasted veggies. Where is this chicken wonderland?I usually brine my chicken first for 10-12 hours. it really does a great job of infusing flavor and moisture into the meat. i use a simple recipe that can be altered to anyones tastes.

i like to butterfly my chicken by removing the sternum so it will lay flat in my pan.  once that is done and ive dried up the excess water, i give it a rubdown with some oil then season with herbs and spices with a little baking soda mixed in to help the skin crisp up.

roast it at 425 for 15-20 minutes then reduce heat to 375 for an hour or until the internal temp reaches 165F.

ps: if you didn't know...

brining is just water with salt and other seasonings and you soak your meat in it. The salt forces the meat to absorb the water and flavor from the seasonings through osmosis so it's extra juicy and the flavor goes all the way through the meat. Longer soak =more flavor. Especially good for meats going on the grill.


I mix salt, pepper, paprika, a little cayenne, a little cumin and a little coriander (like, teeny amounts of those three!) into softened butter, then slather the bird in it, and get the butter under the skin all over the breasts. Put it in my pan on top of carrots and parboiled potatoes (tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper and oregano) then squeeze about a quarter of a lemon over the whole shebang. Throw it in the oven at 450 for approx. 15 minutes, then down to 350 until it's done.

Seriously amazing chicken, always comes out moist, and the roasted veggies are just stupid good with all the chicken juices and the lemon. Last time I made one, I also spatchcocked it, which I'll likely do from now on because the breasts stayed a lot moister with less cooking time.yes, I don't know why.  By legs I mean just the drumstick, not the whole leg (drumstick plus thigh).It seems related to the Chinese cleaver, which has the same shape as a Western butcher's cleaver but is much lighter and thinner and intended for slicing meats and vegetables. If this is the case, it really shouldn't be used for heavy bone work.I shouldn't have had seconds...I threw one for 4 years straight for mine and some friends birthdays. Just a suggestion on the other things to throw in, mushrooms, full heads of garlic cut in half so you can just squeeze out the cooked garlic. artichokes (1 or 2 per batch depending on size of pot), and for something sweet and spicy, slices of pineapple.

Edit: In case not everyone likes crawfish, I usually do a batch of shrimp, can be pretty expensive though. Also don't cook like crawfish by leaving them soak or they get way overcookedSteak au poivre is amazing!! We usually pair it with sauted Swiss Chard and brined cherry tomatoes. Recipes follow.

We also sometimes make roasted asparagus wrapped in prosciutto. (If you've never done this, it's a must!) Pro tip: Get Prosciutto di Parma from the deli section of any grocery that carries Boars Head or other high end brand, it's much cheaper. for the recipe below you only need about 1/4 pound (about $3.00 worth)

Brined Tomatoes.

* Cut 1 pint cherry tomatoes long ways and brine in a 2-3% salt solution (roughly 1 tbs kosher salt to 2 cups of water) for 30-40 minutes. Drain and save for later. If you want, you can add a few splashes of balsamic vinegar and fresh basil to the brine.

Sauted Swiss Chard.

* Remove the stems from on bunch of chard and dice, rough chop remaining chard.
* Saut 1 diced shallot and 2-3 cloves of minced garlic for 2-3 minutes over medium+ heat
* Add stems and 1/2 cup white wine, saute until tender - 5 minutes.
* Add remaining Chard, tomatoes, and a couple of tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and saut until wilted.

This will add a nice acid touch to the dish, and is absolutely amazing!

Roasted Asparagus and Prosciutto.

* Trim asparagus tails.
* Toss asparagus with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
* Roast @ 425 for 12-15 minutes (ends should be starting to crisp)
* Remove from oven, allow to cool enough to handle.
* Wrap 3-4 pieces of asparagus in prosciutto.
* Return dish to oven for another 3-6 minutes (Until Prosciutto is done to your liking)

Edit: Formatting, added roasted asparagus and prosciutto recipe. (hard to do from mobile)If you live near an Old World Market, they have really nice pots and pans.  Otherwise, a set from Calfalon has done really well by me.I like chicken with capers and lemon juice.  Basically dredge the chicken breast in flour, cook them in a little butter or olive oil, add some chicken broth, capers, and lemon juice to the pan.  yummmStuff the inside with mirepoix as well as some chunks of apple. Make a spice mixture and rub it on the muscle of the bird UNDER the skin.  Between the two of these things, you're attacking the bird with flavor and it comes out tender and flavorful.I just use Flavocal and corn oil.  Simple, tasty.Personally,  I just have a typical 7 inch Faberware kitchen knife that I didn't spend hardly anything on.  I've had it for probably ten years.  you could get a couple of different cheaper knives and a sharpener for that price.  I don't know what kind of cooking you do or how much but this has worked well for me!Buttermilk powder in the flour mixture.they freeze really wellLemon zest and black pepper along with salted butter!

I'm a bit obsessed with Mushroom Popcorn for it's bit fluffy kernels - perfect for caramel popcorn:  http://shop.justpoppin.com/gourmet-popcorn-kernels-mushroom-popcorn.html - Amazon has it with Prime shipping

Really solid point. Puts things in proper perspective. Thanks.You also don't want to put yourself in a situation where you have to share the delicious, crispy, salty chicken skin with anyone else.Tasted both the milk and the cheese. Both look, smell, and taste fine on their own.Then maybe some bruschetta with melted cheese.  You'll need something vegie/acidic based to start this meal, otherwise it will end up being too heavy.Anyone ever wonder why your roasted chicken isn't nearly as juicy as the ones you get at your grocer?

Yes, their commercial grade rotisserie helps (half of the juices fall back onto the other birds), but that's not the whole story. The birds typically used in grocery rotisseries come from the distributor vacuum marinated, and retain a lot more moisture through the cooking process. I have no clue what's in the marinade solution, but it's delicious.The core contains a higher concentration of calcium which has a bitter aftertaste.    That's why those prepackaged carrot barrels taste so crappy, they are all core.

When I make a carmelized carrot pure the cores have to go as they detract from the candy like sweetness.  The same goes for soups like the following.

Throw it trout, its bass.Is buying chicken legs cheaper for you than whole chickens? Yup, and what son. Roast chicken a national dish and 3rd highest amount of Michelin starred restaurants in the world. Much more than where you're from, America, despite being a shit ton larger. I await your insults lmfao.I think I'm going to try this method tonight. I'm excited! I should have mentioned in the original post but my fiance does not care for seafood :(.  However I was thinking about doing some scallops for myself.  If chicken skin cooked to any consistency is difficult to cut through, I think you need a new knife.Easiest would be just seasoning them and the pan-frying or oven baking until done. Then you can make sauces to eat with it, shred it up, slice it up, add to sandwiches, wraps, fried rice or whatever....oh, you're British. Just dump it, its garbage.It's a pretty "eyeball it and go" type of thing, but generally it goes like this:

8 cups of chicken stock
1 head cabbage
2 bunches bok choy
3 chicken breast (frozen boneless/skinless for lazy dudes like me)

You'll want to pan fry the chicken with a little salt/pepper and 5 spice before tossing it in. Everything else is to taste - you can go a little ham with the soy sauce, but go little by little with the sesame oil and fish sauce - a little is a lot with those, and they can overpower your dish pretty easily.I add a bit of lavender to mine along with the basic common spices and herbs. Challenge accepted. Now to Dremel the lid off this whiskey...Have you considered just practicing?  Flame a bit of whiskey in a small skillet to see what happens.

We predict that you will be underwhelmed.This is my favorite way to eat tortilla chips. DAE try the bottle method? You fill a glass bottle halfway with hot water(maybe throw some lemon or garlic in there too) and impale the chicken on it. Proceed as usual. Never tried it myself but I heard it makes for a really juicy chicken. I  imagine you'd have to rotate a couple of times so it roasts evenly.
&gt;Reality TV star

I think having 15 Michelin Stars and two Restaurants with 3 Michelen Stars beats out your Jesus of cookery Thomas (who?) Keller who only has 1 restaurant with 3.

Hey guess what, Heston Blumental another 3 star Michelin chef who's restaurant has been voted best restaurant in the world twice also has a roast chicken recipe, guess what it recommends? Rubbing copious amounts of butter into the skin. Funny that, huh? Yeah I'd take their advice over yours. No need to be mad that you've got dry lifeless chicken bro, at least you can recite Thomas Keller quotes while you eat it, rest of the world will keep on trucking with its crispy skin and juicy herby flavoured meat.

Bacteria in the milk can't read the expiration date stamped on the outside. The most likely culprit is that the milk had just started to go off and was slightly sour. If the milk was allowed to hang out at room temp for several hours, either somewhere in transit or at your place, it can start to go off before the date on the carton. Uncommon, but it happens. Second suspect would be the cheese.No secret at all.  High heat, and plenty of salt and pepper.  Thomas Keller's method is the best I've ever found, and it's dead simple.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWLt6G85zC4

**Ingredient List**

Amount | Measure | Ingredient
--- | --- | ---
1 | individual | tart shell (store bought OK)
1 | bunch | your caramelized onions
1 | jar | olive tapenade (you won't use the whole thing) or make yourself
1 | cup or so | chopped olives -- like a variety -- Nioise, kalmata, oil cured, etc.
4-5 | fillets | anchovies (or to taste)
1 | container | crumbled goat cheese or buy some nice fancy goat cheese to crumble
2-3 | sprigs | fresh rosemary

**Method**

1.  Heat oven to 400F.
2.  Put tart dough in tart pan if you've not already done so.
3.  Smear a thin layer of olive tapanade over the dough and make sure you get up the sides of the dough in the pan.
4.  Sprinkle/layer your caramelized onions over the tapanade in a thin layer.
5.  Sprinkle chopped olive mixture over the onions.
6.  Chop the anchovies and sprinkle them over the top of the olives.
7.  Sprinkle the goat cheese over the top -- don't go too overboard.
8.  Sprinkle the chopped fresh rosemary leaves over the top of the goat cheese.
10.  Bake in the 400F oven for about 20-25 minutes until shell is brown and you see brown bits form on the goat cheese and the smell of fresh rosemary fills your house.
11.  Let cool and serve either warm or at room temperature accompanied by a nice white wine.
Try kraft dinner macaroni sauce powder after its popped Grind them up and add them to your favorite carp bait recipe. 450F for 60 minutes?? won't it turn out really really dry? not to mention the smaller parts like legs and wings will probably burn to a crisp. Maybe 350F?This has been my experience, almost verbatim I use these nice chunks of fat I trim off the butt. Cut them in even strips and put under the breast skin along with some spices.

Speaking of chicken butts, I usually shove a piece of fresh fennel bulb and a bunch of herbs in the cavity too. I prefer green onions and fresh dill, but it can be anything, thyme, parsley, whatever.    You avoided the question. Anyway, Bouchon's recipe for Roast Chicken does not include a bed of  vegetables - you seem confused because you keep bringing up an entirely different recipe from Ad-Hoc that's geared towards beginner cooks for a complete 1 pot meal. But I'm sure using a reality TV star as your counter-example will help drive your point home. hehe &gt; pots de creme

This could be good i could pre-make this then server when we get to the desert part of the meal. love that video - especially at the end where he snacks on the oyster. I always offer to carve, just so I can sneak that bit - carver's privilege, I say.That's what i have heard. I've seen the shucking tool and it looks brutal. lolThanks, I see I have a lot to learn (tho my instinct to go with the arborio was correct  - *sooo many rices*) (ducking auto correct wants to to change that to 'abortion', WTF?)

Also, 'Hedgehog Chestnuts' is my new band name ;)Stock and a bouquet garni inside the chicken, stuck in place with a pricked lemon in the butt, oiled (or buttered if i'm feeling unhealthy) simply seasoned with salt and pepper. Super quick and easy but always killer.Salt..what ever seasoning combination you use on the skin and cavity has to contain salt to crisp the skin.

That and a vertical roaster. https://www.google.com/search?q=vertical+roaster&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=vertical+roaster&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=shop Le crueset has a wooden scraping spoon, I think that's what they call it.  It has a straight edge that's good for scraping fond off a pan. "2 most famous recipes for Roast chicken?" Are you mad lmao? Who cares what they think, go read any other Michelin stared chef or roast chicken recipe, tons recommend using fat to keep the chicken moist and crisp up the skin. Gordon Ramsays a much, much more famous chef then that Keller dude, and has a ton more Michelin stars at his restaurants, guess what his recipe recommends, rubbing oil on the skin. Thomas Keller you say doesn't like using butter 'because of steam' then plants his chicken on a ton of vegetables, that when cooked will produce what? Steam... Fat is flavour and moisture, this is cooking 101. It's like this Thomas Keller dude is your Jesus or something, all your posts in this thread are just 'I do this, as recommend by Thomas Keller' or 'The wise words of Thomas Keller(Peace be Upon Him) stated this on the 3rd of August about the roastings of chicken, let us recite his words'.Creme brulee is fantastic as well. Not to make it harder, but if you've never had pots de creme, that's another fudgy chocolate delicacy.you can even throw bamboo in the dishwasherYou're right, all these incredibly accomplished chefs are doing it wrong and you are right. You shouldn't trust what they say because they clearly don't know what they are doing. Isn't that what you said? "Don't trust anyone that tells you to truss poultry?" Reddit, where there's bound to be someone that thinks they know better cooking methods than chefs who are regarded by their peers as the best in the world. I made a honey mustard sauce the other day for my crispy belly.

* Garlic (chopped finely)
* Leeks (chopped finely)
* Heavy Cream
* Ground Mustard
* Honey
* Pepper Flakes
* Salt

Saute the first two in olive oil and add the rest to make a honey mustard sauce, reduce.  Enjoy.Instructions unclear, cock stuck in roastThanks :)

I learned it from my turkish mother in law. This is called pirinc pilavi, and they call the orzo "sehriye". For festive occasions it's common to add pine nuts. She does not use any onions or tomatoes in this recipe, but there is another side dish called domates pilavi where instead of cooking the rice in broth you cook it in fresh tomato juice, and there you do saute some onions and garlic. Domates pilavi is great too, you should definitely try it. Make sure you use fresh tomato juice and not canned tomato paste, that tastes totally different. There are many turkish pilaf types, like lentil, carrot, chick pea, liver, and many other ingredients mixed into the rice. Additionally you can replace the rice with bulgur. One of my favourites is is rice pilaf with roasted chestnuts mixed in. If you've never had roasted chestnuts you should definitely try to get your hands on some. In the fall you can collect them yourself, just make sure you get the [edible ones that look like a hedgehog](http://cdn.honeytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Chestnut.jpg?4c9b33) and not the [inedible ones with the fewer thicker spikes](http://www.mdidea.com/products/new/r013/horse-chestnut_cosmetic.jpg).

Baldo rice is the rice she prefers, and arborio is the most similar to that. Jasmine rice is nice but it's a totally different type of rice.

Good luck!After I pour on the butter and salt I sprinkle a tiny pinch of sugar on. It makes it so much better.I stand corrected then.  Liver has never been part of my diet.Doesn't it get terribly over-cooked? Even adding it to soup, it turns to mush pretty quick. I make my sauce with a regular can of tomatoes and small (6oz?) can of paste (and other things), and we always have leftovers, which I freeze, and use as the the 'starter' for the next batch. Introducing the pasta directly into the the sauce seems pretty problematic, especially with teensy pasta. (I have done this with baked ziti, but not with just sauce or teensy pasta).
For dessert, strawberries dipped in chocolate always are a good choice.  You can feed them to each other, maybe add a little whipped cream to spray on them or dip them in.


The only thing I'd add is maybe a small, green salad of some sort at the beginning or after bruschetta.   Damn I'm hungry now.I sometimes chop off the end, like the tiniest amount to remove the brown bit, but I generally just use the whole carrot regardless of how I plan to use it.Thanks for the suggestions, totally forgot about lemony desserts!No, because I am doing a wet rub with oil in it. So the skin is oiled with I put it on the roasting rack. Sorry I did not specify, it's just for me and SO for valentine's!I'm not sure you're right there - I've always found the core to be the sweetest part unless the carrot is really old! When I was a kid I used to eat the outside off the carrot and keep the core (or "daddy's hairy leg" as we used to call it, much to my dad's chagrin) until last because it was tastiest
This past weekend we did the Keller method (brining first, recipe from his Bouchon cookbook).  It is no lie that we thought it the best chicken we've ever eaten.I found a wing recipe for our superbowl party that called for boiling the wings for 5 minutes with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda tossed in, then roasting at 450F until done and crispy. Worked very well. Density comparison for reference.

http://www.dadcooksdinner.com/2012/02/salt-by-weight.html

&gt;Cooks Illustrated was right. A half cup [1/2] of table salt equals 3/4 cup of Mortons Kosher equals 1 cup of Diamond Crystal. Roughly - it slightly over weights table salt and under weights Morton's Kosher, but it's close enough.I only run the oven at 450F for the last half hour. the rest of the process is 350F.

What I do with my chickens, is to wet rub them with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic, salt and pepper. Then I shove a lemon cut in half with a sprig of fresh thyme and sage, with whole cloves of garlic into the cavity to keep it moist.

My secret to super moist white meat is the same as I do with a turkey... Roast it for the entire first 3/4 of the cooking time upside (breast side) down. It's not as pretty when it comes out, but I carve the meat before I get it to the table, anyhow.

What cooking it breast down does, is take all of the juices and keeps them in the white meat. Then I flip the chicken and turn up the oven to crisp the skin at a higher temp.

It's also incredibly important to let the chicken rest. When you carve it, you don't want all of that juice flowing out all over  the carving board or plate. You need to let it rest a good half hour or so  and you can do it on top of the stove to make sure it stays warm. I asked my wife what she wanted me to cook for Valentine's dinner. She said, "A salad.".

God dammit...Not difficult, just don't fuck up your hand trying to open them. Literally the hardest part of dealing with raw oysters.As I see it you have:

App 1: Red, fresh, acidic

App 2: White, meat, smoky, salty?

Main: White, meat, creamy, starch, salty?
( 'salty' in the sense of good salt flavor, not 'TOO salty')

So what you could do is: green, tart, spicy, possibly a few more...

So how about some sauteed green beans with some spice to them? And something lemon or otherwise tart for dessert? (Lemon sorbet?)Cook up some bacon, and blend it all together with some balsamic, some cold black coffee, and a bit of rosemary.


Then spread that shit on crackers and some baked brie.


Edit: Saw no meats in the OP.

Omit bacon, use more onions.Personally, I'd go with something lighter to start and something richer to end.

Maybe some seared scallops and home made bruschetta as an app.  Or maybe some white wine mussels (really easy to make) like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4z2gmtUzHE).

And for dessert I'd go with some chocolate cake.  &gt; leaving it on its own plain will make it dry.

Are you saying that not using butter under the skin will result in a dry roast chicken? That is nonsense. Overcooking will result in a dry bird, not lack of butter. Arguable the 2 most famous recipes for Roast Chicken - Marcella Hazzan's and Thomas Keller's - neither recommend adding fat of any kind. They not only don't included it in the recipe, they explicitly recommend against it. 1. Brine.
1. Separate the breast meat from the skin and put some butter underneath.
1. Start the chicken breast side down.
1. Turn the bird about 1/3 of the way through cooking.Sauteed and simmered, the flavor can't be beat!Is this a special event menu?  For valentines day?  For just you and SO or how many?This sounded so good, I went searching for it. Apparently, it's common to use chicken broth, and to saute onions and/or tomatoes when browning the orzo/vermicelli/couscous/whatever. Other than that, there are no particular 'Turkish' spices involved, though some recipes call for a bit of lemon juice. And if you add shredded lamb or chicken, you have a whole meal!

The proportions seem to be, two tablespoons orzo per cup of rice. (that seems stingy, I'll probably add 3). And I don't have 'Baldo or Calrose' rice, so I'm probably going with aborrio, over the jasmine?


I'll be doing this tonite, thank you! (baked chicken thighs on the side, my mother has this notion that casseroles are 'low class', go figure :()Blanch asparagus for 30-60 seconds (depending on thickness), ice water to stop the cooking.  Warm a stainless steel skillet to medium heat, add butter and very thinly sliced garlic, add asparagus and salt and pepper to taste, saute for 60 seconds, remove asparagus, but leave the garlic in the pan.  Add some balsamic vinegar and a bit more butter, reduce until it's fairly thick, drizzle over the asparagus.  Bamboo. I find the wooden spoons of *wood* tend to stain and/or eventually start sort of shredding due to the constant exposure to water - sort of like a weathered deck, only paler :)

Bamboo, however, tends to withstand the water better and doesn't seem to hold a stain. onion jam, and any variation on french onion soup whether its dip, soup, sandwich its all super good.Totally inserting a lemon into some cavities.Careful, that's not what he said.

Salt won't cause someone to have permanent high blood pressure, but if you already have high blood pressure salt is something you definitely want to limit because it causes temporary blood pressure increases.OK, you're going to need 2 forks, electrical tape, and an extension cord.  Cut the extension cord to about 3-4 feet long.  Strip the wires, and wrap them around the 2 forks.  Cover the exposed wires with electrical tape for safety.  Stick one fork in each end of the brat, and plug it in the wall.  Not exactly sure how long it will take to cook, but if it explodes you cooked it to long.french onion soup...it's delicious, and caramelizing the onions is the hardest part.Yep, high heat in your oven(400). Toss them in olive oil, and liberally season them with kosher salt and fresh pepper, roast for 10 minutes or until they are done to your liking.

I always seem to have balsamic glaze in my fridge but here is a quick recipe.

[Simple balsamic vinegar and a sugar of some type that has been reduced(dont use the good stuff) ](http://www.marthastewart.com/864510/balsamic-glaze)Is that really true, do you think? I'm pre-diabetic, I try to mostly focus on high fiber, low carb/low sugar, low-ish animal fats, as many vegetables as possible. And keep it somewhat low sodium by avoiding things out of cans and frozen foods, but my doctor made it soumd like I'm not supposed to salt my food when I cook which isn't going to happen. When I was doing this full force and working out religiously I lost 10 pounds but my blood pressure remained high-ish, so my asshole doctor didn't believe I had changed my diet. That bitch...still suspiscious of brining though.I think you're probably getting that problem because they're not defrosting evenly, and the parts that defrost first then get overcooked by the microwave while other parts are still frozen.

Just as an experiment, try putting one in the fridge overnight to defrost and then heat it up more gently in the morning.

But honestly, next time you might just prepare the muffins and cheese in advance and cook the egg fresh.Ah my so loves goat cheese so a simple salad like that might be the way to go. The lobster risotto.. oh man, i could do that. Well thanks for sharing your meal. I hope you and your wife have a great meal and evening!

edit: wanted to add the desert sounds really nice, seems like a nice lite finish to the whole meal.Oh man... i may have to do this too... but its a toss up with the suggested Dark Chocolate Creme Brle.I would say leave out the cream cheese frosting in the chocolate strawberries...it may be a bit rich after the steak and mashed potatoes.  If you want to get fancy, inject them with Grand Marnier, amaretto, wine, or whatever your poison.This sounds good as well. Thanks for your suggestions! ill have to learn how to work with raw oysters if i go that route.Wow this is wonderfully put together. Thanks for your suggestions. I love the scallops, lamb and lentil soup and the Coq au Vin. Thta chocolate creme Brulee sounds amazing too. Thanks for the suggestions!I learned to cook cheap meals first in a Tex-Mex style and then learned soul food, and now I combine the techniques. A $2 jar of tomato Sofrito with red beans and rice, adding basic chili-type seasoning is delicious./r/drunkencookery homie.The Zuni Cafe cookbook has a recipe we love: Swiss Chard Panade.  Basically, you made a casserole with caramelized onion, bread, gruyere cheese, garlic, and chard leaves.  You top it up with broth (it calls for chicken but it works fine with vegetable) and bake it.

It depends on how well I am going to cook them...when eating raw, I peel them, when cooking I usually scrub all the dirt off and leave the skin on.  My husband always peels them.  Matter of preference I guess.Try using a ranch dressing packet at the end. It is amazing. A simple brine overnight makes for a super juicy chicken.

I also use a rotisserie George Foreman (hate all you want, but it gets the job done very well, super crispy skin).

Simple recipe, but done well.Thank you this is exactly the type of advice I was looking for.  I'd like to avoid changing the steak sauce so maybe I'll go with the salad or a different side. I like brussel sprouts but I'm not sure about my fiance.  Can I do something similar with asparagus?  I keep it pretty simple: stuff it with an onion and a stalk of celery (a half lemon which I juice over the top of the chicken before stuffing in, and a bundle of thyme if I'm being fancy) and smear it with butter, salt, and pepper.  I surround it with cubed up, salted, and peppered yams, red bell pepper, red onions, and carrots (to make it a meal), cover it with foil, and bake at 350 for about an hour to an hour and a half (depending on the size).  Usually it browns sufficiently in the foil, so I just take it out, let it sit for 10-15 mins then carve it up.  Delicious every time.I like to wash them with steel wool or a depleted brillo. It rubs off the dirt and roughest part of the skin. Same with potatoes.And? Doctors earn medical degrees but still misdiagnose. Engineers study for years and still rely on their peers to identify and iron out their mistakes and oversights. Their Michelin stars are indicative of a lot of talent and education, that is for sure. But that doesn't mean that they are infallible.I'm imagining something like beef Wellington, only with a schnitzel instead of the tenderloin and spaetzle -- lots of spaetzle -- instead of the duxelles.  Puff pastry can stay the same.

I think I gained five pounds just writing that paragraph.I like to keep my roast chicken super simple so that the leftovers are more versatile; s&amp;p and oil. Yum yum yum. Make up a nice onion and potato omelets or quiche...
 it depends on a few factors but most conventional room temp rising is done between 2-4 hours. I posted this in another valentines day thread but an easy dessert is fresh fruit cups with homemade whipped cream.

Use croissant or pastry dough from a tube. Form into cups in a muffin pan and bake. Reduce some fresh berries with sugar in a sauce pan. Add more fresh berries to the cups and then some of your reduction on top.

Dollop with fresh whipped cream and you're done.

For the whipped cream I incorporate a liqueur, usually baileys since my wife loves it, though I prefer bourbon or Dooleys.

Adding my additional ideas:
Melon and prosciutto as an appetizer/first course.

A nice arugula salad with red onions, goat cheese, and a citrus vinaigrette

Lobster risotto for the main course. Looks really nice but is relatively easy in terms of preparation. I use a lobster tail per person and just roughly chop and add at the end of the risotto cooking time. If you want to get legit, you can boil the shells to make a light stock for the risotto but I usually don't bother.

And then the dessert I mentioned above. This is basically the meal I am making for dinner with my wife. Onion and goats cheese tart. Make a haloumi and mushroom burger and top with onions. Hot air-popped popcorn with melted butter and fine grated Parmesan cheese shaken into it...awesome!
I did a regular old grilled cheese but with a big pile of carmelized onion in between slices of american. Amazing how well that went together.I really like to cook them in the sauce. Just make a standard tomato-based sauce, then add pasta and keep an eye on them to add more water or broth as needed. Saves on dishes, and I think the pasta ends up tasting better. Never tried it with a cheese or creamy sauce, but it goes well with most tomato sauces I've used.The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.A lot of veggies and fruits taste better with peels on.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzEOL-N2cbwWhen making salad mix, yes.Never for me.I peel carrots.  I sometimes make an exception for the very young and fresh carrots I find at the farmer's market.  Otherwise, I peel them.  For me personally, I find the skin to impart a bitter taste that really bums me out.  So, I peel them.

But, if the carrots are very young and fresh, the skin doesn't seem to do this, so I'll go through the trouble to scrub them well and then keep the skins on.I'd say that's a strange combination for a knife: a cleaver should be as heavy as possible, but it doesn't need to be that sharp. On a chef's knife, on the other hand, you want a much finer edge. So it looks as if this thing is either good for chopping through bone *or* regular knifework, but not both. So I'd just get a regular chef's knife or santoku, but not this strange combination.&gt; Is 40 grams of salt always 40 grams of salt?

If it's going into solution, yes. If you're sprinkling it on top of a steak, no.nono it's still amazing on the grill, just get a stand or spatchcock it and tell people that you have to keep an eye on the temp the whole time and that you might as well be drinking beer while you do that.... It may well act as a jawbreaker!You got amounts for stuff. Im making this tonight.I peel when eating uncooked, otherwise I'm lazy about it and don't taste the difference anyway :)This. The peeling is a lot of work for fussy presentation, and it wastes some of the nutrient content. &gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; However, I've found that my Yankee friends typically aren't prepared to stand/sit at the table and peel crustaceans for half an hour until they're full.

As a yankee--those folks just don't know what they are missing - that is one of my favorite things at a boil...peel and chat and shoot the crap...and I can stand or sit there for hours.  freeze them in portions &amp; use them in future recipes.Separate the skin and put butter under it effectively making a skin bag.  It will make the skin crispier.On bringing a fresh/acidic taste to the meal, what are your thoughts on roasted brussel sprouts with a touch of balsamic?Okay, maybe AB's flame was just excessive, it looked like a Michael Bay movie. I'm using a 12" skillet and it's only for two steaks, so I will probably use less alcohol than most recipes that are for 4 servings. I will probably just take a step away from the stove, add measured out cognac, and ignite with the lighter.

I think V-day would be ruined if I accidentally ignited my beard.Brine it.  The breast is done well before the thigh/leg. Brining helps keep the breast from being dried out.

Also, make a small cut in between the leg and thigh, on the inside. That will help it cook faster.I love that kind of thing. It makes it more interesting and you can apply it to other recipes yourself.Check with your dad to see if his doctors gave him a food list, usually they give you a big list of yes and no foods. Also, ask him what he craves. Chemo changes your taste buds, and some things will taste ok to him and others disguisting. My mom said almost everything tasted metallic. The one calorie rich food she craved was mcdonalds shakes, so I ended up getting her one almost every day. Good choice. Best of luck! I would like to see someone take a rock of pure sodium and pop it into their mouth like a jawbreaker.

(Disclaimer: Don't fucking do that. Please god, don't fucking do that.)Gotcha. Thanks for the info. I'll make it for myself and gobble up that salty goodness without them.2-4lbs per person is a good rule for the non-natives from the south and NOLA areas...but if you like crawfish -- we usually do about 4-5lbs per person estimate for the bugs...not including the corn...beer.....onions...beer...sausage...beer....potatoes....beer...etc etc.   Get a good size kiddie pool to wash em and hang out in til you are ready to boil...Looks like you need an acid element in there. The fonduta, bread, mashed potatoes, steak and sauce are all going to be very rich and oily, and the acid from the strawberries is only going to cut it at the very end.

Maybe consider using a balsamic reduction sauce instead of a poivre for the steak, or add a small side salad to the entree, with a quick homemade balsamic dressing.

EDIT: I don't know if you're planning on topping your fonduta with anything, but a quick mix of diced tomatoes, basil and balsamic vinegar on top, almost as a garnish, will go a long way to developing flavor. Just let it mix in as you're dipping the bread.You should also try a capon, which is a castrated rooster. They are generally larger and have a more pronounced flavor. I would personally not worry about the flame very much, just use a wide pan and the alcohol shouldnt be able to climb so high. You can always pull the pan away to from the stove if you're worried about the flame. I have a similar hood, I have just pulled it off the heat and lit it with a long kitchen match or piece of spaghetti (yes it works) and the flame isn't that large. Just keep it away from your face. I'm sure you will be fine :)Louisiana native to the rescue. I currently live in Colorado and do a boil each year for friends.

As far as amount of meat one /could/ eat, most people feeding only on crawfish can put away 3-5 lbs. on their own. A big eater, or just a crawfish enthusiast like myself, can eat close to 7-10 lbs. of the critters.

However, I've found that my Yankee friends typically aren't prepared to stand/sit at the table and peel crustaceans for half an hour until they're full. If you're not certain that everyone will eat their share, you may want to only count on ~1 lb. for those persons. I've grown accustomed to ordering 10 lbs. for myself and one other friends, then 5 lbs. for a select few I'm certain will chow down, and a smattering for the remainder in attendance. If there's other food, it's likely that several people will gravitate toward that instead of the apparently daunting task of peeling crawfish.

The other option is to go crazy and save whatever isn't eaten at the boil for etoufee or gumbo afterwards. Just stick your leftover boiled crawfish in gallon bags, throw it in the freezer, and peel it a few days later for another meal.

Enjoy the crawfish boil! Remember that it's not only an excuse to stuff your face, but an opportunity to bond with friends and family. The act of peeling crawfish leaves a lot of room for conversation and jokes.It does make it pretty salty/flavorful. I wouldn't recommend it for a low sodium recipe. :/ if a brined turkey would be an issue this would as well. I should put paprika on the outside of my chicken too, but mine has managed to come out pretty dark with just salt and pepper, I think because of the temp I roast it at.
I stuff the carcass with some onion, lemon, and garlic. Rub the outside down with grapeseed oil, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, then throw it in the oven at the highest temperature. Every ten minutes, I baste it with a combination of butter and white wine, usually chardonnay, that I've kept on very low heat to keep it from bubbling. It usually takes just under an hour to a full hour for it to be done. They come out fantastically like that.


EDIT: God damn, I need to try that chorizo method.Grab potato
Shred
Make latkaStuff with half a stick of butter, half an onion, wedges of lemon and a stick or two of celery. Keeps things moist and adds a lot of flavor to the meat.

I also love patting on a bunch of tajin. It is delicious and the fond makes amazingly tangy gravy!I peel mine because I feel guilty not handing the peels over to my guinea pig.Dry brine for 1 to 4 hours (whatever you have time for). Cast Iron skillet.I have made this a couple of times and highly recommend it as it uses every part of the lobster.

http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015941-spicy-lobster-pastaYou can put it in homemade mac and cheese made with Gouda.Could not have said it betterI always peel the carrots (I peel my potatoes too). Mostly this is because it is easier for me to peel and rinse than to scrub them clean. Mostly yes for presentation purposes.

On another note if you want sweeter carrots remove the core.  That's where the bitterness lives.

Depends on the carrot. Garden fresh, carrots with tops or farmer's market carrots I never peel.

Plain old carrots from the grocery store that come in a plastic bag? Those get peeled. They always look disgusting even after a good scrubbing. The chocolate decadence found in one of the latest [food wishes](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/02/chocolate-decadence-eighties-most.html) has me salivating, I'm giving that a go this year.Yeah, I was considering just taking a step back from the heat, add the liquor (not from bottle of course), and light with a long lighter. Thanks for the info. &gt;Dry brine for at least 2 hours

That's what does it for me.  Works great on all chicken.1. Onions

2. Mouth

3. Repeat Never. A lot of work for no reason. While I'd never heard of the term "spatchcock" before, this is the way I prep a chicken for the grill or for the smoker.  Like in one of the more recent [food wishes](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/02/chocolate-decadence-eighties-most.html).I brine, dry chill, season simply, and use a lot of butter. Perfect every time. :) I prefer to save the variation in flavors for whatever accompanying sauce I'm using, allowing for the leftover chicken to be more versatile in the next day's dinner (or soup).I guess I don't have an excuse to crack open a beer and grill it outside... unless I don't tell anyone.My secret is to roast chicken often. It's easy. It inexpensive. It tastes great even if you only season it with a little salt.

If I have one technical secret to roast chicken, it's to add roast some vegetables along side. Maybe about 25 minutes before the chicken is done I'll add some Brussels sprouts, or green beans, or peppers, or onions or a mix of them all.

This never fails to please my friends who don't cook at all. I'm not a real big washer of vege's either except root vegetables.  It just makes sense to me if they came out of the dirt, they need at least a rinse. I don't peel soft skin root veg. I peel celery root, butternut squash and sweet potatoes depending on how they are being used. I usually spatchcock (split and flatten) my chickens since I learned this method a few years ago. Cook nice and fast, and most importantly very evenly. Plus the dark meat skin gets a nice crisping too. I cook it at 425 for about 90 minutes for my average sized (5-6lb) bird.

However, I recently tried deboning and stuffing a whole chicken and it was awesome. It took me about 20-30 minutes to do it, but I know I'll be faster next time. It was a perfect roast, and I stuffed mine with the stuffing Jacques used in his video here.

[De-boned chicken video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfY0lrdXar8)I know right?  I was kinda bummed when I read this too... but it also makes sense why my bird sometimes wouldn't quite get done on the inside or that it took for freakin ever to smoke the dang thing.  So, I gave up on the beer can.  Using a wire stand or spatchcocking have given me way better results... loses some of the "cool" factor though.You'll probably get a variety of responses here, but ultimately, it really depends on you.  Is it necessary?  No.  Will it change the flavor of the final dish... that depends on how strong your palate is.    If you've never made it before, you probably won't notice the difference.  Just let the sauce simmer a little longer to cook off more of the alcohol.  If you decide to go for it and you're worried about the space for the flame under your hood, remove the pan from the heat before igniting.  The size of the flame is dictated by how much vaporized alcohol is available to burn.  If you let the sauce cool a bit before igniting you won't get giant flames.  Also, have a metal lid on hand (and a potholder or towel that covers your whole hand) and if things get out of hand just toss the lid on top.  The flames will go right out.Sounds like you've been in my kitchen with one exception. I don't cut the strip of skin out like you do. I start up by the neck and wiggle my fingers under the skin, open it up and then work my flavoring in between the skin and the meat.I've made this twice and both times it was delicious, but wow, not health food. [Maple Bacon Popcorn](http://www.finecooking.com/recipes/maple-bacon-popcorn.aspx). You pop it in the rendered bacon fat. *Arglebarglebargle...*:(1. Chicken pot pie is super comfort food and super easy. (too many recipes to pick one but I riffed off a few on all recipes.com

I don't know what this is called but it's fancy enough to be special:

Take your chicken breasts and cut them in half flat wise. Breasts tend to be way too thick for this prep. Then, pound them flat so you have nice big breast pancakes all beaten senseless. (not ragged just thin.)

Thaw a box of frozen spinach (chopped) you can use fresh but I get better response from frozen IMHO.

With the breasts flat spread on a thin layer of the spinach (1/4 - 1/2") then put a few small cubes of butter with a little salt and pepper to taste. Roll them bad boys up and pin with a toothpick. Line a pan (I use glass but up to you) with tinfoil then park them in there and, and this is the trick, put another piece of tinfoil over them and crimp all the edges together. At the edge you've got remaining, blow in (yes put your lips on the tinfoil and inflate the pocket like a balloon) then crimp it closed. I'm not sure it's necessary but it gives an air of fancy so if you can get 1/2 of a relationship point...I say go for it.

Okay, pop those in a 350F oven for about 30 min (I don't honestly remember so you may want to experiment with one before the main event to get the timing right).

While they are in the oven make up a bechamel (3-4 TB of butter, + 3-4 TB of Flour...cook a little, add milk/cream/half&amp;half until you're happy with the consistency then go a little further so it's looser. Get it bubbling then add in swiss cheese until you are happy with both the flavor and consistency. (Be sure to whisk lightly as you go)

Okay, so now you have nicely made up spinach stuffed chicken and a decent swiss cheese sauce to pour over it. You may want to tweak to your tastes. I've added water chestnuts and other bits to the stuffing part and I've used different seasonings in the cheese.

avocado ice cream Beer can chicken is kind of a myth since the beer doesn't actually do anything.  It really just got started because it was a cheap way to stand the chicken upright on the grill. It doesn't get hot enough to actually boil the bear out into the chicken.  Here's a good read on it: [link](http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/debunking_beer_can_chicken.html)Mashed potatoes with caramelized onions is one of my favorite sides (and some fresh diced scallions!). Cook it on high for 15 mins, then reduce the heat. That way the skin get more crispy.I usually use something with more bones to make stock with.  But vegetable stock is always good too.

Then put that stock into some ice cube trays and add to other dishes to flavor them up.  I peel them, but I save the end and peel to use in stock.I wasn't aware there wasn't a proper correlation between the two. I think she was just following her physician's instructions.

Hmm: this is just from a quick search and finding a Time article that cites the study that generated the media buzz: the link we all assume between salt and blood pressure is overstated and more complex than once believed. It should be noted, however, that even though the study found no statistically significant association between blood pressure and sodium in the diet, those patients who were hypertensive consumed significantly more salt than those without hypertensionsuggesting, as other research has, that salt affects people differently.Beer can on the grill.

UPDATE: So my big accomplishment for this week....

I picked up a package of Eye of Round Steak (3 cuts) at the grocery on sale for $6.99 (about to hit the sell by date).

I marinated those all day yesterday in a bottle of store brand marinade and then cooked them on the George Foreman grill. I also made instant mashed potatoes and instant stuffing.

When all was said and done I had one steak for dinner with 1/3 of each potatoes and stuffing. Another 1/3 of each with the second steak for lunch. The third steak was used this morning for breakfast with some eggs. And the final 1/3 of each (potatoes and stuffing) is going with chicken tonight.

I feel.... accomplished?

It was simple, it didn't take more than 30 minutes last night to do all of this including getting everything ready for today's breakfast, lunch, and tomorrow's dinner (minus cooking chicken and reheating potatoes and stuffing).

SIDENOTE: I get much of my fruit and veggies from V8 type drinks for now... still working toward including those in to meals.I just use an enamel roaster or occasionally a stainless roasting pan. Fairly shallow. I'd like to try it in something cast iron, but CBA forking out that kind of cash I never peel carrots, but mostly because I'm lazy. Easier to give 'em a good scrub, do a rough chop, and toss' em in a stew. I'd probably peel them if I was doing something fancy or otherwise delicate. If you think it might be to much. You can always cut them in half and plate the tops for dinner as many as you like (2-3 inches cut). Then the ends can be sliced a bit smaller and put into an Omelet with some ham and onion for breakfast in bed the next morning.


hope i explained myself OK there. :)I'm about one half step in front of you. I sometimes use words with the letter W in them near the veggies. Not too much though.This is maybe a dumb question, but the Zuni method calls for brining the chicken ahead of time. I've considered making this recipe for when my parents visit, but my mom has high blood pressure and tries to limit her sodium intake. Does this make the chicken especially salty, or does most of the salt simply keep the bird juicy but dissipate by the time it's eaten?Light scrub is all you need. Same with taters.make small holes under the skin in the breast and the leg. insert garlic cloves into these holes, and put some butter under there.
It's like a garlic pre-baste.Obtuse, but correct. There is no solution involved, thusly there is no brine. The end.

I forget the name of this method but here's what I do...

1. Brine chicken overnight in 1/2 C salt +1/2 C sugar in about 2L of water for 24 hours.
2. Drain chicken and pat dry.  Pat DRY and PAT DRY again.
3. Let chicken sit out and get to room temperature (about 2 hours)
4. PAT DRY and then sprinkle with salt and pepper
5. Preheat oven to 450F
6. Put chicken in cast iron pan and put in oven for 60-70 mins or until temp reading at thigh joint is 170.
7. Let bird sit tented for about 20 mins.  (make the mashed potatoes and gravy)
8. EAT THAT BIRD.
9. Rejoice as the new king of the roasted chickens.French Onion soupMy favorite is pat dry thoroughly, salt liberally, and put it in the oven at 450 until the thigh reads 160*. A properly roasted chicken has so much flavor it really doesn't need anything else, but if you're inclined you can add some fresh thyme and crushed garlic to the juices in the pan while the bird is resting, then baste with the juices.

Make sure you eat the oysters and that triangular piece of butt fat right away - you earned them.Absolutely, it is all about the chicken.  I buy D'Artagnan.  One cheap trick -- don't buy a whole bird, just buy chicken legs.  They taste fantastic and are super cheap comparatively. I just rub them with butter and salt and roast them for an hour.  Whole family devours them.What container do you roast it in?Y'all make me feel a dirty little badger as I just whack the ends of with a knife and chop accordingly.

I don't think I have ever washed veg, and just trim and chop to the style I want.

My third kidney is acting up though.For anybody interested, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxm1vPwUQDY) a Thomas Keller vid where he demos his roast chicken. Simple and awesome.I bought one, it was like 26 bucks, I named him chuck, chuck was delicious.Chicken has a lot of water, so do vegetables which Keller plants his on top anyway. As long as your oven is set properly your skin will be crisp.  You also want the meat to be moist, leaving it on its own plain will make it dry.

Try roasting a potato plain vs roasting it in butter and tell me which one comes out more crisp.Me tooThomas Keller, Eric Ripert and their 9 or so Michelin stars would disagree with you. They both recommend trussing. And I'm sure there's more. We call them Happy Chickens, and joke that you can taste the happiness. And it is DELICIOUS.No pets? Add some carrots and onions, maybe that wilting stalk of celery, and some S&amp;P, strain it and use it yourself as stock.I was going to suggest scallops, just don't overcook them (durr). I like seared scallops in some kind of cream sauce. Last time I did them in a chipotle corn cream which was very good. Pretty much [this](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2014/08/seared-scallops-on-corn-cream-not-to.html) with the addition of some that canned chipotle chile sauce.Without the cavity screwing things up you can cook the bird really hot, which lean meat likes. I spatchcock and cook at over 400f.Butter has a lot of water so you're helping create steam which is working against you. From the words of Thomas Keller -

----

"Place the chicken in a saut pan or roasting pan and, when the oven is up to temperature, put the chicken in the oven. I leave it aloneI don't baste it, I don't add butter; you can if you wish, but I feel this creates steam, which I don't want. "[This](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2012/08/roast-chicken/) has been my go to recipe since I first tried it.  It is just simply amazing.

Basically, you just mix up some butter with lemon zest and rosemary, then rub that sweet baby down and roast it.  Truly perfect.Sounds delicious! I wish my boyfriend was willing to try some new foods. He's a strict meat and potatoes guy :PIt is?! Damn, I should have abused that more. I always forget about it. On the plus side I have a chicken in the oven. Rub some flour over the skin after putting flavoured butter under the skin. Creates a super crisp skin that absorbs all the flavours from the butter you put underneath it.You're supposed to put the butter under the skin so it melts into the meat itself and helps crisp up the skin, what you get is a layer of herbs and flavourings directly under the crispy skin and on top of the meat.Scallops Provencal-

Anyone who has been through treatment will tell you that at certain times, specific foods, smells, tastes, and textures are off putting. If he wants a cheeseburger, get him a small one. Then try and serve some soup or salad with it as well. Salmon fillet on top of pappardelle in a roasted red pepper beurre blanc sauce. My GF is vegetarian, so I'll be doing this one with ravioli instead of the salmon fillet.

I'll be using this recipe, though I haven't tried it yet. http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=520582I never do.  Frankly, I feel the time investment of peeling them versus the wee bit of dirt I may ingest after scrubbing them isn't worth it.Im confused... could you explain why? (Noob person-who-cooks here)Rub garlic butter in between the meat and the skin.

Additional tips:

- Brine the chicken for thorough salt penetration into the meat

- Rub the skin with a bit of oil. Add salt and pepper

- Stuff the cavity with herbs and lemon wedgesI mean drying out too much, to the point where it's difficult to cut through.Those are not apt comparisons. Driving to the beach is not the same as boating. Dry brining accomplishes the same thing as wet brining. You're being obtuse.Do you have pets?  I would make them a soup with that stuff.  Boil it forever and use it like canned dog food.

Yah, I expect downvotes for that but my dogs eat very well and are very healthy.Don't worry, /u/drinkwineandscrew is actually Emeril Lagasse. It's all hyperbole.

...

**BAM!**damn, it's your cakeday, someone should "abuse it" for you.I do butter under the skin with some fresh herbs (rosemary or tarragon).

The one oddball thing I do is similar to a roast. I'll sometimes pierce the meat and add whole garlic cloves into the breast meat. After reading this thread about roast chicken I did need to "abuse my bird". Oooh the piping bag is a great idea!  I was thinking of doing asparagus as well, but I was worried it may be too much with everything else.  It won't cook evenly. By the time the center is set, the outside will be overcooked.

I had the same issue in making a whole bunch. Instead of ramekins, I ended up using shot glasses. They were perfect for individual, mini creme bruleesHonestly, brining it is the secret.  I'm never going back.  The chicken was juicier, more flavorful, and I didn't even go all out with the seasoning or butter.It is about as self explanatory as "dry washing" your pans when you are drying them, "land flying" instead of jogging, and "dry boating" where you take your car to the beach.

Credit to /r/guygan for a dry washing and dry boating.I remove the ribcage/hip bones, leaving only the thigh/leg/wing bones, so the breast lays out perfectly flat. This allows me to cook it at very low temperatures, making it extra juicy. It also makes carving super easy. Then I use a torch at the end to crisp up the skin.My version's similar: I roast the chicken in a cast iron skillet (having rubbed an olive oil and salt mixture all over the skin and under the breast skin) with chopped onions, celery and carrots in the bottom of the pan. When the chicken's done roasting, I put it onto a carving board, use a slotted spoon to pull out the veggies, then add a water/flour slurry and heat to make the gravy, adding salt and pepper to taste.Generally speaking, no.  But I "rub off" some spots with the back edge of my knife. I don't chop it; I cook it in whatever presliced cuts it came in usually. Sometimes I cut into bits if I'm cooking for children. I'll add onions sometimes too, but not always. IMO  Jonathan Waxman's  method is best. That salsa verde is pretty amazing too. http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12467-jonathan-waxmans-roast-chicken All about that baste, 'bout that basteNever take advice from anyone who advises you to truss poultry, even if it involves a rotisserieMy husband would love this :)Zuni is unstoppable.I spatchcock and then cut a strip out of the skin where it is thickest along the breast and thigh (so some of the seasoning gets on the actual meat. I then season liberally with a mix of equal parts salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder.  I cook it at 375 convection roast in a big cast iron pan until the breast reads about 162 on the thermapen.

Juicy and delicious. Everyone loves my chicken. My mother in law had me come over and teach her.

As an aside, I trim as much fat away as possible from the neck and wing tips and leg end nubs (which come off) and put it all with the organs in a ziplock with onion ends and floppy carrots and celery bottoms, etc. and then I make stock in the pressure cooker. Makes damn good risotto. I actually adore the process they go through in the America's Test Kitchen recipes. The "we tried (this) but found that while it browned nicely, the pastry was tough and flavourless. We realized the problem was (this) so we added (an improbable ingredient like vodka or mashed potatoes)"

For someone like me, seeing someone else's thought process and trial and error brings it all together -- rather than just presenting me with the end result of "use this much vodka to make awesome pie pastry. Don't ask why, just do it".That steak sounds great. If you have some time... and your doing creamy mashed. you might want to using a piping bag for some fun design instead of spooning the potatoes onto the plate.


I always like Asparagus with my steaks so if you can find some good quality and roast them up in the oven it can be a nice side.


The rest sounds great to me! Hope you have a wonderful night! &gt;then headbutt it into the oven Absolutely true.Apart from the obvious ingredients like lemon, thyme, salt, pepper, garlic and butter; I like to stuff chopped up apples and apricots inside the bird to add a sweeter, fruity flavour plus they also add a little moisture from what I have found. Alternatively putting it in a tray with chicken stock and then covering with foil gives it a bit of a steam bath while cooking to add to the succulence. Not that I recall. Lots of fish and lobster, though, usually in a chowder format, though lobster rolls are popular, too.Along with the cabinet finishing.Huh...  So it's heat, not smoke, right?

I'd bitch to my super, but I guess it could save you from burning one night.I will bake and I will post.  Busy for the next 2 weeks, but will do after.Most of the time i just use them in stews or roasting with other veggies. I never peeled mine, only rinsed, until the other day I was reading a recipe that said "remove peel" in reference to the carrots. So I peeled mine for that recipe. Honestly I couldn't tell a difference when I was eating it. I will probably continue with not peeling just to save on time. I love this stuff too, only instead of a can of rotel, use a can of beanless chili....it is amazing!!!Yeah good point. Im not entirely sure what I was thinking there :-) Salting immediately before cooking has a different effect than salting a day in advance.  That's why there are separate terms. Dry brining is a self explanatory term that tells you everything you need to know - accomplishing the desired effects of brining without additional water. There's no cause for being butt hurt about this.wash chicken, clean cavity, sprinkle with salt (as much salt as you like), fill the cavity with a lemon pierced all over. oven at 450f until done (1hr or so for a 2-3lb bird). Let it sit at room temp covered in foil for 5-10 before cutting. Done.I never peel my carrots. I like the taste of the skin on it. Earthy and gives whatever I'm making a nice flavor.For cooking?  No.

For giving to my daughter to munch on like a rabbit?  Sometimes.BTW Tony Chachere's is wonderful and you should get some but if you don't want to go buy it, it's just a mixture of salt, red pepper, black pepper, chili powder and garlic powder. You could really just season with salt and pepper.Salt and pepper the cavity.  Stuff with fresh rosemary, thyme and sage, crushed garlic cloves, lemon wedges.  Rub down with olive oil.  Season with dried rosemary, salt, onion powder, garlic powder.  400F oven for 90 mins.I would suggest going to your local TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Home Goods etc.  I make my wife go through the pots and pans each time we are there but never actually need anything.  They have some pretty decent stuff at extremely reasonable prices.  I believe just this past weekend they had a very nice Cuisinart porcelain coated cast iron 12 inch pan for some amazing price of like 13.99 or something.  Which would leave you ( I am no mathematician) approximately 86 dollars to buy a pot.Commonly accepted by half wits who don't understand the words that are coming out of their face holes.

It's salting. You fucking salted the turkey for 'x' time. Using 'dry brine' is just a bullshit term to make it sound like the person knows what they are talking about.

They taste better with the peels on so I don't peel them any more, I just scrub the dirt off.

Do a taste test some time. Just peel half the carrot. The half with the peel still on will have way more 'carrot' flavour. It all went over pretty well.  I would've changed a couple of things, but it all tasted really good.  Went with the savory hash.  My pork could have used a sauce, but it was still good and juicy.  I didn't have much in the way of leftovers, which is always a good sign.  Thanks again for the tips!I'm with you there on spatchcocking. Haven't tried adding too much to my chicken yet but I recently did a simple salt thyme roast after reading a serious eats article. The idea was that on a  baking sheet, it gets hotter on the edges due to the eddy currents that circulate there. I bought a broiler rack and kitchen shears to try it out and boy was I impressed. By the time the temps in the thigh reached 165, the breast meat at the center was still around 147. This was perfect because I prefer white meat below 160 and dark meats above. Overall, way happier than a normal whole chicken roast.Oh I hate this stuff... It's all over the kitchen, especially on top of the cabinets, and then it polymerizes.Krab Bisque

 cup diced celery
 cup diced onion
 stick butter
3 Tbsp all purpose flour
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 can chicken broth
2 cups half and half
 lb imitation crab finely chopped
6 oz grated sharp cheddar
1 Tbsp Tony Chacheres Original Creole Seasoning
1/2 cup chardonnay (optional)

Heat the oil on medium high in a large sauce pan. Add the celery and saute for about 5 minutes. Add the onion and saute for another 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Add the butter and stir until the butter is melted. Gradually add the flour while stirring until a roux forms. Gradually stir in chardonnay, broth, half and half and creole seasoning. Bring to a low boil, add imitation crab and bring back to a low boil. Remove from heat and stir in cheddar.
I couldn't find the ATK thing for baked apples because it was behind a paywall.  What I did make, my wife liked a lot.  All 5 lbs of apples got eaten, so it must have been decent enough!  I just kind of winged it and used cloves, sugar (didn't have brown), molasses, cinnamon, and I think allspice.  I wasn't sure about cooking time, but I cooked them for as long as I could before I had to leave.Foods can contain additional sodium from other sources, notably sodium nitrite, baking soda, and MSG. If monitoring your sodium intake is important to you, then a sodium level would be more relevant than just the amount of table salt. In addition, since table salt is only 40% sodium by weight, it makes sense to describe just that portion.This. Or simmer them on the stovetop and add the liquid right back into the finished product. Whatever you want to do, make sure you brine it.

Simple brine: Place chicken breasts in a zip lock baggie, add 1/4 cup soy sauce, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp italian herbs to the bag. Let brine for 30 minutes to 1.5 hours.

Also, you are going to want to [cut your chicken breast in half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjfQP3Mp2k) before you brine it because the seasoning won't reach the middle of the chicken.

Finally, because you are a rookie, you are going to want to practice this dish at least once.

So, here's what you do:

In a non-stick pan, melt 2 tbsp butter over medium high heat, toss in an 8oz pack of sliced mushrooms and brown. If the mushrooms stop sizzling, add a bit more butter. Push mushrooms to the side and add your chicken. Pour 1/4 cup white wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth into the pot and bring to a boil. Add italian herbs (basil, oregano, marjoram, and tarragon), and pepper. Cover and simmer the chicken until it is almost done (less than 10 minutes), flipping halfway through. Take 1-2 slices of fresh mozzarella cheese and cover the chicken with it. The goal is to have the mozz melt over the breasts.

Serve with rice, risotto, mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, on a bed of spinach (my favorite) or with a side salad. You are also going to leave quite a bit of liquid in the pot, and that is Ok. Tenderloin was definitely the way to go.  It turned out really good, but I didn't have enough ingredients to make a sauce.  Next time, I would have that.  Thanks for the tip!That's a pretty tight fit IMO - your veggies are going to be packed around the sides of the bird so they'll end up steaming in the hot fat rather than roasting. I'm sure it tastes fine, I'd just prefer a 14" or larger skillet if I'm adding extras. Butter under the skin.  Gives you moist meat and a crispy skin if you finish the bird uncovered.My favourite fruit accompaniment for duck would be peaches, but I don't know how to fancy it up. Bet somebody here does, though.&gt; slam it on top

calm down a lil in the kitchen, no need to abuse your bird.as others have said I use [Thomas Keller's roast chicken recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxm1vPwUQDY).  Super simple and tastes great

Whole lemon inside the bastard. Rub it all over with olive oil, dried herbs, salt and pepper. Sit it on a bed of onions/shallots/garlic/all of the above.That six pounds of butter will then somehow morph into 25 pounds on our assorted butts.  Someone pass me the salad, quick!Dry Brine, spatchcock. A large grain of salt will take longer to dissolve on your tongue, as well as being uneven in the distribution. There is a really simple way to test it. Measure out equal weights of superfine salt and coarse kosher salt, and taste them separately. The superfine salt will immediately dissolve on your tongue, and will be very strong. The coarse salt will take a longer time to dissolve, won't coat as evenly, and it won't be as strong tasting because your tongue wasn't exposed to as much surface area at once. You will also probably find it harder to get the taste out of your mouth with the superfine salt thanks to the even distribution, assuming you don't dilute your saliva with water immediately.Glad so many people have been liking this!!!Lovely!!!  Plenty of other stuff to kill them back then, I guess. v


It's not the neighbors that bother me, it's the smoke and vaporized grease getting all over me walls and ceiling. Sure the smell goes away after a few hours but those tiny drops of grease build up over time.... I know this sounds crazy, but one day I needed broth *and* a roasted chicken, so I decided to boil it before roasting - it turned out so well I've never looked back.

Boil the whole bird with some rosemary, sage, an onion, and the last inch of the root end of a few green onions.  Long enough that you have a nice broth, but not so long that everything is falling apart.

Carefully pull it out and put it in your roasting pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper and a bit of butter, then surround with pre-boiled carrots, parsnips, potatoes and leeks and roast at 225C until the skin on top is golden brown and crackling, about 30 minutes.  yay!  Rice-A-Roni!No one roasts a chicken like [Christopher Walken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43VjLCRqKNk).

Fast easy and cheap.It sounds much cooler in a cast iron skillet, and my neighbors only complain every so often. 1. Dry brine (generous salt rub), covered, overnight.
2. Wash salt off.
3. Air dry, in the fridge, uncovered overnight.They do eat cheese though im not sure if all do have chicken broth but my girlfriend does. I definitely would love to grab your recipe!This sounds really good! I think I am leaning towards this.The skin may have a less permeable texture that could in theory effect how it caramelizes and or absorbs liquids in a pan. Other than that, no reason besides it looks nicer.Thanks I never ever peel carrots and I don't see why you would.  The peel doesn't taste bad and gives the carrots a nice rustic look.  There's no point.The Garlic Shrimp looks amazing!Your drunk!Let it sit in the fridge uncovered overnight for extra-crispy skin. The reason your smoke alarm is going off is because of the cast-iron skillet - it gets too hot so the dripping fat smokes. You can remedy this by switching to a regular foil-lined roasting pan with a rack set over it.  You'll get better browning with this because the chicken is elevated above the sides of the pan. You'll also get zero smoke, even at 450F.  There's definitely something romantic about roasting with cast-iron but truth be told, a real roasting pan works better.

http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Chicken.jpgYou ever make ciabatta?i think he means his apartment gets too hot or something?The best secret IMO is the chicken itself.  One of those fresh farm raised hormone free cage free organic chickens is a gift from god.  Sure it's $25 for the 4 lb bird, but man, the flavor is fantastic.  And the meat is well distributed, there isn't a huge amount of breast meat, but there is a lot on the back and neck areas.  That is the best chicken I've ever made.

However, I don't want to drop 25 bucks every time I want to roast a chicken, so I usually just get a fryer or something and do this.

dry brine.

then
I use a low salt bbq style rub that has paprika pepper, garlic powder, and a little bit of salt for the rub.

 lemon and garlic in the cavity always make the pan juices nice.  also thyme and rosemary.

cook at 275 with a rack for about an hour and a half, check temperatures.

if you wanted a more even cook you could cook it breast down for the first 30 minutes, and then flip it for the final hour or so, but my breast meat is still usually juicy enough so I don't have to worry about that.Stuff with quartered lime, lemon and orange, peel on. Rub with extra virgin olive oil and apply dry rub of Old Bay, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, dry mustard, black pepper, and coriander. Roast in 300 degree oven for 3 hours.it's a magical trick

I should have explained -- small apartment, hot oven = the smoke alarms go off.

I usually get a small bird, 2 to 3 lbs. This cast iron wont work with large birdsWhere are you getting a 4lb bird that physically large? [This](http://i.imgur.com/qEBE0vnh.jpg) is one that I did the other day, it's a 4.5lb in a 12" skillet - plenty of room for veggies around it.Dry brine is a commonly accepted culinary term.  You don't have to like it.Two tricks;

1. Put Worcestershire under the skin, it tastes amazing on chicken

2. Blowdry your chicken. It sounds ridiculous, but if you get the skin really dry it comes out hella crispy. I definitely read that as "fat blasting," which is now what I'm calling that.I've always peeled them, and now I wonder why. After all I don't peel potatoes very often- only if I'm making something that specifically calls for them to be peeled.

I'd never really thought about leaving carrots unpeeled. I'll have to try it next time and see how much difference it makes.Depends on usage. Steamed carrots get peeled. Blended, pured, or in stew they don't.

Basically, if you won't be able to tell, I don't peel them. I would say that you can probably do a lot better in terms of cutting quality for not much more $$.

Something like this perhaps for a similar style: http://www.chefknivestogo.com/todpna16.html

Is lists VG-10 as the metal which is what Shun uses on a lot of their knives, for $100+. If it's the same metal it can be sharpened to be equally as sharp as a much more expensive knife.

That being said, ANY knife you get can be sharpened far sharper than it will come from the store. And if you're willing to do that work, one of the $40 Victorinox with the fibrox handle is enough to do almost everything you need once well sharpened.

I'm still stuck on why his oven gets bigger than his apartment when he raises the temp to 500.Yes, you're correct. I didn't specify that you should let the water in the butter evaporate before basting. And 40 minutes is the minimal time that Kenji recommends in that article, but it actually takes a lot longer for the surface of the steak to dry naturally. I'll probably salt my steaks a day in advanced now. I agree with applying the pepper after the cooking. Whoops!It does! Not as well as at 450 but still good.Double the amount of salt you think is appropriate.The skin drying out is what you want - you want it crispy not moist.I boil water, sugar, vinegar, and a bit of baking soda.  I'll place the chicken on a metal rack over the sink and then pour the mixture over it.  The water/vinegar/baking soda help tighten the skin, while the sugar jump starts the browning.  This leads to a very crispy skin.  it probably just takes longer. I've done chicken at even lower temps, for very long times, and the only problem I've had is that the skin tends to dry out. The meat is super tender and moist when you cook it that way though.Actually, most of the smoke comes from after the steak is placed in the pan and not the oil itself and it definitely wasn't enough smoke to "choke you". Canola oil has a higher smoke point than olive oil so the point of step 4 is just to get the pan hot enough for a good sear. Also, there wasn't a lot of oil splattering since it was a thin layer of oil. If your worried about it, you can certainly use a screen guard while cooking the steak with this method. If your oil is splattering everywhere, than your not being gentle enough with flipping your steak.

Hope this helps!I always peel them, but I keep the peels in a bag in my freezer to eventually make vegetable broth.I peel them. It definitely brightens them up from dusty brown to nuclear orange.Thanks for the suggestion! I'll definitely have to try this out next time. I usually just let it rest while covered with tin foil so that it still remains warm after the resting period. I'm guessing I should keep the pan on low heat while the steak rests?How large is your cast iron skillet? I typical 4lb bird would completely fill up my 12" skillet - there'd be no room for veggies around it.I've never been a big fan of rubbing butter onto a roast chicken before it goes into the oven. It just melts right off. I get much better results butter/fat basting after it's finished roasting.I've found that cheap table salt tastes a lot worse than say, Maldon even when fully dissolved. I could be imagining it.So I think the instructions in my post my be a bit misleading. I didn't mean for the oil to be completely smoking, but show tiny wisps of smoke. For this cooking method, you should use a cooking oil with a higher smoke point (which is why I used Canola oil which has a smoke point of 400 deg). You certainly don't want to use olive oil for this method. You certainly don't want to burn the oil, but definitely get it hot enough for a good sear. I'll probably experiment with other oils with [higher smoke points](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/cooking-fats-101-whats-a-smoke-point-and-why-does-it-matter.html) to see how it turns out.I've officially tried a runny egg this morning with my hash browns and sausage. All I can say is, I can't believe it's taken me 29 years to try this. From now on this is the only way I will take my eggs!Does the skin brown at such a low temp? I blast mine at 450F as recommended by Thomas Keller.Salt the cavity with enough salt to defrost Route 66 in February.Yes, I learned about the pepper, but it really didn't affect the taste overall.

The 10 minute rest is based off this [Serious Eats Article](http://www.seriouseats.com/2009/12/how-to-have-juicy-meats-steaks-the-food-lab-the-importance-of-resting-grilling.html) where it shows that the temperature of a 1.5 inch steak at 10 minutes causes the muscle fibers to relax enough so that there is no problem with losing juices.

With a cast iron pan, the heat resides after turning the heat to medium low and of course it depends on your stove. My stove's tends to run a bit hotter so I find that medium low has a lower chance of over cooking my steak.

And finally, I did render the fat side for a bit during the searing stage, but I neglected to mention that in my OP. Hope this helps!Came here to make sure someone had mentioned this. One of the greatest simple food treatments ever. G-ma forever.Nah, it's very helpful in how I should deal with cooking it. That sauce sounds amazing. What should I do with the rest of the duck so that it doesn't go to waste?I don't drain my Ro-tel, and it doesn't change the texture. That's one less step between me and fat kid heaven. In the future you can just boil water in the pan to clean it.  Soapy water never hurt mine, but scrubbing burnt, stuck stuff off would also remove the seasoning (If this happens, you're cooking wrong, but whatever). Ran across an article on care for cast iron that suggested to scrap vigorously with a metal spatula, always, and  fill with water and boil to lift any stuck food to clean.  Never have problems with the seasoning since.

Top reseason, cook bacon, then oil fry something like okra, or breaded zuchini.  Comes out smooth as a babies butt.Preheat cast iron skillet in the oven as high as it can go for an hour (I do 450,my oven does go to 500 but my apartment isn't that big.)

While it's heating up I season the bird with salt, pepper and smoked paprika, stuff the inside with cut up lemons and fresh rosemary, and stick a few rosemary sprigs under the skin.

I also chop up some onions and carrots (or just use baby carrots) and I smash some garlic cloves and put that aside.

Once the hour is up I take the cast iron out of the oven, carefully since it's hot, and put the chicken right on it. You can hear it start to sizzle right away.

I throw the vegetables around the side, hit it with a squeeze of lemon and a pour of some beer (usually what I'm drinking while cooking) and put it back in the oven although I lower it to 400.

That cooks for about 45 minutes to an hour, and it's this really moist and delicious chicken. Ugh, right? That's my least favorite thing. It's just something I'm not going to read and I'm going to scroll until I see something formatted like a recipe anyways. I understand that it's part of blogging, but come on. As long it's you for dessert I'm sure he'd be happy.I've always thought this. I'm sure it is just some way of doing that. Companies love isolating things and pretending it's the same. Probiotics with one species; marinol instead of cannabis; omega 3s, when you need the 6s, GLAs, ADAs. If you want good pots and pans get the American made All-Clad, like the Copper Core.  Those pans are the real deal. If those are out of your budget, the next best thing is commercial cookware.Oh, I see. You're just a bad troll. I chop up herbs (sage, rosemary, thyme) and mix it into softened butter with lemon zest. Slather it on the chicken, get in all those crevices. Freshly crushed garlic can be added as well if you're a garlic fiend like me. Stuff the rest of the lemon (cut in half) inside the cavity with herbs and garlic cloves. Salt and pepper outside and inside. It is. I also did this with tofu, more often than chicken, because tofu is cheaper. haha.

Just... always wait for your oil to be hot enough. Sometimes I was in a hurry and would just throw in my chicken when my oil wasn't hot enough. Then I was sad. ;__; That sounds ideal. Pop in 20 minutes of crying, self-loathing and shame, and then do all the unnecessary housework, and that's the perfect procrastination right there.I find the cleaver style knives to be really useful, but the problem I have with most of them is that the blade is too thick for finer work, eg onions. The thicker blade makes vertical cuts on an onion half spread apart and make it really hard to manage.

It is a nice design, in particular the return (where the handle meets the blade) has a nice angled taper and although I am not a fan of sharp edges in this area it appears to be small enough that it wouldn't cause a problem.I peel them. I feel like even scrubbing doesn't get the dirt off properly. Also I don't much care for the texture of the skin when it's cooked.I'm a huge fan of Indian food and he does like stir fry and fried rice so that's a good idea. Homemade naan would be a great one to have in my arsenal too :) thanks!Spatchcock it. I generally spatch it, flatten it out then marinade it all over with some oil, salt, pepper and a touch of paprika to make the skin even darker and delicious. Occasionally I'll add a touch of celery salt or garlic granules.

marinade for a couple hours then I slam it on top of a bed of chopped onions, garlic and herbs (bit of tarragon is nice in there). Chicken roasts beautifully, and while you're resting the bird before you carve it up, you can use the onions garlic and herb mix in whatever accompaniment you like (or just devour them on their own).


If you have more control than I do, they're pretty damn good on a sarnie with the leftover chicken and a bit of mayo!

Only downside is that the sink on the underside doesn't crisp. Could be solved with a roasting rack, but I like the added softness that the onion bed gets from being in contact with the chicken. Truss the bird
Dry brine for at least 2 hours with kosher salt in the fridge
Brush with vegetable oil and cover in spice mix of choice (I like a combo of Weber's Kickin' Chicken and smoked paprika)
I use either my rotisserie on my grill or my Ronco Showtime rotisserie oven to cook to 160F.
Let rest, then carve. Just do it straight in the pan or use a bowl/insert?http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002HDT9FK/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?qid=1423661103&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=boos+oil+butcher+block&amp;pi=AC_SY200_QL40&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=41px725YTrL&amp;ref=plSrch

I use this one, I make cutting boards so I've tried a few different things and that's my favorite anyway. It's more of a paste so it's less messy to put on than a straight oil. I almost never peel carrots. Most of the nutrients are directly beneath the skin anyway. Just give them a good scrub when you're washing them. Leaving the skin on doesn't seem to affect the taste of the final dish in any case.Wow. If I get the cancer or the sideways kidney I'll know it's from the quick rinse/light scrub I give mine! If I buy the carrots at the grocery store, they are definitely peeled.  I assume they are treated with fertilizers and herbicides that I do not in my own garden, and don't forget they've had a long ride from the field to the store.  Even baby carrots, and pre-packaged salads, they all get a double rinse before I use them.

Around my own home though, I just use a scrub brush on the carrots to take off the dirt and they are sweet and the skins very thin anyways.Fricassee from Joy of Cooking (they show it for turkey I think).

Really simple and so very good. Be sure to use plenty of thyme.

Reheats like a champ, not expensive, makes a ton and serves well alone, with rice or egg noodles, or with steamed broccoli or other unassertive veggie. I just watched this last night and it seems very enlightening.


[How to cook chicken like Heston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAZGQql9Dh4#t=125)

The other one seems less about general and more about something specific alternative...   pay more attention to the first stuff.

[Heston's Perfect Crispy Roast Chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kq8k7yTr8Y)I read this as, "No need to flip the microwave"Probe thermometer.

Rub chicken with olive oil and cover liberally with kosher salt and ground pepper.

350F until thermometer reads 160F. Pull and let rest.

Sometimes I'll add:

Good French thyme all over as well as some rubbed sage.

To me the idea of a roast bird like that is that I'm going to have a few meals then use the rest as an ingredient in things like chicken salad, chicken soup/stock, and so on so I need it to be fairly neutral.

Also, if I'm serving it I like to serve it with BBQ sauce on the side or maybe some teriyaki or hoisin sauce or even a little warmed honey mustard. Yes!I would cook the breasts *sous vide*, that is put the raw breasts in a ziploc bag and submerge the bags in 140 degree water for an hour. My crockpot on the warm setting will hold water right around 140-141. It makes the most tender, moist chicken you've ever tasted. Get the cooked breasts cold again in the fridge or some ice water, pat them dry, rub them with a little oil and a generous amount of cajun or creole seasoning and sear them in a smoking hot skillet for about 45 seconds on each side. Now you've got perfect blackened chicken that you can slice and put on a nice big tossed salad or put in a big flour tortilla with cheese, peppers and onions and grill in a skillet for quesadillas.Finer salt dissolves more easily, but no. 40g of salt is 40g of salt.

I thought I could of done harm by taking in too much protein thus knocking me out of Ketosis.I still do. No reason to stop. I just have to set alarms to remind me now. Thank you for the advice everyone. When I got the measurements, I was actually surprised as my clothes are starting to fit better along seeing noticeable differences in my face.I still do! Not saying I stopped but I have to set alarms now which I never had to do before!Awesome.

I know this in my head that if i put on muscle the scale might 'go up' I guess but I have lived my life obese for so long that I am terrified of gain - even though it would be healthy muscle gain.

I'm sitting at around 17% body fat now (as calculated by my FitBit Aria scale for what thats worth). Would love to get rid of the mid section of my stomach and get it flat flat flat! Those sound good!

I'm not so much worried about the eating fish part, but about hitting my macros based on one meal a day without gorging myself.I also brew my own Thai tea, then add sweetener and some heavy cream. Delicious as a dessert.If there's a bodega or truck stop nearby, you can usually find it. If not, I think you can buy packs that you cook at home from Amazon.Tip: Invest in belt which doesn't use set holes: braided belts, canvas sliding belts, etc.

 It's kind of embarrassing having a belt go half way around you but if you're *tight* on money you can save buying mid sizes.  That's the only reason I haven't bought a whole new wardrobe yet.

If you love shopping and want to budget in new clothes though that's also an option. I do my own chocolate too. Usually just chocolate sauce, in a minute... Personally I find coffee a vital part, it tastes way better to me, I love coffee. I add a wee bit of keshew too.
I think the possibilities are endless... Chilli, coconut, keto caramel filling, a little rum, pistachios, there are zillion variations :) I usually just use coconut oil, a cocoa, a little strong coffee (my mix would be too dry anyway since I don't use honey. when I did, it was perfectly smooth without coffee), eythritol, a tiny amount of cashew and that's all, I mix it and it's ready to eat.
But if I add an egg yolk for every 10 grams of coconut oil, it becames especially wonderful, I could spread it on a cake but I typically just eat it up...

It melts, yep. I never tried coconut butter but it's on my todo list. It's very expensive for me right now and I could live my life without it pretty well.Do you dip them in sugar between bites?Vyvanse here, and I find that IF comes naturally between the meds and Keto in general. I've been trying to eat regularly as of late, but found that it's slowed my weight loss almost to a halt the past few days, where I was losing about 2 lb/day initially. Could be related to the initial loss, but even then, at my current weight (320), I should still see a decent loss daily.

Scheduling an intentional IF tomorrow to see if the weight loss picks up again.winter stuff does tend to be sweeter, I think they force themselves to make more sugar through photosynthesis to live longer or something like that.I feel pretty good... not hungry at all (the meal was filling) but im not very energetic...(dont wanna get out of bed and do the things I need to get done kinda feeling)Obviously you should still be brushing/flossing as much as you always have, but I put that clean feeling down to consuming no sugar and drinking lots more water.ok, thank you so much! I was worried it was way to low because i read that most people wake up with a fasting blood sugar of 80 or so.
First I've heard of it. Maybe ask over at /r/ketoscience - they'll have better info about this sort of thing.Congrats buddy. Keep it up!!I would figure out your current body fat % (lots of accurate and not as accurate methods of calculating) and get a realistic goal that is maintainable for you (No fat at all isn't healthy).  You might find that you are at a desirable body fat % currently(8%-12%) and just need to do some strength training to increase your lean body mass.  Obviously you have the dedication to transform your body just need to keep realistic goals if you want to continue to improve and possibly change your routine as your goals change.  Body fat % and lean body mass are more telling than total weight now that you are no longer obese.  Either way awesome progress bro!Lifting. As in barbells.Sadly, only after I told him so.

We are working on a new one -web based one- soon for www.ketogains.comI've noticed this too. I noticed more nutty flavors (and the chocolatey ones) in coffee since cutting out the sugar. I have a new appreciation for my Blue Bottle subscription.I would cancel the appointment entirely, lol. Dieticians are generally not able to do much for you, and will probably want to put you on the same cookie cutter diet they put everyone on. He gave you an 'atta boy at the bottom!Yep, I get really thirsty. Usually the 6-10L includes 2L of water that is mixed with electrolyte packets as well.Just let that comment slide off of you. People say what they say while knowing only a part of the picture. You're not weak/less manly/whatever for having specific dietary needs and following them. Taking on a victim mentality and letting yourself feel like crap despite there being options to make yourself feel better right in front of you? That'd be pretty weak. You take control of your diet and how you feel. Pretty boss way to live life, in my opinion. I'm confused about the to satiety portion. Did you add lime juice for satiety - or you ate that meal until you were satiated ? Well 23/1 doest imply ultra low calories but in fact eating all your days macros in an hour window. One day is not big deal but if you plan on more you still need to get adequate protein and calories. That sounds fantastic! Thanks!How do you feel?I've read elsewhere that it doesn't have the same negative effects as transfats from man-made hydrogenated oils.I work at Target, and our Mossimo skinny jeans are at 70% off! Check them out and get a pair at $7-9 a pair! Energy in the morning, I experienced that. It's one of the main reasons I really try to get back  on  the wagon! I'm a morning zombie normally (I'm way more awake at 3am than in the morning, my brain is kind of asleep till noon), so having way more energy was amazing. I want it back!

Getting tired earlier... I don't remember such thing but I didn't do keto for long. It would be nice to me, I always go to bed too late because I'm not tired or sleepy at all and it's no good as it's interferes with my already handicapped morning state...Its a rip off of my calculator.That calculator is based on my Excel Spreadsheet and I only got credit when I called the author upon it.

Ruled me just steals content from all over the web and posts it as its own.

We are working on a web based version of my Ketogains macro calculafor which will be available soon.Yes, it's fine. Do you feel fine? Keto is often associated with lower blood glucose but people remain asymptomatic. If you feel symptoms then I would be concerned and call your doctor but if you're not otherwise diabetic it shouldn't be an issue though that raises the question of why are you checking your blood sugar? &gt; They told me my total cholesterol was high risk

You can't really assess high risk with total cholesterol alone which is why these health assessment screenings can be troublesome

&gt; Should I get a full blood test before I panic

There's no need to panic. It usually takes 3-6 months for lifestyle changes to affect lipid profile and moreover weight loss alone will affect your lipid profile. Just get a lipid profile at your next annual check up.  Do you drink that much water because of thirst? I drink 1-2 liters a day. I never wake up to pee unless I drink more than that. My urine is mostly clear or light yellow which means you're hydrated.Do you count eggs as meat?  What about cheese?
Also, how have you eaten fish that you dislike it so?  A different method of preparation can transform the eating experience.YES!! I have totally noticed this too!  Awesome benefit!Are you looking for fish recipes?  It's only a couple of months, and it's once a week fish, can you tolerate it that long? If so perhaps you can find some fish options you enjoy.  I do 23/1 IF but that means I still eat everyday.

* Steamed mussels
* Salmon with spinach and Hollandaise sauce
* Tuna melt with portobello mushrooms or stuffed tomatoes
* Baked cod with tomatoes, Feta and olives
* Parmesan crusted cod or any other white fish
* Shrimp scampi
* Seared tuna
Not all of Peets beans are dark roast, but they do dark roast better than anyone else. If you ever get a chance to try Ethiopian Supernatural, it's incredible. It has these amazing berry flavors; it's like drinking blueberry pancakes.I do a lot of fondue, and usually just use veggies as dippers, but I might try making some keto breadsticks to dip this year! To make the fondue. I just use my fondue pot and add in some cheeses like cheddar and gruyere and some cream cheese and a dash of white wine and let it simmer.That's how I pretty much view bread and rolls and such, as a dessert.Took me almost 3 weeks to feel good. Really depends. Think about what you're not eating and how much nutrition you really get from them. Starchy foods usually are not super nutritious, with a few exceptions. When it comes to micronutrients, you'll get those from your vegetables. I take a multi just to make sure. There are also a lot more micronutrients in meat than you might think.

Also fish. Eat fish.

Eat your vegetables, you'll be fine. You are probably getting more vitamins now than you did before you went on keto.

You may want to supplement electrolytes.I have not used that, as we suggest the keto calculator on the sidebar instead. ------------------------------------------------------&gt;

You can download /u/darthluiggi's excel workbook that allows you to input your actual exercise minutes instead.  It is located on the sidebar at /r/ketogains.Yup, looks good.

Fat and protein are not relative to each other.  Protein is relative to lean body mass and activity. Fat is for calories and satiety.

* Limit carbs
* meet your protein goal
* Fat to satiety unless eating at too high of a deficit

Exceedingly high fat = exceedingly high calories = slower to no weight loss

It's net grams not ratios or percentages of macronutrients.Floaty?Awesome. I was just worried that the much lower calorie count would have to be balanced by like a huge increase in protein or something, which given my disdain for fish would likely have to come form supplements or something.

Thanks!Totally go for it. It's like 3.50 a loaf just to warn you Yeah, but it would be a start. I'd only be trying to get him under 30 carbs a day at first. We have such a solid food routine that if I were just able to swap a couple of things he'd be on the diet without doing anything at all. We love sugar.There have been multiple posts about nightsweats in this sub. I know because I did a search before posting this, however the answer I was looking for wasn't in any of them.

Also as I said, this started since I began keto, so I would assume it's related. Thanks for your input but I don't think a visit to the doctor is necessary.&gt; Fresh roasts from places who don't overroast the beans

You missed that part.I'll have to try that! I think my next attempt will be: Egg wash with HWC, pork rinds/Parmesan.Plenty of people on Keto eat on 23/1 schedule (one meal per day).  Just practice a few times heading in and that week should be a breeze.Sometimes one. [Here's](http://restlesspalate.com/coconut-oil-chocolate-recipe/) a decent recipe.  You can, of course, sub out to any sweetener you want if any.

It's basically cocoa powder and coconut oil.  The only downside to this is that coconut oil melts at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, so it will melt in your fingers but man does it make a REALLY easy ganache like chocolate.  You can even add some toasted unsweetened coconut for some extra fiber and flavor.

EDIT:
You can also easily get [cocoa butter](http://www.bulkapothecary.com/cocoa-butter.html) that you can add to make a more traditional chocolate.  I prefer the traditional cocoa butter and cocoa powder chocolate but you can mix and match the coconut oil and cocoa butter to get some interesting finished products.I have never heard of this before and I don't think it has anything to do with your diet. See a doctor.During the last nine months I haven't counted any calories at all; I just made sure I ate 20 g of carbs or less a day.
During the summer months between May and October I played tennis four times a week and now that it's in the winter months I play squash four or five times a week. I do not do any weightlifting at all.
I would say I eat less than 1800 cal a day and I play squash for usually two hours at a time which is about 800-1000 calories burned per hour (avg or estimate).
Some days I'm very strict with my eating some days I definitely go over 1800 as an estimate.Good to know. This is where I got my stats from:

http://www.ruled.me/keto-calculator/That's crazy progress! This is very motivating. What kind of exercise did you do and what did your calorie intake look like?These people exhaust me. My challenge is that despite the fact that I spent a good amount of time reading and studying the subject before I decided to experiment with keto, I'm not particularly good at explaining it, so I get accused of being uneducated and naive. It's working for me. I'm challenging myself psychologically as well as physically. I'm losing weight that's been stubbornly stuck on me for months. I'm becoming more aware of what's in my food. Honestly, anyone who is putting extra work into taking care of themselves earns my respect, whether that's keto, Paleo, or even a high carb raw diet. Kudos to you, I hope you feel awesome. Our bodies are so varied and complex that it takes exploration and experimentation in addition to education to understand yourself. I'll never understand these closed minded cult followings people develop for their nutritional habits. The keto reddit has been the most open minded fitness/diet related reddit I've run into yet. &gt;The last 2 nights I've had the worst insomnia- I usually hit the pillow and drop into dead sleep, but I've been tossing and turning for 2+ hours before falling asleep.

Nurse here. Stress causes the release of cortisol and epinephrin, both of which cause insomnia. Your body is adapting to a new stress and so this wouldn't be surprising.

Hypokalemia and hyponatremia can both cause N/V. Any chance you are pregnant?Like everyone else said, you should be fine.  You should treat yourself every now and again though.  You basically get a free pass to eat meat, so take advantage of it.  Get a big-ass, good steak, and go to town on that thing!Four slices of the trader joes bread is almost the daily limit of carbs alone, 16 carbs..... I'd rather get those from veggies but that's just meA lot of it depends on your goals and what you are doing at the gym.  However, 80g of protein is way too low, so you should move over to /r/ketogains and read their FAQ.Thank you for answering!Italian or creamy Cesar works just as well. Oil-vinaigrette. Any salad dressing thats keto will work perfectly.  Even yogurt or hummus. I've been on the diet off and on for years, and I can do without bread. My husband is so set on having 2 pieces of toast with his eggs in the morning and a pb &amp; j for lunch that I want to be able to substitute it.  I really hope my trader joes carries that bread.  I don't mind baking occasionally but I don't want to do it all the time! im gonna give it a try, so.. following the same logic... a 100% cacao bar from bakers is even healthier than a 75% bar of chocolate then?that sounds delicious, what brand of 100% cacao do you use for your mixture?

I haven't been waking up since I started making sure my water was all in by 6:00 pm or so. I do wake up thirsty, but I know I'm not dehydrated since I get all of my water during a 24 hour period. I'm just dry mouthed when I wake up. Before I stopped the water a few hours before bed I was up a few times a night. Now I sleep all night. You on a deficit? Do you exercise? I found that a large caloric deficit with heavy lifting affects my sleep quality.Just use any dressing that you would like in a salad? Ranch, blue cheese, Caesar are usually all low-no carb choices. If you are following the 0.8g/LBM pound advice, you were taking 142g protein instead of 111g protein.  Lyle McDonald recommends 150g of protein the first 2-3 weeks anyways, so you were doing fine.My go to meal is to buy just a package of 400 gr wok vegetables, all cut up and done;

and add meat that is on discount, usually chicken or ground beef. Please describe the taste of the culinary masterpiece please.Post your height and sex and macros People will be happy to double check your macros for you.i have a bit of a problem with this "bone broth" trend. it's *stock*, people. (yes it's delicious, and i have like 8qts in my freezer at all time, but why do we have to call it 'bone broth'? that's like calling steak 'meat steak')Did they ask you to join crossfit too?
It looks lovely. I wish I could stomach mayo, I just hate the taste. It's one of the things that has put me off unwitches, the fact that they just turn out dry and bland because I can't find an appropriate dressing/sauce that I actually like the taste of. Not sure how to get around it really.I don't think I could sell him on that! Baby steps. I don't but it looks similar to lightly breaded chicken, the crust tends to slightly thin. Yes, sorry I meant 3 months not 4.Thanks, I'll look into that. Small amounts of trans fat naturally occur in beef, so it's not an intrinsic thing to be worried about.I'm actually having a hard time finding pork rinds near me. I've looked at the grocery store and 7-11 type places. Apparently in Boston, people are too "healthy" to eat them. :(

The grocery store used to carry one kind a few years ago but slowly stopped.mmm cake
I can actually smell chocolate from across the room now. I can pick out sweetness everywhere in (what feels like to me) an almost superhuman fashion. If you want Pita/wraps or a base for a pizza then these are pretty good and 4g net carbs. Not really splittable in the same way a pita is though so I sue them more like wraps or cut into quarters as the top and bottom for a handheld burger

https://www.josephsbakery.com/shop/flax-oat-bran-whole-wheat-pita-bread.htmlOh yeah I'm stoked about my results so far! Just that first day was really rough. I weighed myself today and I'm down another pound. If you want Pita/wraps or a base for a pizza then these are pretty good and 4g net carbs.  Not really splittable in the same way a pita is though so I sue them more like wraps or cut into quarters as the top and bottom for a handheld burger
Hard cheeses are usually near zero carbs per serving. They are the ones that typically have been aged for the longest. The cheesemaking bacteria have had the most time to eat the lactose. An example of a soft cheese is cottage cheese. You can still eat soft cheeses on keto, just have toe more careful about the carbs adding up.I had some almond milk this morning and realized how much more sensitive my taste buds are now. Crazy!I've had similar conversations with Paleo-ers! I get the natural, whole foods movement, and I like where it's going in terms of promoting healthier food choices over processed carp. However...carbs galore with some foods!

I think as soon as I go into maintenance mode, I'll venture into some Paleo meal territory, but I'll be as low carb as I can. I used to do Paleo, and I only lost a little bit of weight. Keto is far better for me and my goals! I've found the /r/paleo sub to be pretty negative actually. I think there's a lot more to argue about since paleo has no hard set rules.I have the same issue. I got 10 hours of sleep on Tuesday night. I felt good most of the day. Came around to 8 - 8:30 last night and I knocked out and did not want to get up this morning. Another 10 hours of sleep last night and I would love to go back to sleep.Yeah but you lost 4 pounds! So that's good, right?Wow that is early! I usually went to bed at 2am when I finally felt tired, but now I am getting tired by about 10pm. So I guess it is also easier to fall asleep too. :)Agreed.  The benefits of committing and sticking to this diet far outweigh that "reward" you think you are giving yourself.

But also on that note, don't beat yourself up if you do cheat.  Move on with even more resolve. Health. Lowering blood pressure. I though it was peanut butter at first - now I want a peanut butter and bacon unwich dammit!I've gone keto multiple times and for me, this IS normal. But only for a short period of time. About 2-4 weeks into the start of it.
I make a big plate of food after not having eating much or very little during the day. I start eating and suddenly its not appetizing. I stop after having eaten a little bit.
I think its part of the adjustment to the different types of food and the schedule. After about a month into it, it goes away and I can eat normally.
As a side note, I do NOT follow macros. I don't load up on fat like many do.Yep... I'm with youI have been an insomniac since I was 14 or 15. I take melatonin every night and it usually helps. I'll lie in bed for 30-40 minutes before I pass out and wake up 3-4 times a night. I have slept like a baby the past 2 weeks with very vivid dreams. When I wake up, I'm actually well rested and have more energy.

I didn't even put the two together! I do sleep and wake at around the same time daily. Slim Jims are functionally like Pepperami in that they are shelf stable preserved meat sticks typically sold as a convenience snack - slim jims taste like arse though - Pepperami Firestick FTW - since I morved to the US they are one of few foods I miss - the others being proper pork scratchings and Colston Basset stiltonHmm I'd add some cheese to the flour then. That will probably help it stick a little better. Have you tried pork rind breading? I think it sticks better and gets gets crunchier than almond flour. If you're doing keto properly (that is, following the macros that the calculator provides you, and keeping up on water and electrolyte intake), you couldn't possibly be doing harm.

Keto, so far as every scientific, medical, and anecdotal piece of evidence I know of shows, is straightforwardly healthier than high-carb eating.

Also, if you're eating at a proper deficit, you'll be losing weight in no time, if you aren't already!NH here. Even my snow-loving ass is getting a little tired off all this shovelling. The snow banks around my driveway are officially over my head now.What's the rest of your life like? If I'm stressed or busy the amount of sleep doesn't make a difference Hey! I started the same day you did! What fools we were huh? I'm also 30F though on the other side of the country. I'm hoping to lose about 90lbs.

I feel your pain! I woke up 3-4 times a night. I started tapering my consumption about 3 hours before I go to bed, which has knocked it down to 1-2 pees per night. Also, when I wake up with dry mouth, I don't glug the water like I do in the day, I just sip it and go back to sleep. Seems to do the trick.That sounds much more reasonable than what I did -- two tablespoons right after my first keto breakfast, when I still wasn't used to all that meat so early in the morning. sourdough is what I miss the most.  Honestly, I could eat a whole artisan loaf on my own.Rice?  How can rice be a paleo food?  Isn't the whole deal that you don't eat any grains?  Isn't it a pre-agriculture diet?It's like a superpower. I can taste the surgar in onions and peppers.I threw up a little bit and then got terrible diarrhea... at work. I'd suggest that you read the /r/ketogains FAQ and follow their protein intake recommendations.Creatine I'm on Adderall and I get lightheaded/dizzy/confused/anxious/tired when I don't eat for more than 4-6 hours. These symptoms can be tied to general hunger, but I feel that they are exacerbated by being on a stimulant insofar as my meds tell me I have energy, while my body disagrees, resulting in clunky functioning.

Rather than IF, I eat at specific times--7:30am, Noon and 6:30pm--each around 300 calories of high fat, protein and greens. I also drink a lot of water with the meal and try to take 20-30 min to eat. If you pick at your meal for 30 min, you finish 30 minutes closer to your next meal, which makes it a little easier. The high water consumption helps to mitigate the pangs as well. It get's easier the more I do it, and it seems to be creating a healthier baseline for my portion sizes. I find myself snacking and binging far less than ever before.

Play around with your calories and see how you feel.You're fine. How would you have done harm? Just curious No, you're fine. Oh its there! I just cropped a little better lol
Maybe the HWC is what mine is missing. I just did straight egg. Chipotle mayo made by boars head. Its so damn good. Yea, and I could find studies saying the opposite.  I tried this and ended up with a coating double the thickness that still flaked off. I wake up at 4am so getting tired "earlier" is normal for me but then again if I'm not actively preparing for bed and late at work or otherwise occupied I don't get tired. But when I am at home at the usual hour I go to sleep and not active I'm tired and ready for bed. You might check electrolytes if you feel unusually tired or is it more that it's easier to fall asleep?Thanks for the imput friend, not only the budget, I am 17 with no real knowledge on cooking, also a full time student and at the gym most of the time so it's hard to fit meals in between. I need to lift lol. We have similar SW and GW. I have the most stubborn spare tire.
Great progress.  The past two days in Louisiana we have been getting up to 70! We get random shorts weather, but today and tomorrow we're back down to highs of 50, then back to 70 Saturday and 50 on Sunday.

Can we just have some consistency, please?!What happened to the picture by the toilet?Those are basically fine.  "Slim Jims" are small snack sized sausages (around 1/2 inch diameter and 4 to 8 inches long) usually sold at the check-out line and in service stations.  Not refrigerated and hence lots of preservatives.That's one of the nicest looking lettuce leaf sandwiches I've seen. What's the orange stuff? Mustard? Or some other dressing?Anyone who wants to make a group on Skype so we could talk to each other on a daily basis! Ask questions, support group and stuff?

If you're game then send me your skype ids and let's get this thing going!! :D The quality of the food you consume matters no more on keto than any other diet - keto is about the macros not the micros.

That said - the quality of the food we consume SHOULD matter, regardless of our diet since believe that science bears out the notion that livestock raised in a more natural manner (free range, grass fed, low stress etc) seems to lead to better micronutrients, better Omega 6/3 balance etc.

In a realistic sense, we cannot all suddenly start eating "all natural" foods as the current industry cannot sustain that sort of demand.  Most people - myself included - couldn't afford to eat what we eat unless we make a few compromises and buy factory farmed and/or processed meats from time to time.

All things being equal or if I can afford it, I will spend the extra to buy grass fed beef, dry cured bacon, free range pork etc for the taste, the presumed nutritional advantage, and the ethical angle.Would it be reasonable to increase my protein intake to 75 grams according to blurfocus? Thanks xI don't know much about egg fast. I love eggs and they are great food but I find an egg fast unnecessarily extreme.
I automatically started IF when I started keto (well I actually did something like IF before too, breakfast never was my thing, it's just the eating window was long, like 8-10 hours. Now it's 4-6 hours), it's very natural for me, very pleasant, convenient and helps me losing weight (at least on keto, I can eat really big meals otherwise). Even if I do IF, I do what always: I eat when I'm hungry. I'm simply not hungry till afternoon. Keto and IF - a great combo for me,  I love it!

But I can't know what your experiences will be, of course. To me, IF only has advantages. So I think you should try it, maybe it's your thing.I'm not. I'm indifferent about them.

Can we be friends now? :DDo a little searching.  You'll find that not only is there no evidence for vitamin supplements in healthy individuals but there is a casual correlation between them and sickness. Save your money. I see, thank you for your reply :)YesI have seen that said around the subreddit, but did you also find you get tired earlier too?Thanks! Now I know the types of fat :)Ok, maybe I wasn't clear enough. "Preaching" to other people you're doing a better, harder, healthier (inject suitable adverb) is NOT gonna give you social brownie points.

Thank you for the advice and I ment sausages like these sorry I'm from the uk and have no idea what slim jims are :P http://images2.mysupermarket.co.uk/Products_1000/67/306167.jpg?v=5?1423757632538%20=1423757632538Sub minerals.
Avoid multi-Vitamins.
If you don't get a lot of sun light sub vitamin D.
Get regular checkups and blood work. I don't know anyone who's had a deficiency on keto besides the things mentioned. That is most definitely not normal. See a doctor about this, you might have trouble digesting certain foods. Has your diet been low in fats for a while? Were you vegetarian previously? Did you just change my life?I'm guessing your future mother-in-law is just insulted that you didn't eat what she made for you, or forced her to make something that wasn't her specialty.  Is that a possibility?  As for feeling weak, I have about five or ten pounds that I'd like to lose, and I'm a pastry chef and artisan bread baker and confectioner.  When it comes to diet, I'm the strongest person I know. By rights I should be overweight, what with my line of work, and everyone assumes I'm gobbling up crusty sourdough and cream puffs and nougat.  I would love to eat the wonderful foods I make.  But I don't.  It takes almost superhuman effort to resist this stuff!  So stand proud, and maybe try to explain to her that you are doing this for medical reasons!Provided you are actually eating a good, balanced keto diet (like you're not just eating cheese and diet pop and calling it keto), the only area where you might lack vitamins would be electrolytes. Sodium, potassium, magnesium. The reason we have that problem is that in a perfect keto world, you'd be consuming MUCH more animal product than you probably consume today. Organs, blood, etc. That's where those electrolytes would normally come from.

That being said, a multivitamin probably can't hurt. You could always get bloodwork done and decide what's best with your doctor based on your result.Lol I'm 6 feet and the snow banks tower over me in some spotsThings like this make me glad I'm not male. There are definite downsides to being female, but at least my midnight pissing is efficient :)Improved sleep is a common keto side effectPaleo has a lot of cult mentality (like most diets) and has been adding more carbs back into it as what's "allowed" over the last few years and a lot of it's proponents have championed 100-200g of carbs per day from starchy vegetables, rice, quinoa etc as well as from fruits.

Fruits is the biggest argument I get from paleoers. They all seem to ignore that for the majority of the planet all of those foods are extremely seasonal.Never, ever talk with paleo or vegan people lol. (kidding)
Paleo is a very broad term. It comes of course from paleolithic which means stone age or before agriculture. But, homo sapiens has spread around the world and there were a lot of different diets. People in Indonesia ate differently than the inuit or the vikings or people in Chile. There are also genetic differences because of that. Like the P479L gene or the fact that lactose tolerance is different for people around the globe for example. So, paleo is a very loose term.

I do paleo, but keto. I eat raw salmon, egg yolks, avocado, vegetables, etc..... But you can also eat bananas the whole day and do paleo. It doesn't mean anything. You have living food, raw food, paleo, cavemen and god knows how many diets.

But it is all personal. You have to find what works for you and that will also change throughout your life. It's a personal journey. The body is a very complex biochemical machine and everyone has a slighty different one.

But we do know that HFCS and too much carbs are not the way to go. :-)
I've been on keto almost 5 months, and I have the same problem :p Well, maybe not to the same extent. I usually drink some water during the day, and then polish off a 1.5 liter bottle of seltzer water in the evening. Some evenings I'm thirstier though, and drink 2 bottles (3 liters) and I'm only exaggerating a little when I say I have to get up to pee once an hour all night long :p My big meal of the day is dinner, and I'm a salt fiend, so I'm pretty sure my sodium is fine. Congratulations on your sobriety - I have someone in my life whom I am very close to who is beginning that journey for herself, as well. I'm as proud of you as I am of her.

It's so funny, because I don't and never have been a drinker... so I've actually experienced your story from the other side. People being like, "but... what do you DO for fun??" Your anecdote totally makes sense though... experiencing someone who exists completely outside your understanding could stand to be confusing. I hope I'm not giving her an identity crisis, lmao.90% Lindt tastes like a Candy bar :)

I buy a stack regularly, and ended up getting an 85% in the mix. Didn't realize until I ate some of it - even that small difference was very noticeable.Check the ketogains FAQ.

1 lb a week is about top end to avoid muscle loss.

Don't force it.I guess my point is:  most cheeses seem pretty low in carbs, even traditional soft cheeses like gorgonzola and Roquefort.  Compared to many other food groups, cheeses across the board always seemed to me to be a safe bet.  Was wondering if I was missing some.I can see where the idea could come from. Like you can't control your cravings or have no will power. I totally get that people can see you that way for eating a diet whose benefits include reduced hunger and no cravings.

I know that for me, if I decide to break my diet and eat pizza, for example, I will have a very hard time eating just one or two slices. Is it a weakness? Is it a character flaw? Yes. It absolutely, definitely, certainly is. I will not dispute that. However, which do you think is a better course of action? To try and work against those cravings and risk caving and overeating, or to acknowledge your weaknesses and employ a plan that eliminates them?



I think it's the same reason people keep putting more and more sugar in stuff. You enjoy the sugar taste but get desensitized.

I like coffee and chocolate. You start off pretty weak and work stronger. So now I'm using an aeropress and 2-3 tables spoons of coffee per cup and 100% cacao.I'm so ready! It's been *years*.I wonder if its from the sugar, or just the highly refined flour that starts converting to glucose in your mouth almost immediately. A slice of wonder bread only has 2-3g of sugar, hardly enough to make it taste like cake.Holy crap.   I've never thought to put cream in it.  Is it like drinking a root beer float then???Maybe a dumb question but all the prepackaged burgers I've seen have at least 2g of trans fat. Is that okay to be consuming or is that a type of fat to avoid?You really should try IBC root beer.  Fantastic stuff.Technically, no.  Keto is about adequate protein, limiting carbs, and eating fat to satiety.  However, after you learn these basics, then you get into other discussions about fat composition, toxins, preservatives, additives, sustainability, etc.

Much of the advice on /r/keto is about how to successfully implement the lifestyle and hopefully improve your health, and eating whole foods instead of Atkins bars is an example.  If you are talking about "Slim Jims" type pre-packaged sausages, they are probably fine in a pinch, however I wouldn't make them a large part of my diet.Self-discpline isn't an issue with me but availability of low-carb foods is a huge issue. I can't cook meat because I stay in a vegetarian household..So only cottage cheese.BUT THE CANCERZ!!11one

If you're anti-artificial sweetener we can't be friends. As a Dietitian I feel superior to my peers, because I know and they are too ignorant and brainwashed to even seeYup, that's the thing. I like spicy food but it's got to be home-made. Even if I exercise, I tend to gain weight so low-carb is the only the thing working for me with the reactive hypo.

Feels so frustrating to see others gorge on carbs and not having choices.here is a link that seems to have a pretty good discussion

http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1yfysw/are_saturated_fats_as_good_as_unsaturated_fats/Mayonnaise, ranch, or low carb ketchup are all great!No problem, enjoy!Today i slept 10 hours. I had to go three times :/ It pissed me off...Ooo. That sounds great! Do you have photos of the mayo fried version?Keto is about ketosis so no, meat quality doesn't matter as long as you achieve ketosis. However for most keto is also about overall health and so you might consider not just eating processed meats and incorporating other meat as well4 slices?? Shiiit, maybe he should quit bread cold turkey and do lettuce wraps instead.Judging by your comment history I would say that you have a tendency to go on to other people's celebratory threads an cut them down and call them fat so I'm just going ignore this and take my doctor's advice. I think you should consider seeing a mental health care professional yourself if that's how you get your kicks. Carbs for cheese varies, if the package says 0 then it's no more than 0.4 grams per serving I know you're leaving your job soon, so thankfully you won't have to confront her on a daily basis anymore.  But just gonna add a brief anecdote, in case you encounter any similar characters... I quit drinking over 7 1/2 years ago at 19 years old.  Now when I meet people that also don't drink I think it's great.  But when I was a raging alcoholic I remember meeting this one guy at college who didn't drink, and didn't have any obvious 'tells' (still went to bars, wasn't mormon or uber religious, etc.)  I also thought he was really cool, and he was the only person I ever remember meeting that was cool AND didn't drink, at the same time!  This was like a bomb to my entire world view, and every time I saw him I would ask him about it, probably to the point of being annoying.  I didn't even realize if I was being annoying at the time -- to me, he was like a confusing human specimen who I needed to understand, due to my own problem with alcohol, of course.  My point being, maybe she has a really unhealthy relationship with food or her body, and the thought of seeing someone actively changing their body is something she sees as beyond her comprehension.  Not sure if this is helpful at all, just trying to offer some possible insight into why people act crazy sometimes. Usually it's because we are, indeed, crazy.  But we can always get better.  At least I like to think so.  When you see her you can be happy that you're living in the solution, and pray that she also finds her solution.  That's what I try to do, anyway.Even within /r/keto you have wildly varied beliefs that make discussions harder than they ought to be.



I've never brought up keto or dieting with anyone in person, but I end up being asked about it all the time anyway.I'm different. I have a different constitution, I have a different brain, I have a different heart. I got Tiger Blood.Yes, it will. When I do IF I drink black coffee with stevia by the liter.
Next to the caffeine fix it will help to suppress your hunger a bit.

But, as anbeav said, the main benefit of IF is the convenience and simplicity. I also like to do a 16/8 or a 18/6 always but sometimes hanging out with carb friends make it difficult.
I overlap.
During my cycle each month I add berries to my yogurt. Or once in a while honey in tea. Banana pancakes maybe once a month.

But that's it for fruit. It still fits my macros. I'm with anbeav, we shouldn't overcomplicate things sticking a mere number... Our body don't work so easily anyway, such numbers are just a guide.
I personally have no such problem, I never could drink coffee black either but spices helped a lot (I usually use coconut milk as well though. or butter. but not in my fast period) and I don't actually need coffee. I'm not an expert at all but I don't think even a coffee with a tiny amount of nut milk would be a problem.Very good point! If I just pick something that would gross them out I may have a shot! :)
They do have a tasty whole shrimp dish there I know we could all eat. I appreciate the advice!Resistance training = Lifting heavy weights.  It causes your body to react physiologically and can help reshape your body.

I have been fantasizing about the cream in diet root beer - please tell me its amazing? D:I asked a similar question last time I was on KETO.  below is a link to that thread.  Wasn't super definitive though.

http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1j3dos/gallstones_whats_the_real_deal/This sort of thing really perplexes me. Keto and Paleo are fundamentally similar. While paleo types don't necessarily limit their carbs, they generally eat a very low amount just due to the nature of the diet.

We also similarly do not eat sugar or grains.

I do agree that paleo is more strict, mainly because it's an elimination diet that has a lot of restrictions that are not necessary for most people, and a good number of which are based on woo/pesudoscience but do seem to yield results for many people.

They are both good diets, I think you just caught some elitists (Were they crossfitters? They had to have been crossfitters) who think, like some of us sometimes make the mistake of doing, that they've found some holy grail of health and nutrition and are looking down their nose at anyone who hasn't found the same holy grail.

No joke. I had a couple strawberries yesterday - fucking unbelievable.They can eat family style and you order your dish to add to the others and just eat that.  I doubt the steamed meat and veggies will be a crowd favorite :)Broth and vitamins are your friend.

Make sure you drink enough water - I have to force/remind myself

If you are not hungry, dont eat. Just because it is 8am, noon or 6pm does not mean you have to eat out of habit.

Jerky, nuts or 99% chocolate is a great thing to keep in your bag in the case that you get a bit nippy

Your main goal is to get in your required amount of protein. After that, the rest is pretty much just filler (eat enough fat/carbs so you are not hungry - but you dont need to hit your limit just because you can)

There is no shame in keeping it simple - bacon and eggs, bunless cheese burger, pork chops with garlic mayo ect. The longer I am on keto, the more I find complex recipes overrated

Go shopping often and get good deals on meat/freeze

Try eating less/intermittent fasting when at a plateau

Be proud of keto. Haters gonna hate, dont let them get you down.

Don't stress about asking to change your rice for a salad and that odd bid of carrot/onion in your curry is not the end of the world.

Straight up cheating on keto is not worth it. bread, pasta, and potatoes become a distant memory after awhile.&gt; anbeav - i'm 5'2.5 52kg, 23% bf eating 1600-1700 cals and counting macros 5%carbs 20% protein and 75% fat. generally losing about 0.5-1lb a week which is fine. But wanted a bit more of a boost before my hols.

&gt; darthluiggi - I didnt think eggs were magical, i'd just heard an egg fast could give you a boost if you were in a plateau.I call that a pee-boner. she sounds like a human pathogen.  yay for you!!! AFAIK you need to possibly supplement sodium, potassium and magnesium Good point - the only thing different is the packaging. I'm the type of person who can't keep "treats" in the house because I'll eat the whole box/bar in one go. I've been experimenting with the really really elaborate and tasty sugar-free gums like Trident Layers because it's only 1 g net carb and it lets me feel like I'm "treating" myself when I'm in the store passing the candy aisle.[Flaxseed crackers in the microwave](http://easylocarb.com/recipe/flaxseed-crackers/) are a great way to eat cheese.During the last nine months I haven't counted any calories at all; I just made sure I ate 20 g of carbs or less a day.

During the summer months between May and October I played tennis four times a week and now that it's in the winter months I play squash four or five times a week. I do not do any weightlifting at all.

I would say I eat less than 1800 cal a day and I play squash for usually two hours at a time which is about 800-1000 calories burned per hour (avg or estimate).

Some days I'm very strict with my eating some days I definitely go over 1800 as an estimate. Eat your vegetables and eat a variety of other foods meat, nuts, cheese, fish and no!

If you live on processed meats, no vegetables, and a limited diet, perhaps. Also consider that most people on a SAD diet are not necessarily the picture of nutritional health, the reason the food is fortified is because it's nutritionally deplete.

Your mom seems to be nagging you about keto a lot and I assume she knows nothing about it so you need to either educate her or ignore her

The micronutrients in fruit you can get from other foods and many vegetables are more nutritious than fruit as it's mostly a convenient sugar delivery vesicle

The science-tell me what's in fruit you can't get from other foods?

I think you might need to explain to your mom that you've researched this, it's safe (provide a copy of the art and science of low carbohydrate living) and ask her to respect your choices and that you don't want to discuss any further. I had the same problem. Going to get it resized some day (it was custom made), but I'm thinking of getting something new to wear as a placeholder.Ahh thank you :) Pinot Noir and sparkling wines/champagne it will be! Much appreciatedNo sugar added dark chocolate seems like a great idea - I was a milk chocolate gal so I have to be careful as it's a slippery slippery chocolatey slope.

I went to a brazilian steakhouse in December pre-keto and I remember feeling soooo guilty about all the meat I ate - Can't believe I didn't think of this sooner!!

Thank you for the insight and I am in love with the getdrunknotfat (it's my life motto)So at first you disliked it? but at the end you started enjoying it? how much did it last for you to start liking it?.  do you do it because of the health benefits or because U CAN do it? Everybody is different, but I found that I don't get the laxative effect if I take 1 tsp in a small amount of water after a meal.  On an empty stomach... yeah, not good.Make sure your oil is hot before putting the chicken in. I also double bread my chicken. So dip in egg/heavy cream mixture, coat with breading, dip in egg mixture again, coat with breading, shake off any excess, then into the frying pan. Good luck! It's good to get all this idiocy on the record so that when we finally decide collectively to stop the diabetes epidemic we will know who gets tarred and feathered first.

&gt; Experts say starchy food should make up around a third of the food we eat.Yeah, I've upped my g carb / day to 50 since I hit my target weight, and peanut m&amp;ms used to be a staple of mine. They are absolutely 100% candy-coating to me now. I could not taste anything else. It was incredible (not in a good way)That quote stuck with me as well. They're right, because that's essentially how fat accumulation works.

If the effect of carbohydrates made you obese, reintroducing them stands the chance of making you gain all the fat back. Sucks, but that's metabolism for you..I know. I used to work at Peet's coffee.For me in my circles, the term keto has negative connotations, mostly do to the fact that it is food source agnostic (if you wanted to eat 100% processed food you could and still be doing keto correctly.)

I don't eat lots of processed food, so I generally say I'm low-carb primal. That automatically makes people think whole foods, fresh veggies, etc. I also say primal because dairy, and do not ever say 'my diet is Paleo, but I eat dairy' - the hardliners get upset.

Sometimes I even say IIFYM.  And I don't label my macro set at all, I let everyone make assumptions about the things I eat.

of course, I try to avoid all of the above BS, by following the first rule of keto.I bet it felt great to put it back on! And you're right, what's a few more months? Great job!That's a good idea. =) sweet of him!One of the best bosses was into paleo. Nicest guy ever, ex marine.Thank you!Wow, amazing progress. Let us know some details. Are you counting calories, if yes what's your deficit? How often are you lifting / cardio?
Whyyyyy does nobody read the FAQ?? Sourdough bread actually has a glycemic index of 54, which puts it (barely) in the category of a low-glycemic-index food.Ooh, I'll have to try the Trader joe's stuff. I'm not sure I can make enough cauliflower bread to cover the 4 slices minimum that my husband eats a day. This actually worries me a bit. I'm pretty strict on my keto, and I aim towards zero carbs (really), and accept that there are some hidden carbs or unavoidable carbs.

Except I eat in the company cafeteria, which is ostensibly healthy Chinese food. When I look up a lot of Chinese recipes they often have sugar (a couple of tablespoons for six servings, for example). As a consequence I avoid the food with sauces.

But I really, really love green vegetables. And since starting keto, they taste _so_ danged sweet that they're not as enjoyable, but I also question whether or not they have sugar added. One of the local employees told me it's a winter crop; they're naturally sweet. But it's driving me crazy.

I wonder if I'll like sweet corn when I reach my goal weight?
I couldn't eat all of my dinner last night either.Fresh roasts from places who don't overroast the beans are even more amazing, with coffee there is a wide spectrum of flavors, even if it's a different roast on the same beans...I started looking at the peking duck as well. In my experience there, since they are a dim sum place, they like to put a sweet glaze on the duck, so I will most likely have to avoid it. I want a simple meat and veggies dish. A whole other issue is they want to eat "family style" so I have to share everything too. TKD questions should be adressed in /r/ketogains

Egg Fasts are not magical - they work mostly because you are eating in a controlled deficit and are being accountable with calories and portion controll, not due to some magical properties from Eggs.I'm only on Day 6 so I have the disadvantage of little perspective but the advantage of a fresh memory of Day 1. I haven't "cheated" at all yet, either. When I first configured My Fitness Pal I said I wanted to lose 1.5 pounds a week, and as you can see from my stats I'm not a very large person, so this left me at 1200 calories a day. This is, on average, is what I was eating on my old "healthy" diet with 50% of my calories coming from "healthy" carbs. I'm enjoying the food and new lifestyle and relishing my long lost relationship with butter, but usually still hungry at the end of the day and was feeling really funky at first, probably largely from lack of electrolytes. Once I realized that I was probably severely lacking in sodium, potassium, and magnesium, I took measures to remedy that by making a bone broth and a soup out of chicken bouillon cubes, sauteed mushrooms, avocado, and parsley. Yummy! But I was still hungry and craving dessert, even 1600 calories in. So I topped off my night with a bowl of heavy cream mixed with stevia and vanilla extract. Double yummy! It's easy to make keto treats without "cheating", I just recommend beginning with a simplified approach to what "cheating" actually means -- it means eating carby foods, NOT eating too many calories. At least that's how I'm managing to get through, by being forgiving of myself if I'm still hungry at the end of the day and giving myself a fatty treat. As far as I'm concerned, I can just decrease my calories after my body adapts in a few weeks or on days when I'm less hungry. Once I actually kick into keto, I apparently shouldn't really have many hunger pangs at all and can start experimenting with intermittent fasting. But for now, I'm in no huge hurry to lose weight, and I really don't have much to lose. I'd rather set myself up for success in the long term than shoot for quick gains that are a total joyless chore.  I also read a lot of testimonials and keep reminding myself it's going to get easier.  Best of luck!!

TL;DR: I'm a newb, too.  Get those electrolytes! And if you feel like cheating, just whip up a keto dessert or eat a bunch of cheese or pork rinds or something. It will feel like cheating but it's not.  You could also possibly import some of the "rootbeer mix" or extract from the US too. Usually it is just the flavor packs, you mix it with whatever sweetner and carbonate.Safest thing would be steamed meat and vegetables with soy sauce. Beef and broccoli would not be a good choice as most if not all of the sauces have starch and/or sugar. The Peking duck would be an awesome choice as most aren't cooked with carbs but you might have to double check how they prepare itReally similar stats, from someone who didn't take progress pics, thanks! Really motivating. I was starting to think the same. I'll have to have my girlfriend or her brothers order for me because this is like some OG chinese restaurant stuff going on there.I definitely agree!  I don't think its a finish line, but sometimes I sorta view it that way from a very hard work perspective.  I think i've lost alot quickly because I have been attacking this very aggressively. When I hit 180 I might be able to ease off a little bit and just get into more maintenance instead of 'aggressive loss mode".

Certainly not happy with where I am at yet tho!  For once I'd love to be basically fully trim with no fat at all - I think if I want to reach that I might have to dip below 180 tho!  I guess I will address that when the time comes.  Thanks for your thoughtful response!Ok that totally makes sense.

Thanks for the info!You're welcome to post this in /r/FreeEBOOKS :)The highest estimate I have ever seen is 12 weeks, and that is just for top physical activity.  At 20g carbs, your brain seems to be about 85% transitioned in four days, and two weeks is usually sufficient for basically all brain transition and a good part of system conversion.  Two weeks in seems to be a low point of physical performance, however, as the initial effect of adrenaline wanes.  I have PCOS an endocrine disorder, I tried every diet to lose weight. I ate 1200 calories a day and gained weight! I topped out at 250 before finding keto now I weigh in the 180's and still losing but I am eating 1400 calories! I eat more and weigh less. My mother in law is Asian (I'm not) and she made me feel awful about never eating her food, but now is starting to get it. I don't view Keto as what is making me weak, it is helping me be strong.How is your fiber intake? I've noticed that if my fiber is not up to par, I'll get really bad stomach cramps, and or nausea. The nausea will sometimes come out of nowhere. It's worth a try. I have been eating a serving or two of coconut flour a day along with what I get from a few veggies and sometimes also add a soluble fiber supp as well.I've noticed that unsweetened coffee--when brewed well--is almost chocolatey with a hint of sweetness.Just ask for no sauce, there's probably lots of sugar and starch. Man, diet root beer with heavy whipping cream is my jam.I had 4-6 of them in my mouth.  I chewed them up and thought "What am I doing??!?" and spit them out.

Then I ate some sugar free chocolate pudding and made some thick sugar free chocolate milk.  :)Great Job! KCKO!![Thinslim](http://www4.netrition.com/thinslim_foods_bread.html) or [great low carb bread company](http://www.netrition.com/glc_bread_company_bread.html)

1g net carb each (7g fiber)Try an unwich, seriously, most don't miss the bread at all. Moreover it would likely be a better long term strategy rather than appealing him with substitutes. However I think Trader Joe's has a low carb bread and if you search ruled.me, cavemanketo.com, ibreatheimhungry.com or /r/ketorecipes you'll find recipes and reviews Easy sandwiches don't need bread.  Prep a bunch and put them in a tupperware.

Pepperidge Farms 'carb style' is 5net per slice but it adds up too quickly for it to be more than a treat. There are also many different brands of low carb wrap 3-6net but taste and texture varies. Again they add up.
Really attempt the romaine leaf 'unwitches'. You could probably make your own if you wanted to bother...  There are lots of recipes for making the syrup, you could make it keto, and just add soda water.The brain uses a lot of energy, I wouldn't be surprised if that figure goes insanely high when we are stressed. So the fact that you have a craving is most likely just a fact that you're hungry. Find the best Keto foods you can and keep them handy. I make a 160g heavy cream drink with 40g coconut oil and 40g Kerry gold butter, 7g cacao powder, cinnamon, vanilla, cayenne/paprika. It's about 1000kcals and I keep it hot in a thermos all day. It's been a life saver for me since I hate having to pack and carry a bunch of foods with me when I'm out of the house.I make [cauliflower bread](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=2232221) because honestly, I just need a vehicle for my meat and cheese. But Trader Joe's has a sprouted bread that's 4g net carbs.You don't find it hard to meet your protein macro?  Sometimes I have trouble meeting the daily goal and I'm not even trying IF.  Usually on the days I'm drinking a bulletproof coffee instead of bacon and eggs or a protein shake.  I would worry about not being able to reach my protein macro if I was skipping two meals. Europe's bread game is taken seriously by the citizens.

Bakeries are like Starbucks there (i.e. on each and every corner).I love IF! Especially when traveling or at a function where you aren't sure if there will be suitable food, suddenly food doesn't even become a worry. You don't have to plan snacks to stuff in your bag or anything cuz you know you'll have a feast when the hour comes.Egg fast - unnecessary unless you really like eggs but there's no need to drastically cut calories just eat eggs at a reasonable deficit

IF - keto and IF pair well, useful for many and it makes eating at a deficit feel better and thus most are more consistent and lose more efficiently but it's not magic

TKD-this is complete separate consideration and has more to do with training than fat loss

Just curious, what are your stats? What is your average loss per week? Are you counting calories and macros? If so how many calories?What an inspiration to us all!I preferred diet soda over regular soda pre-keto too.

That corn syrup is too sticky to enjoy.Ooooh...  How do you do that?  I'm interested in making my own chocolate...I found that instead of egg, using mayonnaise works better with almond flour. Plus shake off excess flour before frying.Austrian here, I love root beer. Sadly I can only get it at specific import shops, and I've never seen a diet version. Your period of very decreased appetite only lasts through adaptation - say three months maximum.  I'd day take advantage of it.I wish I had gotten a better handle on comprehending how the body metabolizes the food it takes in versus what it does with the extra nutrients.
That's why I ate yummy grilled pork last night :-) Oh. Weak in that sense... Yeah, I do. I am also reactive hypoglycemic and have a fructose intolerance that causes bloating and I can't handle my spicy food. I'm also Hispanic so I tend to get crap for the latter.

It is quite annoying not to be able to handle much spicy food since I actually like it.

However, I feel way stronger than most people in the fact that I am able to realize I have food intolerances and am actually doing something to live a digestion problem free life. Not everyone has the will power that us ketoers have and that has to count for something. C: kckoThanks I will go to that! Last time I did a calc for body fat it was 11% on me I think any links to good body fat calculator? Excellent work and an inspiration to us all.

Yes tweak those calories to squeeze out those last few pounds.

Although you must feel pretty good at your current now.

Well done &amp; Good Luck.I was thinking of taking a supplement but trying to find the right one
Yeah I stopped being able to wear my ring about a month ago. My husband said my valentines day present is going to a nice chain to wear it on. Yes it's pretty effective. Haha for dinner I had planned on having a couple meatballs and then a chicken salad. Buy I got through 2.5 meatballs and wanted to vomit. I didn't even get to start my real dinner. I felt happy that I was full but a little sad I couldn't eat my delicious salad. Multivitamin isn't going to cut it, you need much more potassium and magnesium than is in a multivitamin. I would get a chelated magnesium supplement like magnesium citrate. For potassium, mushrooms, avocado, spinach, yogurt, fish; lite salt or no salt potassium supplements whoa!! AWESOME!Thank you for the brands!  I was wondering if the coconut milk was in the can or carton.  My birthday is next month and I was trying to think of something low(er) carb for the cake that everyone could enjoy (and that wasn't cheesecake).  I'll have to give this one a test try!Really though, congrats on your weight loss success. in the beginning at least a couple, but 2 months in noneYes! That's exactly what I was thinking. Thank you for your advice. I was a little worried. Way to go!Doesn't this qualify as NSV? Lol sorry for all the folks in the colder regions. It has been quite warm lately... For about  2 weeks. I feel great all the time! Except when I eat, but I was thinking maybe I'm just full before I realize it. That's what I was thinking, maybe my body is just saying I'm full before I realize it!That's a good kind of embarrassed! I've lost my pants in Target, reaching up for something on a shelf. It was not pleasant but a good kind of mortified!I've been on keto for 2 weeks. I have never experienced this before and no I haven't been to the doctor because it was a new thing. It happened the last time I tried keto too. Not sure what it could be. Buy a smoker, it'll make the diet a lot more fun. There a lot you can do with it, and it's easier to make flavorful meats w/o sugar than with bbq (although there's plenty you can do with that too, there just tends to be a reliance on sugar in a lot of the marinades / sauces / rubs, so you gotta watch out for it).

Moussaka! There are many mediterranean dishes that don't have any carbs (or are entirely veggie based). Look into Greek and Lebanese food especially. Also the olive bar at the supermarket can be great  roasted red peppers, artichokes, marinated garlic etc.

Tuna poke or sashimi platters are actually quite easy to make at home. You can also make ramen with Shirataki noodles and it doesn't really feel like a keto-sub, people actually do eat it like that sometimes just cuz.

Hot pot is great. Go to an asian supermarket and go nuts, it's really easy to make and a lot of fun. Get lots of enoki mushrooms instead of noodles.Oh geez, they're really doing that? Smh lol
Some friends posted they made no sugar added chocolate chip cookies... I told them chocolate chips (tollhouse) are at least 50% sugar lol. They stood by their claim. Shrug.

For me fructose = fructose, glucose = glucose, and same for all the other forms of sugar. Every natural sweetener out there is just a combination of these.I think it's because of the metallic taste your breath/saliva take on when in ketosis.  I recently became addicted to seltzer water when I realized it tastes amazing when I'm in ketosis.  I worked up to it and now I actually enjoy it. It's like espresso.

I usually eat one little square from a large bar at a time (maybe 1 or two a day) and I just put it in my mouth and let it melt.Pretty effective way to get you from eating too much, right?Isn't the coating high in carb?A multivitamin isn't a bad idea but you will need far more sodium, potassium and magnesium that it will provide.  Check the FAQ for dosages and keep in mind this is in addition to normal daily requirements.

Don't worry, it's not too hard to supplement.  Use Nu or Lite Salt for potassium, broth for sodium and a chelated magnesium pill (any kind ending in 'ate').

Good luck!Obviously Mother Nature is not a Patriots fan...  We're gonna have a long weekend of -23 C (on average) here.

No snow though, ha ha!My partner and I work together, and currently working a lot of overtime hours.

We started going to the grocery store by our office and buying some thick cut dry sausage, fancy cheese, a cumber and spicy mayo.

We then come back upstairs and do a sort of 'kids lunchables' style lunch -super fast and easy - also cost us like 7$ each (with leftovers for the next day)Around 20 a day it seems...Just remember that your body will need 50-75g of protein per day even after keto-adapted. That protein will come from somewhere. If not from your diet, then....The keto calculator tends to over-estimate exercise calories, so we recommend that you set it to sedentary in determining your macros.  You only need the maximum suggested protein on heavy weight lifting days and 80% of max on rest days.  I don't think that you will need or want that much fat (especially for the first three months.)  Set to sedentary and a 23% deficit and remain on Standard Keto until you hit 15% BF.  Then you can move to the more advanced TKD explained in /r/ketogains.ah, thank you! I also was getting leg cramps at night but thought that was due to walking through a foot of snow to work :P Seems its time to get me a multivitamin!For me almost everything tastes sweeter. Tomatoes, mandarin oranges, the few Ryvita I have on occasion. It seems super strange to me that my taste buds are so amped when it comes to even the slightly of sweet foods.Congratulations friend :)

I might have a suggestion for you.

It's your body and your life, so take my advice or leave it; that is entirely up to you.

It looks as though, honestly, you don't "need" to lose more weight. That is, if you are eating such that you feel comfortable with your intake, and you look in the mirror and are proud with the way you look, and you wake up in the morning and last throughout the day feeling great, than you might just be able to continue exactly what you're doing and stay right where you are.

If that idea isn't attractive to you, and you want to be positively chiseled and look like you dreamed, and you're just not feeling like you're there yet, then hey, who am I to suggest that you stop.

But honestly, you look great, and if you feel great and like where you're at, there's no real NEED to force yourself to go any lower.

Also, I would caution against thinking of this like a real goal-line where, once you cross it, you're done and you win.

This is a life-long experience. If you feel like you've "won" when you hit your goal weight, you might go back to eating like you used to, and then it's all over but the crying until you hop back on the keto wagon :p

Best of luck to you whatever you decide, and I am impressed at your progress.

Well done :)

Edit: Also keep in mind exercise adds muscle to your body, so you may not be able to hit 180 as easily as you could have once before. You may have more muscle on your body now :pBritlandian here, **love** root beer! Costs so much to buy over here because nobody sells it, we have to import brands like A&amp;W and MUG from America. It's usually a treat I enjoy two or three times a year at most really :(Ah, making those happy college memories, I see! Seriously, this will probably be one of your favorite stories when you think back about time in college. I once showed up to a formal lecture in a v-neck and yoga pants and pretended they were black slacks. Womp womp.My ring had been too tight for years, but I had to stop wearing it about 6 months before keto as it became so tight that I could hardly get it on/off

My first NSV came about in my first few weeks of keto when I was all "hm, I wonder if my ring fits" tried it on, and it fit perfectly

Right now, I am at the point just before it falling off - it spins in place and the stones always end up sliding to the bottom. I want to get it re sized but I figure there is little point until I get near my goal weight.

The way I see it, I had to go 6 months without wearing it as it was too small - I could prob go another 6 months because it is too big :)As a culture whose obsession with being fit is almost rivaled by its obsession with superheroes, I'm starting to think ketoers might just be the modern superhero. You think batman HAD to get his snack in before saving Gotham so he wouldn't get grouchy? Pshhhh. All these stories are really motivating me through adaptation phase. Day 6 and my best friend says I'm going cuckoo and my eyes are dilated and sometimes I have laughing fits for no reason and I can't stop mumbling about butter. #ketocrayI have never read science for this but it sounds reasonable to me, do you go to bed and wake up at the same time every night/morning? I would imagine if you did your body would catch on and do something to not have to pee during your sleep window. But if sleep schedule is all over the place, then body never knows what to expect. Just an idea, no science behind it.No, just the opposite.  I feel weak as a person when I overeat and delay my progress in getting back to a reasonable weight and improving my health.  &gt; "Yeah, I heard it shrinks fat and water cells, but as soon as you start eating carbs again it will fill them all up again and you'll gain weight."

This one annoys me so much and I hear it all the time. They've validated the keto diet in one sentence but somehow still blame keto for weight gain? It's no coincidence that adding carbs makes you gain weight. That's not keto's fault, it's carbs.

There was a woman on BBC Breakfast News the other morning blaming saturated fat for obesity and heart disease. Her reasoning was that saturated fat encourages you to eat carbohydrates [referring to buttered toast].

They get all the observations right but the conclusion is always the opposite of what's actually correct. Unbelievable.Oh god, a friend gave me a 'eat for your blood type' book.  Speechless. Recipe or it didn't happen ;-) Woah man, great pics. Your hard work really shows- you look great! You've got this in the bag.Excellent!Congrats!! That is a great accomplishment!I'm originally from France, been in the U.S. about 12 years and I still can't stand the taste of root beer.Congrats!  Fantastic focus!&gt; other high carb diets are not necessarily high GI processed carbs and people can lose and maintain on these diets because they do not cause insulin resistance in the same way as SAD.

Like the Kitavans or Okinawans I'm guessing? A diet based on sweet potatoes and rice rather than on grains?

Interestingly once had the hypothesis that it's a combo of high fat and high carb that is dangerous toward fat gain.

If you are objecting to foods on the basis of being 'processed', which ones are healthy carbs, and which ones aren't?

Is it a problem of sugar, which would include fruit, making starches acceptable? That would be a strange thing for a keto advocate to say.

&gt; When does dieting worsen insulin resistance?

I didn't say dieting, I said diet. As in one's diet worsens insulin resistance, or the pathogenesis of:

I eat x --&gt; x causes me to gain weight --&gt; gaining weight worsens insulin resistance (this is the common model of it)

or

I eat x --&gt; I have a pre-disposed insulin sensitivity --&gt; I gain weight if my food choices overwhelm my insulin sensitivity --&gt; my weight gain worsens the insulin resistance I have

&gt; The insulin resistance on keto is physiologic.

Yes, but we're talking about pathological insulin resistance and how it contributes (or doesn't) to weight gain. Either IR has an effect on gaining weight directly or it doesn't. The idea behind keto is that IR has built up over time, and reducing insulin levels chronically resets IR to a healthy level and reverses the metabolic blockade of fat cells. If patholocigal IR develops as a result of weight gain, then just eating less would be enough to reverse it, and their would be no need or justification for Keto.

&gt; You cannot compare SAD to a diet of high carb vegetables, yes they are the same but metabolically they are different

A high carb vegetable (like a potato) is nothing but starch, fiber, and vitamins/minerals to the metabolism. The velocity at which it is digested is slower than a simple sugar, but the ultimate glycemic effect is the same. I refer both to Holt et al *Insulin Index of Foods* and also to the [glycemic index](http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthy-eating/glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods) where a baked russet potato has an index value of 111 in comparison to glucose of 100.

A lot of 'processed foods' perform much better: Peanut M&amp;Ms at 33, Potato Chips at 51, and Snickers at 51. Likewise, a yam, which is a Kitavan staple, is 54, while Whole Wheat Bread is 71. So in terms of what they actually do metabolically, the processing makes no difference: a Snickers or Peanut M&amp;Ms has less glycemic impact than either whole wheat bread or yams.

 &gt; are you saying a high carb diet inevitably results in fat gain?

No, I'm saying fat gain indicates the worsening of Insulin Resistance (pathological) while on a high carb diet, and that where fat gain doesn't occur on a high carb diet, it is down to individual insulin resilience.

And I do apologise if I misunderstand you and am wasting your time spinning in circles. My sister and I used to joke about the blood type diet, then it became real. Missed that one. Thanks for having a sense of humor.I've found preachy vegans to be the worst. It's a diet, not a damned religion. Live and let live.Belts work wonders and you can always drill new holes.If you go to the gym for heavy lifting and only eat that level of protein you are just wasting your time.  You'd be better off taking a walk around the mall instead....Have an upvote. Me and my wife joke about this all the time but mostly in the vain of alt medicine.

Edit: cus its a joke, I hate when people are too damn serious and PC. TIL I'm a tiger and that's grrrrrrrrreat!I think that's the fruity taste of acetone breath, not the water.Follow the electrolyte guidelines in the FAQ. For now I would not do IF, I would eat when hungry and think about IF later when you're keto-adapted.  Thanks. :)So happy for you!  What awesome work!I got this too.
1 million people will ask you.
1000 will tell you to send them the info.
3 people will read what you have send.
10 will try it.
Maybe one or two will succeed.
So far Im down 100+lbs, my wife is down 20lbs, a friends brother is down 95lbs, and My neighbors and mother-in-law just restarted this jan and are down about 10 each.  Actually not bad now that I think about it.
Okay - you know the issues.  It still comes down to calories in achieving your goal weight, so I'm reminding you as I remind myself.  ;)Ther first 2-3 days can be tough (varies form person to person). Please check out the FAQ for "keto flu".haha. probably totally don't. But I had this same sort of experience where I was tasting sweet where there made no sense to be tasting it. Like touching the top of my tooth or in a swallow of water.

Turns out (this is according to my dentist), tooth decay gives off a very similar sweet flavor when your cavity gets a certain amount deep.  Might want to make a visit to the dentist just in case.

However a lot of people say they go through the same thing in ketosis. So there's that too.
I say bacon and sitting on ass. Technically less of an exaggeration then your lie, lol.

I want to shock people into looking it up. I don't do facebook, but thanks anyway.I started IF yesterday, scale says I'm down .4 pounds - probably water.  You've inspired me to keep going!Steak? Eggs? Pepperoni and salami and cheese. Bell peppers cut up and dunked in guac or hummus?I don't like almond milk on its own, but I drink it as a dessert sometimes with Milk Splash strawberry or orange flavoring. It tastes so rich and is honestly an awesome dessert for like 15 calories a cup.I am new here and trying to ease into it.  Two specialists I see have been pushing Paleo or Keto or some combination of such on me for about three years now and when I did "atkins" in the past it worked well for me. I just have no self control to stick with it.

I did a Paleo/Ketoish thing for several months last year and a car accident derailed me due to some meds I needed to take and they required carbs to keep me from getting sick taking them (I tested that theory, they were not kidding!).  From then the wheels fell right off the truck! Sugar and junk are my kryptonite. And I am my own worst enemy.

I am trying to get back on the tracks, and I've learned from past experience that I can't just jump full bore into anything, I have to ease in. So far I am getting there slowly.  I love the recipes and snack ideas I am getting from this group and the paleo group on here, and I am hoping I can ease my husband, who is diabetic, into this life as well.

*waves*Depends on what sort of bread, definitely agree if you're talking about that horrible processed white breadNo idea but in general most who are fasting try not to push the limits so not sure anyone has really looked into it in more depth but I think yes it varies with BMR.  As I mentioned above, IF is about making eating at a deficit feel easier and convenience so if you need your morning coffee with cream go for it, I don't think it will be an issue.  And, like I also said above try not to overthink IF, make it work for you. If you prefer to have 75 calories cream in the morning with coffee, go for it :)

From Berkhan:

Splash of milk/cream for your coffee will have such a minimal impact on insulin that it's no use making a big fuss out of it. I said 50 calories max to safeguard against people using boatloads of the stuff which is obviously not ok.I like to grab a box of sugar free jello pudding and sub heavy cream instead of milk. I then use the whisk beater on my hand mixer to whip it into a kind of mousse. pop it in to the fridge for 10 minutes and it's good to go. still some net carbs but it's dense and I can usually eat a tablespoon or two full and shake my sweet tooth. better than having a sugary freak out and eating a package of oreos!I like nuun tablets... they dissolve in your water like seltzer and make it lightly flavored and a bit fizzy, but they have electrolytes instead of just flavor and fizz. One a day and my legs haven't cramped in months.Don't forget the broth. You might do fine without it but it really helps if you need it.  I suggest just working a cup in daily to avoid any issues.  I use chicken bullion with fresh pepper and a little butter. 1 - Use MFP to track everything (combined with a vivosmart its even better)

2 - Don't cheat with carb foods - the idea is to make the lifestyle work for you so you can be on it for life, that way you will never feel as if you are waiting for it to finish so you can indulge in XYZ

3 - Ignore premade atkins bars or low carb bread etc but experiment with some high calorie keto foods so you can still use them as treats - don't have them every day ie Keto pizza night is every other Friday, - that way you'll look forward to it and don't miss the carb version.

4 - Using 1 above plan out your meals for at least the next 7 days - it makes it far easier to shop and that way you can pepper in your indulgence foods so you regularly feel as if you are being treated instead of living on the same meal day in day out. (If you batch cook then batch and freeze for several weeks so you still get the variety each day).

5 - Enjoy the benefits, and remind yourself of them regularly - eating this way should not be an exercise in self denial but rather a voyage of discovery for all the great tasting new things you can replace the craving causing carbs with.lol based on a lot of these comments we need to xpost this to /r/ketocirclejerk  ;)I heard the root beer thing is because (in Germany was where I was told) their "default" "cough syrup" flavor is similar to root beer ...
whereas in America our default cough syrup flavor is that kinda fruity/cherry/jolly rancher-type flavor.

So it's not that root beer tastes like medicine to them, it's that their medicine tastes like root beer.Duration of ketosis makes a big difference. The duration is the most important thing.

It can take up to 4 weeks for the brain to begin fully utilizing the ketones. This is how long it takes for the body to adjust to a fat-burning metabolism from a carb-burning metabolism.

It can take up to 12 weeks for individual muscle cells to complete the transformation in very many intricate ways (mitochondrial biogenesis, epigenetic changes and changed gene expression).

Keto-adaptation is one of the most important things about a ketogenic diet. No other diet forces your body to change so much. It is the keto-adaptation which gives the long lasting health benefits (better insulin response, lower blood sugars, less muscle and cell glycolation, reduced brain plaque, improved blood panels, improved liver capability through remission of fatty liver).

Weight loss is incidental to these whole-body improvement processes and is closely correlated to calorie reduction.Actually she was.

And never actually said, "Let them eat cake."

Qu'ils mangent de la brioche.

Let them eat "brioche". --- egg bread. -- also, totally still not Marie Antionette.I definitely understand that feeling. Often when I go off plan, all I think about is food and I will literally just keep eating no matter how full I am. I've just accepted that my self control is something I really need to work on. I also try to remind myself that most people don't have enough discipline or motivation to try to get healthier, so I have something to be proud of even if it takes keto to do it.Shredded? No, you have to get to like 5% body fat for that. In three weeks that's not gonna happen. Put on some lean mass, that will help more. Go to /r/ketogainsMany people overdo BPC at first before their system is adapted to the higher fat diet, and especially MCT/coconut oil in BPC, and stories of gastric distress here are common.  In addition, at the beginning of the diet, your appetite normally goes down quite a bit, and people report struggling with eating enough protein, and especially report not eating enough protein because they are overloading on fat.Sounds like they need to shut up and eat something.so you eat that chocolate made for cooking cakes? which is 100%? are you serious? I dont eat too much sugar neither Ionly eat 75% dark chocolate but wow I tried tasting that one and it was unbearably sour!Did you dip them in anything?I had a sip of milk last month and it tasted like pure sugar.Check out r/fastingHarder cheese = aged longer = less lactoseJust because peanut butter is keto friendly, doesn't mean you should eat all the peanut butter, all the time.Happy you found it!! That would be scary. Yeah... I would say on a good night I am up about 5 or 6 times to pee. On a side note, also TMI, as a dude on keto, for whatever reason, every time I wake up I got some serious drill sergeant standing at attention so pissing takes forever.  Good answer, haha. *Again,* not trolling or kidding of being stupid. Just new to keto. Love it!Maybe get a cheap substitute for the time being? =)What a great motivator. That's super sweet! =)That's a great idea!!Sorry to hear =(It'll happen!This.No more weight to lose, limbs start falling off! HahaDidn't used to be able to drink diet soda because it tastes gross and not at all sweet. Now they all taste super sweet and are actually enjoyable!If it makes you feel better, once in college I accidentally tucked the bottom of my skirt into my underwear after going to the bathroom and walked around with my ass hanging out for like five minutes. Also, yay physics!In Denmark we eat [Rugbrd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugbr%C3%B8d), I don't if it will fit into a Keto diet, but it's a nice alternative to white bread. Research has show that it lowers the risk of testicle cancer.I ate a peanut m&amp;m yesterday and it blew my mindif you're really interested in zerocarb, there is a facebook group that eats ZC that is failry active.

https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/105005229541718/Over what window would you say (best guess) that 50 kcal applies?  Surely not for the entire fast?  If I had coffee at 8am w/40cal worth of cream, then again at say 10:30am, all should be fine, right?

If I had to guess, it would be tied to your personal BMR?  Where did that value of 50 come from?  It looks to be, roughly speaking, the hourly BMR of a "low end of normal" person.  I wonder if that value was created to cover all bases.  So, could someone have 50 calories per hour?  My hourly BMR is closer to 100, could I get away with a little more cream in my coffee?

I don't expect you to be able to answer all of this.  I just got really curious about the formulation of this number.  I'm not looking to take in 100 cal/hour and still call it a fast.  But I wouldn't mind putting more like 75 calories in my morning coffee.  :)

My question about two coffees in the morning is actually moot, because I've always been very sensitive to caffeine.  If I have any past noon, then I have trouble sleeping.Fruit will blow your mind.Lucky youIt's only the first day... And I hope you're tracking your protein intake.Haven't had slimy experience w x.gum, just need to pay attention to a little bit goes a loooong way to thicken .
It's used in Starbucks frap.drinks AFAIK.Apples to oranges. Aaah, let her. My work speaks for itself. I just got a job offer elsewhere and I start next week so she can talk bad all she likes, I'll be gone soon. :)There was an article on this recently I read... http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/selling-the-fantasy-of-high-protein-everything/385318/Why does eating rice make your mother in law such an ignorant bitch?Yes omg yes. Not all high carb diets are SAD that's the fundamental issue-SAD is high carb rapidly processed crap and high fat, other high carb diets are not necessarily high GI processed carbs and people can lose and maintain on these diets because they do not cause insulin resistance in the same way as SAD.

When does dieting worsen insulin resistance? The insulin resistance on keto is physiologic.

You cannot compare SAD to a diet of high carb vegetables, yes they are the same but metabolically they are different

Again I think we are talking in circles not even sure the point you're trying to make-are you saying a high carb diet inevitably results in fat gain?You're welcome to some if you're in NYC!If you fill it halfway with oil, it should work. Try adding the coating and then storing the batch in a ziploc bag in the fridge overnight. The coating stuck more IIRC. I don't mean to talk in circles with you, or to put words in your mouth. I'm trying to clarify a point and to correct what I believe is inaccuracy.

First, one can't have it both ways. Either:

* Insulin resistance is independent of weight gain, and thus down to each individual pre-disposition, where diet choices don't impact insulin resistance and weight gain is only down to calories

or

* Insulin resistance and weight gain are related (where the latter would be dependent upon the former) and the non-low-carb diet would first corrupt insulin sensitivity and weight gain would result as a by-product of a calorie composition that violates it

&gt; Many gain on high carb diets everyday, the fittest people around with no insulin resistance.

If this were true it would be directly attributable to the individual resiliency. It could also be expressed as a simple equation:

    Insulin Resistance = Natural Insulin Sensitivity - Activity Mitigating Impact (ie fitness training) + Diet Choice Impact

Some activities improve insulin sensitivity and also help reduce insulin resistance where it is found.

If your version is right (insulin resistance is independent and individually attributable) then managing the diet means managing one's carb tolerance and eating under maintenance to lose weight.

It's also notable that insulin resistance can worsen with diet, which seems to conflict with the idea of its independence from weight gain--how can weight gain via excessive caloric intake cause pathological insulin resistance develop or worsen when the two are not related at all?

&gt; Not all carbs are the same, not all weight gain on a high carb diet is the same.

Yes they are. The only difference between a sugar and a starch is the velocity at which they are digested. A potato is just as glycemic as table sugar, thought it has more fibre and vitamin content. And weight gain is weight gain--it's either fat, or it's lean body mass. It has only those two components for everyone, although both can be part of the same change in weight.

&gt; where the distinction between those that gain unhealthy weight vs those that can gain healthy weight or maintain on high carb diets come in

Do you mean gain lean body mass or gain fat?

SAD is nothing more than high carb, high fat, low protein. Other configurations are certainly apparent, but the gain of fat is no different across people when it happens and is equally unhealthy. Other configs may support a gain of lbm over fat, but if a person is gaining fat, it's all the same in that regard.If its black it has like 5 calories a cup, so I'm sure that if perfectly OK.about a yearOk! Never had hazelnut meal before. Post the results!The little 100 calorie packs of almonds are a good way to not go overboard on almonds, when you need a salty snack!No mincing or pre cookingThose look great! I'll have to try ground chicken next time!Never. I typically don't need to pee very often either. I always was like this, sometimes it's pretty useful.
But I never drank 6-10 liters. When I have 5 liters (and it's not an everyday thing for me), I need to pee a bit more often but never at night. Even if I drink a whole liter before going to bed, I don't wake up.
I noticed drinking frequently but little at a time works nicely, I don't need to pee too frequently (if I must, I do it in every 8-9 hours only - of course, I don't drink a big amount in this cases. I never tried it out while on keto). A lot of water at once is way different and if it's tea or beer, it's even worse.

So I wouldn't stop at 6pm (I would feel terrible in the whole evening) just drinking a mouthful water sometimes. Except if I'm too thirsty...There was an article a few months back about things Americans eat that Europeans just can't understand, one of the biggest was "Wonder Bread" type white bread.

All of the people talked to described it as cake. "It's so sweet!"

Of course, that's at least partly because of the amount of High Fructose Corn Syrup that's in it in order to keep it "fresh."

Interesting side note, Europeans didn't understand how we can drink Root Beer, which they all claimed tastes like medicine. God, I love a good root beer.Whisk the egg wIth HWC and try and get most of the egg off before adding coatingI notice I eat WAY less on keto than off. My average day is about 900 calories. But I'm also a slow eater. My husband is a fast eater, he's done with a plate by the time I've eaten a quarter of mine. Perhaps you are also a fast eater and don't get the "I'm full" signal until it's too late?Once, pretty consistently at 1am

Make sure you're getting enough sodium as well It's a laxative, a very fast-working one. Like Epsom salts. As long as its not a couple hundred calorie coffee (BPC)Make sure you adjust your weight loss expectations appropriately.Low carb beer is fine as long as you limit yourself. Ill drink 3 mich. ultras and 3 rum/diets or gin/seltzer.  about 10 carbs total if you round up. keeping an eye on electrolytes is key. I constantly have to adjust my pants to keep them from falling down and my favorite Shorts now just slide off my legs. It's a great feeling but also becomes a hassle sometimes Haha. &gt; Did you bathe the chicken in its own children first?

FTFYCanned fish with decent ranch sauce is my goto snack. Just make sure the ranch is low carb, I get Newman's Own which is 1g of carbs per serving, and it works well as a fat booster for most meals.To be fair, bread by itself is really sweet even if you're not on keto.Miller64 is very bad, yes.Really consider a deef fryer. I picked mine up 3 years ago and between buffalo wings, avocado frys, and naked fried chicken I get a lot of use out of it. Lately Ive been deep frying pork chops and hamburgers too.  They are a tad messy and take bit more skill to clean than to cook with but overall Im really happy with it. I know that brie is keto friendly, I've got a triple cream brie in the fridge with negligible carbsYes. You become fully keto adapted after 5 weeks - 4 months and can vary from person to person from what I understand. This is what I'm afraid of.How long have you been on keto? My first three weeks I drank like a camel and peed like once an hour. Now though I drink about 4-5 liters a day and usually don't wake up during the night to pee. It usually levels out after your body adjusts. Not soft, but pre-grated cheeses contain starch to avoid it sticking together.I know! Not in Boston here, but I'm in a snowy upstate NY region, and my first thought was "Where the heck does the OP live that it is now shorts weather?!"

To OP, good work with the keto. Now go clothes shopping! ;-)Well you can get 100 ml of cow's milk for a taste if you want everyday. Full cream milk has like 5 g carbs in 100 ml. Once you add it into your carb allowance.Absolutely ... progress is being made two steps forward, one step back. Ratios don't really matter. What's your calorie target and your protein/carbs/fat intake?those almond flour nuggets come out AMAZING.  super juicy and tender thanks to all the oils in the nuts.

i just bought some hazelnut meal and can't wait to try it.  the flavor is surprisingly mild so i think it'll be a good vehicle for spices.No! If anything, I feel stronger. Ask just about anyone if they could give up bread/rice/pasta and they practically faint at the idea. Add in the idea of sugar and/or fruit being off limits and they say "I could NEVER do that" (almost exactly) every single time. I feel strong because I've been able to give up foods that previously were an addiction to me.I actually feel more masculine eating this way than when I ate the dainty grain filled crap I ate before.  Kit Kat bars and bread aren't manly in my opinion.You can PM me. I'm nearing the end of my journey, with only 20 pounds left, so I'm full of motivation and drive! I'm also always down to help people who need it. I used to be ~100 pounds heavier, I get it. Cream cheese is a little carby compared to cheddar or parmesan.Yep, I had it resized, and I am picking it up in a few hours.i occasionally find myself frustrated that i am SO sensitive to carbs that i've had to adopt this way of eating, and that occurred as a direct result of the OMG FAT IS BAD that we've had shoved down our throats the last forty years.

but the benefits outweigh the inconvenience.

you are not weak, and your mother-in-law is, to be honest, kind of a bitch for saying that.  wow.this is a fantastic answer.I know Keto is so much easier when you have people to ask for help. If you ever have ANY question, don't hesitate to PM me.Is beer bad though? Miller64 has only 64 calories and 2.4 carbs per can. I won't give up wearing my wedding ring and don't want to get it resized until I'm happy with my weight. Instead, I buy an inexpensive ring in the right size and wear it in front of my wedding ring. Keeps it safely on my finger. I'm down three ring sizes now and it's still working.I found that water started tasting sweet!Their buffalo is supposedly low carb. Check their website. I just make my own. Anything below 75% store-bought tastes of sugar coupled with that burning in the back of your throat right? I make my own coconut oil based chocolate...;) -huggles- :DVitamin D - I was told by mine that a huge percentage of Americans are deficient.oh my gosh thanks to your flair I finally know what KCKO means...haha  (I'm a newb)I'm good then... Thanks for the infoI eat 100% cacoa bakers chocolate. If I have some regular chocolate it is almost unpalatable.I'm not sure this is true for everyone, especially women. I was going to say that. Bread is a must less dessert like affair outside of the states.I think you know you have to cut out the carby foods, even in tiny portions. It will be worth it, because after a week or two you won't be having the ravenous cravings for them anymore.

You also might want to cut out the lite and diet foods (diet tea, lite sour cream) and go for water and full fats. The diet foods are typically carb heavier, and less calories. It's the carbs you need to watch. I went to a fancy engagement party once, staying overnight in a hotel. When it came to get dressed in my suit, I found that (a) my trousers were falling off me and (b) my belt notches didn't go that small.

We were running late. I tried to cut a new notch in the belt in the taxi on the way over. I failed. Once there I had to blag a safety pin from the staff to keep the trousers up, and checked my belt into the cloakroom!Melted cheddar in a bowl of sugarI really like boxes of frozen burgers (just take a quick peak at the label to make sure there arent hidden carbs).  Fry/grill the burger up and then I put it over some lettuce with some kind of cheese on top.

I also like scrambled eggs with spinach, just sautee the spinach and pour the eggs in and scramble.

Then you can always go with the standard piece of meat over a salad.Apparently 8-12 inches of snow is now called a "snow shower."
Because, I mean, when you already have a full bathtub, what's another turn of the faucet?&gt; it's not possible to gain weight from eating  non-low-carb calories (ie SAD) without first developing a degree of insulin resistance as result of the dietary macro composition. The weight gain is indicative of an increase in insulin resistance.

This is not true. Many gain on high carb diets everyday, the fittest people around with no insulin resistance. Not all carbs are the same, not all weight gain on a high carb diet is the same. SAD is not the only high carb diet.

I never said it was simply CICO so don't put words in my mouths. I think we are on the same page here but talking circles. However if you're implying insulin resistance is inherent to individuals, I disagree. For some yea, for most, no, that's a function of SAD and not all high carb diets are SAD which is where the distinction between those that gain unhealthy weight vs those that can gain healthy weight or maintain on high carb diets come inBased on the info you gave us. I think that although you had good intentions, you may consider to work on you're social skills.

When you connected the word "stricter" with "keto" and combined it into a comparison with Paleo, you automatically put yourself into a RETHORICALLY superior position. It doesn't mean anything if you actually mean that or not. Forcing people into a comparison, where they feel they have to defend their choices = emotional hostility. It doesn't matter who is "right".

You also said "I'm really not familiar with Paleo, but I know people coming off of the ketogenic diet often go to Paleo as it's a little less strict." Which is a) a statement that shows you don't know what you have an opinion about. b) You accept thirdparty statements as a universal "truth".

If you wanted a heated discussion all this is fine. If you genuinely are curious to hear about other people's experience, open questions are usually more productive, like "why do you do Paleo and what are the pro-cons of following such a diet ?"

I'm sorry for being blunt. You may hate me. That's ok.Why do people always say hard cheeses?  What soft cheeses aren't keto compatible?Mine is currently set at 80-15-5.. Is that okay?That makes sense. I'll start increasing sodium towards the end of the day in that case. Thanks.Did you find it??Insulin resistance isn't independent from weight gain.

It's possible to gain weight by eating excessive low-carb calories, but it's not possible to gain weight from eating  non-low-carb calories (ie SAD) without first developing a degree of insulin resistance as result of the dietary macro composition. The weight gain is indicative of an increase in insulin resistance.

They key variable between them is the inherent insulin resiliency of the individual, which is first strained and then broken.

There are seriously people eating 5k calories of low-carb foods without gaining weight (as their BMR compensates) and people eating loads of calories of non-low carb food (in fact high sugar) who also don't gain weight because they are resilient to corruption of their insulin sensitivity.

It is not simply reductive to a calorie number without considering the individual variability and how that impacts their body's behaviour.This is a really good idea! Especially because I'm not such a fan of the whole pork rind breading thing - or I didn't get much success last time I tried at least!

Thanks :DWhen I was huge on keto I might have a single can of soda a week, and it was always as a dessert after a meal. And I rarely finished the whole thing in one go. Just sip it like a dessert wine.

Keto's cool like that.I haven't noticed a tolerance shift (2.5 wks in) but I have noticed that I'm not drinking as much so maybe that's what it is?

Electrolyte issues can manifest in many ways, typically headaches but also night sweats. It might be that you're getting most of your sodium earlier in the day and less at night before bed.Yes it's only been an issue since I started keto. My meal times are pretty much breakfast, lunch and dinner. I try to keep from eating anything past 9pm though, and snack on salted nuts as and when I feel like it during the day.

I will admit I haven't been tracking electrolytes, but isn't a deficiency supposed to make you feel dizzy/ light-headed? I remember feeling slightly dizzy the first couple of days in, but I upped my salt and water intake and the feeling went away. I've had a few nights off and on where I woke up feeling super sweaty.

my solution was to start wearing less to bed.  I think, for me, my  metabolism is cranked higher than before and at night I'm "running hotter" than I'm used to.

Also might try experimenting with the time of your last food of the day.I'm right on board with you there. I'm really starting to hate snow. I wish it would warm up here instead of the impending snow storms  Did you put  the chicken in an egg wash first? Electrolytes do need to be supplemented on keto but it's not really a lack in the diet.  It's simply that the glycogen that could more efficiently retain most of those electrolytes is lost.  That is why we need to add more.I cut mine in half, scrape out the seeds, coat them with olive oil and some sea salt. Let them sit for a few minutes to absorb some of the oil, then turn them over and bake until they feel soft when you press on the skin.  Makes all the difference in the world, in my opinion.  Softer and more pasta like. I also love how you can re-heat these "noodles" and they still taste good, sometimes even better than the first time around.hell this food plan / diet makes me feel stronger.
in my mind I know the work that I've had to do to be successful at this so far (it's not an easy way to go about eating sometimes).
While it's a bit different than your situation (choosing vs. needing) the ability to show myself that I have control is empowering.

Also what's not strong about a diet consisting mainly of dead animals and fat?Electrolytes electrolytes electrolytes Resistance as in what?Could you point me out where did you read this?nice, and lucky you being in a warm territory.Is this only an issue on keto? When do you eat your meals?

Are you actually tracking electrolytes?This was an interesting back and forth, thanks!If you don't have insulin resistance, eat more than you need carbs or not and you'll gain weight. You can gain weight without pathologic insulin resistancePlants crave it. Why not?That's fine

Nope never tried itAccording to LG  50 calories or less is recommended So the only way you can gain weight without an proportionate insulin resistance is by gaining it by eating an excess of low-carb calories? hah! you know the same thing happened to me, actually I only ate about 1/4 (I think the flour really expanded on my gut and there were more carbs than I realized?) but wife took down her entire half.  that pizza is awesome, but for those not on keto it's a bit weird to realize it's basically eating a huge chunk of cheese :)And that's what I said...assuming no insulin resistance keto offers no metabolic weight loss advantage (read: if you have insulin resistance, it offers an advantage)I boil a bunch of eggs at once and keep them in the fridge for a snack or for salads. Helps save time. Sausages are a quick grab and go as well as salami and pepperoni. Olives are a good snack. Stream bagged frozen veg. "The weather is warming up" ha, ha

*cries as Boston gets two more feet of snow this weekend*For me its a different kind of fullness. I just stop being able to eat any more. You get full so quickly it doesn't feel the same.good to know, I've certainly had some days where I'm just not as hungry.

I've always found almond flour and Parmesan cheese a good mix for any fried meat. It's amazing how sweet things, that were once bland, taste after a few weeks without sugar. It makes no sense that carbs would trigger an immediate gall bladder attack. But what would I know. I no longer have my gall bladder. :-)

Keto has been fine without it.

I wonder if there is such a thing as a pancreas attack? That's what should be squeezing out juice after a carb overload. To be fair, bread in the US is effectively cake.  (Note I'm talking about store-bought white, there's obviously lots of other types that are more "classic" non-sugary messes)Perhaps this is what Marie Antoinette was referring to. I have a friend that had his gallbladder removed and has been able to eat like normal.  Other than he lays off the energy drinks more than he used to.Yea I just keep away from beer.  Dry red wines and straight liquor is the way to go.  Just remember your tolerance is lower.This was an excellent summary of the current advice provided by "nutritional authorities". It didn't quote any recent research. It simply kept repeating what various "experts", government agencies, and official reports recommend.

How sad. &gt; Are you saying you can't gain weight without pathologic insulin resistance?

No. Hypothetically one could eat a low carb diet with an excessive calorie count and gain weight--although I think it would have to be beyond the threshold of the body's ability to compensate via certain tolerances to raise and lower the BMR.

&gt; Most insulin resistance is driven the macros of a SAD and too many calories. So yea weight gain is a function or insulin resistance but weight gain also increases insulin resistance, it's not either or.

I agree. It's a self-reinforcing cycle in that regard.

&gt; Most insulin resistance is driven the macros of a SAD and too many calories. So yea weight gain is a function or insulin resistance but weight gain also increases insulin resistance, it's not either or.

Removing the carbs removes the impediment to weightloss which can exist even at a calorie deficit. While one needs a calorie deficit to lose weight, one also needs an agreeable insulin sensitivity via hormonal balance achieved by reduced insulin presence. People for whom insulin resistance is no problem lose weight by merely eating less, but people for whom insulin resistance is also a problem need to also manage their glycemic response, and the best solution in that regard I would argue is Keto.I tried coating with pork rinds a few days ago, it was not successful. It may be because of the type of pork rinds available here, after crushing they were very greasy and did not adhere well.

I've used egg and almond flour (w/seasoning) before and it was a success. Coconut flour was also a success apart from the fact I hate the taste! Going to take your advice and try adding some parmesan to the almond flour too :) thanks!Black, espresso strong and without sugar.
Tried portuguese coffee?What is the calorie limit that would "break" a fast?  I can't stand black coffee.. I'm not going to lose sleep if I have been doing it wrong, just curious.Coffee is fine. Don't overthink IF, the biggest benefit of IF is that makes eating at a deficit feel easier and is convenient, do what's sustainable for you and I imagine coffee is a big part of your morning routine :) if you're drinking it black it doesn't break a fastI have been a hibachi chef for the last 6 years and I can tell you the only thing that uses corn starch is the teriyaki sauce.
no corn starch is used for your food cooked on the grill unless it is a meat that uses teriyaki sauce.
Chicken is generaLly the main meat that uses this sauce though some places may put it on seafood as well.
You can always ask them to just use soy sauce onlyIf you fed a tiger a diet of mainly corn, I'm sure that tiger would have some serious issues. You wouldn't ask why the tiger is so weak. You would ask, "why the hell have you fed it corn? That's not what it's supposed to eat." Likewise, there are some of us who eat Keto who don't have any other choice. It's not that we're weak, it's just this is what we're supposed to eat. Eating carbs makes us sick just like a tiger eating corn. No shame in eating how you are supposed to.[r/Keto-er that combined Paleo and Keto](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/w2kuu/365_days_85_pounds_2ish_pieces_of_advice_f54/c59o7f4)Well, they did say you need balance of everything, and that restricting food groups leads to losing weight unhealthily.Agreed - good quality bone broth is such an amazing source of nourishment to support ketoing!I went through a very stressful time where I was unable to focus on myself any more and a lot of control was taken from me. However I am nearly out of the woods so I have been able to get back to what matters in life, and the biggest thing for me is being healthy again :) As for what I would do differently, I'm not sure, perhaps be strong enough to keep control? In hindsight I maybe could have, but at the time it wasn't an option I felt I could have.Yeah, that's great, thanks for sharing! I'd place myself in the middle to the bottom.Thank you! :DHaha thanks! You too! :DYup, with time taste buds and brain chemistry can change Set it to Sedentary with a 20% deficit. Set protein to 0.8g/lb lbm (middle of the suggested range).Set to sedentary, set protein to 85 gLol I agree! I'm both paleo/primal and keto (but can tolerate dairy, thank goodness), and work in a paleo cafe. All day long I hear my coworkers assure customers that everything is sugar free, but when I talk to people about our food (which is pretty freaking awesome) I always make sure to point out that it's only free of REFINED sugars, and that we use NATURAL sweeteners like honey/dates/fruit/maple syrup. To me, sugar=sugar=sugar haha.I agree!!! This is not complicated but people really overcomplicate it. Eat real food and get some salt.  I get it's a learning curve but it's not as steep as many make it. Not everything needs a label or a formula. No one needs to stress if they are doing IF "right." If you want to drink BPC in the morning then do it. It breaks the fast but so what, do what works for you. Exactly!! Keto poses no issues to anyone else around me, I eat what I eat and leave the rest, no explanations, no discussions. In fact I didn't realize keto was so complicated and there was so much criticism until I discovered reddit. My keto bubble has been burst :) But, this! This is all simple, as mom says K.I.S.S. A mayonegg! In the first weeks, his cholesterol values will actually be higher than they were before starting keto. It will take 1-2 months to see a real drop.
Sugar is a problem, when trying to do both. In my interpretation, paleo is very much against artificial sweeteners (with occasional exceptions), so most of the keto treats sweetened with stevia or diet products aren't really something I want to depend on. I occasionally indulge though - it's a compromise thing. It doesn't help (or does help?) that my stomach doesn't like fake sugars either. Damned IBS.Post a recipe, that looks amazing! " ... yes it's a fad but people including me have been doing IF for years, it just didn't have a name it was called "skipping breakfast."

If you think about it, this concept applies to a lot of stuff. Folks attribute all sorts of "sciency," "am I doing this right?" stuff to BPC too, when it's really just drinking your breakfast. Even keto itself is just the idea of having a steak, veggies and a baked potato for dinner, but skipping the potato.

It's kinda like depressed folks, prior to meds, were called melancholy and people suffering with anxiety were high-strung. Sure, as we learn what drives these conditions, we understand that there certainly is science involved in IFing and BPC and depression &amp; anxiety, and keto in general. But I think if folks tried to simplify keto for themselves, especially early on, it would make a potentially complicated subject---and a lifestyle that can be challenging to follow---a heck of a lot easier.

Yes, I'm oversimplifying, but I'm talking about the gist here. Think: Just not eating your hash browns and toast as opposed to explaining to the waitress why you want her to hold them.

K, will shut up now. BPC is kicking in. Time to raise a barn or something.  This started for me last summer. I just had it resized this week for valentine's day. I went from an 11.5 to a 9. I actually thought I lost it on a plane last fall. I was sitting in my seat, and my precious slipped off and rolled under the seats forward like 10 rows. I ran up to try to find it on my hands and knees, but couldn't. I waited after everyone deplaned to crawl and find it.I haven't been able to really wear my wedding band either for the past month or two. I've got some friends that are sensitive about those kinds of things, so I've been asked on a few occasions whether or not things are OK at the old casa.I don't think in regards to feeders that "to each their own" is an appropriate opinion. It's textbook abuse. Protein is a little low, fat is a bit high.Been there.  Didn't notice until I was off the bus and halfway to work. Upvote for the feels-Well done! As an emotional eater I can fully empathise. I could easily go through boxes of sugary Honey Crunchy Nut cereal, or loaves of toast slathered in butter. I've found casual-IF has helped me with the emotional aspect. I don't really have a set pattern and I'm not strict with it, but in general I usually only allow myself a 2-6 hour eating window each day. I'm not going to beat myself up if I quit IF for a day or two, but I've found that it helps with the emotional side of things. Instead of thinking "god I want &lt;bad food&gt;" I'll think "Oh well I can't have anything because it isn't time to eat yet, so I'll just go distract myself with something else!".

The little victories add up to one big one :) KCKO!But make sure to always check labels when you are looking at a new product. Carbs are often put in the strangest places. This is my 2nd time through Keto.  It is sort of a modified intermittent fasting where I eat breakfast &amp; dinner and just drink coffee (with some mct oil) throughout the day.You might try 2 meals instead of 1Are you saying you can't gain weight without pathologic insulin resistance? That's where you lost me, because people with no metabolic derangements can gain weight. Most insulin resistance is driven the macros of a SAD and too many calories. So yea weight gain is a function or insulin resistance but weight gain also increases insulin resistance, it's not either or. But once you get there, remove the issue (carbs) and weight loss is more efficient I still haven't picked out an engagement ring (engaged for one year, he proposed with diamond studs because he knew I'd want to pick the ring, d'aww!), specifically because I don't want to have to get it resized after weight loss! So getting a nice shiny at the end of my keto journey is just a bonus ;)I recall a section of The Primal Blueprint mentioning keto briefly. (Obviously Primal isn't Paleo, but it's similar enough). I find it a bit strange that they had such a negative reaction when the diets are actually quite similar, paleo is low carb in general, especially compared to the SAD.

I think the biggest differences are that Keto is more restrictive regarding carbs, Paleo is more restrictive regarding food "purity".

When I did Primal a few years ago (no calorie-counting, no macros, lost a little under 50lbs, kept it off too), I remember one of the things I found stressful was getting too caught up in finding the "purest" food - raw organic milk, grass fed meat, organic vegetables, raw organic nuts, zero additives, etc. It made finding simple snack foods quite difficult because pretty much everything had to come from a whole food before being cooked into something else. I ended up feeling tired, overwhelmed and too restricted. I don't doubt that Paleo/Primal is one of the healthiest lifestyles around, but I feel that (for me) it is more important to get the weight off sticking to something I feel comfortable with and fits into my current lifestyle and around my current medical and psychological issues. Then once the weight is lost I can re-evaluate where I stand, at which point I will likely do maintenance by going Primal.

Now that I'm doing keto I still try to maintain certain Primal/Paleo principles, I still buy grass-fed and organic meat, pastured eggs, organic berries; I still make bone broth from organic/pastured/grass-fed animals. But I'm not as hung up on "purity" as I once was, which makes it less stressful. I don't care if my Blue Diamond almonds use rapeseed oil rather than a healthier oil with better omega 3:6 ratios. I don't care if there are some E-number preservatives in some of the deli meat I eat occasionally. I don't mind eating non-organic cheese. I allow myself sweeteners (Natvia/Truvia, Erythritol w/Stevia).

But overall I think the two are similar and very compatible.Canned fish. I'm currently eating canned herring in a mayo based sauce with only 1% net carbs.

Maybe something similar is avaiable where you live.How long have you been in ketosis? You might be experiencing keto flu! IF is a natural thing for many on keto, of course it doesn't work for all, no one ever said it does. Moreover yes it's a fad but people including me have been doing IF for years, it just didn't have a name it was called "skipping breakfast." I think you're over exaggerating the IF talk around here and undervaluing the reason that it's popular is that keto offers reduced satiety and prolonged hunger which make IF seamless for many. If it doesn't work for you, don't do it. Not sure why the rant about it. There are dozens of things people suggest here that don't work for me, I just don't do them. I do agree that people suggest IF for stalls but it's not magic, the reason it works for stalls is it helps with eating at a deficit and by eating more consistently at a deficit people lose weight more efficiently. It's not magic.Wonderful to read this. You must feel GREAT!

Welcome and good luckThis exactly. Everyone tried telling me it was okay to cheat. I told them I knew myself and knew that if I cheated I would cheat again. I wanted a month before I even considered cheating.

I have cheated since starting, but it's been easy enough to get back on the wagon. I don't think that would have been the case however if I hadn't fully committed at the beginning. There shouldn't be this 'us-versus-them' competition between dieting groups. Tribalism in health of all things? We should be joining together against *the world* because the same energy that people use to argue about whether or not they should eat apples could be used to inform the general populace about how their sugar-addicted/processed foods diet is killing them.

Some chap got downvoted to -30 elsewhere on reddit for saying that sugar was just as dangerous as caffeine and nicotene. Shit like that infuriates me a thousand times more than some paleo guy who thinks I'm dumb for not eating carrots.Yep I've taken the same stance as you with the quality of my foods. The difference in macro for keto is less carbs to get into nutritional ketosis. Stepehn Phinny spoke to the author of the paleo diet and ask why so high on the carbs and he said to him it's to fuel the brain. But so much new info is comming out keto and paleo is converging.
Here the link time coded to the part where he speaks about the difference between a well fourmulated ketogenic diet and paleo diet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkQYZ6FbsmI#t=915Do you mince the breast? Pre-cook it then coat and fry it?So discouraging. There are so many statements that can single-handedly be taken down by mainstream research. I don't have time. Whatever. KCKO.when I started, my meals were like....

Breakfast,
Bacon and Eggs

Snacks
String Cheese

Lunch
Atkins shake

Supper
A burger with no bun.


For like a week. Sometimes I'd make chicken. Then I started looking up and making recipes but I still eat a lot of this stuffFAQUse ground chicken. The breading sinks in and sticks a lot better. Also try baking it with oil drizzled on top. A lot easier and you still get a decent crunch. He/she said that unless a person has insulin resistance, keto offers no metabolic advantage other than increased adherence. My point was to inquire how it's possible to gain weight without gaining a proportionate degree of insulin resistance.

I think from your perspective it comes down to whether insulin resistance is a function of weight gain, or whether weight gain is a function of insulin resistance. For my part I argue the latter; that the processes which end in weight gain start with a sort of metabolic 'corruption' which happens as a result of how the body reacts to dietary macros. For some people the idea is that the continued insulinogenic stress their diet choices puts on their body creates a progressive insulin hypersecretion in tandem with a poor insulin clearance. This begins in the liver and then spreads peripherally--a phenomena called 'hepatic overload'. As it worsens, so does insulin resistance.

The continued need for more secretion of and chronic presence of insulin in the bloodstream has negative implications for white adipose tissue (WAT)--in that it downregulates the expression of Hormone Sensitive Lypase inside WAT, which reduces the body's capacity to breakdown stored triglycerides back into non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and push them *out* of the cell for use as fuel. So the end product of weight gain is caused by the prevention of stored fat from exiting fat cells, and this in itself causes a build up of NEFA in the bloodstream (dyslipidemia) commonly known as high cholesterol, or high HDL/LDL.

A healthy individual with correctly functioning adipose/endocrine tissue is suppose to be able to keep an equilibrium between NEFA flowing in and out of the cell, alongside all the carbohydrates eaten being used for fuel and not arising either in frequency or overall amount as to depress the function of adipose tissue. What I have noticed and what I think is interesting is the individual variance in 'resilience' to carb metabolic 'corruption', or how people are affected differently by a similar carb load.

/u/anbeav is well respected here, and I was hoping for a comment on how weight gain/weight loss are not related to the underlying metabolic structure of the individual.

Does that make sense? I too just went on a chicken nugget binge. I really wanted mine to taste exactly like store bought/fast food nuggets so I used ground chicken for the first time in my life. I also discovered that the breading sinks in and sticks A LOT better to ground chicken than it does slices of meat. My winning combo was pork rinds, Almond flour and dehydrated parm with garlic and onion powder. I was to lazy to fry so I baked them with oil drizzled over.
[ Turned out pretty well if you ask me! ]( http://imgur.com/tyTH416)Many people make this mistake - but since technically ur consuming less carbs currently i wud stick with it - no need to UP your carbs since ur below ur 20-25 gram - i find the best keto ratio is 80 fat 15 protein and 5 carbs. Net carb is ur friend I wonder if you only can eat that if you're part Polynesian. Or do we need to use the pineapples which weren't modified with 5,000 years of selective breeding? I'm betting that a lot of fruit is sweeter today. How long have you been on keto? What were you like with food before keto? Do you have any known allergies/conditions? Have you spoken to a doctor?
I lost my wedding ring this way.  Bitter sweet.Haha, right on.. embarrassing though it may have been, it's a victory! I ended up getting a couple of cheap elastic waist maxi skirts for similar reasons. The weight was coming off so fast for a while that I didn't want to get anything nice knowing it wouldn't fit soon. A great feeling!I am doing IF since I started keto about 6 weeks ago. I really can't bother eating more than once anyways.I think this is a case of irresponsible journalism.

The BBC should be able to put better quality opinion pieces on the web than this.

There is shockingly little consistency, neither low fat nor low-sodium nor calorie restricted but a mish mash of everything.I know exactly how you feel. Glad to see you're back on the keto wagon!

I lost almost 90lbs in 2011-12 on an atkins diet that morphed into keto when I learned more about nutrition. I went from being "morbidly obese" to "healthy weight" on my doctor's scale. I went from a 44'' waist to a 35''~ waist. I gained muscle tone and for the first time I really felt good about myself.

2013 was a tough year. I gained jobs, lost jobs, had a back injury, money worries and an incredible amount of stress. I began cheating here and there, with the intention of "going hard" at the gym the next day to make up for it. But that never happened. A slice of pizza turned into a whole pizza. A pint of beer turned into 8 pints of beer. In my last binge, I drank 9 pints of beer, ate a whole Papa Johns XXL pizza, and then crammed in Ben &amp; Jerries ice cream in a 12 hour marathon. I sat there in bed watching my stomach pulsate as my heart seemingly struggled under the stress. I was honestly worried I might have a heart attack.

Then this Christmas just passed I found myself over 100lbs heavier, with all my muscle tone gone, sleep apnea, chest pains, digestive problems. I was in terrible shape.

Thankfully 2015 has been good to me so far, and /r/keto is always there for support and advice. I'm 22lbs down, not a sip of beer has passed my lips, and everyone has started commenting on how much better I look. The second time around is harder in my opinion, but I think it also grants us a little wisdom in the long run. We remember what a hard marathon it was the first time, and the mistakes we made. But we also remember the reward in reaching that goal weight, or wearing that new pair of jeans, or simply being healthy again.

Best of luck.The way the article started I actually thought it was going to say something positive about a ketogenic diet. Then the one quote by some doctor or whatnot and same old same old.lol!

&gt; Some convenience foods may still contain good nutrients and be fine to eat in moderation.

&gt; A can of baked beans, for example, contains both fibre and protein.

[See for yourself the goodness](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/7698/2) contained in baked beanz!

Yeah, I do feel quite foolish for thinking that. "Idiot Proof Diet" - There's a lot of nice stuff in it about changing your mindset and living with keto longterm, but, it does give the impression that you don't have to watch calories once the carbs are kept down. Purchased only from a vendor at Mark's Daily Apple!Yeah ,female or male food preferences can't really be stereotyped, like you said your boyfriends the one who likes fruit the best! It's lucky that you have a particular draw to vegetables.
 With the sugar -fructose in the fruit must give it that "Move outa the way, gotta have it feeling". I don't get your answer. The more weight you lose, the better your insulin sensitivity becomes.You'll do fine if you stop eating junk food. Even in tiny quantities, junk food will sabotage your diet. All of the small amounts of carbs add up to put you over your limit. If you cut out the cheetos, croutons, low-fat cheesecake filling, etc, you would be well under your limit. Also, sugary or carby processed foods like that will trigger cravings for more of the same. Just lay off that stuff for a week and your cravings will go away.

Seriously, just eat meat and low-carb veggies cooked in butter or olive oil and you'll be fine.

Or maybe you are just trolling us? :)Yes! This what I need! Thank you!When I was doing Keto, I had this problem too. Note that it's only suggested to hit 20 for the first 2 weeks. This is to kick you into ketosis. Then it's suggested to hit around 50. So essentially you can eat healthy at 50 but not so much at 20. Not that it's UNHEALTHY to do 20 for 2 weeks... but you need fruit and veg. It's no problem at 50.Don't let anyone deter you - 2 weeks at keto is a very short time and it takes a while to adjust to it.  You're doing great.  Just cut out the croutons, eat more fat (no "light" or "low fat" stuff.)  You'll do great.I would be skeptical of the trainer's measurement. Accuracy with calipers depends in part upon the skill of the person doing the measuring. Try getting someone else to measure you with different calipers.

Here are some calipers on Amazon rated 4.5 out of 5 stars that cost only $10.49 and they have free shipping.

If you don't end up getting a second opinion, I would go with 45% if I were you since it matches the comparison photos and is closer to what the keto calculator says.If you are interested in fasting, try Intermittent Fasting. I only eat after I get home from work and I can eat 1500 calories a day and feel really full. I get hungry around 2pm but only for about half an  hour and I don't have a lunch at work to eat so easy not to. Started at 245 and down 8 pounds in 9 days.I think paleo is more strict than keto. On keto I can have cream, half n half, cheese, peanut butter, diet sodas, sugar-free candies, and really anything I want, as long as it fits into my carb count and my macros.

Paleo is limited because people really consider what cavemen actually ate. They didn't have diet coke, they didn't have sugar-free brach's candies, they didn't have cows for milk and butter, they didn't have coffee or chocolate... So they're like, I have to cut all of this stuff out of my diet, because cavemen didn't have access to it, so it's not paleo. I've literally read of people drinking nothing but water because it's the only thing that's paleo as a beverage. Sometimes those people are crazy.20g _net carbs_ is generally what's advised.

http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_net_carbs_and_how_to_i_calculate_them.3F

Eat more foods with fewer carbs. Have some meat and non-starchy vegetables or something. Munching isn't the issue with your carb count- your food choices are.All meats are fine if they aren't glazed in honey or cured in sugar or otherwise contaminated with carbs. You can look on the nutrition label to be sure the carbs are 0 or near 0. Stay away from things like honey-glazed ham or teriyaki chicken or maple cured sausages.

Other things that are ready to eat or easy to make ready:

* boiled eggs

* beef jerky (be careful of brands with too much sugar added)

* pork rinds

* hard cheeses (check label to make sure near 0 carbs)

* deli meats

* pre-made salads (make sure they have low-carb ingredients) or grocery store salad bar

* full-fat, low-sugar greek yogurt (e.g. Fage 4%)

* almonds, other low-carb nuts

* salami

* low-carb frozen dinners (microwavable)

* avocadoYUM!!!I'd like to think that I'm on a ketogenic informed by paleo principles. I'm huge on sourcing my food from sources that make them the most nutritionally dense. A pasture raised cow is simply going to supply more micronutrients than a corn fed industrial raised cow. The same as vegetables grown on healthy, living soul are going to be better for you than crops grown in depleted, dead soil with artificial fertilizer. With these, I agree with the paleo community. But I just love being in ketosis and don't think there is any need to differentiate. You can aim your macros to be in ketosis while giving thought to the quality and nutritional value of the food that gets you there. There are those who do Keto in line with paleo and those who don't. Damn, do I feel you. I did so well and felt so good when I first started. The past few weeks I have fallen off the wagon hard, and every stinking day I tell myself 'tomorrow.' I'm stuck in a vicious cycle. I know the right things to do, but can't make myself do them. Thank you for putting out such an honest post!I think it really depends on the person. I've been on Adderall since end of October and on keto for 2.5 years. The adderall definitely decreases my appetite even further than keto already did. Before adderall I was fine eating two meals a day and a couple light snacks if needed. There are many days now that I find it's 7pm and I've only consumed about 500 calories. I'll have a large dinner to make up for it even if I'm not hungry.
I went on a fat fast recently to jump start my system again. I was eating a minimum of 85% fat every 2-3 hours with a daily maximum of 1200 calories. It was for three days and I lost 3.5lbs during it. However, I noticed that in the afternoon of my second day my body was reacting very differently to the adderall. I normally take 20mg in the morning (9:30-10am) and then 10mg around 3pm. The lack of protein that I was eating was making me jittery like I had taken too large of a dose. My head hurt, buzzing, I felt dizzy, just overall not good. I know that I need to eat some kind of protein within an hour or two of taking my pills and my fat fast was making it that I was only getting a couple grams at a time.
This is only my experience and I was told by my doctor that my body is pretty sensitive to drugs. I had some pretty bad side effects with strattera and wellbutrin before going on adderall.I know, I just hate cleaning our wire rack (it has some kind of coating, can't use anything harsh, total bitch to clean) so I just hope for the best. Our oven is also quite subpar, I think it's older than I am!&gt;Vitamin C keeps your immune system healthy first of all.

[Citation Needed]. If you have a deficit you develop Scurvy, or other issues, none of which are immune related, but deal with connective tissues. Normal (even Keto) modern eating provides more than enough Vit C to prevent that.

Also, mega-dosing yourself is actually counterproductive as your body will dump more of it out of your system instead of adding it to it.

Drinking water without the vitamin C also helps with hunger, the extra vitamin C isn't needed.

[More information on what Vit C actually does](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002404.htm).I thought about doing just that, but then thought about my frying situation and decided against it. I don't really have a pan suitable for deep frying or a deep fryer. Though I suppose I could attempt to oven bake them...Your friend doesn't understand Paleo. The adobo stuff that comes in a can almost every restaurant uses doesn't have any/much sugar. The info says no carbs per one ounce serving might be rounded down but it should be pretty low. Of course, they might add something to it...Lots of people are asking about IF, and lots of people are getting those questions answered.

IF is [going mainstream](http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-82776447/), and when paired with SAD can bring about real improvements.

My take on IF in keto: Since you already have insulin under tight control, IF is about tweaking leptin and ghrelin. Way too detailed and micro-managing biology than is useful, probably. IFing on keto is convenient - one meal a day is less effort than 3 meals a day. Since I already do lazy keto, eating once a day makes it even lazier.I thought about pork rinds but since I don't like them alone, I figured I'd omit them. Cheese with sausage is ALWAYS a winner though :D So far so good, though microwaving didn't work out, but oven reheating was fine :) &gt; Why didn't he tell you this?

We were running out of time. I can ask next time.Is she one of those "I hate drama" people? Because it sounds like she loves to have drama to hate.The keto calculator uses the bodyfat percentage only to calculate your protein requirement. The higher the bodyfat percentage, the lower the amount of protein required.

The keto calculator suggests that 35% bodyfat may be appropriate for you (but it could be wrong).

Here are the protein ranges for you given various different body fat percentages.

35% -&gt; 54 to 88

30% -&gt; 58 to 95

25% -&gt; 62 to 102

I would choose a protein of around 75 grams which puts you safely in the middle of all three of those ranges.

You can increase your carbs to 20 or 25 grams without hurting anything. It may help you to have the extra flexibility.Uh, yeah. That's basically what I did back in the day when I lost weight the first time. Now they call it IF.

However if your going to go a while without eating on keto you must remember to drink water and maintain electrolytes (Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium)Grind them up and add a tbsp to cream cheese pancakes for a more substantial and bready pancake.

You have conditioned yourself that cereal tastes great and is a very cool reward. So now you want cereal, as a reward.  I think most people would accept that using food as a stimulus in [operant conditioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) is not good. Maybe right now is not the best time to tackle this, passing the CPA test is probably more important.

Ultimately what will free you is to break the conditioning. You don't need food to enable you to work harder, play harder, exercise longer, succeed at school/work, be loved, be liked, feel better. You don't need food for those things unless you make yourself believe that food is the key to getting what you want.

If you want to master yourself you will need to break the reward conditioning.When I feel like snacking, I make myself a cup of bulletproof coffee and add more coconut oil than I normally would. It makes me feel very full, often to the point of nausea. The last thing I want to do then is eat. Not great, but better than giving in to my snacking desires :p How did that turn out?

I see no issue with eating lots of meat, fat and cheese, and really don't see how this can be associated with 'weakness' in any sane mind.Some people use keto for a few months and shed 10, 20, 30 pounds of fat. Then they go back to "eating in moderation" and often gain it all back in the same amount of time.

If this is what you want (and it seems so) then you need to read the FAQ and follow it strictly. I won't repeat what it says, but it says everything you need to know.

If you can manage strict keto for the first few months, you can manage it for a few years with even less effort.Nice. I need to download the app yet and start logging my food more carefully. I'll add you when I do. I personally would never do a thing like that. I think there is MORE than enough bullshit clogging up the market, why would I want to add to it?

One of the best things about keto and this community is that it is free for anyone, no bullshit, just facts and support. For free.

I think part of the reason so many people have trouble with weight-loss is that they are confused by all the products and misinformation out there. Making a buck off stupid people is one thing, but to consciously contribute to delaying/derailing someone's health is pretty nasty.Near the Tacoma area.  Been keto for almost 1.5 years now.  aleehagen on MFP if you want to add me to MFP.Hi! Also from Olympia and am fairly new to keto. I'm on my fitness pal: akimaryJust don't do IF on a day you are planning to exercise or lift weights!I guess I technically don't NEED to do keto/low-carb, but with this and actually finally finding the right supplement mixes to get my energy levels up (prone to depression/forever sleeping), I actually feel stronger.

It feels great to realize some sense of control over your own body. Keto's been great for me and my self esteem because it finally gave me the framework to connect what inputs turn into what outputs. Previously, all I had to go on was some psycho-mumbo-jumbo on "listen to your body," which was about as useful to me as trying to learn French by diving straight into Proust.Some people only do IF. It's not something that you need to limit like a fat fast.Glad I haven't watched it.

Lunch today was two quarter lb burger patties from a local joint. For $3.25. Bomb. As the great philosopher Jay-Z once said, "Ladies is pimps too, Gon' brush your shoulders off."Man you guys from North America have it so good. I checked out Franks sauce and it sounds fantastic.  Its hard to find nice sauces here in Australia. Bear in mind that keto should be viewed as a somewhat permenant way of eating. As soon as you pick up carbs and sugar you will put on weight.And because I forgot and in case you didn't know already(you probably do) you can change the targets for the diet plan to make it more specific as the two images here showcase. I use the percentages from my macro setup from the Keto calculator in the sidebar personally. http://imgur.com/a/j0hMxWooo! Grats on your NSV! KCKO!Make up some shit, sell it as an eBook. Eventually you can make a modest change to an exercise machine, like add vibrating motors to a dumbbell and make up some shit about stabilizing muscles and whatever. Get rich I was just thinking this today and I'm curious to see what others say. Typically when I win I get between 25% and 40% of my original bet.
So it's not a lot of money, but for me it's more about loss aversion. I often do 3 diet bets simultaneously, and the thought of losing up to $100 terrifies me enough to keep me on keto.
When I was on day 3 (day 10 now), I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible, god-awful headache. I was too tired to make broth, but I knew I needed salt. I measured out half a tablespoon of salt and downed it with some water. Headache was gone in ten minutes. Hang in there and do like the others say and get enough salt! -internet hugs-Of course they are. It just takes the naked human eye to see they aren't as breaded though. The official website even lists the carbs. There's only 9 net grams in the 8 piece nuggets. With the nuggets, I notice that you can kind of see the chicken through it. Where as the filet you candefinitely not. If only the sauces weren't loaded with sugar though. I'd kill for sugar free Polynasian! I dunno - I specifically eat ultralow/no-carb stuff for breakfast and lunch just so I can have amazing dinners on a regular basis.You really need to talk to your doc. I have been on amphetamine for my ADHD, and it killed my appetite. I haven't been taking it since being on keto and have an appointment scheduled to talk it over soon. I already IF and am worried my appetite will completely go away with the meds. Weird. On facebook at least,  the paleo keto people are the fucking worst.  "That's literally poison" "That has chemicals" etc etc Meals are usually half a pepper, half a tomato, some cucumber, meat, coleslaw, cheese, omelette, sausages If you go to the gym they should have Callipers there that should give you an accurate  fat measurement. :)None, quite a bit of olive oil but I've eaten more before and not had an issue! You can do it! Stay strong and plan out your meals. Snacking is/was a huge problem for me so I would get caught in a moment of weakness if I didn't plan things well.

Ps. MN is great. The wife and I are from there and hope to move back someday. Dude! I am studying for my CPA exam as well.  I take AUD in less than 2 weeks!  My goto snack is macadamia nuts.  They are awesome!.. they taste good and they fill you up bc of all the fat!That kind of self-righteousness is usually found in diet newbies, in my experience. Were they new to Paleo?No way! I'm all for Threesville and Twotown as well lolI've been on keto since early January. I'm in olympia, so it's good to see other WA folks on here. If you want to chat or need encouragement, let me know. You can do it!This looks great! I'm going to try it this weekend. I *miss* chicken nuggets!Partisan garlic should be fine. Their medium, hott, mild sauce should be OK.When I tried similar with only almond flour (no parm) the coating fell of very easily. Any ideas? It the parm the secret I was forgetting?Good for you! I'm looking forward to the day when I can actually put my wedding ring back on.Eta?   Do blood work again, get the ratio.  The good/bad ratio is important on keto.  And a breathalyzer... To make sure you aren't drunk :)I think anyone getting mad over what other people eat is silly. Our society is obsessed with hating "fat" people and uses the moral superiority whatever diet they're on gives them to fan the fires of fat phobia everywhere.

Sigh.

In my experience,  people tend to think whatever diet they AREN'T on is crazy and strict.

Edit: I also do keto and paleo. I'm trying to add cheese and butter, because, cheese. I'm used to people making comments about what I eat, so it rolls off me like water off a ducks ass, as my grandfather used to say :D KCKO!I am a fellow ADHD Ketoer and I think a lot of it depends on your medication and metabolism. I am currently taking long-acting Methylphenidate HCL and am also doing a 20/4 IF fast. The medication still works (if that is your question) and I am not hungry after taking my medication (or before for that matter) but I have noticed that I metabolize my mediation incredibly fast.

I can't 100% say that it is due to the IF though, my body naturally fell into the rhythm when I started Keto so it could very well be keto itself, but what I am experiencing is that with my medication that used to take 6 - 8 hours for me to fully metabolize and come down off of I am now metabolizing in 3 - 4 hours (some days 2!) and coming down off it. Aside from that everything is A-Okay!

As far as trying different medications, I unfortunately recently moved and have yet to procure a family physician to speak with (there is a doctor shortage here) so I have been saving my Methylphenidate HCL for times when I feel I really need to concentrate (reading tasks, etc) and doing my best to cope in other situations until I can find one. :-\

I would say give it a try, and if you notice any complications arising I would suggest stopping and discussing it with your family physician.I think I got the keto flu 4 weeks in. It snuck up on me too :)If you haven't found it, read around /r/ketogains which has more special information on maintaining or gaining muscle and controling bodyfat%. It even has it's own calculator so you could compare the results given from the two for a protein number. I don't have experience with the cyclical keto plan, but ketogains does.

Usually though, unless you are a training professional, you would start with the Standard Keto Diet (SKD) for a duration of 4-8 weeks to get adapted into Ketosis before transitioning into the Cyclic Ketogenic Diet (CKD) or Targeted Ketogenc Diet (TKD). Starting out with those stats now, keep up on your electrolytes, and see how that much protein feels once you are adapted to Ketosis. Which could take 4-8 weeks. Hope I was helpful, good luck.I too was overjoyed when I discovered this at my local Costco. Unfortunately my research uncovered serious discrepancies regarding the carb content. According to numerous commenters on the keto and xxketo subs, the 17 grams listed as "total carbs" are in fact the NET carb amount. For me, the definitive answer was found on the Netrition site: http://www1.netrition.com/explore_asian_organic_black_bean_spaghetti.html#NUTFACTS. Just wanted to make you aware of the "carb controversy" regarding these noodles. Well that *is* how you get insurance to pay for itOkay thank you, glad to know there's a cause to this. Weird that I only started experiencing this 3 weeks in.How many 300+lb users we got on this sub?This happened with my new coworkers. After I told them about keto, they got all preachy and started informing me about how unhealthy it was to eat so much fat and asked why I wouldn't try paleo instead. This also being after the fact that I told her that I was on the diet previously, about all the benefits, and how much research I did on it before starting the first time. I didn't want to start off on the wrong foot so I held my tongue. But what I really wanted to do was ask her who the fuck she thought she was to tell me how to live my life.Yes, called the Keto Flu, often happens when transitioning into Keto, but it can happen anytime. [Read all about it in the FAQ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_.201Cketo_flu.201D_and_how_long_will_i_have_it.3F), it advises what to do. Eat more salt, what salts to eat.It sounds like rather than being a victim of your circumstances you've taken some major steps to overcome serious invisible health problems. I'm only aware of the social culture of India secondhand, because I've never been there, but from what I do understand anything which deviates one from the norm is subject to harsh criticism. Especially to a prospective man or woman in a relationship to the in-laws. Source: my Mother's first husband was from India. If it wasn't your diet or how your stomach affects you it would be something else. If people are looking for something to criticize they will find something to criticize. Chicken Broth is magical.

Make a soup, add it to your foods or just plain drink it. I live right to a Buffalo Wild Wings. I'm going to assume they add a lot of sugar in their sauces.. Would I just have to stick to plain buffalo hot?Someone just told me I'm going to get atherosclerosis from my keto diet.  He told me it will cause inflammation.  This person is a bonafide expert in weight loss.  He's an MD, bariatric surgeon and is on blood pressure medication in his 30s.  He ate a ton of fat today for breakfast -- along with a ton of carbs.

He is obese and already had part of his stomach cut off (sleeve gastrectomy).  He literally stands to make millions more than he does if he'd just lose weight.  But he can't.

Yet I am the unhealthy one.I would love to join you! I started on February 7th, so last Saturday. I'm aiming to lose 50+ pounds. :)

I'm from Minnesota, haha.

We can do it! Message me anytime!How long did it take you to go from 385 to 255?  And how do you feel about your progress at 255 at this point with your weightlifting?Fantastic work man, congrats.  How long did it take you?i read that as: "my ring finger fell off today" &amp; i thought "looks like it's time to stop dieting."Good luck on your license, I saw my Dad go through the same thing when I was really little. He locked himself in the basement to study for hours at a time. Would tea (hot or cold) or a cup of hot broth give a comfort feeling for you? Start by reading the FAQ.

When you're done, read it again.

Then use the keto calculator.

Follow it. Eat fat. Stop or severely limit carbs (less than 20g per day)

Drink water. Eat salt. Measuring how? I've already gotten caliper measurements and I can't afford a DEXA scan. Agreed. Largely, paleo does support individual approaches and doing what's right for you :)I lolled in public.*pastured, free range organic bacon ;) lolWe had to stay late in the lab  yesterday. Everybody was whining for pizza and going "I'm sooo hungry! ".

 All I felt a polite knock from my body "hey, if you don't have anything better to do, food would be nice. I really don't want to be a bother though, I can come back later. "

In addition I didn't feel weak at all on my hour long bike ride home! I would disagree with the idea that paleo needs to cause debate over whether modern foods were available to cavemen and whatever. I've always thought of the 'paleolithic' part of the philosophy as a hook - a story to help people get their head around what it's really all about, which is eating real, whole foods. Just my interpretation: I'm broadly both paleo and keto, and find plenty of room for both philosophies in my life. Technically, I guess I would say I eat low carb low fodmap primal haha but that sounds horrendously strict. It's not particularly.Started on January 27th. Already down over 10lbs.
My MFP username is livitup85. Add me :) Today I just happened to not eat until 6:40PM... wasn't intentional, I just wasn't hungry, and accidentally went the whole day without eating. It was a pretty great realization that I can do it, and function normally without really much trouble. My routine is 2 scoops of protein powder in morning + vitamins first thing in morning. Then all my food after at least 5pm.The only thing I've changed is where I buy my food.

Once I saw the way animals were being kept I made the switch to keep it as natural as I could.

Grass fed beef &amp; open range chickens.

Food Inc on Netflix really fucked me up.Yes, I second this, though I would compare the carbs in the bouillon cubes before buying.

If you can't stomach just the plain broth, you can make a quick egg drop soup.
Here's a quick recipe, if you're interested:

-Bring about 4 cups worth of chicken broth to a simmer in a pot (make sure it is not at a rolling boil)
-Wisk 2-3 eggs in a bowl
-Add some black pepper, onion/garlic powder, and any other spices you would like to the eggs
-As the broth is still simmering, slowly stir in the egg mixture, keeping it as steady as possible
-Once the eggs have been added, turn the heat off and let the soup sit for a few minutes, so the eggs finish cooking.

I definitely attribute that soup to the reason why I only had the "keto flu" for a day or two. I made 3 batches total and had at least a little bit of it at every meal.

Hope this helps and you start to feel better soon!If you want to do p90X make sure you take it easy. It is a very intensive exercise program with almost no breaks during the hour or so of each video. Definately focus on a hypertrophy workout. You don't need strength if you just wanna get big. Do a lot of volume. Use a nitrous oxide promoting product like  agmatine, or citruline malate, or if u can handle it, most pre workouts have shit in it to get you pumped. This is all broscience btw but it's what I'm planning to do in a couple of months for a fitness competition, and it's what got me big in highschool, just pure ego lifting.I've been trying IF this week, and I feel considerably better than I have since starting keto.

I've been working with the 20/4 interval, though I do want to try my hand at 24 or 48 hours soon. I have similar stats in weight and height as you and my body fat % is closer to 50 than it is to 35. I would maybe try measuring or getting another opinion from a doctor perhaps. :)Lighten up. Onederland is a huge accomplishment and a big I MADE IT to so many people.

To OP: Oh yisssssss. Nicely done. =)You're doing well! You may want to invest in some sort of broth or tea in case you start to not feel so well within the next few days.
I had the "keto flu" for a couple of days towards the end of my first week.

I made a basic egg drop soup (4 cups of broth, spices, 3 scrambled eggs) that I ate throughout those days, really think it saved me from the worst of the symptoms others get.
I think most people get the "flu" because of the change in electrolytes- not entirely sure. But the broth really helps make sure that your sodium and electrolytes stay at a decent level.Feel free to message me! :)52grams of carbs? I have it set for 20grams and it works for me. If it goes over for any reason try cycling the different meals. http://i.imgur.com/yOxOYY7.jpg &lt;-general exampleHah. No.

Hunger is natural, and there's nothing weak about eating what makes you feel less hungry.

Further, there's nothing wrong with eating what jives well with your body, and avoiding what messes you up.

Your mother-in-law is saying what is tantamount to "He allergic to peanuts, he weak person because can't eat peanuts. Bad person."

There's no reason for you to feel bad about it.

It tells you more about HER (she's a bad person) than it does about you ;)I started in November but haven't been good about sticking to it for about a month (back at it though!) From the beginning my goal loss is about 30 lbs and we are the same age! Feel free to PM me too :-)first time on keto (2012) i was fine, avoided the flu for the most part aside from feeling a bit "brain foggy"

this time around, it's every bit as bad as i've read it can be.

also, your dinner sounds amazing.Ladies can do anything! We just add cream to ours.Thanks for the help! I will try this!
Thanks my man! I will try my best!
I hadn't seen this before. Thank you!PM anytime started a week ago, good luck on your goalsCan ladies do that too? =)Indiana.  We've got Mperks all over the place ;)That's really unfortunate. I am coworkers with someone on paleo and they are always the most sympathetic to my annoyance over food options in the office cafeteria. Tell her you have cancer.If I were you I'd take creatine,  and then ego lift try to lift and sustain a pump. Last few weeks do a keto diet to shed your water weight.I posted a couple of days ago, but I was also suffering keto flu really badly that day.
half my lunch came back up.

some helpful people here told me to get some electrolytes into me.
all i could find was powerade zero from the convenience store next to work.

seemed to help a lot

and this is the third time ive started keto, but never experienced anything this bad before! between that and the sugar withdrawals. omfg. kill me.

i swear sugar is more addictive than methCongratulations!

You're right; cereal won't help.  You'd still have the anxiety, plus you'd feel sick and bloated, plus you'd be really ticked off at yourself, and you'd probably knock a few points off you test score.  Well, I would, anyway.  My brain words much, much better on keto.


Stick to your guns and slam that exam!Interesting. Have a link? These aren't "herbal" supplements... I'm not into that hippy shit... so I wonder if the FDA investigation is going to cover these vitamins. I've always viewed the generic Equate brand as fairly trustworthy but if it turns out they've been screwing me over for years I'll switch.

Seems legit, though... my urine coloration is noticeably different depending on if I took my vitamins that day or not.I had to give up talking to people about food.The regular nuggets are done exactly the same as the filet on the sandwich. I worked at chick-fil-a.Proud of you for finding a better way to deal with your stress! You can do this! Good luck on your exams! When I look at BFP comparison pictures, I look more like 45%. All this is so confusing! And exactly why I'm starting to lift! Whoa! That batter looks pretty cool. Post back with the chicken pics if you use it!Oh no doubt. But I'm okay with it being such trace amounts that they don't register for a single serving of food. If it's listed as "&lt;1g" it goes in the notebook as 1g.You can PM me!I've noticed a lot more places have started to offer it! McDonald's being one of the more notable onesThanks for taking the time to share videos!

You seemed really nice on camera. I deduced from a YouTube comment that you were Canadian.

Intuition confirmed.  Looks like you missed out on a prime opportunity for a hall pass my man.  What's that Baxter? You pooped in the refrigerator? and you ate a whole wheel of Brie?! How'd you do that? I'm not even mad, that's amazing,Hmm, haven't thought about chicken nuggets for a long time, but this made me crave them, and I just happen to have a ton of chicken thighs laying around.

I might try and wiggle my [fish batter](http://highsteaks.com/egg-and-cheese-battered-fish-bites/) recipe to see how it might work.I honestly do drink a decent amount of water, I'm in school and bring a liter size water bottle every day and finish it ATLEAST once, then when I'm at home I only drink water, or the diet tea from time to time or a coffee at work. But I mainly try to just stay with water Great jobJust total in MFP. I'd been trying to stay with lower-carb options but I'm easily tempted :(  why didn't you ask them to wrap it in lettuce or add more toppings? You seem to have gotten what you asked for besides the increase in price. ...no? I was just trying to eat "normal" food in portion. Still new to this.


 Shit.Don't be obsessed with "am I in Keto yet" and just stick to the program - if you eat less than 20g carb a day, you'll be in Keto soon.
Don't get stressed if/when you plateau - your body will likely be healthier and that's the goal and the point.

Good luck, stay positive and check in here if you have questions!Total I guess, just going off of MFP.


I'm a really bad muncher I guess :/I always get diet Dr pepper &lt;33 one of like three restaurants that have itShe's probably a sociopath who speaks badly behind your back.  The workplace is full of these nutjobs.  This rabbit hole goes deep.Meijer! Yea! Which of the 5 mid-west states are you in?Definitely try the almond flour and powdered parm one! You can play around and adjust the proportions too. Sometimes I prefer more almond flour. Just don't forget to add some salt, pepper, and seasoning of choice!

I've made this in a frying pan as well.The first time I did keto I felt fine days one and two. Day three I felt like death and I shit my brains out all day. Not cool. Then it got better. It might not effect you. I can only last about 16 hours before a headache kicks in. I don't think it's for everyone either. It doesn't help me stop stalling. Great job!!!! It is such a great feeling to pass a big milestone!Very new, yes.  And wow, that's some serious eggs.  I thought I was going overboard with 14 eggs and 30 strips of bacon a week.Saved! And thank you! I made pork rind encrusted ones and they were okay but kind of soggy with no crunch. I'll have to try this. I bought two silpats on an Amazon lightening deal.

No.  But you can definitely put some muscle on for a decent beach body.  Head over to /r/fitness abs read up.

Edit:  by March?  I thought you said by the Summer!

The most you can do by March won't be much at all.I was doing this as well. I play volleyball, soccer, and run 4-6 times a week so I make sure to eat some carbs daily to keep my energy up.I know.. whoever runs that blog must use a professional photographer.. lol. I don't have anything as fancy as pancake shaper thing.. so I have to use the xanthan gum to keep them from running all over the skillet.

The coconut pancake sounds really yummy. I've found low sugar syrup before that had like 7 net carbs.. but I think the recipe on ruled.me had like.. 2 net carbs or something. When we're trying to keep them under 20, each little carb counts a lot for me.. lol.

I recently realized my breath mints contain 2 carbs a pop. ouch. :/First day ever on a ketogenic diet, which is why I ask. It seems unlikely that I would just transition suddenly into ketosis after 24 hours of a low-carb diet. I haven't had any headaches or anything.You're new around here aren't you?

Dietary cholesterol doesn't have the effect on your heart you think it does.

http://highsteaks.com/cholesterol/

http://highsteaks.com/blood-tests-simplified/

I frequently eat 24-36 eggs in a week and roughly 4 pounds of meat. My blood lipids are fantastic.I get this and it hasn't kicked me out of Keto, because it's only 9 net carbs. It is lightly breaded as opposed to the filet in the sandwich. You just can't eat it with most of their sugary sauces though. I also get an unsweet tea and add stevia or if I forget they always have sugar subs, like Splenda, available. Add a side salad and your golden. Their grilled nuggets are gross imo.Feel free to PM meI watched some documentary about IF, then I didn't eat for three days.  On day three I started feeling like Ghandi or Jesus.  All my aches and pains went away and i felt all calm and peaceful.  Even my grumpy personality went away.  It was totally weird and I'm never doing it again.Is this your first day on a ketogenic diet, or your first day in ketosis? It sounds like from your post you've gone 1 day eating low carb and youre already in ketosis (which would be quite impressive)

If it's your first day on a keto diet ever, a lot of people go through carb withdrawal which can get quite nasty. People get super grumpy and start salivating when someone mentions bread. However when you're past that, as long as you eat enough fat to satiate yourself you shouldnt feel bad at all.

In regards to actually being in ketosis: some people report runny noses or feeling under the weather (keto flu). Outside of that most people get a burst of energy and feel amazing (I know I feel much better now that I'm not shoving my face full of carbs every day)I would recommend cutting down on the drinks. How much water do you drink a day? I've been around for a while now but there are several of us Seattleites (and surouding area) around /r/keto and /r/xxketo. Welcome and feel free to PM! :)I am nodding in agreement so hard right now. I'm late but their chicken salad in a bowl is good. I eat with just a fork or with cucumbers or pickels.

Be prepared for confusion while ordering. You do NOT want a chicken salad or a chicken salad sandwich. Just chicken salad in a cup. HTH!!Another thing you could try is ween down on the carbs. Try maybe 100g for a few days, then down to 75 for a few days, then to 50, etc. This works better for some than cold turkeyTry brawndo. What happened?Don't eat croutons. Don't eat cheetos. Don't eat pre-made cheesecake filling or cupcakes. Don't eat things with names like "Maple caramel" or "Sweet heat."

Are you tracking total carbs or net carbs?Hell yes! Are you counting net carbs or just all carbs?

The other thing I notice is that you're still eating carby food, just in tiny portions.  I think this might be part of your problem, because things like a tiny cupcake or cheetos have so many carbs that you're blowing a good chunk of carbs on one tiiiiinnnnny amount of food.  Those flaming hot cheetos must have had at least 5 carbs.  If you consider it, that's 25% of your daily amount in, like, 13 little sticks of cheetos.  For many of us, that's almost 1 meal's worth of carbs (I aim to top out at about 7 at most in 1 meal).

Also, lite or diet versions of foods have more carbs.  Lite sour cream can have 2 carbs per serving, while full fat sour cream has .4 carbs per serving.They sound hangry. You should have thrown some non-grass-fed bacon at them and ran away!12 count of grilled nuggets dumped on top of a side salad with ranchYou should check out Healthy Wage too.

Add some sweetener if you require it (I use swerve), some cinnamon, and some water - microwave 30 to 45 seconds, and ta-daa oatmeal!

I sometimes add berries, too. :)http://m.imgur.com/a/a8te2



Screenshots of MFP diaryGood to see another keto follower from the Seattle area. If you can start on Super Bowl Sunday, you can get through anything :)http://m.imgur.com/a/a8te2

There are some screenshots of MFP diaryWait last Thursday.  You've gone that long?"Still, despite some revisions, the main advice never changes: eat more fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and eat less saturated fats, salt and sugar." - Don't forget that line in the article.

Also, it states that "While they are based on dietary science, the guidelines aren't immune to politics.".  I'm seriously wondering how OP is  struggling to keep it under 30gsEat meat, fats, and low-carb vegetables. Eat the lowest carb vegetables from this list.

Cobb salads are a reasonably good choice. Mixed greens, bacon, avocado, boiled egg, mushrooms, cheese, full-fat salad dressing.

Don't drink any carbs.:)Drinking lots of water without bolstering electrolytes will only make you feel like hell.  Ever heard of water poisoning?  That's it.

Drink some broth or salty water with a splash of lemon.  Then hit the grocery store to track down some Nu or Lite Salt for potassium.  While you're there buy a chelated magnesium supplement (ends in 'ate').  The FAQ should have the dosage you need but keep in mind that it is on top of standard daily intake.

Electrolytes will help sooo very much you'll wonder why you could have ever forgotten them.You bred raptors?Think this would work with Met-RX protein powder?

If you could put up a list of your average intake on a daily basis, for all meals and snacks, that would be helpful.Relax, potty mouth.hey I do it too. I'm just saying what I have read. I do 16/8 or 20/4 every dayNo kidding? I'll give it a shot tomorrow, thank you!I'm new, on my second week. Last week I stayed under 20 net grams of carbs all week, but it didn't feel like I went into ketosis. No keto flu, no funny taste in the mouth or pee smell, etc. On Sunday I ended up going way over my carb/sugar intake, so I'm sure that screwed up everything. I went back to normal on Monday and don't plan on falling off the wagon again, so to speak. I've read the FAQ a few times and still feel like I might be missing something.

My main two questions are:

1) Is there any reason why I didn't feel the effects of keto flu even staying under 20g net carbs for six days straight?

2) I've been tracking my food intake on MFP as accurately as possible, and although ideal macros are 60/35/5 mine have been closer to 70/25/5. Most people I've seen have problems getting more fat as opposed to protein, but I seem to have the opposite problem. I've long been a fan of chicken thighs with the skin on, but I've gone to eating skinless chicken breasts to up my protein/fat ratio. Should I be worried right now about getting that fat-to-protein ratio closer to 60/35?

However, I will say that right before I started Keto a week and a half ago the scale said 283 and last time I weighed on Saturday it was 276. So something was working.What the fuck are you eating? I'm curious why you say this.  Are you saying they should save their fat allowance for other things that will allow more satiety?  I did BPC a couple of times during my first two weeks, didn't see any downside to it.I'm tired of telling my patient they should lose weight to help with their health problems and feeling like the biggest hypocrite on earth!Happy to hear this. I have a loaf of their sourdough on the way from Netrition.Yes, there has been a weird spur of downvoting going on in this sub since the News Years.  I least that's what I've noticed.  This thread alone is covered in negative karma.

Anyway, thanks for the advice.Yeah that is what I thought. On facebook I read some people mentioning at least 5$+ per test! Meh. I don't have enough money to sustain something like that. Indian food is generally pretty good.  Chicken Tika, Kurmas ectI'm pretty sure I read that fat loss goes in this order of significance. Diet &gt; Weight Lifting &gt; Cardio.Welcome back. I am only a couple months in and depend on this community. I am saddened by some of the harsher responses, and ridicule, but find overall most comments are welcoming and encouraging. Good luck and blessings on your journey, and congratulations on your wedding. Especially because of my GAD, I need regular reminders that I am doing things right, I was alarmed by my reading and I don't think that it is wrong to ask the question I asked. Some people just love to attack other people while they are only trying to learn their new body and new lifestyle. For sure, some responses I got here would have scared some people off. Thank you /u/Addbutter for your empathy.Thank you so much for helping me try and find ways to spare on calories. It means a lot! I spent a lot pf money in groceries (mainly the almond flour) and threw out a lot of cupcakes for this. I'll continue to experiment and come back with an update if I crack the code!You sure need to stop hitting on my head. There is NOTHING wrong in being concerned and ask. I'm only 10 days into this so give me a fucking break.Never be embarrassed to modify an order when eating out to make it keto-friendly... your long term success is worth more than a few seconds of confusion or a condescending stare. Most of the time, they don't even bat an eye. You're paying for the meal - pay for the meal you want. Plus, you're avoiding wastage.

Flat out telling the server to make up the order without carbs is the best option, rather than simply pushing them to the side of the plate where you might be tempted/peer pressured into "not wasting food".

Being "forced" to eat carbs due to dining out should never be a reason to break keto. If worst comes to worst, just say NO! If you think you'll be tempted, eat before hand (if possible), or eat after. Spend the meal focusing on the company or the delicious meal you'll eat once you get home!
I wasn't going to cancel an entire pharmacy order just for a freaking 7$ box of ketostix. Calm yourself will you? I don't need your judgement. I got to go to a dietician. I never went back.  Mine told me to eat my carbs and with each meal.  Potatoes are so good for you....I don't agree with that definition. I am taking in very meagre amounts of fat (butter and coconut oil; about 200 Cals) to keep the body in fat burning mode. This lasts all day until I break my fast 12-14 hours later. You're telling me that's not fasting?! Where exactly did reddit get that 10 Cal/hour definition?

People can do their version of IF, and that's great if it works for them however they define it. This is working for me. When I do 48 hour fasts, I only intake about 400 Cals for 2 entire days, in the morning as fat in BPC! Oh that's not fasting?thanks! anbeavSorry didn't read everyone else's reply. Can't take credit for most of this, I've  gathered things from this sub.

If you're craving anything, eat, you're hungry. (I was blown away by this one.)


Eat enough fiber. (I got serious nausea and stomach cramps which made me feel like death. Day 18 of my second attempt, I woke up and barfed. I'm now successfully avoid such problem with coconut flour and other soluble fiber supp.)


Drink water with plenty salt and nusalt(potassium), use the taste as a measure of how much to add, it never fails.


Bone broth, beef broth, broth, broth, broth. Salt to taste.


All the fresh herbs!


Heavy cream drinks for the lazy. I make one that provides 1000kcals of my daily intake almost every day.


Kerry gold butter _is_ worth the price.


Make your own ghee with cheaper butter for cooking.


Take it easy with coconut oil. Start with 10g a day and work your way up every so often. (Day 2 of my first trial, I had to make up calories and had used up my macros, so I force fed myself 50g of coconut oil... Had plenty of fun the next morning.)
Give yourself time to adjust, not everyone loses that big water weight in the first few days. It takes time for the carb crave to subside, sometimes. This diet is the most adjustable to fit your lifestyle that I have been on, so fit it to you, as long as you get the protein, electrolytes, and good fats your body needs. Take advantage of the support, advice, and encouragement found here. And yes, be careful about giving in to that high carb favorite treat, because it can become a snowball effect. But if you do, forgive and get back on track. KCKO.and headaches!Actually when you're fully keto adapted, you have so much energy that you don't sleep that much.

But sleep is important, keto or not. It's the time when your brains does a lot of work sorting memories and such, and regulation of certain hormones are done during sleep. Adults really should get 8 hours sleep a night, and that should burn about 1000 Cals, depending on weight. Night, because all life on Earth above the ground has evolved using the sun to set circadian cycles. Sleep in a fully dark room. Disrupting this cycle with on and off sleep may not be the best thing to do because it can add a lot of stress to your life as well as depression. My advice is to try to go to sleep earlier.

Personally, I have noticed weight loss on the scale stalling when I don't get enough sleep, and i feel like crap.Ahhhh I see! Thank you so so much for the detailed information! I will ask my local friends how to type in Chinese to look them up.

That's cool! No wonder you know so well about the local cuisine... ;)When I first started keto I over thunk it. (poor grammar I know)Iit took me about 2 weeks to realize it was as simple as just eating.  If you can pick a weekend to do nothing but relax and eat keto you will get past the tough part.  Batch cook some bacon, get that cheese cut up and ready to snack on. Eat cream cheese and pork rinds. Drink the broth.  Saute some spinach in bacon grease. Eat a big ass steak. Prepare for the worse and you will find that you aren't thinking about it at all.[Don't stop once you're "finished."](http://np.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2tl4hu/graph_keto_works/)Belizz has a good idea. I just salt my food and I take magnesium and potassium tablets. I'll try the Mio trick though. I've found that since I started keto I'm taking more high sodium foods anyway. Haven't run into much trouble except today I have a terrible headache. Will probably up the salt intake tomorrow. I think that Keto is stricter in the sense that you pretty much rid your diet of most sugars. Where some use artificial stuff, I rather not.  I have know many paleo peep who swear fruits sugar is some other variant that doesn't qualify as sugar. I've seen them try to recreate their favorite desserts with as much sweet stuff as they can.
However, in the end it really comes down to perspective, its silly for someone to blow up on you for saying such a simple thing. I just saw those 2 days after I bought my big bag :(Be Patient!  Eat when you are hungry. Keep keto friendly stuff around.  Eat when you are hungry. (notice I said that twice)   If you feel like cheating eat some bacon, eat some cheese, drink a diet root beer with heavy cream.  KEEP KETO no matter what! :-)Diet Dr Pepper and heavy cream. About a 5 to 1 ratio of DP to cream.Don't even bother trying food substitutes like low carb tortillas and quest bars. I'm currently trying to ween myself off of stuff like that. The first time I did keto, I lost 40 pounds in 4 months. I didn't know alot of products existed, so I ate really simple and didn't even track macros. Now, I'm struggling at a stall, despite being meticulous with macros, and I know it's because I eat at least one carby substitute a day. Nice!  Let me know how it turns out.

&gt; I stuck to a small batch this time because I substituted peanut butter for almond butter

Definitely the smart thing to do the first time, though I'm guessing almond butter would work just as well.  I actually used half butter / half olive oil my very first time because I had no coconut oil (still tasted great).  From what I've noticed, the more substitutions one makes, the more you *might* have to make up in sweetener.

One good thing about this recipe is that you can pretty much just taste test the mixture after it's melted and gauge how it will be (then add whatever little touches to finish -- I've added nuts before).  As long as that tastes great, you'll be fine.I've always wondered if I should head to the doctor to discuss these symptoms but I think it's just my body trying to get used to such low carbs. Once I get used to it, I'm sure I'll feel way better. It's just going to take a ton of determination in the next couple of weeks. I thought the same way, but the more I am on the diet, I find the less food I need to get that full feeling due to the richness of food and the longer I go without being hungry.I have battled with blood sugar issues with all of the highs and lows, and was accustomed to having to eat something every couple hours to keep my sugar level up high enough to keep from getting weak and having the shakes. I am awed that I no longer get the hypoglycemic reactions, and I usually eat no more than 2 meals a day, with an occasional snack. After living for years having to be always aware of the time and making sure I carried an adequate snack I feel a real sense of freedom. Look,for low carb substitutes if you feel the need, but after while you may find you no longer want them. Good luck and blessings on your journey.Homemade Gatorade/headache buster=  1-2 squirts of MIO (my favorite is cranberry raspberry), 1/2 tsp of Lite Salt in 24 ounces of water.   Your on an enlightened path.I completely agree and I appreciate your honesty. I know I just have to tough through it, sometimes it just gets hard. But that's life. Thanks again for the advice. You may also want to skip your daily exercise until you are past the keto flu. If you are getting enough electrolytes, then the likely cause of your headache is insufficient fuel.

When eating high-carb, your brain uses around 120 grams of glucose. On low-carb, you are only eating 20 grams of glucose. The rest is supplied via:

* glucose from burning fat (from the glycerol)
* converting protein to glucose (gluconeogenesis)
* ketones

Your brain may not do a very good job of burning ketones on the first day since it has not yet adapted. So eating a bit extra of protein and fat can help. That's why avoiding the calorie deficit is likely a good idea at first.
I just gave that website a try and it told me to consume 52+ grams after subtracting the carbs in a single day. I clicked on the Keto - Atkins. Vaguely on topic:  if anyone was looking to pick up some xanthum gum but not sure they wanted to buy a full pound of the stuff, I found the following little bags of it at Walmart:

https://ashleyshomemadeadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_4001.jpg

It's .32 ounces for 49 cents.  Located in the baking aisle, clustered with their other gluten free items.  I think the problem was that he tried to cure cancer with it.I usually call that breakfast.Hey thanks for the tips, my first batch is getting chilled right now and im really excited! I stuck to a small batch this time because I substituted peanut butter for almond butter and wasnt sure how the outcome would be :PYou mentioned 8 hours of sleep.

With myself getting off at midnight and getting up with my SO at 7:00 AM the next morning, I'm typically getting 6 hours of sleep. Is this going to majorly effect the weight loss benifits of eating a Keto Diet?

Should I find time to take a two hour nap?

*Edit: spelling.
I think it's probably relative to what kind of foods you crave. I'd have a harder time on paleo diet without dairy products or the occasional peanuts (they are legumes). On the other hand you're "allowed" to eat more nuts (real ones), root vegetables and can also eat fruit on a paleo diet so if you're in to that paleo might feel less strict.Eatthismuch.com can give you meals based on your specific macros from the Keto calculator and you can tell it you are doing keto as well. It can be really helpful to at least see the options it gives you for your meals. If it didn't make me feel terrible, then I wouldn't be going on and off the diet. Um, I thought under 25g of carbs was required fir ketosis.  I'm confused. Can someone double-check for us?Stop going on and off if you want your body to adjust Holy s***! I woke up today with a terrible headache and low electrolytes and did _exactly_ that! I was not prepared for what happened next.

Did you find another quick and easy way to get your salt? I struggle to put too much of it on food. I also take NoSalt for potassium and that is terrible on food.That may be it...

However, it's also possible that this supervisor is a cannibal. Obviously she had designs (recipe?) for OP, which are now totally messed up because of the weight loss. And it's just getting worse and worse for her every day.

KETO PROTIP: If your co-workers are worried about your weight loss too much, they just may be cannibals.Grilled chicken, salads And no, I'm usually not hungry. I actually stay pretty full throughout the day since I'm eating more fat. Controls my anxiety and moods, also.  A few weeks ago I cheated and had a normal serving of sushi rolls with soy sauce (I know, gluten) .... After 40 minutes I wanted to kill myself, literally.  I was googling painless suicide.  Scared the crap out of me!Unbreaded filet or nuggets. I tend to obsess over my macros, but I will take your advice on not counting calories right now. I'll just focus on staying away from carbs. Thank you :)I add lite salt to like everything, its a habit now honestly Their grilled nuggets are awesome and very low carb. Also, even an 8 count of their regular nuggets is below 10 carbs, which is crazy to me!It could also be that you're drinking TOO much water and it's flushing out even your extra electrolytes. Only you can tell based on urination, everyone needs different amounts of water.

I would recommend the no/nu-salt stuff, I doubt you're getting enough potassium. You're still missing that one.

I just saw you exercise ~500 calories of cardio. Maybe you should cut that down a bit and eat at maintenance until you are comfortable with keto, and *after* start a deficit+exercise.Get electrolytes, especially sodium, in the amounts detailed in the FAQ.* Take a week's vacation to coincide with the induction phase, because keto flu can be that bad.
* Don't try to restrict your calories the first week. There will be enough going on with carb withdrawal, keto flu, and needing to cook 90% of your food.
* Make sure you have a working scale so you can start weighing yourself before starting.

Actually, I'm lying... I was on top of the first two and everything worked out fine because of it.Sounds like you've tried about everything!  Thanks for doing all of the experimenting.But are you still hungry? You may just need more food. Don't worry so much about the calorie counting right now, your body will take time to adjust to processing fats while your glycogen stores are being depleted.

Focus on making sure that you are satisfying your hunger, avoiding carbs and not putting extra stress on yourself.Here is a recipe for cream cheese frosting using Truvia that claims to have 0 carbs per serving. I haven't tried it. If it works, then that could save another 1.5 grams of carbs per cupcake. Worth a try if anyone wants to experiment.

http://truvia.com/recipes/cream-cheese-frosting

I found another recipe for cream cheese frosting that uses Truvia and butter. Maybe it would be better.

http://shortcutmenus.com/2011/11/sugar-free-cream-cheese-frosting-with-stevia/
I've been doing keto + IF for a few weeks now. The combination is insane at burning fat. Far better than calorie counting ever wasessential fibers = 0I tried that. I can show you the bag! It was disgusting as well. The cupcakes sank in the middle and had a bitter aftertaste. I use it for zillion things. Nut breads and nut cakes, I mix it with egg and vegetable purree and bake it - but it's never alone, there are other nuts involved too. Pure flax bread is horrible to me. I never have enough eggs to use them in big amount for bread. But this one is so lovely I bake it sometimes:
http://www.charliefoundation.org/resources-and-tools/find-recipes-home/breads-rolls-and-muffins/item/978-high-fiber-rolls

I put ground flax seed on my scrambled egg today. I put it on my mixed raw veggies or fried veggies. I typically eat everything with raw veggies but I need something dry too sometimes, with some calorie and fiber content... And I don't always have bread and it's simpler. Okay, it wasn't so great on the eggs.

And I have this:
10-10 g ground flax seed, coconut and walnut (everything ground), a little water or nut milk, I tend to use some butter too.
Spices or whatever we want (cocoa, fruit).
It's a quick meal for hungry times. I personally like its taste too.I'm eating about 1700-1800 calories a day and then I exercise at night. I'm definitely eating enough, but it probably isn't potassium rich foods like avocados and spinach. And I love both of those, so I will try to incorporate more of those into my diet. When I say a lot of water, it's usually a gallon a day. Yes, add more butter. Yes, add more salt. YES!No, I have been going off and on. When I do the diet, I stick to about 20 carbs a day.

I'm 5'7" and 213 lbs. I eat about 1700 calories a day and get about 120-140g of protein. When I exercise, I do cardio and burn about 500 calories. But the thing is, I exercise at night and am feeling sick about 5 hours before exercising. How many calories are you consuming? Are you hungry?This might be of interest to you as well:

[eatingacademy.com/nutrition/do-calories-matter](http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/do-calories-matter)

&gt; "All calories are not created equally: The energy content of food (calories) matters, but it is less important than the metabolic effect of food on our body."I am sure others will chime in with better advice, but.

I highly doubt there is enough potassium in that supplement if it's a typical magnesium supp. Did you add additional potassium, like nu-salt? Avocados, spinach?

According to your other post you seem to be eating enough but are you hungry?

You don't need powerade zero. How much is "a lot of" water? You should be seeing 5+ clear urinations per day.Have you been sticking to 15 to 20 grams of carbs for the entire past month? Or have you been going off the diet periodically and then trying again? If you've been going for a month straight, you should be past the point of having these symptoms if it is the typical keto flu.

If you are determined to follow keto, it is worth going to the doctor and asking for an electrolyte blood panel test to rule out deficiencies in electrolyte balance.

Another possibility is that you could be eating too few calories. What is your height, weight, total daily calorie expenditure, and target calories? What are your macros for protein and fat? How much exercise if any?I like the analogy: "If you get a flat tire, you wouldn't get out a knife and slash the other three tires, would you?"This looks like my favorite yet! Cauliflower crusts are getting a bit old. There's crazies in every group, whether it be diet or religion. The longer I eat differently than most people, the less I'm willing to discuss diet at all with people. Somehow it tends to bring out the crazy in even the most sane seeming people. Keto especially seems to bring out the crazy. Those websites would be great!! Thanks for your advice.Thanks. Appreciate it. It seems strict is subjective, maybe it means "easy for me" here...

I'd say paleo is way less strict (I try to be objective) but it's just my first guess, it's impossible to compare the two I think... And I might be biased because I met paleo first and went almost totally paleo, then met keto and went keto for a while... Keeping paleo except for some interesting recipe in the beginning. And I never mentioned vegetarianism, not like I do it nowadays, I'm just very close to it, I have about 29-30 vegetarian days a month...

Paleo is very easy if you ask me. Keto is harder (according to the few weeks I was on it) but not so very extreme, a veggie lover hedonist like me could do it for a while, after all. But it feels better.
I plan to make keto my lifestyle - with occassional cheat meals (I forgot how one can say it nicer) when I eat more veggies, a little more fruit and even more veggies, but nothing extreme.

Vegetarianism was the easiest, I simply couldn't not to do it. But it changed when I met the wonderful salmon...

Of course, others would say drastically different things. If someone can't live without a ton of fruits or fell in love with oats, keto seems hell.
To me, every low-fat diet is hell and would cause suicidal thought in a few days, I'm sure. I never tried that (not eating anything for days doesn't count, that's way better).

Nothing as strict as paleo? :D I would have laughed at it for minutes if I were there. What about raw vegan, zerocarb, vegan paleo? Hey, even my almost-vegetarian almost-paleo is more strict!
I'd even say it must be easy eating meat :D And they could hate me all they want. I'm not a nice person though I don't think I'm very intolerant, especially regarding diets. And they shouldn't take me oh so seriously. Why can't people just discuss topics of diets in a calm way?

Oh I got carried away again.Sounds like yes and yes to me.  Keto flu from lack of salt.  Try drinking some broth, and also use No Salt or Nu Salt for potassium if you're not.  A magnesium supplement is also helpful.I guess I am fortunate that most people I interact with do not respond like they did. Instead I would expect questions like "What do you mean by strict?"  or comment "Not in my experience."  Especially when prefaced with "I'm not familiar..."  I'm definitely not used to someone taking up an immediate offense and striking out.  Have you tried Truvia Baking Blend instead of the Splenda Brown Sugar blend? It says to use half the amount of sugar that you would use. This is the same as what the Splenda Brown Sugar Blend box says. However, Truvia only has 32 grams of carbs in 1/3 cup instead of the 64 grams that Splenda Brown Sugar Blend has.

If it will work, then you could save 32 grams of carbs out of the recipe for a net reduction of 2.13 carbs per cupcake.

http://truvia.com/recipes/conversion_chartThis sounds good and so easy...  I do have some ground turkey in my freezer, I'll have to try it - thanks for the idea!  Oh, and congratulations on your fantastic progress :)I always like to put this into context like this:

83 lbs is almost 38 kg. That's 19 two-liter bottles of Coca Cola that's he's always been lugging around. Or nearly 10 standard US gallons of water. Or, you know those water cooler bottles (carboys), the ones that usually hold 19 liters or 5 gallons? That's _two_ of those in lost weight.

Imagine walking around in life carrying two full carboys with you everywhere.

Since starting keto, I've stopped carrying 4 gallons worth of weight with me everywhere I go.
Great tips here. I'll just add that alcohol can be part of a Keto diet (especially zero carb choices like gin), but it may slow down weight loss because your body deals with the alcohol before it gets to burning fat. I found that I didn't lose (although didn't gain either) those days I had an alcoholic drink or two.  But I know not everyone finds this - it may have had more of an effect on me because I am a small woman who didn't have much to lose (and in maintenance now). Also -- a body in Keto cannot handle liquor! Your tolerance will have dropped and hangovers are brutal. Stay hydrated.Wonderful job!  Congratulations to you!  :)Looks like the heavy carb hitters are:

* brown sugar splenda blend @ 64 grams
* almond flour @ 30 grams
* vanilla frosting @ 21 grams

Those three together account for 7.7 grams of the 9.2 total per cupcake.

Here's a Google spreadsheet that I made in case anyone wants to make a copy and experiment.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AN5QlMTvN49PZWy003UBSUVZ_6n_zPm0gUzPqlJ-Z3U/edit?usp=sharingNo they are, that's just a reference that gives you an idea of how much energy you get from the same amount of fat/protein/carbs BY MASS. What you see on the label is already accounted for this (though you will notice that smaller amounts of fat have lots more calories than a similar sized protein/carb). Again, you need to re-read.  I wasn't trying to educate them, but simply answer their question briefly and concisely.   I lost 2kg when I did an egg fast, and I was eating more than usual. It still didn't break my latest plateau :)NO
Two weeks is not a plateau.
Ask again in about 3 months ;)  Congrats!!! I bet that feels great! Mexican is hard because their food is VERY carb based. You might get away with a naked burrito (in a bowl) if you can specify the ingredients used. These kinds of people exist in every dietary group, unfortunately. Don't take it personally :)

I eat paleo/primal keto, and I don't see what's wrong with the OP's statement. I think paleo *is* less strict if you're looking at carbs. Ketosis is a very real limit (you're either in ketosis or not in ketosis). While paleo may naturally be lower carb than the SAD, it certainly doesn't restrict carbs in the same way someone on a keto diet must restrict carbs. Lots of paleo folks eat tubers, higher carb veggies, and fruit. Some even eat rice. Paleo is stricter in other aspects, so I guess I can see both sides.

But either way, getting p*ssed over keto is a bit silly.I don't know enough about how humans work but I have a hunch eating only fruits doesn't enough. I can't imagine that. Raw veganism seems to work, zerocarb seems to work, they are just complicated to do well in my eyes. Eating only fruits for a long time... Well, it seems dangerous to me. I'd love to read about it more but not so much I actively search for it :D It has nothing to do with me, I just love fruits - in tiny amounts and not all the time :)Try having some Bovril or broth if you feel drowsy around that time. You just need to up your electrolytes.Porridge

I also like to add strawberries, raspberries, blueberries or some carob depending on how I want it. Meal planning is the biggest help for me. If I don't have to think about or decide what to have for dinner I'm 100% more likely to stay on plan.Started IF last Thursday, lost 7.7lbs! Only thing I suggest is to keep something handy to up your electrolytes like some salt, boullion cubes you can mix with hot water or Powerade One which has 0 carbs. In my first day I was fine, but second day I started feeling dizzy, nauseous and my body aching all over. It helped drinking Bovril but until my body adapted, until day 4, I felt very weak. I wasn't hungry just needed elecytrolytes.After I bake them I throw them in a skillet with bacon grease and butter for 5-10 minutes until they are more pastalikeGet a Shatafa (Hand bidet). Your bum will love you. I just squirt a little water up there to lubricate the "pipes" and it works wonders.

Also, drink more water and make sure you take a Mg supplement. Probably been said already but heavy cream, coconut oil, almond butter, olive oil etc..I love vegetables and I'm worried about eating too little... But my diet is probably much more restrictive. Zerocarbers surely haven't this problem.
Why are you worried? Vegetables are great (not super healthy because nothing is that nowadays *sigh*).  At least in my not-expert-at-all eyes. It's a wonder I can limit them on keto but I love lowcarb ones too and I have a generous carb limit just because I depend on vegetables. I'm close to being a vegetarian and anyway, I LOVE them with a passion. Many people eats kind of much vegetables on keto, what would be the problem if it's not too much carb for them?From what I understand..., this diet basically killed Steve Jobs. I just finished making this, but with homemade Alfredo sauce and crab, it is really friggin good, thank you!Welcome back and I wish you luck! Eat yummy, healthy meals and get your ideal figure and have a lot of energy! :)

To me, keto is way cheaper than my usual almost paleo diet. And that was the same as my normal diet, despite some pricy and frequently used ingredients. We are very poor now and keto will make our costs less :D Especially if I can keep myself from eating too much erythritol every day :-/
I eat veggies and nuts and eggs and coconut oil and butter, they aren't very expensive (they might be, depends on the type).

I fell off the wagon myself (my keto life didn't last long but was great), stayed low-carb and lose a bit more weight... Very slowly and because of keto anyway. My diminished hunger stayed, I was able to eat at a deficit if I focused on it. But it was tiring, it was easier on keto. And I felt better on keto. Had more energy. I tried to come back but it was hard, there are so many kind of valid excuses why not exactly now.... Then I got angry and said I do it. Now. It's the worst possible time ingredients wise, and what? I love challenges (well there are a limit...), I will do it almost totally plant based in the first days if I must! So I'm here, reading stories, they are pretty encouraging. They makes my newborn decision stronger. I need that.I guess you didn't check the sidebar http://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscienceOh, indeed at least on the biological level. When I become a frothing, drunk-munchie-seeking cookie monster though is when it can be hard to toe the line of the straight and narrow. :DI have the opposite problem. I saute mine in Alfredo sauce and they get all soggy and make the sauce runny. Maybe I should try roasting. Some Paleos go to harsh extremes like eating raw intestine for gut flora, consuming only foraged greens, or refusing to eat any non-sprouted seed (including mustard and sesame).

I think anyone who heads down the path of a restrictive diet runs the risk of feeling constantly tormented, but also feels a sense of accomplishment over their extreme determination.

I think the most strict diet is fruititarians, who only eat raw fruits (in a way that doesn't kill the plant). They feel like they are constantly starving, no matter how much they eat.Beware, keto has a diuretic effect and too little sodium can raise blood pressure as wellFriend of mine is paleo and thinks I'm crazy limiting carbs to such a degree, has tried to tell me I'm going to die without carbs. Funny thing is he started paleo to reduce inflammation because of a back problem that paleo helps manage as he doesn't eat starches. He'd benefit from going even lower carb but is pretty adamant that you need to eat all the wonderful carby foods paleo keeps trying to add into the dogma.Get your veggies in and take Psyllium husk powder. Your asshole will thank you. Rememeber you only get one ass, take care of it. I think I'll just eliminate some sodium. And drink more water. Thanks. The formatting of your post looks good to me on my tablet. Welcome back! I'm all new here and stuff, doing a lot of what it sounds like you did. Trying to be part of a community where I found this big life upgrade called Keto. Being positive, being helpful if I can.

This subreddit is very active, and just everyday you see all these new to Keto posts. It is exciting in a way. Like this is an idea that is catching on or at least being made known. I wish I had heard of Keto earlier, or at the very least hadn't been so misinformed by the dogma of nutrition standards that exists from the political world (because it is politic$, not science-based). There is so much misconception and just outright wrong facts it could be really tough for someone coming into Keto. Personally I lurked and researched everything for about a month before diving in and yet, I'm still learning.

Best of luck, strength, and may your Keto budget be successful :)If you're worried consult your doctor. Well I'm a little bit concerned. I haven't nearly gotten 5000mg of sodium a day. I'm afraid if I add any more it could be hazardous. I don't eat salads at buffets because I have them at home, but I sure do eat a lot of meat.Tell her you have a horrible disease of the butt (like crohn's) that causes wasting, and well up with tears, then go silent.That's awesome, Chris!

Thanks for the Keto Chow, too, by the way. I am liking it better than People Chow in terms of flavor. Keep up the good work!Don't have any suggestions for the constipation beyond what has been said by others, but that figure for [iron is *way* off](http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/).

Men are recommended to get only 8mg/day, women 18mg/day, with the tolerable upper limit for anyone at only 45mg/day. So even if you meant to say 100mg/day rather than 100g that is still over double the maximum safe dosage, and will be problematic for you. Follow the guidelines, see if that helpsThis is exactly what I do every time I try to cheat!This.  The cashew milk is amaaaazing.You get to enjoy more veggies :) I have this exact stuff and yes it's 8.7g "bad" carbs per 100g.

However- I use a tablespoon which is only about 5g in soy milk and make milkshakes, or in minute muffins for cakes- it's a small amount so the carbs are negligible. Unless you're planning on eating the whole box then you should be ok to use it no problem!Thanks for writing this post.

I'm new to keto. Sugar was one of the things that I thought to table and figure out later because there's just so much too read and it gets confusing because there's nothing clear cut, just opinions.

I want an erythritol sweetener. Done. I agree. IF is a much more pleasant way to eat. I'll take a nice sized satisfying meal over a bunch of snacks any day, and feel way less hungry.It's a bit crazy in my case. On keto, I don't crave sweets. (Just fruits, sometimes.) They are just comfortable and my SO needs them. He loves sweets and he actually eat desserts to get enough calories... Sometimes their role is the same for me. Or keep myself to eat too much carbs. I almost think we cut too many food groups...
And it's a stubborn habit! I ate sweets all my life. I decide I won't eat desserts, I don't need them, after all. And the next thing I realize I do some. It just happens. I want to try out an interesting recipe, my SO needs it, I just wanted to put these together, totally not a sweet thing... But it would be yummier if sweet, yep, it totally needs that. I love coffee and cocoa but they are hard to use without a sweetener. My old sweet tooth must be angry and sabotage me. I don't like to use self discipline when I eat (I just respect my own decisions if I'm aware) so I'm vulnerable.Only difference is that you have slightly more flexibility than you thought you did. There's no harm to super-low-carb (e.g. 10 grams instead of 20), but not much benefit that I've heard of either.

Don't spend those extra 10 grams all in one place! ;-)Congrats on your SV!

I just started IF yesterday (haha) but not as drastic as you. I usually need something by about 13:00 or so or I get drowsy. It just suits my natural eating habits so much more. You have kind of inspired me to bump up my fasting window though, maybe I'll give it a shot this weekend.

Have fun with the rest of your conference, and enjoy food not being the boss of you. :)And fiber for digestion if one benefits from it.The 90%+ Lindt bars are made with Dutch-processed chocolate,  which strips them of the flavonoids and makes them bland IMO. I eat dark chocolates for the bitter flavour, dammit!

I nibble on Ghirardelli 100% instead. Pure bliss.I'm a [Venn diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) guy. I think of Paleo and Keto as overlapping Venn diagrams. You can do Keto diets that aren't Paleo, and Paleo diets that aren't Keto, and plenty of diets are both at once.

As for more strict? With Keto, it seems like there is one simple rule: eat few enough carbs (likely 20-40) for your body to remain in Ketosis. That's pretty straight forward! Get a blood meter if you want to double-check that you are doing it right. With Paleo, there are all of these arguments about what food Cro-Magnon man had access to, and whether modern beef still qualifies or if you have to hunt venison, and there's no simple test to see how you are doing. On strictness, I can see the argument going either way.You know, I probably would have said the exact same thing. So, thanks for the heads up! People can really surprise you in how passionate and reactional they get over their own diet protocols. Not all people, of course, but yesh. You did your best to stay cordial, that's the best anyone could do. KCKOFlaxseed - egg pizza base ( takes 3 minutes to make)
Mix 2T flaxseed, 2 T grated cheese, 0.5tsp Baking powder, dash paprika, 1T water, 1 T olive oil, 1 egg. Spread out on a 8" plate and microwave 2 mins. Then flip it over onto parchment sheet, smother with favorite pizza toppings a bake in oven for 10 - 15 mins.Welcome back. You definitely are not alone in losing 45 pounds and then gaining it all back. I did the exact same thing except I lost 45 and gained back 50 before starting again. Now I've lost 55 since the restart. I'm where I was about 5 years ago. I've been much more strict about it this time and not allowing myself to make excuses to cheat.

I hope that you find enough good here to come around from time to time.Well no knowledge of a subject sure sounds like a good way to start a disagreement. Just as I'm sure it annoys you when people spout off incorrect stuff about Keto, the same is true for Paleo folks. You're being too modest! You did carry the weight well beforehand but it's never too early to start eating healthy. :DThe super crazy thing is that after she went on and on about "you're more beautiful when you smile," she made a big scene about something (I don't even remember what it was... something work related though) and literally ran out of the building sobbing and didn't come back for the rest of the day. I'm just not sure about her.This just means that you've been eating fewer carbs than what you could have been eating. There's no requirement to eat carbs. You could do okay even if you ate zero carbs.

The main reason to eat more carbs is that it allows you to eat more vegetables which could give you more beneficial micronutrients.This looks so good. I actually made coconut flour pancakes   (Tspn of trivia in the mix) a bunch recently - cooked in coconut oil and then I buy sugar free syrup. These sound awesome too! That... is so clever. Accept and continue rather than letting the conversation stagnate at the comment. I like it!!Here are the screenshots from MyFitnessPal! Sorry they're iPhone screenshots. These are of course total carbs not counting fiber and the frosting isn't counting sugar alcohols-- I already did that math for you guys LOL. The apple sauce comes from HEB/Central Market (a grocery store here in Texas).

Brands that got cut off in the screen shots are Torani (caramel syrup), 365 Whole Foods (butter), and So Delicious (coconut milk).

http://imgur.com/a/PUhXn I hope this helps!Ahh, the "I" language. It is a brilliant thing. Our call center works with health insurance, so we're actually specifically trained to refer to the company/ourselves rather than the customer when there is a concern, especially because it's such a sensitive topic to begin with.

Generally speaking, I genuinely love when somebody notices. It reminds me that I AM making progress however slowly... I just don't need someone to notice 3-4 times a day, lol.

I appreciate your suggestions :)No personal experience with/knowledge of Paleo - just repeating what I've heard from people who switched over.  Well no real history of hypertension. History of some white coat syndrome other than that none. The only thing I've been doing is drinking water. I Haven't been following the guidelines. I'ma check those out. I'm a hedonist. Feeling well is basic for me. And I HATE breakfast. I have several years of experience. If I have breakfast, it's bad. If I don't, cool. I feel soooooooo way better without it! So my choice is very obvious (I couldn't even force feed myself if my brain wanted! my other parts would fight against it. I have an anti-hunger, anti-desire towards food in the morning. I CAN'T eat. And I don't wanna. I don't need. I have more energy without it. I would get hungry. It would be so silly :D)
And there are zillio people who has great results without breakfast anyway. As for me, I don't care, there are people who has great results using steroids. I want to give my body the lifestyle and diet it prefers. Our love and communication is nice and I plan to keep that.

I'm NOT an average person from the statistics. I'm unique. I don't work like the statistics think.
Some people need breakfast, some people are fine with or without it, it's wrong and feels bad for some people  and there are ones who gets really unwell, almost really sick if they eat a breakfast. Of course, diet matters a lot.As I said, I don't know a thing about Paleo, only repeating what I've been told by keto-ers switching over.

"To have someone come and say how easy it's been to drop weight, etc, is construed as inconsiderate."   Ummm, perhaps you need to re-read my entry,  I never said that.&gt; I realize that there are billions upon billions of dollars wrapped up in these lies, and those people and organizations will go to great lengths to make sure that this outdated knowledge is kept in place.

I am sure this is part of it. In addition, my experience with big companies has taught me that it is an *enormous* amount of work to get people to change. Left to themselves, most people will keep doing the same things.

The nutrition professors have a text book that they know. They have class notes that they are comfortable with. They have quizzes and tests already prepared. To do something **new** would be hard work! Plus, most teachers are not researchers in the field. They are likely to wait until "the authorities" recommend change, and we know how well that's going.

So even without oodles of money in lobbying, I wouldn't expect fast change.Eat. Eat before you make bad decisions.Cheers to that! And I know she understands at least to some extent. She has pretty bad scoliosis, and one of her shoulders is significantly larger than the other as a result. She's mentioned to me before that she's super conscious of it... although I never noticed until she drew my attention to it. It would be super rude of me to be like "HEY! Your shoulder looks pretty straight today! Did you do something different!??" and while that's kind of an extreme example it's the same kind of idea. Wow that's crazy!! I don't think I've ever been so close to someone that they would be offended if I made a decision like that without them. It's good that she was able to have that discussion with you, and tell you what upset her and why.

I also think that my sup is trying to be positive, in her own way... I don't know whether it's that she's treating me the way she would want to be treated (she does like attention....) or if she simply has never had someone in her life lose a noticeable amount of weight. I try not to let it get under my skin in a serious way, but I just don't know how to handle her.

You make a great point though - if she feels like she might be triggering me by bringing up my weight all day every day perhaps she'll slow her roll some, lol. Thank you!About the fat/calories part, you're saying that the calories listed on nutritional facts aren't final yet? That we still have to equate protein and fat to get the final calorie value?Sadly I do not. I really should get one. I've been loving all the things I can do with spaghetti squash.I totally see that. A lot of people are used to seeing me bigger so I often get the comment, "I can't imagine you losing any more!" and really the only thing to say to that is either, "I'm only half way there!" which may concern people, or "don't worry, I'm being healthy."

I have rehearsed my lines many times ;)Oooh, Makes sense.I generally don't have a problem being complemented. I am proud of what little I've accomplished (20 pounds on a tiny frame does make a difference) and I'm proud that people are starting to see. But she knows she's already brought it up... today, yesterday... 45 minutes ago. It's not THAT striking of a difference yet that it should be the only thing she can think about when she's talking to me. I am not my weight.I almost never fit female stereotypes, I just like fresh raw stuff, well my darlings are vegetables, I really, really love them. My boyfriend is the real fruit lover :) He keeps a lot of apples in the house all the time and it's winter (I miss some vegetables) and they are lovely... But I don't touch them because of this tiny reason, my dedication is harder. Okay, I touched them today but I barely have vegetables at the moment and I ate 10g apple, it's way harder than not eating any though...

Sometimes I wonder about fruit. My body shouldn't need it. But sometimes (not today) it just wants it. It's not like just a craving for sweets (I love cocoa, I eat it a lot but I'm pretty sure I could live without it), it's something basic. It's like real, strong thirst. it's like hunger when I haven't eaten in the last 4,5 dats. I need it. I must have it. Probably because I never was on keto for long enough to fully adapt. I feel I don't need the sugar in it, I even feel it's too much sugar for my body when I eat half an apple. I need freshness, juicyness... It's one reason I try to eat enough raw vegetables in its juicy form, not dehydrated.She does get right up in my face with it, too. I usually just make some excuse to leave the pod, but eventually I will always have to come back. I can only be gone for so long, haha. I'll try to just brush it off without trying to respond and see how that goes!For some complements it seems awkward to agree. "You are the nicest person!" Don't answer: "Yes, I think so too."

But for complements about more objective topics, like losing weight, it sometimes feels less weird to just agree rather than accept the complement. "You have really lost a lot of weight!" Some how if I say, "Yes, I'm happy with my progress," it seems to take the conversation to a different place. Like the two of us together are noticing this thing that happened, rather than they are pointing me out.

I don't know if this is just a quirk in my own psychology or what.I think I was afraid of fat when I first started.  I mean, its really calorie dense.  It took me a couple of tries getting back on the wagon to finally say fuck it.  So my advice is, "don't be afraid of fat".  Don't go nuts on it either, because it IS calorie dense, but don't be afraid of it either.  It really does help with satisfaction.I totally understand, I wanted to try the IF to jump start my progress and see how it goes.

I started on Sunday and to be honest, after eating these kinds of foods, I've found that when I do get hungry, I look at the clock and cant believe how long its been since I ate last.
Which is a huge difference from last week when I ate because "I woke up" or Its 12:00 time for lunch" and if I missed those meals I would definitely feel it.

I'm loving this diet and I really feel like it could be a lifestyle change that I can stick too.Well it was just an example I guess, but there's no way that eating 35 eggs and 5 pounds of bacon a week could be good for you, even if it might help me lose weight how could my heart handle that?

Because yeah, ideally to start off I would just be very boring and eat the same thing over and over again that I knew put me within my limits.  But I can't eat bacon and eggs 3 meals a day and expect it to be healthy, I gotta try and balance portions with content or I'm just going to end up going from one extreme to the other I bet.Ugh, she sounds awful. Ignoring you after you called attention to her passive aggressive-sounding comments? I've had supervisors like this and I consider them to be immature and manipulative. Do your thing and pay no attention to her. Sorry, this was purely hypothetical. I love vegetables, but I'm worried about eating too many.As a child I thought all cocoa powder was sweetened cocoa powder, and got a terrible surprise when I mixed some unsweetened powder into a glass of milk. But now my own kids are eating very dark chocolate with me, and although they obviously enjoy regular milk chocolate, and sometimes will comment about "that really bitter stuff", they still always want a taste of it.
I would go with 45% as just a ballpark estimate Yep. I've been lifting for 5 months now. And thanks for the kind words.No problem.  Take what I say with a grain of salt, I'm no expert :)

Honestly after not quite intentionally doing the IF thing for a few months, it's pretty hard to break 1700ish calories a day without doing something like drinking an entire pint of heavy cream or loading up on delicious, evil potatoes.I'm 6'5 the road been a little bumpy. But I learned don't let a a bad day turn into a bad weekMy favorite site for product recommentations is [wirecutter.com](http://thewirecutter.com/).

[Here](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-bathroom-scales/) is what they say. I bought one and am quite satisfied.No, but you also don't necessarily need fiber supplements. Thanks. Please include the brands too since then people can go for your exact recipe if they can find the brands.I was eating lunch today when one of my coworkers said "you've lost some weight". I said yes, I have. I sat down to eat. I had a salad from home (spinach, some ground beef, spouts, cheese and a dressing) along with a bowl of steamed spinach (from the cafeteria). One of our coworkers asked me what I was doing, I said "no longer eating stuff that isn't good for me". She dug in more, then said "oh, Atkins". I said yeah, sorta, just modified.

People get atkins, not too many get keto. My doc does, the docs I work with do, as does a nutritionist that I know.It is possible to follow a ketogenic diet without eating vegetables. As you stated, the main things you'd miss out on are dietary fiber and micronutrients including vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals.

If your main reason to avoid vegetables is that you don't like the taste and texture, you can work around that problem by blending them into a puree / paste and including it in a protein shake. Use cocoa powder and cinnamon to make it taste okay. To do this, you'll need a powerful blender such as a Vitamix or Blendtec. Your typical home blender doesn't make a very uniform and fine puree of vegetables.

This seems consistent with the point that Gary Taubes likes to make. The 3500 cal/lb theory may be correct in the level of physics, but it isn't very useful for understanding what is actually going on in the biochemistry of living people.

What if you trim 500 calories from your diet, but your body responds by metabolically slowing down 700 calories worth? What if different macros make it more or less likely for your body to do this? What if your eating *history* makes it more or less likely for your body to do this?

My sense is that science is still at early baby steps for these kinds of questions.Thanks Oranges13, Noted about the carbs! Thats a great thing Follow the FAQ electrolyte guidelines. Water without salt doesn't work. Eat the meatIF is also a really great way to prepare for keto.I feel like not everyone will have an EXACT same breakdown of carbs per ingredient as I had because some brands have a lower or higher amount of carbs depending on what brands are available to you. As soon as I get the chance, I'll provide you with a breakdown of my own!

And I completely agree with you. I tried going for more coconut flour and less almond but the result was awful and pretty much inedible. I wish I had taken a picture. The consistency was terrible, flavor wasn't so bad. But I'd rather have no cake than eat what I made that day LOL. It came to a point where I'd rather take the plunge and ration my carbs just to have this cupcake, in all honesty. Ok. When you broke it down like that, it totally makes sense now.

Thanks for help!
I am in respiratory therapy school and on clinic days when i am running all over the hospital and not sitting down for hours and hours, my weight is very apparent to me when every part of me, especially my feet, hurt like hell. When a code blue or a rapid response is called and I have to sprint to the other side of the hospital up 3 flights of stairs, I can physically feel my weight pulling me backward. Knowing this will be my career and that I need to be physically fit to do it it a major motivation. That being said, I am 40 lbs down and can totally tell the different when I'm climbing stairs.

There's also the fact that I have PCOS and my dad has diabetes.

I am only 24 and have been huge my whole life, and I want to look good and be able to do all the things a 24 year old should be able to do.

Shouldn't be hard. Eat a big salad and a bunch of steak. Yeah, IF is intermittent fasting.  I don't know how others do it, but I usually sleep during a large portion of those hours.  Four hours before sleep, eight hours asleep, and then four hours after sleep is sixteen hours without calories coming in.  You just have to get used to doing that, I guess.  I don't usually get hungry for hours after I wake up unless someone shoves food in my face.

1500-1700's pretty easy once you get used to eating only a little every day.  Low carb/keto helps with that, because most of the calories you'll be getting are high in protein and fat, which means they fill you up faster and keep you feeling full longer.

Not sure about the other stuff, I'm still a newbie myself :)OK, I see how that appears very contradictory. I obviously didn't word that correctly. Apologies!


What I meant was, I really do not enjoy your typical *^green ^salad* types such as : tomato, cucumber, radishes, spring onion etc.

I do however enjoy cooked veggies like the cauli, broccoli, spinach, asparagus, that sort of thing (which from the sounds of it, actually has a good amount of carbs :(


From tomorrow I will try cutting some of the veg out, and alot of the dairy. Again, I thought I was already over doing it from the meat side of things, but after what every1 is saying I will increase the protein intake.


Thanks guys!Drink some broth made from bouillon or homemade soup. Use more salt. Take magnesium and potassium supplements. The Keto FAQ says how much. If that doesn't help, try eating a bit more protein and fat.

Other things that can help include a tablespoon of coconut oil or MCT oil in your coffee, tea, or soup.What is the net carb breakdown by ingredient? I may have some ideas after seeing that.

One thing to try is using a little more coconut flour so that you can use less almond flour. It seems that coconut flour absorbs more liquid per unit measure than almond flour does. For example, doubling the coconut flour amount may allow you to cut the almond flour in half (just making examples up since I don't know for sure how extreme the effect would be)."[G]eneric equivalent of centrum silver"  --  be aware that store brands of herbal supplements are being investigated by the FDA for failure to meet their label specifications.  Quality control for generics, particularly those made outside the US is iffy.  And, there is no way for you to tell if you are getting the vitamins you pay for.It depends on how quickly you want to lose weight.  I keep carbs under 15 g a day, sometimes just under 10. Yes, it could be due to electrolyte imbalance. Are you supplementing with potassium, magnesium, and eating enough salt? See the Keto FAQ for details on amounts.

It may help to increase your protein slightly.

Also, it can help to eat a tablespoon of coconut oil or MCT oil when just prior to when you normally get these headaches. That will provide your brain with some more energy.Increase salt and water intake.Avocado, spinach, mushroom, fish, yogurt; lite salt or no saltDo you have a history of high blood pressure?  Did you have caffeine beforehand? Did you sit down and rest beforehand? Are you following the electrolyte guidelines in the FAQ? What are your meals like?

What is your protein macro goal?

Meat - fish, chicken, turkey, beef, pork; fish - canned, freshPlease do! It's so worth it. And if you end up making substitutions, share it with me. I'm always looking for ways to improve. :DThey are counterproductive long term. For now I would not eat any higher than 40% deficit and ideally not 30% deficit.

The estimated maximum deficit is 31 kcal/lb body fat but I certainly wouldn't push that limit. thatd be a really interesting blog post to read about the comparisons of making your own seed milks5 net split across all of those cupcakes isn't much.

I love carrot cake! I will try this for my birthday which is coming up later this month.I love IF :) Glad it's working out for you&gt; Don't rely on the stats in My Fitness Pal. They aren't accurate about half the time.

Eh.  I mean, you gotta track, so you track using the tools available.
The accuracy of any individual item in the MFP is less important than the practice of consistent tracking over time.Unfortunately, I tried using light olive oil and sunflour oil in two separate tests, it doesn't give the moisture, true cake texture, and flavor. With the brand I use, half a cup of organic apple sauce adds 5g net carbs to the recipe. I tried doing my best to cut out and substitute ingredients to make this as low carb as possible while trying to do minimal damage to taste and texture. Unfortunately, apple sauce was not one of these things. :( Thank you for the suggestion, I appreciate it greatly! I'm absolutely willing to tweak this recipe further in the future with your suggestions! I just take a daily multivitamin to ensure that I am covering my bases.Do you lift? I looked wayyyy fatter at 195 than you do and we have similar body and age stats. Congrats man, looking good. and frankly, eating 1500 calories in a sitting is way fun =)&gt; my body was not used to the increased amounts of fats i was eating

Had a coworker spike my crock pot with castor oil ... now *that* was an unexpected increased amount of fat! :-ODon't wear your seatbelt, it's like planning for an accident!Have you had a look in the stickied post?Especially with pork rinds.  Those fuckers add up quick :-/I'd call your Doctor.  As I recall, my wife needed a stool softener along with her prenatal vitamins.  Given your diet and other answers, this might be necessary.The metaphor I like is, "If you dropped your phone on the ground, you wouldn't then jump on top of it, would you?"Now, it's white :D Maybe a wee bit gray but basically white. Surprising, I know.
I've read you can make milk from every oily seeds. I tried some. I couldn't drink sesame milk, it was horribly bitter. I love walnuts but walnut milk was strange for me, I just add a bit into my coconut milk.The 10 lbs you lost in the last 4 days is likely mostly water weight and won't affect your body fat percentage. Right, but because it only measures *excess* ketones in the urine and *none* of the ketones in the blood, a newbie could be in ketosis but still show blank on the 'stix, which could make them discouraged.I would probably cut the skin off- it goes a bit rubbery.I think the term "strict" and the implications of a lack there of are probably what set the person off. Keto and Paleo aren't strict vs less strict. Paleo has rules... Keto does not have rules per se. Keto is short for Ketosis, which is a state your body can achieve/exist in. Paleo is not a state of your body. Going forward, I wouldn't refer to one or other as more or less strict. Paleo does allow for more carbs, but doesn't allow a lot of artificial stuff people on Keto eat. It's just perspective as to "strictness" and I'm sure that felt like an insult to the crazier of the two people. Suck it up, write it down, every bite.

I already knew that writing down my intake worked automatically in the past, I just did not want to do it.  I was on this upward trend that I couldn't shake, and then found out I needed (as in, prescribed) 6 grams of fat/day for brain function.  That made the upward trend worse.  I stated messing with keto recipes, and tried "lazy keto" which worked to put me in maintenance, not loss, mode.  When I gave in and started writing down my macros, the weight loss started.

Simple.  Annoying.  Works.To piggy back on this comment. Do not fall into the trap of "in for a penny in for a pound."


Oops... you accidentally had regular soda instead of diet. Or - Damn I slipped and had some wheat toast or a whole wheat bagel because I was weak. I guess my day is ruined, might as well goto hell with myself, right?

WRONG.


Don't indulge because you caught yourself cheating once. Don't throw out the rest of that day or weekend or whatever because of it.

Treat it as a non-issue and just keep calm and keto on.yah. every time i get drunk i end up ordering a pizza. fortunately i'm not an alcoholic and eating a whole pizza just sets me on cyclical keto for a couple of days.Weird. Paleo people are generally pretty easy-going about it. It sounds like at least one of these two was trying to be some sort of martyr to their diet. The odd thing is that most paleo dieters eat pretty low carbs of they're trying to lose weight, and are pretty open to the whole ketosis thing.It's true. You'll be amazed at what size a portion actually is. It varies quite a bit for women. You can check out /r/xxketo if you want more info on it.

My personal experience is that my PMS is a bit easier to handle, my cravings for iron are higher (or I'm more in tune with them perhaps), cramps and bleeding seem the same, I'm hungrier just before I bleed and I have more cravings then too, and my cycle has lengthened a little (from 25 to 27 days), which I am really happy with.

Nice, man. Keep it up. I did my first attempt close to your age and the little stalls messed me up a bit. Keep up the hard work, it will be worth it.Don't rely on the stats in My Fitness Pal. They aren't accurate about half the time.

If you cheat, you're going to feel like shit. It's actually a good deterrent not to.

It's going to feel weird eating things like bacon, butter, mayo and cheese if you were brought up that low-fat is the way to diet. It's a little hard to believe you can eat those things and lose weight. It's not just that though - eating those fats is what helps you to succeed on this diet. Track your calories so you don't go over, but plan to utilize the fat. It really makes you feel satiated and it's what has enabled me so much success with keto over low-fat dieting.

I like to skip breakfast and use my calories for lunch and dinner. I'm generally not hungry in the morning - but once I eat something, I find I'm hungry regularly after that. So, it's best if I just wait and have an early, larger lunch.

Embrace low-carb veggies. You can steam them and then saute them in a hot pan with some good butter so they brown up a little. (add kosher salt and pepper). So good. Yeah the content of the post says "[removed]" for me, as well. No picture links.I don't know, I think a few (maximum 5) weeks? You are right, it's not much time but it had some effect on my hunger and calorie intake already, I think I subconsciously thought it can't get any more better for me, I extrapolated using my expriences too... Oh. Maybe it's... possible? I can't want to figure it out! :) I feel silly now. I  restarted keto and I try to stick to it this time.
I definitely entered ketosis, there were pretty obvious signs, so many things happened, mostly good ones. In the first week I ate my usual amount of calories. I got used to keto, it got easier and a few weeks later my calorie intake dropped a few hundred calories, it was amazing. (When I fell off the wagon, my hunger stayed the same for months and I continued my slow weight loss.)
But even if less calorie is enough, I still had to focus to make sure I don't consume more, it's very easy to eat a few more fat bombs or drink 1-2 more coffee with butter (I actually banned them at some point)... I'm not used to weight-loss diets, I like freedom. I need a method that automatically makes calorie deficit possible. Keto is the biggest part of it but I need more.
(Being 145lbs and sedentary definitely doesn't help. It was easy when I was bigger, 80g carbs did the trick. I lost about 40 pounds but my body wanted its usual calorie intake, if I just ate as little I could, it was 2000 kcal. When I wasn't that strict, it was a bit higher. High-carb would be worse. This behaviour of my body has benefits, gaining weight is pretty hard for me and I can't get over 180 pounds without force feeding myself. But I want and definitely need to be thinner.)You should make the peanut butter pancake recipe on ruled.me! I make half a serving nearly every morning for breakfast.

http://www.ruled.me/peanut-butter-pancakes/

They use a home made low carb syrup, but I can't find some of hte ingredients, so I use a couple tbsp of reddi whip instead. 2 tbsp has like 1 carb, so even if I use like 4 tbsp, it's only like 2 carbs.

I've also used stevia and cinnamon as a no carb topper and turned it into a cinnamon type of uh.. thing.

Sometimes I'll add an extra tbsp of almond flour in as well. Almond flour is way more expensive for me though so I use it more sparingly.

I noticed the batter can be runny sometimes as well. So it's good to have xanthan gum on hand.

As a 6'1" guy, I can't wait to get down to 255! I got down to 270ish before and I felt amazing.

Am going to try this tonightThank you.Lentils over rice? two things I don't believe shouldn't go together.The sidebar is funny and so are some top posts. However, it went from being absurdly frugal to unrealistic . Frugal means getting more for your money.  When they take a picture of dog feces and title it "dinner," that's not being frugal. You would never eat dog feces and if you did, you'd likely spend more money on medical bills. It also gets old when every comment section reduces down to calling someone a "fatcat" or debating over who spent less caloriesvery nice. I can see lots of variations on this too, such as goat cheese instead of feta. Also, if someone isn't to keen on the lemon juice, they could use a bit of chicken broth to prevent the potato from being too dry. It's vegetarian, and not kidney beans.  There isn't an unsafe temp at which to eat it as long as you store it in an airtight container.I react strongly to sugar, so YMMV. I feel just as sick after eating delicious baked beans, as I do after eating a candy bar. Sometimes if the rest of my meal is slathered in butter I'm okay, because fat has effect on how the sugar is absorbed by the body. But protein and carbs don't help me out personally. But to each their own. I wish I could eat baked beans every single day though... one of my favorite foods actually!If you love chickpeas, you might like this recipe: http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/linguini-zucchini-chickpeas-recipe  I've made it a few times, once I added mushrooms and it was great too. That's the first time I'd used chickpeas as anything but hummus. Now I eat them as a salad topping too. I'm not in the US, ymmv.Number 4! Sorry, where I come from it's a toastie maker![1. Toaster over?](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71mdsLdw2-L._SL1500_.jpg)

[4. Sandwich toaster?](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71aoxQGalzL._SL1500_.jpg)Sweating involves adding salt early.  The salt brings moisture out of the onions.Yeah, it's all about setting up taste expectations for me.  People kept telling me to try spaghetti squash with pasta sauce because spaghetti squash "tastes just like spaghetti!"  Well, no, it doesn't, not even close.  If people had said, "Try spaghetti squash with pasta sauce, it's delicious!" then I wouldn't have been unhappy with the result because I would have expected a squash flavor.Anecdotally (and subjectively), it does wonders for me. I find that when I drink around 3L (or more), I feel better and more awake, am better able to focus, and snack less. And of course, water is free and won't hurt your teeth. You might feel a bit ridiculous with how often you run to the bathroom, though.that is correct. It's more of a mock tuna/ egg salad though if you add mayo there is technically eggs in it(from the mayo).True that. I feel the same way when people say mashed cauliflower is just like mashed potatoes. If you eat mashed cauliflower expecting it to taste like mashed potatoes, you're going to be disappointed. But if you eat it thinking they're buttery garlic mashed cauliflower you may be pleasantly surprised. It's similar texture and color but the taste is very different. This question comes up quite a bit:

Once this is added in the comments, send the mods a PM. Thanks!That looks like it would be great with tortilla chips on the side - for scoopin'.

Thanks for sharing!It is Chachies brand.Anyone have an ideas as to how to make this a crockpot recipe?Do you guys have macros for this recipe? It would be very helpful. Thinking some greek yogurt mixed in would be good too.How are the farts?Canned meats can be healthy, just read the ingredients and make sure there's nothing in there that you don't want. I eat a ton of sardines when I road trip. Hardboiled eggs hold up pretty well too, and of course, jerky is shelf stable. Now if you want to go really out there, you could look into making pemmican. It's one part tallow (rendered beef fat) and one part dried beef. You can mix it all up together and package it into bricks. It is shelf stable as long as it doesn't get exposed to excessive heat or light (cooler bag would be sufficient), and it's complete nutrition (all vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, etc...). You have to be very vigilant about drying the beef properly, and it is usually recommended that you use grass fed beef or wild game over grain fed animals (better levels of beta carotene, better ratios of omega 3/6 fatty acids), but I don't know if that actually matters if you are not going to be living off the stuff 24/7/365.If you've only ever used tuna from a can...try tuna from one of the little pouches. It's only like $1.55 around here, and you get one sandwich's worth out of it. They're usually flavored, and I layer some pickles on top and have it just as is. Super good!I have been sprouting lentils. Love having fresh sprouts in the middle of winter!Can't we just call it a mashed chickpea salad? Chickpeas don't taste anything like tuna or eggs, and mayo isn't that much of a miracle worker.My boyfriend would hate everything about this recipe except the spinach lol&gt; and more expensive too.

I find 10-12oz bags at Dollar Tree, doesn't seem unreasonable.Excellent post. I make a similar recipe, very frequently. The meat and vegetables can be varied a lot, this recipe is such a good way to go through some fresh vegetables before time to clean them out of the fridge. Last week's curry included carrots, celery, bell pepper, mushroom and spinach that were fresh, and diced tomatoes and bamboo shoots that were canned. So easy to whip this together.

I also brown whatever meat just a small amount, remove from the pan, then add onions and curry paste, adding the meat back in once they have softened a bit, then continuing with the other ingredients afterward. A good curry has some varied mouthfeel on the vegetables, even some crunch. For those making this, be careful not to overcook, and to ensure you put soft vegetables in last.

Great post, /u/PabstyLoudmouth!I kind of like that idea, thank youIt is very bizarre. She says the smell lingers for days. I can't smell it but she can.Shallots no, fennel and celery are fine, never tried leeks on her. Thank you!beans and rice. I make a big pot of rice, then get a couple of cans of beans. It's boring on it's own, but it's easy to add all kinds of stuff to (like salsa, guacamole, or just about any sauce, really). If you want to be even cheaper cook the beans yourself. You can also live off of a combination of lentils, beans and potatoes, too, but I haven't tried that myself.Never met anyone who couldn't tolerate onions but still like garlic!I like putting a little lime juice, red pepper flake, pepper, and a touch of salt on baby carrots.You know you can Save things on Reddit too?I dont know how to edit but I should probably add that by toastie machine I mean sandwich toaster.Hit it with fire at the end. I reverse sear most of my meals that i put effort into and it works so much better. Less gray banding as well with the red meats. Greek yogurt with some chocolate whey powder in it is delicious and can have more than 30 grams of protein. Cottage cheese is also awesome, with yogurt or whey powder.

For snacks, I like Blue Diamond smokehouse almonds, roasted edamame, pumpkin seeds, mixed nuts, nut butters, and pickles.

For full meals I like spiced up lentils (eat in a bowl, use as filling, as a side-dish), vegetarian chili with black soybeans, and veggie burgers with hummus and feta in low-carb/whole wheat pita. Carb-balance Mission tortillas are amazing (and filling!) with nut butters, as wraps, or with burrito fillings. I have tempeh in my fridge waiting to be tried tomorrow, along with some extra firm tofu. Make sure to include a lot of eggs if you like em, and greek salad with some olive oil and feta is a very filling lunch that you can eat a lot of. Finally, don't be scared of all frozen foods. Soups, veggies, and [Amy's](http://www.amys.com/products) are all things I like to get from the frozen aisle.Shallots, fennel, leeks, or celery?Everyone's throwing in their suggestions but the only way I'd eat this is simmered with a tin of diced tomatoes.

I'll give it a go! Sorry just to clarify, you dont actually add egg or tuna to this do you?Just thinking about the pastey texture of this dish is making me lose my appetiteSounds yummy, thanks!TaggingI love doing a "grown up" Lunchables.  Crackers, deli meat (usually chicken or turkey), cubed/sliced/string cheese, and some sort of fruit. I usually also have a yogurt, especially when they're on sale at 10 for $5.  You can easily portion them out into individual containers for the week, or keep the food in the company fridge and assemble it each day.  yea, to caramelize themI have gas, but I think it is unrelated! Fine otherwise, no symptoms at all from this.Bought a 20lb bag from Costco last year. It's since expired, but they're still good. Working through them, one miserable, healthy pot at a time. Never again man. Man cannot live on lentils alone!I disagree with you. I think that's the reason why a lot of people don't like lean meats like chicken breasts. I just want any readers to know that low and slow isn't gospel.Oh my goodness, all of my favourite foods combined. I must try this sometime. Wow this looks pretty good, I'm def gonna try it next time I grocery shop.This is easily the best tasting variety of Bush's.  Haha, I love that sub.I personally don't wash chicken breasts, as that is an easy way to spread bacteria and there is no reason to. I usually buy my chicken in bulk and freeze, so when I'm using them, I let it thaw a bit then cut while it's still semi-frozen.

But if you don't freeze yours, no worries, just a suggestion. Ha, aw man I need to drink more water. I'm always at about 2 bars below the red line. I barely drink any water, mostly soda, tea, some juice, and sometimes milk.http://www.wildrootsfoods.com/products/trail-mixes/coastal-berry-blend-trail-mix.html

My favorite snack. This meal is actually cheap and healthy.This looks great, going to try it but I'm adding bacon. You can make an egg salad/tuna taste by smashing chickpeas with mayo and make a sandwhich :)  it's a common "vegan tuna" recipe but it taste just like egg salad to me, it's so good. I add cut up pickles and tomatoes into it. My kid doesn't care much for sandwiches, so I often pack some small chunks of cheddar and/or a hard-boiled egg. Also included is a rice cake (kid loves them and used to use them instead of bread for peanut-butter and rice cake "sandwiches"), seasonal fruit, and granola bars or homemade oatmeal cookies. I sometimes include some cherry tomatoes or carrots, but those are hit or miss unless I pack guacamole for dipping. This might sound crazy, but what could I sub for the onion... Lots more garlic? My wife can not tolerate the smell of onions at all. It's weird as shit.Looks great, can't wait to try it!Apparently you're not familiar with the art of BBQ... anything.Thanks for this! I just made it tonight for dinner. Really simple and good. Cool, I didn't realize this was DIY either.  I might give it a try.
No need to use a microwave, thought it works.

If your water is evaporating add more and cook on a lower heat.Been a fan of mason jar meals. Easy to clean in the dishwasher and the right "lunch-size" container.

Salads, soups, pasta, and oatmeal for breakfast sometimes.

I've also been doing "pan" dishes lately. Shepards pie, lasagna. You just layer the ingredients in each jar, and bake in the oven for a little shorter than the normal 9x13 glass pan. Mason jars are strong enough for the oven.This recipe is amazing: [cumin wild rice &amp; quinoa](http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/2012/01/18/quinoa-black-rice-salad-with-cumin/).I am from New England, your approximation is about where my family's recipe is at. It doesn't taste all that sweet to me, but we're all tweaking on our syrup addictions so I guess that could be why. I have a kickass maple syrup beef marinade too.

And yes, pork definitely has to go in the baked beans.:)

haha it really isyes, it's a generalization. And there are exceptions. With vegetables though, generally it works. With meat, if you sear it it's a high heat, but then you can throw the meat in a slow cooker all day long and it'll be fine.Upvoting purely for the whack of common sense at the end rather than the prurient analogyAre you claiming that minute rice isn't easy?I think it would still taste good if you didn't use lentils and had it over rice instead :)No offense taken :) I've had a bag of lentils in my pantry for months and just started using them, they are actually pretty great, so I understand the hype

Edit: Also, thank you for introducing me to /r/frugal_jerk this shit is hilarious.Just commenting to bookmark. This looks amazing! If only my husband liked lentils. Oh well, lunch for me! it's a joke because they always talk about lentils is all. not hating on you or your recipe, it's a great idea, and i am probably going to try it.Is it still frugal jerking if I made it because I like how it tastes instead of because it's cheap?/r/frugal_jerk/Sure dude.  You gotta do you.Can it be the whole gram white I'm sure is really bad for me somehow but I prefer its taste?Check out the comment I posted. The stuffed potato itself is about 225 calories.Is it Kirkland?  I keep seeing the 2-pack of Kirkland salsa, but I haven't tried it yet.Is it really far to compare 24 grams of sugar, that comes with 28 grams of better carbs and 10 grams of protein with a candy bar. I'm also a IIFYM kind of guyI made a curry with lentils and tomato sauce the other day, I bet it would have been great with chickpeas. But I love chickpeas, I'd pretty much eat anything with them in it, haha.This is DIY. I got everything on amazon in 2 days. So this may not be the best way, but I have a really hard time getting them soft and this worked for me. Basically I combined my lentils with the appropriate amount of water (last time I made them I used 1 cup of lentils and 1.5 cups of water) stick them in a deep, microwave safe bowl, and microwave the shit out of them. My microwave is super small and shitty, so I microwaved them for 14 minutes twice, but I think for most people 14 minutes should be fine. This worked well for me because whenever I tried to cook them on the stove the water would evaporate quickly and the lentils would stick to the pan. There's probably an better way to do it though, haha.the mango peach salsa is delicious.  I am eating some right now.
Chickpea curry is seriously amazing. I would add a small can of tomato sauce, and serve over rice.Hmm, thanks for pointing that out. Cauliflower. There is a typo for the 1/4 cup; half is 2 TBS, not 2 tsp.Any ideas on a good broccoli substitute?

Try as I might, I just don't like broccoli.Whats the best way to cook lentils? Im going to trt this tonight.  Ive had cans of lentils for weeks but avoid cooking it because I never have and fear change.The reason I use frozen is that it lasts forever. I usually only go grocery shopping once a month, so I don't buy many things that won't store for a while. Plus I don't use it super often, I've had this bag since October I think. Helps keep down on food waste :)Here's another! I saved it a while ago and make it at least once a month. I usually use 4c chicken broth instead of water and bullion, and I throw it all in my rice cooker.

Edit: mobile link fail. Here you go

https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2ggqpu/lentil_and_brown_rice_taco_filling_tasty_and_less/You definitely want to do this. I'd cook them for 10-20 minutes until they're getting really golden (not caramelizing though). You could even blend them at this step, but ideally they'd be soft enough you don't need to. Try it, trust me.

Also, I personally hate frozen Spinach, never as good as fresh.. and more expensive too.
It's like making love, really. Sometimes you need to start slow, ease into it, don't move around too much, just let the energy start to build, and then hit it on high; thrust in with a wild jerking motion a few times to toss everything around and before it knows what's happening you've managed to kill the heat.

And sometimes it's like cooking, where you do whatever makes the most sense for the food you're preparing.A little creamier, just a tad sweeter.  Cashews and garlic work great together, I could probably just blend those together and eat it on crackers.never mind, i didnt realize there was a DIY soylent movementIsn't the waiting list on your order like six months? I've been watching from Canada for a couple of years now.How did you like it?Almond butter is worth a try.  He tried sunflower seed but didn't like that either.  I'm hoping, like you, he grows out of this.  I keep working on him.I've found that ethnic grocery stores have the cheapest vegetables &amp; also carry a great variety of strange, wonderful produce. It's worth seeking one out!I used a recipe with roasted pine nuts instead of walnuts. And like all awesome recipes I lost it :( but I found it initially by searching on the internet, so it's out there somewhere.Pinterest is your friend. Thanks for the feedback! I agree that the cauliflower part is a hassle without a food processor. Chopping it without making a mess of the kitchen is an art form that I haven't gotten down quite yet. I'm glad you liked the marinade!"Low and slow is the way to go"
Becomes impossible to burn/overcook anything as long as you pay some attention.Fair enough. My first thought also; browning cubed tofu for a little more texture. Would make it even cheaper and vegan if you're into that sorta thing.I don't think I've ever tried cold pasta with pesto.  Gives me something new to try out.Sounds good! I'm trying to break myself of the habit of cooking everything on high heat right now, haha.Has he tried any other nut butters? There's almond butter and cashew butter. Maybe with crackers instead of on a sandwich. I was a picky kid and liked cucumber sandwiches, though that's still light on nutrients. Pesto pasta can be served cold. I got out of my picky phase when I realized that garlic made everything better (for me). I think the sweetness of the onions would enhance the dish. it sounds pretty savoury as is and a bit of sweet could balance that out nicely.I generally find it brings out more flavour as well as a nicer texture. It's a slow process of caramelization, but you can stop well short of the onions actually caramelizing (when they turn transluscent this is known as "sweating" the onion).Being hungry isn't a bad thing. It can be annoying but as a vegetarian you'll need to adjust your expectations of how food makes you feel. Good vs. full. Not really advice but something to keep in mind. The key will be to more often. Sit down and eat 200 calories is lettuce. You won't be able to. You'll get full before that. But because your body can digest it faster you'll get hungry faster. Nuts, roasted chick peas, dried fruit, granola, cut up veggies and fruit are all things you could snack on. Even a protein shake could help your hunger or a protein bar. You said you gave up bread and that's good. It's easy with a vegetarian diet to fall into a carb trap and miss out on the "veggie" part of vegetarianism. Could also try quinoa instead of rice. In the end the cure isn't really about eating more but just eating more often. The most hardcore vegetarian I know who is also a runner basically eats constantly. I'm not as active so I stick to a pretty set schedule of protein bar for breakfast, a Kind &amp; Strong bar at 11, lunch at 2 and then dinner around 5:30. So I'm basically eating every three hours. When it gets warmer and m more active I'll probably bump it to every two hours. Find what works and don't be afraid of having your tummy grumble. The sides all sound great.  No salad but I can squeeze in cucumbers and carrots.  ThanksI'd be willing to try that, but I'm curious what the reason for it isHam  &amp; soups are good ideas.  Will add that to the list.

He hates both the peanut butter and the jelly.  It's just so strange to me to not like peanut butter!  I can't even imagine packing him a salad.  I would hear about that for the next 15 years. Hysterical.Also very high in iron which is really important for vegetarians and vegans.I don't think you want to really bring all the sweetness of the onions out on this dish, just relaese some of the flavour, which 5 mins is ideal for in my humble opinion anyway.I like it fried. Just dump the can out in a skillet and fry it in your oil or fat of choice. Salt and pepper to taste. Good for sandwiches or salads. If I may make a suggestion, try cooking your onions on a lower heat for longer.For someone not counting every micro nutrient, you can't beat the cost-to-nutrition of PB&amp;J (or fruit) sandwiches with whole grain bread. No specialty shops needed. There are no "empty" calories. Yes, there are some oils. Plant-based oils (unsaturated). Its an extremely efficient source of healthy (healthier, not healthiEST) calories for the price. Add some oatmeal and leafy greens, and whole day's needs are met (variety with the veggies and fruit is key, though). Cheap eating with no absolute need for cooking, unless you MUST have your oatmeal warm.[You until you get the hang of it]( http://i.imgur.com/4VECbpz.png)No problem! Even though I like spice, massaman is still my favorite. If you can get a big tub of the paste from an Asian market, it also makes a pretty cheap and filling meal. Protein, carrots, potatoes, onion, curry paste, coconut milk, roasted peanuts (optional), and serve over rice. Love! I make something very similar but use kale instead of spinach and top it with sliced almonds for a crunch! I've also made it with quinoa and cherry tomatoes as well.Check out mujadara as well, its fantastic and cheap!&gt; and calorie dense

That's what I'm talking about. Calorie dense and nutritious goes well with *cheap*, even though many seem to want to advertise that their recipes are so lacking in calories that they can only sustain you for one hour.http://www.copymethat.com/r/38H1GUm/ajandiacute_de_lentejas_bolivian_spicy_l/For hard boiling more than a few eggs at once you can stick them in the oven on 350F for 30 minutes. Then you just leave them in the fridge and grab them when you need. They should last a week or so :3Ah, lentils are amazing. If they're taunting, you spend a sunday afternoon making lentilburger patties and freeze 'em for single serving 'twixt sheets of wax paper. Yeah, you don't need more calories, just a greater mass of food that provides you with a decent balance of nutrients.(unless you were overeating, in which case it may be less)That does sound good, I'll definitely try it next time!I'd honestly avoid supplements. Better to try to eat a wide variety of things, paying casual attention to what nutrients they provide.*Dem ol' Beans-n-Rice.*

Fresh veggies and herbs... (ginger root is a fav of mine), remember that just because its vegetarian doesn't make something healthy.Go for vegetarian chili in a can. I eat that stuff all the time and it comes in a much bigger can, roughly the same price, and is way more filling.Haha, always nice to hear from someone with real experience.I can suggest adding a hit of chicken stock or veg stock at the end and simmering for a little bit. I like the change in texture and it serves well over a bit of rice!Well I don't know who taught you about loosing weight, but 1000 calories a day is unhealthy, most people are too heavy due to eating 2400 cal when they only use 2000 cal. Normal calorie intake for females are 1800cal and males 2400 cal, you seem to already be aware of this and as this is not a fitness sub so I'll move on.

**Loganbread**
*item 1  kg coarse wholemeal
*item 500 g wheat flour
*item 500 g bulgur (soake in water for 30 min)
*item 500 g of rye flour
*item 2 spoonful of salt.
*item 250 g of chopped almonds(or other nut)
*item 250 g of raisins (or dried fruit, chopped in raisin size)
*item 300 g of butter
*item 300g of sirup
*item 250g of sugar
*item 1 Liter of whole milch

Mix the dry ingredients. Heat the butter, syrup, sugar and milch in a pan, until  the butter and sugar is melted and hand warm approx 40 degrees C then mix the dry ingredients into the liquid mix. Put it in a baking pan the dough should have a height of about an inch more will increase the baking time, but give you a softer bread(actually slightly less hard), I will not recommend a thinner bread than an inch. Bake the bread at 180 degree celsius for 90 min. Take the bread out and slice it into 20-30 parts while it is warm as it is almost impossible to cut it when it has cooled down.

A little info: if you cut the bread into 20 parts each will have 750 calories for 30 it is 500 calories, you may want to cut the bread to more pieces than 30.

A little info 2: The bread is very hard, and kept in containers at room temperature they will keep for 2 weeks.

When I am on camping or out in the wilderness I have to carry everything including food which can be heavy, therefore loganbread is a big part of my meals in the wild.

edit gramma.Just made this yesterday.  It's basically a nice stew.

* 2-3 lbs of cubed chicken (I used skinless, boneless thighs; you could also use beef or pork)
* Half an onion, sliced
* Three new potatoes, cubed
* 1 cup of baby carrots, halved
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup
* 1/2 cup chicken stock (could also use other stocks, broth, or just water)

Throw it all in a crock pot and cook on low for 8 - 9 hours.  Definitely play around with seasoning -- the recipe as I wrote it is very bland.  Try minced garlic/garlic powder, good old salt and pepper, chili powder.  You can also play around with the veggies.  Adding some peas, corn, or peppers could be good!  It would also work over rice.  This amount lasts me a week eating it for dinner every night.I eat a lot of burritos. Beans, various veggies, cheese, rice, tortilla.

Some stir fries, rice or noodles, fried veggies and tofu, mixed with a sauce that is half stir fry sauce, and half peanut butter (yes).

Vegetarian chili mixed with noodles.

Lately (because I'm poor) I've been making rice and bean dishes. Which is more like, rice, beans, diced tomatoes, chick peas, spinach, spices, hot sauce.

Hard boiled eggs are a great snack. So are avocados with salt. Baked potatoes. A good though debatably healthy snack I make is peanut butter, sliced or mashed bananas, granola and honey wrapped in a small taco tortilla, and it's pretty filling for a post-work out bite.Meatballs (whatever you prefer - pork, chicken, beef, etc) cooked in a couple of cans of diced tomatoes, crushed garlic, Italian herbs, diced capsicum, carrots, celery, onions thrown in a pot together.

Then throughout the week you can take portions and change it up easily for variety. Chuck in onto pasta. Put into a sub roll for a sub sandwich with some cheese and grill. Add a bit of Mexican seasoning and some canned beans and eat with rice/in a burrito/with corn chips. Use it as a topping over baked potato.

You can obviously skip the meatball part and throw in strips/diced pieces of other meat. Meatballs are just nice sometimes because they're fatty and hold a lot of flavour. Vegan friendly too!
Wow a post thats actually cheap and healthy. Thanks for posting!A non-vegetarian version would have a good hunk of salt pork floating around too. You'd render the fat out of the salt pork while baking in the liquid, and it just all goes into the sauce.The only known benefit is that drinking water prevents dehydration (no shit, right?).  Whether drinking additional quantities of water improves your health over those that are simply hydrated, there exists no scientific data to conclude one way or the other.

Will definitely give the massaman curry a try. Thanks!Calorie in, calorie out. And all that shit..Too easy!  Thanks!I like using ghee. It's got a surprisingly high smoke point, and it makes things oh, so decadent.All that means is that since it isn't so precise, you have a lot of freedom and leeway to create your own special house dressing, and if you accidentally use too much acid or too much oil, it's not a dealbreaker for the dressing.1 day later


OP PLSIf it does, I havent gotten sick. Ive been pretty lax in terms of 'leftovers', and while my evidence is only anecdotal - It is the truth as it applies to me!thank you so much, i needed a lentil recipe badly.  have a huge container of lentils,they're just sitting in my pantry taunting me.Holy crap. I should not have clicked on this while I'm doing IF. That'd really depend on which curry you use. Curry can be non-spicy as well, depending on how much and which kind you use :)
Got the idea from [this recipe](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/sweet-potatoes-stuffed-with-broccoli-feta) and made a few adjustments. It takes about 15 minutes including prep time (chopping, etc).

Ingredients:

* 1 sweet potato
* 1/3 cup broccoli florets, chopped up nice and tiny
* 1/4 cup kale, chopped with stems removed
* 2 Tbsp feta cheese, crumbled
* 1 Tbsp red onion, diced
* 1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
* Lemon juice

Directions:

1. Wash your sweet potato or yam or whatever and puncture the skin several times with a fork. Place it in the microwave on high for 8 minutes, turning over halfway through.

2. While the sweet potato is in the microwave, heat the olive oil in a small skillet at medium-high heat. Add the red onion and Italian seasoning and let it cook for a minute or two before adding the broccoli and kale.

3. Once the sweet potato is done in the microwave, cut it open lengthwise and perturb the inside with your fork, creating little pockets on each side. Sprinkle lemon juice inside and then press the crumbled feta cheese into the pockets.

4. Stuff your broccoli and kale mixture into the sweet potato. Inhale.

The lemon juice can be substituted with butter, I suppose, since I just added it to prevent the sweet potato from getting too dry, but that would make the recipe less healthy. The important thing to remember is to chop your broccoli florets small enough that you can fit it all into the potato. I added some grilled zucchini and yellow bell pepper on the side since those were about to go in my fridge.

If you use light feta cheese, like I did, the [nutritional stats](http://www.caloriecount.com/cc/recipe_analysis.php) come out to:

Calories 224 (Calories from Fat 88), Total Fat 9.7g (15%), Saturated Fat 3.6g (18%), Trans Fat 0.0g, Cholesterol 18mg (6%), Sodium 270mg (11%), Potassium 757mg (22%), Total Carbohydrates 29.5g (10%), Dietary Fiber 5.1g (20%), Sugars 9.5g, Protein 6.5g, Vitamin A (66%), Vitamin C (147%), Calcium (14%), Iron (26%)

Nutrition Grade AIf the potatoes helped you and you enjoy them, then keep eating them. They're relatively calorie dense in the veggie world, so they're nice and filling. If bread doesn't work for you, then just continue to avoid it.

Sounds like maybe you're getting enough calories but just not feeling full? I would just recommend upping your vegetable intake. Try eating a whole pound of non-starchy vegetables every day. It's a lot of green things, which will give your body tons of micronutrient goodness. Because a pound of veggies is a large volume without a lot of calories, you'll get to feel super full without feeling stuffed or weighed down.A similar recipe to this is one of my staples. It's great to top with bean sprouts and cilantro.Wow, that's insane. Even for a dessert that would be sweet.

There's not much fat in that recipe, is there? So, if I need to eat more calories, how do I avoid getting fat? I stopped eating bread awhile back for instance, because I had gained some pounds, and I found that meat and potatoes helped a lot with losing those pounds.
Is there any vegetarian equivalent? I think one of the keys to vegetarian eating is to eat a lot! Transitioning away from meat, you're going to be accustomed to fairly small portion sizes. I mean, a single portion of meat is only a couple is ounces. Vegetables, however, are far less calorie dense. I can easily sit down and eat a pound of salad for lunch with a potato on the side. So don't be afraid of larger serving sizes than you're used to. Keep eating until you really feel full!

Don't focus too much on the protein. Everything contains protein (to varying degrees, of course), so you should be getting plenty of protein as long as you're getting plenty of calories. If you're still concerned about meeting specific nutrient targets, though, I would recommend plugging your daily diet into something like Cronometer.

Best of luck with your new veggie life!Put it on a piece of buttered toast and you're in heaven.I was always voluntarily the salad kid, and I loved it. For some unknown reason, I get tired of sandwiches very quickly but was able to bring salads to lunch for years without tiring of it. My mom would pack me a small salad with the dressing in a separate container, yogurt, pudding, apples, bananas, or strawberries with an ice pack. And Hot Tamales. Those were key. Are we talking vegetarian or vegan here? Eggs are vegetarian - if you're concerned about the welfare of the chickens, buy them locally from a farmer's market. Milk products like cottage cheese and greek yogurt are also good sources of protein.

As for vegetables only... there's mushrooms, textured vegetable protein (soybean 'ground meat' which can be bought dried and rehydrated), firm tofu, seitan (wheat gluten, sometimes sold canned as mock duck or mock abalone) and products like 'Beyond Meat' that're made from wheat and pea protein isolate. Peanut butter, sunflower seeds, pretty much any kind of nut or seed, as well as whole grains like brown rice and whole wheat contain amino acids, which are the building blocks of a complete protein. It's not necessary to combine these in the same meal - just having a varied diet helps.

If you're going to be vegetarian, though, you should research your choice thoroughly so you don't end up deficient in any vitamins and minerals as well as proteins. Many vegans are deficient in Vitamin B12, and [common supplements like Spirulina and Chlorella actually contain a 'pseudo-B12' compound that can't be used by the human body, but can cause a false positive for 'normal' B12 levels](http://www.veganhealthandfitness.com/blog/2011/07/b12-for-vegans/).

 Please read the sidebar before commenting again.I desperately need to go grocery shopping, but I think have all of this at home already. Mmm, you just planned my dinner for me tonight. Thanks for posting!I get the thin sliced chicken breasts at the store. Marinade them in Italian dressing and cook em up on the stove, great for sandwiches. Different curries have different degrees of spice. A red curry like this usually does have a kick. You could try a massaman curry instead, which isn't spicy at all, or a yellow curry which is generally listed as mild. yumyeah, bunch of sugar, and expensive. Although, I am a sucker for peach iced tea and you don't get that awesome fake peach flavor from doing it at homeI went through this period where I was obsessed with drinking water. Especially iced because it tasted crisp, clean and pure.

I ended up drinking 72oz in the period of three hours. I felt extremely thirsty, and the guy I was working with started freaking out on my third 24oz round, telling me while water is GOOD, and GOOD for you, anything in excess is bad. I had no clue what he was talking about. I was just drinking because it tasted good and filled me up.

It ended up being too much water, too fast and I got a severe headache, and ended up puking pure water from my body.

Now I have to consciously remind myself to take it easy

But yeah. Point is. Water IS good for you. Just don't be a moron like me. limit your intake. Looks good, although I'd rather have bamboo and longbeans or other more asian veggies. I guess I'll be makong this tomorrow, cause it looks too good!Might as well change it to black beans and hot sauce or lime juice. Baked beans aren't as healthy or as cheap as just plain canned beans. Not a typo. That is my approximation of a friend's New England family recipe for baked beans. I think some pork goes in there too.

It's disgustingly sweet. Then again this guy eats maple syrup on everything. Actually, there might be some maple syrup in the recipe too...

My point was, making a 1:1 comparison, canned is not cheaper.

Then again, theres a reason it tastes so good: sugar, salt, fat!I was mainly thinking about the iced tea that you get at the store, which people often think off as healthy, but in reality they got tons of sugar. I've made a similar dish with chick peas.I've never had curry but i've heard it's spicy and that bothers my acid reflux. How is this in terms of spice? It looks delicious and makes me want to try it.Yeah, i really agree on the fact that you don't get cravings for snacks! And when you say it, i think i can remember having drier eyes before, considering i also use contact lenses, but have never thought about the fact.Tofu and shiitake mushroom strips are excellent in curry.If you have recurrent kidney stones you are doing the right thing, hydration helps push those little punctuate stones out before they form into large painful ones. Also, depending on the type of stone you have and the frequency you get stones, diet changes can affect kidney stones. Spinach is thought to influence the growth of some stones so if you get stones often you may want to think about cutting that out of your diet. Biased tea drinker here. iced tea isn't really that bad for you. Unless you make it southern style with a kilo of sugar. There is some caffeine in brewed tea, which does act as a diuretic, but then you do get some benefits that it is tea and has some nice properties to it (antioxidants and whatnot). Personally I think its a wash, you shouldn't depend on tea as your sole source of fluid but then again, you shouldn't be doing that with any flavored beverage  then again, you shouldn't be doing that with any flavored beverage. ) but in moderation its fine

FWIW I can brew my own tea for under $0.10 a liter, add some lemon to it and it might be around $0.20, not bad at all if you ask me. Certainly better than paying minimum $0.50 a liter for soda. Sure, *right* after. But within seconds of being exposed to air it is totally touchable. Now... It *is* hot, I'm not putting my face on it, but anyone that has worked grill on a busy night knows you are finger fucking that meat all night long to test for doneness. It's not so hot you can't touch it.tofu would be good with currySometimes ill go meatless and do beets, vegetables and hummus in a wrap with some greens and maybe feta or goat cheese.There are other meats to put on sandwiches besides turkey.  Ham is always a good option.

For peanut butter/jelly, is it the peanut butter or the jelly he doesn't like?  If it's the jelly, there are plenty of other things that go good with peanut butter.  Elvis taught us the value of peanut butter and bananas.  When I was 9 I liked peanut butter and pickles.  Still do like the flavor actually, just can't stand the texture anymore.

A thermos full of soup can also be a good lunch, it's something I did often in school.  Same with pasta.

I'd say consider salads, but no kid wants to be the one bringing a salad for lunch, that's just mean.My urologist recommends at least 3L per day for proper hydration but I also have a history of kidney stones so that might change the recommendation a little. I used to have a [chart that showed urine colors](http://www.appforhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Urine-chart.jpg). I found that a minimum of 2L was required to keep my kidneys healthy. The only non-dessert dish I would put sugar in is a tomato sauce,but even then only like a pinch. A teaspoon, max. It's not really necessary and you could just, you know, not and cook it for longer. 2 cups is like 400g... That's an insane amount of sugar.

Yeah, it's not exactly hard to make. Throw some vegetables in there and you're already on top form.I would recommend reading cooking for geeks or....you know in your case not reading it.The same amount as a candy bar.I guarantee it's no typo. Baked beans (in a can) are delicious, but way too sweet in my opinion. Maybe I should try making my own, with a lot less sugar...  for the egg doneness chart, do i time after boiling? and is that with the stove on medium?I'm speaking for myself and I'm not satisfied with the content, so I'm criticizing it. Anyone who agrees with me can upvote, and if you don't feel the way I do you don't need to pay attention to me.Any suggestions on what to replace the chicken with? I like this recipe but I'm a vegetarian!Aren't they basically fried blood clots?2 *cups* of brown sugar? That better be a typo...Pasta dish:
Boil a few handfuls of pasta (Whole wheat/grain if possible).

In another pan, stir fry up a chicken breast, tomatoes, peppers, onion and garlic. When the chicken is cooked, add in some tomato sauce. (Amount depends on if you like your pasta saucier or drier). Let that simmer while the pasta finishes boiling.

Once the pasta is done, drain it and add it to the sauce/veggie/meat mixture. Sprinkle some cheese if you want. Enjoy.

Fish dish:
Heat up a olive, canola, or peanut oil in a frying pan.

Take a filet of fish (I prefer salmon and can get it reasonably priced at Price Rite, but this recipe will work with almost any  white or red fish filets), toss it in flour, salt and pepper, or breadcrumbs.

Throw it in the heated oil.

Cook up some rice and frozen vegetables. Ta-Da!

Super lazy easy dinner:

Mix a can of tuna (drained) with a half cup of cottage cheese. Season to your taste. I use sirarcha personally. Eat it with crackers and a salad, or put it in a wrap or sandwich. Note, this is a TON of protein (approximately 35grams), depending on your stomach, you may only eat half of it at a time.

Edit: Added recipeare you able to grow it indoors? It's pretty easy to do!

edit: oops. I see someone else has the same suggestion. People will look at two items to purchase on the grocery store shelf:

Minute rice, which is "easier" to make and costs like $1

Or a 2lbs bag of rice, which costs like $1.70

However, the bag of rice makes something like 16 servings, and minute rice makes 4 servings.http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking

I copy them to a note taking program and look for common ingredients so I can make multiple meals from one shopping trip with no left over ingredients taking up space in the kitchen. This is all anecdotal, from my own experience. About a year ago I started trying to drink around 60+ ounces (1.77 liters) of water a day.  It helped my skin, which was more clear, less prone to blemishes, less tight and dry, and had a healthy glow. My eyes (I have a bad dry eye problem) were less irritated, I didn't need drops as much or as often, contact lenses were less painful. I stopped snacking so much- when I wanted to snack just for the sake of snacking, I drank a glass of water first. I definitely peed more often, but it was a lot lighter (which is good- it means your kidneys aren't working as hard), and I wasn't thirsty!

A few months ago, I stopped drinking water so well. My skin is breaking out more, my eyes are dry and irritated, I'm snacking, pee is pretty concentrated (yellow)...I'm really trying to get back to the 60 ounces, I definitely felt better on it!&gt; pull out a tasteless block of nutrients

In theory if you eat nothing but baked potatoes with butter (skin included!), that takes care of your basic nutritional needs. You won't starve or become malnourished.

You will have to bake them once a week or so, then pull and reheat as you suggest.

You should probably eat green things too though...or at least a flintstone chewable.I got a big cup that holds 7dl and can be closed. I drink at least two each day. I also take omega pills because I'm not good at eating fish once a week. My job is great though, they serve fish two days a week and steak each Saturday, in the summertime I drink at least four liters in twelve hours when I'm working[You might try those "meal in a jar" ideas](http://www.bigredkitchen.com/2011/07/how-to-make-mason-jar-meals-part-1/)? buy a case of mason jars and build grab and go meals 6 at a time. Pasta salad might be a decent go-to.
Pro-tip: ensure you have forks that can be put entirely inside the jar with the lid on, to make putting the aftermath in your bag possible.

&gt; For lunch I've been bringing these "P3 packs" that are basically just small portions of cheese, nuts, and some type of meat.


I bet you can make a week or two's worth of those yourself for less than half what you are paying oscar meyer. All that stuff is even pretty decently long lasting too. The meats would be the biggest worry.

Another option if you are literally looking for just more calories is simply to drink them. It's so easy to do, that's most people's problem, actually. For example a 16oz Jamba Juice smoothie is like 300 calories. Grab some pineapple juice and frozen fruit, blend and dump into an insulated container. You can probably tack close to 6-700 calories that way. That's a ton of (natural) sugar though. Not the end of the world with lots of exercise though. Certainly beats downing coca-cola.

My grab and go morning food is a [sort of ghetto frittata](http://justbento.com/handbook/recipe-collection-mains/rice-cooker-frittata-summer-vegetables) I make in my rice cooker, which I just just reheat in the microwave and bag in a plastic bag as a sort of wrapper. It also make a good disposal for leftover veggies, proteins, etc.

Sometimes in the morning I just eat some simple rice dish I set to cook the night before. Any decent Japanese rice cooker will keep the rice perfect for about 24hrs, so 8ish is nothing. This certainly beats an apple in terms of calorie count and filling you up.

I would say dollar for dollar, my rice cooker has probably saved me the most from eating out, and actually eating breakfast.nice job! Looks tasty. Fixed it.Not sure about the healthiness of this, but for pure ease of cooking, The Starving Student's Cookbook is probably the easiest. It's available on Amazon (I'm on mobile, so no link). There's no sophisticated instructions or anything. This might be able to ease you into the cooking mindset. Most recipes are pretty quick too.

Also, you need a fridge.You don't need anything major. You can even go second hand if you'd like. I'd be more than happy to help if you'd like to clear up the other points too.Not extremely wealthy. My dad worked as an engineer for a major logistics company for many years. Think rail roads. my mom pretty much stayed home. there for a bit in elementary school she was a lunch lady and just brought all us kids home at the end of the day.


Normal suburb life I assume. My dad is oldschool though. Kitchen stuff was womens work. Youch.chicken and rice is my go to meal pretty much. I think I'll try and cook that first. Maybe document it for you guys, but I haven't changed anything yet or gone grocery shopping. Still fridge shopping. You got all those letters wrong, I said nothing like that.

I'm still fridge shopping at the momentyep. sorry, i assumed everyone on the internet was from north americaI've cooked freshly caught trout in a similar fashion in aluminum foil by a fire. Gut it, throw butter and season in there, wrap it up, wait 20mins and eat it off the bone. Throw bones in the river. Usually breast. I usually wash the chicken breast first form the fridge, then cut it.

I should freeze before hand?I'm not totally sure about the healthy aspect, but a crockpot recipe I've done:

-chicken thighs
-verde salsa (get one that's thinner)
-habanero peppers chopped
-Serrano peppers (whole)
-chopped onion

Throw all that in and cook it for 4-5 hours. you'll get a spicy but delicious soupy thing. Chicken thighs tend to me much cheaper, and you can get Goya verde salsa very cheap.I buy dehydrated meals and meals in packs. Pretty much add water and heat type stuff. Usually my buddy freezes some steaks and by the time we get out there and set up they're good to cook, and he does that. then it's eggs the next morning, and then granola, or sandwhich stuff, or some type of meal in a bag setup. I'm in charge of taking the water and making sure it boils for 5mins+ before we use it for anything.
That was absolutely fascinating and made me more squeamish than I thought I would be. Tempted to try some of these, but there's definitely an unfortunate mental block.Owning a crock-pot is clutch for week-long recipes

Great post! ThanksOk. Buy a fridge. Go to Bed Bath and Beyond, or Target and buy a "Kitchen in a Box". Something like this: http://www.kaboodle.com/reviews/chefmate-kitchen-in-a-box-first-apartment-starter-set

Then, subscribe to something like Plated or Blue Apron. You basically have someone do all the prep, and shopping for you, hand you a box with groceries and recipes, and walks you through cooking dinner.

This is like training wheels for learning to cook and shop, and have a functioning kitchen. It is not cheap. It'll be close in price to eating out.

But then you'll know how to do some basic things, and you can re-use the recipes and shop on your own. peanut butter is doable, i eat a lot of that every day lol, i will have to look into egg salad.

Other than that, try to prepare some meals in advance on the weekends or on your free time. You can make multiple sandwiches and keep them in the fridge and grab one on your way out the door.

Eggs also helped me with the same issue in the mornings. Throw a couple on to boil while you get a shower and they should be ready by the time you're ready and dressed. Where I'm from we cook these things called "filhoas" which are basically pig blood pancakes. It's one of the most awesome things in the world.

Edit: it works only with pig blood.Bonus no can opener needed, 2 servings of 130 calories, 6 grams of protein, 6 of fiber.I'm just saying they're not compact enough to hold the attention of the average person who spots them on the internet. There's no reason for me to drudge my way through 24 pages of infographic when I could find a more readable quick recipe with a google search. But whatever.If you want some more protein and willing to spend ~20$/week (assuming you would eat these every day) quest makes protein chips with some pretty great macrosSeriously, the finger trick gets torn apart every time it's posted. Professionals can tell how done their meat is by feeling it. Everyone else, just use a thermometer. On the other hand, too much water can be a negative. Diluting water soluble vitamins and such. Well, I would disagree with you. For the most part, they are simple and not complex to follow.

 And judging by the responses, people seem to like them and find them useful.

Thanks for your opinions though! Constructive criticism is always welcome around here!! Not at that high level.  You're just making unnecessary trips to the bathroom.Original blog post: http://lettucespoon.blogspot.com/2015/02/red-beans-and-rice-with-manchu-fried.html

**Red Beans and Rice** (serves 4-6)

* 1/2 lb red kidney beans, soaked 8-12 hours
* 1/2 cup onions, diced
* 1/2 cup green bell peppers, diced
* 1/2 cup celery, diced
* 2 tbs canola oil
* 6 oz Cajun chicken sausage
* 6 cups water
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 tsp Cajun spice (I used Slap Ya Mama - hot)
* 2 cups brown rice, steamed

1. In a large pan or pot, brown chicken sausage in canola oil
2. Once browned, remove chicken sausage from the pan and sautee the onions, bell pepper, and celery in the drippings
3. Add the beans, water, sausage, and spice into the pot. Simmer on low-medium heat for 2 hours or until it becomes a creamy consistency
4. Mush beans against the side of the pot
5. Serve with steamed brown riceLaminate them so if you spill on them they aren't ruined!You get plenty of exercise running to the bathroom. I save them to my google drive. Really quick access.No, I'm saying that the format of these infographics is just trying to accomplish too many things at once. It makes them long and unwieldly, and not something somebody who doesn't know how to cook will actually bother trying to learn from. I appreciate the answer, thank you! In norwegian the word "spring" actually means tap, which is probably why i messed it up. Anyways, nothing is better than learning about health **and** english at the same time!To say that it is not true at all is ironic. [Sauteed Chinese Veggies](http://www.tartineandapronstrings.com/2013/06/27/asian-style-shiitake-mushrooms-and-baby-bok-choy/) serve over rice or quinoa

Roasted Root Veggies--beets, sweet potatoes, onions, brussels sprouts, etc. I'm gonna try this today with whole eggs in a wok, lets see how it comes out. Will report back in a couple of hours if I remember


EDIT: So I made it and ate the first plate (I made around 4 portions).

The marinade for the chicken was really good. I was worried there was a bit too much siracha sauce, but since its just in the marinade and the marinating time is quite short its fine. I actually went a little light on it, but now that I've tasted it I'd say the recommended amount is pretty perfect, or even a slight bit more.


I perhaps wouldn't recommend the cauliflower rice if you don't have a food processor. Its a mess and takes a quite a lot of time, even thought I just chopped it very roughly and I will probably opt for regular rice if I make it again without a processor.

I definitely give this one my recommendation.I hate that hand test for meat done-ness that keeps getting shared.

I've had restaurant cooks swear by it to me, seen it online before etc.

Here is the thing: no.  It doesn't work.

Different cuts of meat and different thicknesses of meat and different *animals* feel differently at different meat temps.

Different peoples *hands* feel differently, based on the amount of muscle and the muscle tone.

That there is a sorta-clever seeming trick out there that is 90% bullshit isn't surprising.  That happens all the time.  But the zeal with which people will defend this silly trick is remarkable to me.  People get angry when you tell them this doesn't work.

It doesn't.  It's like the taste-map of the tongue, or the "fact" that you can see the Great Wall of China from orbit, or that the full moon makes you crazy, or that vaccines cause autism.  It's something that is "known" and "taught" to many while not being true at all.  After 1,5 liters/day not really. Until then it improves a huuuge list of stuff. IIRC in the northern countries like Norway and Finland, where I'm from, you are supposed to drink around 1,5 liters per day to guarantee proper hydration and it goes up to 3 liters in some hotter countries, but here the benefits stop around 1,5l afaik.


EDIT: Also its tap water with which you fill it again, spring water refers usually to bottled spring water.[This is my fancy go to recipe.]( http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/01/warm-butternut-squash-and-chickpea-salad/) It takes more time to prepare and you have to hunt a bit for the ingredients (well mostly just for the tahini) but once you have it in the cupboard, all you need is the fresh ingredients and its easy!

Another one when I need my veg fix is simple oven roasted veggies on couscous. Take veggies (like carrots, zucchini, sweet potato etc), cut them into about 2cm cubes, coat them in olive oil + balsamic vinegar + salt + chopped garlic + dried oregano, whack it in an oven until cooked, cook couscous, and finally serve the veggies on the couscous!You can't remember 3 steps to diced food?On winter squash storage, depending on the variety, some will store for up to 1 year without problem.These are too long and complicated for anyone to actually bother remembering what they say.No hard feelings whatsoever. Thanks!Save**Ingredients**

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

3 tablespoons red Thai curry paste

1 yellow onion, sliced with the grain

2 chicken breasts, cut into cubes

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 1/2 cups broccoli florets

1 1/2 cups chopped carrots

1 teaspoon dried basil

3 cloves garlic, minced

Zest of 1/2 lime

1 1/4 cups coconut milk

1/4 cup chicken stock

One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes

Lime wedges, for squeezing

**Directions**

Cook 1 tablespoon of the oil, the curry paste and onions in a large saute pan over medium heat, stirring often and letting sizzle, 5 to 6 minutes. Pat the chicken dry, sprinkle with salt and pepper and add the remaining oil to the pan. Cook the chicken in the onion-curry mixture until golden on all sides. Add the broccoli, carrots, basil, garlic and lime zest and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are coated, about 2 minutes. Add the coconut milk, chicken stock and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Let the chicken simmer until cooked through and the sauce begins to thicken, about 20 minutes. Squeeze with lime juice before serving.

Ive just noticed the dates and this is correct. Yours was posted on the 12th jan and mine the 25th. Credit given when credit due :) I do apologize. Once again I hope no hard feelings.The " amalgamation of work" in your link was copying the work in Buzzfeed's article...word for word.

And Buzzfeed compiled the list from other people's work.

See how sourcing can be tricky?Yay! As a sometimes cooker this is fantastic!Thank you, I was a little worried lol. I also would like to point out the all three are an amalgamation of peoples work put together so both yours and my link are both correct :) Keep up the good work and thank you for your post. Nope! It is all good. A coworker says they are fantastic. But, again, pricey.What do you think about the link?

I just want to be clear the in no way was I trying to upset anyone but instead be helpful and give others/all credit. I enjoyed the article both here and on the link I posted. No hard feelings I hope ?Vat of either rice or pasta plus cut up chicken plus bags of frozen veggies plus cheese.Is it just me, or would that make a great poster?Thanks!

I annihilated mine because I didn't know what the fuck I was doing with it.Chicken breast and couscous. Yeah, I'm from NE Ohio, it's in most of our local grocery stores. But wedding soup is far more common here than I've seen in other parts of the country.Lol I wouldn't have minded if you did if the result was recipes for awesome food. Good to know about the cilantro, and better idea with tiny tortillas. Bite sized quesadillas sounds fantastic!I found a tip for buttermilk (if you don't have any) - use regular Milk 1-2 cups &amp; add a table spoon of white vinegar, stir and let sit for 5-10 mins- and you're good to go.
I've used this a few times and it seems to work very well :)Oooo!I'm surprised that Ziplist won't send you your recipes. I know that people have still recently been getting their recipe file by writing to support@ziplist.com. Although, if your recipes didn't get moved to Epicurious, then there might be a different issue altogether. Some former Ziplist members thought that they were missing their Ziplist recipes, but then it turned out that they actually had multiple Ziplist accounts under different email addresses. If that's the case then it's time to play everyone's favorite game: now which email address did I use to sign up here... (Oh, btw, I'm the Redditor who created Copy Me That.)To be honest you don't need all of them. Just print out a few that you think are useful and stick them to the inside of a cupboard door. I would prefer if this information was compiled into a text format.well that was confusing This was amazing. To offer my two pennies worth - for filleting fish, spend 10 minutes watching the Japanese do it on YouTube. It's the best education. And NEVER fillet with a blunt knife.
Secondly, a lot of us don't have much time. But I DO have enough time to watch gordon ramsay's 'the f word' on YouTube - full recipes to beautiful food get summarised in 5 minutes. Can't get better than that.Generally a vinaigrette would have an even larger oil to vinegar ratio (3:1) than this graphic is suggesting (2:1).exactly, not many people like burnt meat.I'm a student too and like making bulk recipes. I made [this](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/authentic-louisiana-red-beans-and-rice/) Louisiana-style red beans and rice recipe last week and I'm still eating leftovers from it. Turned out pretty damn good...only thing I changed was using smoked sausage instead of andouille since I can't get it easily here in SoCal. Added quite a bit more salt, tooI posted the same thing in food hacksEuh that happened to my sister's friend. He pushed the wrong side of a double door and his fingernail lifted off completely.  For the rest of his friendship with her he was known as fingernail Mark.  I shudder.We were in New Orleans in November, and my husband and I regularly talk about making the three hour drive on one of our days off JUST to have the fried chicken at Willie Mae's again.  We went to the new location on St. Charles in Uptown.  Oh burn!Thanks, that was extremely interesting. You are amazing for posting this. I often find myself making the same internet searches and these infographics are very comprehensive for basic kitchen knowledge. Will add to my recipes book.

Thanks OP! I was just looking at freezer burrito recipes. This is the coolest idea I've never thought of. Trying this tomorrow. Thanks!I like to make 2 cups of rice, add a can of black beans, a can of kidney beans, some cheese, and enchilada sauce or salsa to make burrito fillings for a week or so. Just wrap them up and freeze if you want to keep them for longer.

And go gataNew to this subreddit. I just purchased your book after browsing your blog. Thank you, Beth! I am looking forward to cooking delicious frugal meals! ruined food caused by uncalibrated hands is not. Hands are free!Before.

I usually eyeball it, but if I cook for more than one or two people ( = the amount I'm used to, so I know what the amount looks like in the regular drinking cup I use to measure) I usually just weigh it.
Rice, pasta, couscous etc are all around 75 grams per one person portion. For a quick lunch I reheat 1 cup of brown rice that I'd previous cooked and stored in the freezer, pour it on top of a large can of plain tuna.

From here I mix it up day by day by putting different flavours on top, usually chilli and hot source.

I also put some zero fat Greek yoghurt to add some moisture to the consistency Print them off and tape them to inside of cabinetsOP, cross post to /r/coolguides! This would for right in, if it hasn't been posted yet. I work at a sandwich chain where we make our own vinaigrette. IIRC, we use 1/3 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of oil. So it seems about right to me. I do opposite ratio of oil and vinegar. Maybe I'm weird.Having cooked with coconut oil quite a bit, I find that it emphatically does *not* have a high smoke point. My go-to oil if I need something with a higher smoke point is grapeseed oil.Eat a salada lot of this is pretty common knowledge for those that cook on the regular, but a very large chunk of it is definitely stuff I don't usually see as cooking tips.  Very useful, thanksI only have two off the top of my head:

[Crockpot Buffalo Chicken](http://www.skinnytaste.com/2012/04/crock-pot-buffalo-chicken-lettuce-wraps.html)

[Chilli](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1o594m/simple_slow_cooker_chili/)

They need to be prepared in advance but both are pretty versatile if you have some sitting around.

I use the buffalo chicken in wraps, salads, sandwiches and pasta. The wraps, salads and sandwiches all use similar ingredients (lettuce, cheese, green/red/yellow pepper), etc).

I like to use the chilli in pasta (adding a little extra tomato sauce, basil, and oregano if the chilli isn't covering the pasta). It's also good on nachos or by itself.

Both meals can be added to and seasoned to taste, require very little prep time, can be made in bulk, and freeze well.A couple of tricks I didn't see that I've picked up.

If you need brown sugar but don't have any, regular granulated sugar can be mixed with molasses to taste for light or dark brown sugar.

Cut avocados can also be saved by spraying cooking spray or coating them with vegetable oil before wrapping tightly

Avoid storing bananas in the fridge, as they mature they release ethylene gas which causes other fruit, including itself, to ripen as an exponential rate. placing them in the fridge allows the gas to remain concentrated.I mean I've never even seen endive and escarole where I am is easier to find at a garden centre then at a supermarket.

What if you have fat hands?am i the only one that can't read the pasta chart?For the record, I'm EXTREMELY skeptical of egg substitutions in general/r/soylent is a tasteless glass of nutrients. It has complete nutrition. It costs about $75 a week though, so not exactly cheap. But it is probably the cheapest, quickest, and healthiest thing you could eat every day.Guess I'll just go make an omelette with 12 tablespoons of peanut butter.

I'm just kidding! You're right, I guess I was just surprised to see peanut butter used to sub an egg. Thanks for the perspective.Baked potato piled high with steamed/microwaved veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, cooked mushrooms etc), cottage cheese and salsa.

You can bake all the potatoes at once and nuke as needed, and cut up all the veggies at once and just pop in microwave as well.  It travels easily if you have a microwave at work. I think you'll find that all the veggies and salsa go really well with the cottage cheese and are much more pleasing to eat day after day than something like burritos or sandwiches.Buy a damn thermometer for the meat doneness. Everyone's hands are different and thermometers are cheap.Lay down a bed of roughly chopped root veggies (multi-bite sized carrots, potatoes, parsnips, etc). Toss a cheap chunk of meat on top (pork or beef usually). Tough is *good*. Make sure there's enough veggies to keep the meat out of its juices. Season to taste. (salt and pepper may be enough) Seal the cooker and turn it on.

This is called *[braising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braising)*, and turns just about any cut into a wonderful stew.[blood is also an excellent egg substitute](http://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2013/9/blood-and-egg)Why should it? Maybe you're allergic to egg, or ran out of eggs but have extra peanut butter, or need to use things that don't need to be refrigerated (and live in the US where that's necessary for most eggs), or you want to make it vegan or... Any reason, really.

 The reason to substitute isn't relevant to the question of whether the substitution is possible, and all it was aiming at was telling us which substitutions are possible. Why should they have to imagine ever reason someone might be inclined to substitute?Good to know. I only really use the food processor for pie crust, which makes the plastic one pretty useful. Oh and long nails are gross I trim my fingernails for two reasons, used to bite them and stopped by trimming them a lot, and the other is if they have any length I'm afraid they'll rip backwards on something.That's the point. The image doesn't say why.Just repeatedly did the meat doneness scale on my hand over and over, I'm mindfucked in the best way possible. Thanks for the consolidated guidelist, I absolutely love picking up new tricks!Saving for future reference awesome post!!!!!!!!Food. Mmm.Very useful. For more info on how long foods keep, another source is stilltasty.comThank youI worked in a produce department and I agree. Pointing to what is in season doesn't take much effortThose are super expensive around me.  I can get asparagus on a good sale. It does, provided the butter is cold enough and you pulse. The plastic ones are mostly a waste for me.I own the food processor pictured on the "what kitchen mixer" infographic. It makes better smoothies than the vitamix blenders I've used.Wow, this great! Thank you!I have stuff like this on the inside of cabinets or on the refrigerator, then when I'm stuck, I just flip open the cabinet and reference it without interrupting my cooking to much.That Italian wedding soup one irks me.

I don't know about other parts of the country, but I've never had problems finding endive and escarole. You should definitely use those in place of asparagus. It's a pretty simple and amazing soup to make.I'd hesitate to suggest PB&amp;J, since peanuts are rather fatty (and PB usually has a ton of nasty oils added), and cheap jam is mostly sugar with a bit of fruit flavor. Sliced bread is also either terrible (no fiber) or very expensive.

Bananas are decently priced and year-round, as well as pretty damn good for you... strawberries are far more expensive. Honey isn't exactly a "miracle" sugar though, and tends to be spendy.Freeze a bottle of water and plop it in with food you want to keep cool. By the time dinnertime rolls around you have cold water and preserved food.Same answer I always give. PB&amp;J sammichrs with milk. Or PB&amp;fruit/honey (I suggest bananas and strawberries). For a not-so-healthy splurge to switch it up on cheat day ...  Add bacon to your PB&amp;J. Its amazing.Rolled oats soaked in water, milk, or juice.

You're going to need other stuff to round out your nutrients... but if you aren't willing to cook beans and rice (you can't digest them raw), then you're pretty limited.Saving this.This is pretty cool!

Does the (food processor's) sharp s-blade actually work for pie crust if you don't have a blunt version though?Socal here too. IME, 99c store is more expensive than some normal grocery stores due to custom packaging or custom products made to look similar to others. So the weight per dollar isn't as good as other stores. That said, I rarely go there. It's just what I've experienced when I tried price comparisons.

(don't know about Dollar Tree)Hey all!  I was asked to continue to share my healthy recipes involving cauliflower.  Depending on your budget this may not be your idea of cheap, but if you can swing the ingredients this is a DELICIOUS way to eat healthy and low calorie!  I believe this recipe might also be paleo-friendly, but Im not an expert on that particular diet.

The recipe is my own, so heres the rundown.  Note: This is a 1 serving portion, approximately 250 calories according to MyFitnessPal.  If you want a larger portion, increase ingredient amounts accordingly.

--------

**Ingredients**

Chicken Marinade:

* 4 oz chicken breast

* 1 tsp sesame oil

* 1 tsp soy sauce

*  tsp brown sugar

* 1 tsp sriracha

* 1 clove minced garlic

* A pinch of crushed red pepper

Cauliflower rice:

* 6 oz cauliflower

* 1 tsp sesame oil

*  tsp garlic

* Ginger and salt (to taste)

* 2 egg whites

*  tsp soy sauce

**Directions**

* Cut the chicken into strips and throw the rest of the marinade into a ziplock bag and let it sit for an hour or two.

* Chop the cauliflower into rice-sized pieces.  A food processor would come in handy here but I dont have one so I just did mine the old-fashioned way.

* Heat the sesame seed oil on medium heat and add the cauliflower.  Continue to cook and stir it until it starts to get a brown color

* Add garlic, ginger, and salt.  Cook about a minute longer, then set aside

* Fry the egg whites (this shouldnt take long at all since the pan will still be hot), then set them aside with the rice.

* Turn the heat down just a tad and cook the chicken until cooked through.

* Add the rice and egg back to the pan, stir it around until its nice and hot, and add a bit more soy sauce if youd like

* Serve it up!  Enjoy!

I really hope you like this one!  I am by no means a professional chef so constructive criticism on my methods is always welcome.

I don't know if someone has already said this but you also have to remember that the only item that will "run out" after that one meatloaf is the ground beef. The bread crumbs, spices, and ketchup will keep for a long time. The eggs will keep for a bit but definitely not "run out" that meal. So if you do meatloaf one week, you spend $5ish on a pound of ground beef (depending on how lena you wnat it) and $$ for the rest of the ingredients. But then say, two weeks later, you want another meatloaf. The only things you will have to buy are ground beef and maybe eggs depending on how fast you go through them.

You are going to spend more money now because your kitchen does not have the staples. Once you get those, the only things you will have to buy are the fresh ingredients and replenish staples every once in a while. So, stop thinking of the meal in terms of costs of all the ingredients but instead of the fresher ingredients and you will have a better sense of what each meal will cost. Also consider that a meatloaf (or whatever else) will last you more than one meal. So you will get 3-4 meals out of the one and then not have to buy more ingredients for for those meals.Hooray, another thing to bookmark and never go back toNo question here. I just wanted to say thank you for what you do, I'm a huge fan!

Here is my go at [Curried Lentils](http://i.imgur.com/C5oZCey.jpg) tonight. Absolutely phenomenal!Or a quarter cup of mashed potatoes! I can vouch for that white bean rosemary soup. Delicious. Now I can't wait to try the others!um... does anyone else think that that's way too much oil in the vinaigrettes? It has some reference value but has more value when you learn it and remember. Like cooking, once you kearn a skill or trick, you utilize it often.This is amazing. It should be bound together and made into a book if you ask me. I was actually thinking about printing them off and binding them... these are cool and all, but who the fuck is actually going to refer to these when they are cooking things???Bahaha I definitely thought I was replying to NeverCooks, who has posted extensively about his unwiches and low cal options from wherever. I swear I haven't stalked your food history. But definitely try these!!!! Go light on the cilantro if you haven't cooked with it before. This was my first experience and the first batch was just....whoa. overwhelming. But after using it in this I went on to make a garlic cilantro hummus that was freaking amaaaazing. These quesadillas are definitely in the monthly rotation. I make them with tiny tiny tortillas.this is amazing i want to upvote every single oneI love this!Not sure what type of chicken you're cutting (whole, breasts, etc.) but I find cutting it when it's still fairly frozen to be the easiest and least messy way.My old livejournal food community used to do this and it was great fun. I vote +1 on this idea and would participate. There are other reasons to substitute than calories...Omg, so many. Chips, salsa, various cheeses, ancient grains crackers, guac cups, nuts, chocolate barks... just to name a few. Finally I can just use 2 egg whites when I don't have one egg handyFantastic collection, thanks OP!It's broccoli stems all shredded up and sold in a bag. It's great with red onion, chicken, and Asia dressing. broccoli slaw?Awesome! Thanks!Hey, look at you.The tortilla strips are super cheap and they are sooooo good.  I keep meaning to try the salsa, but I keep forgetting.I know I'm late but I'd like to second this suggestion. My two top food blogs are Skinnytaste and Budget Bytes (so you can see why I'm here on eatcheapandhealthy - it's the perfect combination). In baking egg is primarily used as a gelling or thickening agent. Banana, mashed potato, pumpkin, peanut butter can all do the same thing. It may alter the flavour/consistensy of the dish you're baking, but still serves the same purpose.Thank you for sharing. Now, do I print or lilnk?3 tablespoons of peanut butter is a substitute for one egg? I don't get it. That's like 300 calories substituting 70.Big packs of single serve, steam in bag in pod edamame. If you have little packets of soy sauce or even just salt on hand, even better! Season the pods, then eat the beans.Who said love has to be reasonable?

Definitely get a big backpack for grocery haulingAnd modeling his hands.Frozen veggies are great! All the peas I eat are frozen and most of the time frozen green beans are cheaper than fresh.  They taste much better than canned and aren't more expensive.

The only veggie I buy canned often are tomatoes and green chili peppers. Uh, meat guy really needs to trim those fingernails if he's going to be poking steaks.Get their smoked salmon. Great for onion, tomato and lox bagels. There isn't anything at all wrong with frozen veggies. They're often more "fresh" than "fresh" veggies, since they tend to be flash frozen after harvest. mixed nuts or just the cashews.  Yum yum yum!!!!  They also sometimes get in the dried seaweed snacks and those are hella good.What will done meat feels like: Failure.nobody here sanitizes, and nobody gets sick. Wheres the problem?As a diabetic, I learned the hard way not to trust online auto-formulas. :)Have you considered raiding your neighbors garden?I don't know if this violates the ethos of this sub, but I try to always have a variety of frozen vegetables.

Vegetables are usually cheaper when they're in season and honestly the way to get the most variety for the cheapest price is just to shop around. You can look at your local farmers markets (or if you want a lot of vegetables and aren't very picky, look into joining a CSA) and compare those to the prices at grocery stores in your area. There's a great grocery store near me that carries a lot of produce with much better prices than I can find at the farmer's markets. A lot of it really depends on the area you live, including what vegetables are in season.

Also, as the other commenter mentioned, frozen vegetables are often cheaper than their fresh counterparts. I'm not a huge fan of frozen vegetables, but they're great in terms of prices and storage time. Someone on [r/fitmeals](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/2vg5dh/low_cal_300_cal_sweet_and_spicy_shrimp_with_rice/cohh97y) claims this is 800 calories?

I know. That stuff is OLD. I can't believe there are still sites hosting it. I still use the More Fast Food My Way vids frequently though. In the winter buy:

 * kale
 * cabbage
 * broccoli slaw (cheap all year)
 * squash

I like to add kale, cooked lentils, cabbage, broccoli slaw, and frozen peas to salad. I don't eat very much lettuce. I find other veggies more filling.

Some frozen veggies are always a good price (buy generic):

 * peas
 * green beans
 * spinach
 * corn (not really a veggie I know)
 * chopped broccoli (not florets)

Canned tomatoes are always a good price.
Hell yeah, that looks delicious. Definitely going to try that out. I found her site when I just moved out and didn't know how to cook/was broke as hell. I'm still like that more or less but at least I know how to make a few things. Also I love her sriracha shirt.

That site looks great! I probably care about low cal less than I should but it's always a plus so I can try making a bunch of things in one day and not feel super guilty about it, lol. Thanks for the link!Get out!! Really? That's amazing, (obligatory after watching an hour) you know.Haha I call it Voonderpot as well! That's a great idea! Ha! So true. :)Nah, probably not. I really don't like doing sponsored posts. I've only done one or two, but prefer not to have that in my format.Seriously, black bean quesadillas are amazingI understand that. But MFP doesn't reliably allow recipes to be shareable to other users, nor does it have the functionality to take a recipe and convert it into a "my foods" item that others can use. Additionally it often picks up the wrong food when entering it and requires fixing before saving.

Having it entered and useable by everyone with a consistent entry would be great.I definitely need to compile my one-pot and one-skillet meals! I'll put that project on my list. As far as high protein, low-carb breakfasts, you can do something like a frittata (or crustless quiche), which is basically any vegetable baked into eggs with a little cheese for good measure.  Or I like to do yogurt with nuts and oat bran mixed in (and sometimes berries, too). I'm a huge proponent of spatchcocking poultry. (Plus the name makes me giggle because I'm a giant 3rd grader.). I found Martha Stewart's recipe for spatchcocked turkey for thanksgiving one year, but the technique works on chicken, too. Cooks SO fast, it doesn't have time to dry out. Kind of foolproof, might be worth a shot?If you get a head of iceberg lettuce, you can easily [core it](http://www.wikihow.com/Core-a-Lettuce-in-One-Quick-Move), and then rip up pieces as you need them, or rip them all up and keep them in a tupperware container or plastic bag for a few days.

It's a great idea to keep everything separate until you're ready to make it, but also look at how grocery stores sell their ready-to-eat salads. Usually it's a pile of lettuce, some veggies arranged nicely, a sliced egg, and a packet of dressing. If you work in an office, you can make that in a tupperware container and keep some dressing at work in the fridge, and presto, salad for lunch!Fantastic! I love hearing that! :)I use a Nikon D3100, which is pretty basic DSLR camera. I use the lens that came with the kit and always use natural light. I just work with what I've got! Rainy days are automatically "writing and research" days. ha. :)You can put the link into my fitness pal manually and it will look up ingredients and calculate the various nutritional content. Haha, thank you :)Awesome!! I'm so happy I could help. :) I love hearing stories like yours!Awesome! I hope I can help a lot of other people do the same. :)Dude, he was the personal chef of Charles De Gaulle!These are super tasty, but one time I found a small rock in mine, anyone else have this experience? Probably a rare occurrence. Thanks a lot! Haha those KQED-links you provided were funnily outdated. It seems a whole lot of it is on youtube as well though. Whoa, thanks for the extensive reply, lots of suggestions. I'll make sure to check them out :) Started watching Jacques Pepin and he seems to be quite the bossI Bought a three pack a few months ago online. But recently I also spotted it in a Jumbo supermarket, so I guess it is pretty widely available yeah.Thirding BudgetBytes. My favorite recipe from her is of the [hearty black bean quesadillas](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/02/hearty-black-bean-quesadillas/). I get a tube of turkey meat ;) from the store and put that in there too. It kind of beefs them up. They're fairly low-calorie, I think. I've noticed that you tend to go for the lower cal stuff, in which case you might also like [SkinnyTaste](http://www.skinnytaste.com/).Made with tsp dark soy sauce instead of oil,  tsp smoked paprika, tsp chilli powder,  tsp garlic and a pinch of ground ginger. Had to bake for 40 mins (at 200C) checking every 10 - 15 mins or so to shake around and poke for crispiness. Turned out amazing.  First time having these, won't be the last! http://www.sixpackbags.com/voyager-backpack.html

You could get something like this, my co-worker has one and she really likes itMy Costco usually has big containers of smoked whole almonds that I'm obsessed with. The sodium probably isn't the greatest, but these really satisfy that need to eat something crunchy and salty. Great stuff, thanks dude! Tried one of her recipes this evening and it came out great (well, there is some room from improvement but that was mostly on me. I also totally failed with the rotis I was going to have on the side but that's another story.)Thanks for the tip! I'll make sure to check it out later! :))Hi Beth. Can you try to post some yummy one pot recipes and other simple but tasty recipes aimed at college students?

Semi-relayed to the question above, do you have any ideas for a high protein, and relatively simple/easy breakfast ideas? All good ideas I can think of typically are carbs and such. :/ I see you are dutch. At least here (your friendly neighbor to the east) they have sriracha (and tons of other stuff your normal supermarket doesn't have) in pretty much every asian supermarket i have set foot in, so might be worth checking them out.Seaweed, roasted chickpeas, or rice snacks. I like salty and crunchy so I stay away from sweets for chip substitutes.  Also, don't eat baked lays and whatnot thinking it's better. There are partiallyhydrogenated oils in thereyes, my new go-to. here are some variations I discovered by The Domestic Geek YT channel [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddGi1wwAISg)/[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyufaE226cA)I like simple foods... maybe you should post some of them anyways!You might try Ina Garten's [Barefoot Contessa](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/barefoot-contessa/episodes.html) and Lidia Bastianich's [Lidia's Italy](http://www.hulu.com/lidias-italy). They're not exclusively vegetarian chefs, but they tend to focus on cooking a lot of vegetables and veg-friendly dishes.

And definitely agree with /u/juggerthunk's Jacques Pepin recommendation. His series [Fast Food My Way](http://www.kqed.org/w/jpfastfood/recipes.html) and [More Fast Food My Way](http://www.kqed.org/w/morefastfoodmyway/episodes.html) are available via KQED.Happy Cake Day! It's a risk for most people because they do not sanitize between uses. I'm not eating anywhere that does this (Thailand or not). Feel free to keep salmonella poisoning to yourself!  You get it once and you'll understand why people are cautious. Fat Tuesday would be a good start date of splurge days.Calories on the packaging of uncooked rice are always for the uncooked product. This includes both weight and volume.

I tend to regard 1 cup of cooked white rice (no compressing) as being approximately 200 calories. The easiest experiment is to cook 1 cup of rice with a typical quantity of water (2 cups?), then start portioning it out into halves, quarters, eighths, etc and see how much volume the cooked rice takes up. Obviously the 1 cup of uncooked rice is 640 calories, so you'll probably end up with just shy of 3 cups of food afterward.I would suggest implementing a search function where a reader could exclude recipes by ingredient.  Like maybe I might click a box that said no dairy and a box that said no peanuts and then I would get all the recipes that don't include those ingredients.  Those aren't allergies I personally have, just an example.

At any rate, love your work.  Keep it up.Can I ask what you eat when you go camping? That might be a good place to start. i'll have to find a way to get this all to me because i dont live in the states but i will keep you updated ;)I understand, I know people who have that same aversion to left over food. But then I get to eat all their left overs much to their dismay. I think my best moments are when I take food that is left over at other peoples tables and put them in my take home. (After they have left, obviously.) But honestly many left over foods are considered really good after they have sat for a day, IE lasagna, pasta salad and other casseroles have a chance for their flavors to mingle a bit more and can be a good thing. Also I think it's REALLY hard to consistently eat healthy without involving left overs. Usually my healthiest food options are the left overs from food I have made, rather than pre-packaged foods or take out. #####&amp;#009;

SUPER delicious!Hey Beth thanks a million for all the work you've done, I'm actually eating your curried chickpea recipe as I write this. You've revolutionized the way I eat as a university student can't thank you enough!Hey Beth. I love your website, as a photographer I find the images very appealing and they make reading your recipes a lot of fun even when I'm not cooking. Do you have any details on your camera/lens/lighting setup, and any general tips for food photography?Carry a lot more than that when I backpack. Don't carry food with water in it. Ramen and oatmeal are good options. Sandwiches will keep all day easy especially if you keep the ingredients separate. Trail mixes with nuts and fruit are great for on the go. Fruit like bananas and apples. Of course if you can get access to a stove the options are limitless.Omg I love you and your blogThat's awesome! Thanks!Food won't spoil just because you keep it at room temperature for a few hours, you first need to get some bacteria INTO the food. A way to prevent this is to "can" your food. That is, as it is still (very) hot, put it in the container, then close it. Then refrigerate.

Put it into an insulated lunch bag and you should be set.##Main Courses:

In essence, um, any sort of food that you can warm up or eat cold at home, too :PGet a good thermos and some good ice packs for your lunch/first meal(s). That'll let you have at least one hot or cold meal during the day.

For your late meal, stock up on things that don't need refrigeration. Nuts, peanut butter, canned meat(tuna and chicken to make salad, get your hands on some single serve condiments, or "borrow" some from one of the eating places on campus. Other canned meat can be used for sandwiches, there's canned ham and such), canned foods you can microwave in a break room somewhere, etc.

Hi Beth, I just wanted to say I love your blog! I found it in the summer when I was first looking for cheap and healthy recipes to help me lose weight. I have lost 50 lbs since August with the help of your blog :) My boyfriend and I were eating out at least 4-6 times a week before I started trying to cook more. After I found your blog we eat out maybe once or twice a week. I am a lot more excited about cooking and food. I have started meal planning every sunday and shopping for the week. About 75-80% of the recipes I use are from your blog because your recipes are always good and I trust your tastes. I've only ever had one recipe that didn't work out. I enter all your recipes that I use on myfitnesspal to find out the calories and most of your recipes can easily fit into my caloric budget. I really love the tips you give for storing food as well. It's really helped with our food budget. So thank you for sharing your awesome blog and helping spark the love of cooking and helping me become a healthier and happier person. I don't know how healthy, but I love their trial mix, 12.99 for 60 servings i think[Here's a good resource](http://whatscookingamerica.net/Vegetables/VegetableBuyingGuide.htm) for picking produce at the market.Probably uncooked, if it's anything like pasta. Thanks.  I love your blog, I make the honey spice chicken thighs several times per month, and when I find recipes elsewhere, I almost always check to see if you have a version of it.**PRO TIP**


Go back to your recipe and add a space after each *. It turns this:

*1 tablespoon vinegar

into this:

* 1 tablespoon venegarImpressive, I wouldn't have even attempted to return that lol.Hey,  just wanted to say that i love your blog and its helped me out with cooking skill,  I never learned when I was young. You could try separating your lunch serving before serving dinner.  That way the bottomless stomachs can't eat it.  :)One thing I do with breads that are part whole wheat is I add a little extra gluten to help it out.  I havent tried this particular recipe,  but its something you can experiment with. that's awesome that you've made the blog so successful!

another suggestion for the site that I would love to see is an estimate of the nutrients for a dish. I know it varies so much based on the ingredients but with the tug of war between healthy-cheap-tasty it can be frustrating to find a great looking recipe and have no idea what's the nutritional value might be until I've got all the ingredients in front of me. I want to thank everyone for joining me today! It was a LOT of fun being able to interact with all of you! I'm sure I'll pop by from time to time to answer more questions and read your feedback. You can always contact me on Facebook, Twitter, or via the contact form on my website.

And thank you REDDIT for hosting me!! Cheers!Get an insulated lunch bag that can fit both your lunch and dinner and pack them. You can use cold cans of soda to help keep the food cold if you want soda or use those reusable blue ice packs for lunch boxes. I was very taken aback by how much my emotional and mental state was affected by not getting enough food. It literally changed my entire existence for that month. Hunger is not just about being hungry, it effects every aspect of your life and drastically so.That's a solid suggestion. I actually started doing that this week to compare, and noticed that I can buy two-three chicken breasts for $10, or I can buy a whole chicken for even less. What the hell sense does that make? I guess it's the price of convenience.I believe it's in uncooked volume. It would be really sneaky labeling to put post cooked weight without indicating. Do you think indoor gardening of herbs is worth it to cut down on your grocery bill?  I am on the fence.

I bet aerogarden would give you a free system if you blogged about it.  Seeing product reviews on your site that advertise they cut food costs would be very informative.  Would you consider doing this?I'm a huge fan of Better Than Bouillon soup bases. I use them to make broth, which I use in A LOT of my recipes. They make a lot of different varieties, including low salt and organic options.I'm a wine drinker. It's a nice calm buzz and so many to choose from! :)I still work a few days per month in the lab. I don't want to let go of that career entirely. It's fun and a good fallback career, but nothing beats working from home and the blog is my "baby", so I want to put my all into it. :)I LOVE your site! The step by step pictures are absolutely amazing. What do you think was the most important thing you took away from doing the SNAP challenge?Thanks for the tip!!I had some basil, rosemary, mint, and oregano growing on my porch at my last apartment (I moved in September), but I rarely used them in my cooking because I didn't know how to account for the price in my breakdowns and I know fresh herbs aren't very available to many of my readers. :(I usually just decide based on what I'm in the mood to eat and/or what is on sale at the store. When substituting cuts, I think you need to pay most attention to whether they are bone-in or boneless and if they're a tough or fatty cut versus lean. Bone-in cooks slower, so switching out for something boneless will require adjusting the cooking time. Fatty and tough cuts of meat need to cook at low temperatures for a long time to break them down and become tender, which doesn't work the same for lean cuts. Lean cuts are usually cooked quickly at higher heats. As long as you pay attention to those two things, substitutions should be pretty easy. Ground meats are pretty seamless to substitute beef/chicken/pork, they're fairly interchangeable.I could try that. :) Thanks! I will label it, as my toddler says, "MINES!"I'm definitely going to try that; thank you!

And, just to reiterate what many others here have said, Budget Bytes is amazing! It's always my first go-to when I'm looking for stuff to make. Some personal favorite recipes include African Peanut Stew, Quick Curried Chickpeas, and Hearty Black Bean Quesadillas.Do you grow your own herbs to save money?  We have started using an Aerogarden at our house to grow basil and mint. Hahaha probably because I LOVE cinnamon! ;)I use a Nikon D3100, which is pretty basic as far as DSLR cameras go. Hmm, I don't cook-splurge often. I guess it's because I'm always cooking for the blog, so I always already have food around. I guess I'd make a big salad with all sorts of fresh veggies that are usually too expensive (think cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper) or make a pizza with the same toppings in mind. Things that are usually too expensive like good olives, goat cheese, or those expensive vegetables again. :P

If I don't want to cook, I like to pick up sushi, pizza, Or MAYBE even a burger because I never make those things at home (I mean, I make pizza, but it's not the same).My family has some restrictions on what kind of animals we eat.  How do you pick which meat to make a dish around, and are there any animal specific and cut specific properties that make substitutions more or less complicated?When you do experiment with tofu, definitely press it - it eliminates water from the tofu so it can suck up the flavor.  It makes a huge difference how the tofu tastes and cooks.

This is my press that I love: http://www.amazon.com/EZ-Tofu-Press-Removes-Texture/dp/B007LLGMG2/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423597459&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ez+tofu+pressI bake my naan on a hot skillet on the stovetop. It comes out great! It's kind of like cooking weird tortillas. Love this idea! I'm also sensitive to dairy but not lactose intolerant, and it can be hard finding recipes without dairy, or ones that still sound good when you omit the cheese.Thanks for the answer. Yeah I eat leftovers everyday as well and a couple of hard boiled eggs for breakfast. It's kinda boring but I hate wasting food and have very little time for prep. Thanks again for coming by and may your days be successful and full of joy!!! beth, your recipes are amazing and I love the photos you include. Makes everything so easy to follow

I did think your shawarma recipe had a bit too much cinnamon though :)
hey beth, What kind of camera do you use to shoot the delicious photos of the food that you cook?I will be completely honest and say that I have no idea how to prepare tofu. I mean, I've seen it deep fried, but I hate frying things. I should probably practice cooking with it. I have kind of neutral feelings about tofu. It can be either really bland and boring or pretty good, so I'm sure that all depends on how it's prepared. Hi and thanks!! This is so much fun! :D

Perfect lunch? Like if I could have *anything*? Probably salad and a flat bread. I like that combo because I get a good dose of vegetables and a pizza-like dish without the heaviness of traditional pizza. ...and maybe a glass of wine? Hahaha

What do I *usually* have, though? Reheated leftovers, which honestly I am very happy to have. I like the idea of being able to pop a dish full of food in the microwave and be very full and happy in the end. Very little work but very satisfying. :)Fiber bro

Edit: insoluble fiber is counted in total carbs but it does not contribute to caloric count, you cannot digest it.Hi Beth!!  I love your site!! Most of our weekly dinners are your recipes. I just ate some beef and pineapple enchilada filling with rice that we made a double batch of the 2nd time in two weeks - so good!

First I would like to say thank you for doing step by step photo instructions! That is incredibly helpful. I'm not new to cooking, but I don't know a lot and it is so great to see how certain things should be done.

Questions: What do you make when you want to splurge and not care about costs? And where do you like to go out to eat / get take out when you don't cook?I'm not a fan of Ramsay's cooking shows. It feels like he's trying to mix haute couture cuisine and homemade and it always feels like he's making something basic, but fussing about it way too much.

I don't know any vegetarian-specific cooking shows that I'd recommend.

The Vegan Zombie on Youtube is OK, but he seems rely too heavily on fake meat. I'm not full-on vegetarian anymore, but if I really wanted meat-texture, I'd just eat it.

Honestly, I just watch any cooking show that doesn't sound like it's being spoken in a echo chamber and doesn't have needless filler or tons of transitional noises (uhhh, ummm, pauses, etc). Any dish that isn't focused on the meat (like a steak or baked chicken) can have the meat removed and still be pretty much the same. Here are channels I watch on a regular basis:

Food Wishes on Youtube is good. The guy obviously knows his stuff (I think he's a professional chef). However the guy seems to end every sentence with an inflection that gets tiresome quickly, so I don't watch it a lot.

The Art of Cooking on Youtube is from a Chinese-American chef and he explains many methods of making Chinese-American. I can now make rudimentary sauces that are way better than the Chinese place I used to frequent (that has gotten worse over the past few years)

Ochikeron on Youtube is from a Japanese woman. She's more about presentation, but she has great ideas for vegetarian dishes, including rice.

Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana on Youtube has a bunch of Indian recipes in English.

KQED on Youtube had several shows with Jacques Pepin. I highly recommend watching what he cooks. He feels significantly more comfortable with the food than Ramsay (who seems to fidget and fuss with whatever he's making).That's what I thought.  Thanks.

Not worth it for me at the moment since I have access to a microwave.I would love to see more tofu recipes on your site.  Do you like tofu?  I don't have anything that I "always" splurge on, but if I have extra cash my splurges are cold cereal, frozen pizza, or good cheese. OR, if I go to Whole Foods, I love their bread. A good bread is such a luxury. That sounds perfect. Will definitely check it out when we're visiting :)

Thanks Beth!Good afternoon Mrs. Moncel, I am the guy that created this place and super happy to have you here! Just a quick question. What is your perfect lunch look like? Hmmmm... that's a tough one because I haven't had that experience. I live by myself so I literally ALWAYS eat leftovers for lunch. Okay, how about once per week, say on Sunday, you make an extra meal that is specifically for lunches. Like some sort of stew, pasta, or casserole that can be divided up into individual servings and kept if the freezer so that your hungry family keeps their hands off? That way you're only cooked "extra" one day per week? Here's a list of meals that do well frozen in single serving portions:
http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/04/top-10-freezer-meals-2/Hi! What is the one food you always splurge on?This would be awesome! Or enter them into a database like My Fitness Pal and link to it.What should I do about lunch? X__X I've sort of mastered cooking for dinner, but I find myself reaching for prepackaged stuff at lunchtime or going out. Sometimes I can bring leftovers from dinner, but I can't always plan on my family not eating the whole pot of something... I have exactly 30 seconds in the morning to make or grab something, and the night before I get burned out with cooking dinner and don't want to prep two things.If there is, I haven't found it! Overcooked eggs are so sad, too.

I have brought some meals to work that have a soft boiled egg on top and reheated them in the microwave. I've found that the yolk doesn't cook completely through as long as the dish is just "warmed up" as opposed to heated to the point of hot-hot. I dunno if that helps, but that's what I've done!I had at one time planned to make the How-to a regular feature, but I guess it slipped my mind! *writes on to-do list*

You can find all the how-tos in one place if you go to the black menu bar across the top of the site. You'll find "how-to" at the bottom of the drop down menu under "Misc", or just follow this link: http://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/miscellaneous/how-to/That's so fantastic! Your experience is exactly what motivates me to keep this going. :)

Organizing the recipes by price is tricky because prices change so often. That's why I used the $-$$$ system for the book, but even that fluctuates depending on the availability of ingredients. I haven't quite figured out the best way to approach it yet.I like working with boneless skinless chicken thighs the best. You don't have to do anything to prepare them and they're so easy to just slather with sauce and then bake. They stay nice and moist and tender. Try these Maple Dijon Chicken thighs for example: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/05/maple-dijon-chicken/They're just meant for reheating, not for cooking. Thanks for answering. And I'm sure we all hope to see another book in the future. Hmm, I don't know. I think energy levels depend on a lot of different factors, so it's probably different for each person. Could be anything from getting enough sleep, exercise, water, proper nutrition, hormone levels... there are a million things that can boost or diminish energy.Hahahaha, yes, I got hooked on Serial from the first episode (I listen to NPR all day while I work in the kitchen). I still can't decide if he did it or not, but I definitely think Jay is a shady character who is full of nothing but lies! I don't think the police should have based so much of their case on his testimony.Looks like you're far more similar to me than I thought!

What's your drink of choice at parties?If you want to round out the meal with some vegetables, curry roasted cauliflower would be great. Actually, you can roast just about any vegetable with curry, so you can customize it to use what you like. It's so easy, but has so much flavor! :)

http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/10/curry-roasted-cauliflower/You're not doing lab work anymore? That was super inspiring about you. I'm going into that field and love cooking off to the side.It's something that a lot of people request, but I don't feel comfortable providing it for many reasons. The calculators available online are not very accurate and providing incorrect information can be dangerous to people with some medical conditions. I think it's best to let readers choose the nutrition calculators they trust best and calculate them on their own. Good idea, thanks. Shipping food is not something I usually do, but I had to do it for Sriracha as well, so it is a good option That makes me SO happy! I want to convert every person on the face of the earth into a cook! Hahah :)Another tactic is cooking enough food on the weekend to get you leftovers for lunch on Monday and Tuesday, and cook simple, quick meals on weeknights that have enough leftovers to eat for lunch the next day.

I do this with my husband and I and we roll through the week without wondering what's for lunch. If you're cooking for one you can get away with cooking a couple less meals and just stretching leftovers out longer.

If you do food prep on Sunday and maybe again on Wednesday you can cut back on cooking time other days to crank out meals faster in the evening. I use iherb for a lot of things as you can get them a lot cheaper than local (I live in Sydney). Don't know if the prices are good for America though. I think the print book would be the answer to both! It was a HUGE project and I did it all while working full time and blogging full time. I still can't believe that I published a real book. I never would have dreamed that I'd be able to do something like that. Writing a ten page paper was like pulling my teeth out while I was in school. :P

That being said, I wish I could have focused on the book and book alone while writing it. I feel like it would have been 100x better if I hadn't been so stressed or so pressed for time. But I guess we're all our own biggest critic, right?Hey, Beth! Longtime Budget Bytes reader here. I recommend your blog all the time.

I've been noticing a lot of soft-boiled eggs in your recipes recently, and you make a great case for their awesomeness. I think eggs make a great budget-friendly meat substitute, but I like to cook most of my food ahead of time and eggs are not very conducive to that. Is there any way to re-heat an egg and have it taste good? I would love to bring some eggs to work for lunch sometime.My favorite place to eat in New Orleans is Delachaise. It's a super cute wine bar that has amazing food! Try their mussels and the flank steak bruschetta! To die for!

Other than that I don't think I can offer much help. I really don't get to go out to eat a lot! :( You're welcome! That always bothered me, too. And no matter what anyone says, lemon juice + milk is just NOT the same as buttermilk. Hahahah... it may react the same way and work in a pinch, but it doesn't taste the same. :)I lived in Baton Rouge for nine years. :) It's changed a lot since I left in 2010, so I don't know any of the current restaurants. Chelsea's had some surprisingly good food there and I remember liking Bistro Byronz when it first opened up.

The one thing that I LOVED and miss about Baton Rogue were the produce markets (Fresh Pickens and the one on Perkins, both run by Capital City Produce). We don't have anything like that here in New Orleans. I don't find farmers markets to have the same selection or prices as those two markets in BR. I miss them!

I'm hesitant to do "local" stuff because I'm not native (grew up in Michigan) and Cajun/Creole food is actually not my favorite. *gasp* I admit it.Anything you make for dinner that transports and reheats well makes a good lunch.  Chili, soups, stews.  Just make some extra at dinner, and pack it up for a lunch later in the week.Wow! That IS a lot. I'm sorry, cilantro is delicious, it's unfortunate that it's so expensive. Thanks for the response! I totally understand the whole roasted chicken thing. It's been one of my cooking nemeses for years. Last fall I discovered this guide and it was so simple and delicious. http://www.chow.com/recipes/30264-basic-whole-roasted-chicken

I agree! It's an absolutely vital life skill that so many people lack. Knowing that I'm helping people become more self sufficient is beyond satisfying for me. :)

My favorite place to eat in New Orleans is Delachaise! It's a wine bar, but they have the most amazing food. Their mussels are to die for, as well as the flank steak bruschetta.  http://www.thedelachaise.com/

I'm sure there are a million other great places, but I don't get to go out to eat often. Boo.Hi Beth. I love your site, I peruse it every time I make my weekly meal list. For me, it's the step-by-step photos that really sets it apart from other food/recipe blogs.

I really like the "How-to" section. The ["Divide and Freeze your chicken"](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/11/divide-freeze-chicken/) has been a game changer for me. I used to have frost/ice all over my meats. It seems like you add a new recipe every few days. Do you plan to add to the How-To section of the site?Yes, whole chickens are probably the most cost effective. But even I will admit that I hate working with them. Some butchers will cut them into pieces for you for free, I've heard. Next to that, large cuts of pork tend to be inexpensive and versatile, like pork shoulder. You can cook that in a slow cooker then use the pulled meat for a million different things (it freezes well, too).I have been vegetable gardening for 6 years now - mostly tomatoes, cucumbers, herbs and many greens. If you have questions about how to start growing a few veggies of your own, you can ask me. Even buying a growing herb plant (which is often the same prices as cut fresh herbs) will save you money. A lettuce seed pack can cost .99 and grow you over a hundred heads of lettuce! Even if you just have an apartment balcony, you can grow a little of your own food. (Food stamps can be used to purchase seeds and gardening supplies in most places!)Yes! I came here to recommend the same thing. I have good memories from being little of making popcorn in one of these with my dad, and my parents just finally replaced their 20+ year old whirley pop (or the equivalent).  This is one kitchen gadget I'll never be without! Can you get your hands on liquid smoke? You can usually add a drop or two of that to any dish to get a nice, strong smoky flavor. I haven't personally used it, but many readers have used it to supplement my recipes and talked about it in the comments. Also, check online retailers to see if you can get the smoked paprika or fire roasted tomatoes shipped to your area. The tomatoes might be too expensive to ship because they're heavy, but smoked paprika might not be too costly.Your post has been removed because it links directly to a recipe website.

Ha!Best way to make an egg sandwich: sandwich thins, two slices of ham, slice of cheese, one egg.

Crack the egg in a coffee mug and add 1 TB of water, whisk with a fork.  Microwave for one minute (cover with paper towel).  Depending on the coffee mug used, the egg should cook in to the perfect cylindrical shape for the sandwhich thins.

Low cal and packed with protein to keep you full longer.Hahahah, I have a lot of recipe fails! :D Every time I go more than 3 or 4 days without posting a recipe, it's probably because I've had a recipe fail. And I guess they aren't always "fails" but just recipes that don't turn out spectacular and I feel like at this point I have a reputation to uphold. :P So, that happens maybe a few times a month?I've been dying to get creative with food without having to worry about cost. Having a splurge day is a fantastic idea! I wasn't sure how to do it, aside from creating a whole new blog, which would just be too much work. Thanks for that excellent idea!! I will probably do it. :)These are dangerous.  if I'm not careful I'll eat the whole bag in one sitting, in which case they're not cheap or healthy.I second this I love Copymethat Hahaha, "ease into sriracha" that's definitely the way you have to do it!
I feel like I've never been good at roasting a whole chicken. I don't know if I just don't like doing it or if I don't do it well. It would be nice to be able to just do it on a regular basis with no qualms. It's definitely a money saver, but I can't stand to do it.
I never watch cooking shows. Crazy, right? After cooking, photographing, blogging, and just generally being immersed in food all day, I don't want to watch food on TV. Hahaha.Yep! I have a small herb pot but haven't planted anything yet Beth, I went from being anxiety-ridden when it came to cooking, to very at ease thanks to your blog and cookbook. You've made it very easy for the beginners to gain confidence with the step-by-step instructions you provide.

You make it seem totally easy to cook, and through your recipes, I'm teaching my 9-year old to cook, too. I really enjoyed your SNAP Challenge, and we use those recipes all the time, especially the Spinach Rice Breakfast Bowl.  Do you have plans to lay out the website into price ranges like you've done in your cookbook?Savory coconut rice is my absolute favorite! I'd eat it as the base of every meal if I could.
http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/12/coconut-rice-take-2/Hmmm... I don't watch a lot of TV, but I've always been a sucker for Law &amp; Order and I love Modern Family when I want something light and funny. I've also been a big fan of 30 Rock and The Office. I guess I love quirky comedies.Sea salt, a pepper grinder (freshly cracked is a whole different beast than pre-ground), oregano, cumin, cayenne, chili powder blend, curry... those probably get the most use out of my cabinet. :)The blog started out as a personal challenge and a creative outlet (I was really bored and really broke, so blogging gave me something to do). I quickly realized that it was helping people and that became the major motivation. I absolutely LOVE helping people discover that cooking is actually fun and satisfying, rather than a chore. Knowing that I've helped people cut their bills and make more satisfying (and often more nutritious) meals is beyond amazing. I feel like the luckiest person on earth to be able to do this.

Now that the blog has grown to its current size, it's also become a business. Running a blog this size is expensive, so I've had to make it into a business just to keep it going. I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit, so the business side is fun for me now, too.

So, for me it's about helping people, having a creative outlet, and a building a career. :)
A kindred spirit! What do you usually prepare for your lunches on Sundays? Well, this is awesome!

Too bad Ziplist won't send me my recipe list. Didn't get to export it before they shut down. And the Epicurious connection didn't happen - my recipes didn't move over to that site. :(Not sure if i'm late to this but do you have any quick recipes or advice when preparing/cooking chicken? It takes me a while to make it + I'm terrible at cutting chickenBest way to get energy without consuming a lot of caffeine?That stinks!  Fresh cilantro where I am is very cheap.  Have you thought about getting a small herb pot and growing your own?Thank you for all your great recipes! I don't worry about the cost per se, but I like them because they are all so approachable. I'm a good cook, but sometimes I want something interesting, tasty and easy. I would love to see more Indian recipes (loved your naan recipe). So my question- did you follow Serial and do you think Adnan did it?I've recently learned that you can put popcorn kernels in the microwave! I throw mine in a brown paper bag with some coconut oil &amp; salt and microwave like the packaged stuff. Thank you!

I've had other people ask about the allergy thing, too, and honestly I don't know where to start! There are just so many food allergies. A lot of the recipes are already friendly to individual food allergies, even if not labeled as an "allergy friendly" recipe, so maybe I could just compile or do roundups of previous recipes that are friendly to each particular allergy?

Hmmm, that might work! Thanks for getting my wheels turning. :)

And nope, never baked the naan on a pizza stone. I don't have one. :(Greetings Beth!

Thanks to Budget Bytes I've started with Indian food, so far Tikka Masala, Dal Nirvana and Naan. My family is not very adventurous with food so it was a huge deal to cook and love a new cuisine!

What dish would be a good complement to the dal and naan next? Request:

Can you please include nutritional information for your recipes?Wrap in plastic wrap and then put in a freezer/storage bag. Get as much air out of the bag as possible to help prevent freezer burn.

And when you go to cook it, just cook it frozen. Look up America's Test Kitchen video of cooking frozen steak.Ahhh I'm so excited about this! I've been following your blog for years and years, probably since 2010. I just wanted to tell you that I've fallen in love with cooking because of you! Being a single gal, I want something fast, easy, and delicious. You seem to hit the nail on the head every time.Thank you!!

I'm blogging full time now. The size of the site has gotten to the point where it takes full time dedication to keep it running. Luckily, I was able to optimize my monetization strategies last year so that I can afford to do this full time. Just by visiting the site you are helping support me and the effort, and I thank you for that! :)

My food heros? I love Alton Brown because I love his science approach and I love Mark Bittman for his simple approach to food.

That's a great suggestion for searching the site! I'll take note of it for my next redesign. :)Hi Beth. I am new to your site, but I love how it is organized and I do see it recommended frequently. I wanted to ask you, what do you feel your greatest achievement is regarding your food blog/cookbook? Conversely, what has been your biggest disappointment thus far?Hi Beth, Love your work. A lot of my staples in kitchen come from your blog and book!

I'm going on vacation to New Orleans in March (yay!)

I wanted to ask what are your favourite places to eat in the city?

Also, are there any must-try local specialties and where should we get them?Oh, and parties... Hmmm... Usually we do more drinking than eating at parties, so I just pick up some tortilla chips and salsa. hahaha... I don't know if I ever really cook for parties. :)Honestly, I don't snack much. I'll sometimes make popcorn in the evening (stove top tastes way better than microwave and only costs pennies). If I need a snack to bring to work it's usually a piece of fruit or I'll fill a small dish with yogurt and some dry oats. I pretty much never buy pre-packaged snacks. They're expensive. :PBeth, I just want to say thank you for your tip on freezing buttermilk cubes. I just read that at your site, and that's going to be so helpful to me. In the past, I've just tried to cook several buttermilk recipes during the same week so I could use what I had bought.Hmmm, it sounds like it must not have risen much? Maybe it needed more warmth. You can try putting it in a slightly warm oven as it rises. Also, if it's not kneaded enough it won't be strong enough to hold in the gases and rise properly, so maybe try kneading it a bit longer.Well, I knew I had to make a change when I wasn't making ends meet and I had cut out every other source of extra spending. Food was the only category that I had left that was even negotiable.

The first time I calculated a recipe cost, the lightbulb went off. I saw how one ingredient can drastically skew the cost of an entire recipe. That allowed me to start planning and designing recipes based on ingredient cost and I learned to make meals that had a lot of volume AND flavor, without costing an arm and a leg.

If you want to try your hand at costing out a recipe, which I highly suggest everyone do at least once, here is my tutorial: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/07/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/Helsinki, Finland. A bunch is over two euros. The two Chinese grocery stores I go to (including the one I mentioned) take plastic as well, albeit with a $20 minimum purchase. Typically I don't have trouble going above that $20 because it's kind of a trek for me too, so I usually only go when I need a bunch of stuff. Well, I haven't ever done it! ;) I've only bought steak a few times and when I did, I cooked it immediately. Hi Beth! Created an account just so I could ask you something! Longtime fan here who has lived in Baton Rouge... curious about how you like it there.

Do you have any favorite places in town that you like to go, food or otherwise?

I remember being pretty frustrated by the lack of grocery options but the farmer's market was always good.

I'd love to see you introduce some fresh farmer's market produce in your recipes, and perhaps incorporate a little local flavor! I'd love to see you do a barbecue shrimp or something like that. Thank you for everything you do! :DCheeeeeeese. If I have extra money and I want something "fancy" or to really spruce up a meal, I'll get a nice cheese. OR I'll go for some sort of fruit, vegetable, or fresh herb that is normally too expensive (fresh basil, a fresh lemon, etc.). Those add a lot to a meal, but aren't always affordable for every day use.Hi Beth! Your site has been a tremendous help to me over the past couple of years in providing delicious and frugal recipes as well as teaching me the basics of cooking. It's an incredibly useful skill (one of the most important skills to have as a self-sufficient individual, I think) and I don't want to sound too melodramatic but you're really making a difference in peoples' lives with your work.

I believe I read somewhere that you're living/lived in New Orleans. I'm from the Lafayette area and I only visit NOLA a few times a year. I was wondering if you could share your absolute favorite places eat in NOLA. I'm sure you won't have any trouble narrowing it down or anything :)I personally wouldn't eat it every day. :P  I'm not a nutritional professional, so I shouldn't advise you either way, but I'm pretty sure the research shows that lunch meats are not good for your health because of their high sodium and nitrate levels. Unfortunately, I don't have any references prepared for you to read on the subject. If you have specific questions, I'd suggest getting in touch with a Registered Dietitian.Any brand name food products that you use every time, besides Sriracha? :)

Your book promo video was awesome, so hopefully it all comes together eventually. Totally understand about being private though!I've been reading BudgetBytes for ages now, and it's pretty much completely replaced all of my other recipe sources. Your recipes seem to have just the right balance of simplicity and quality of outcome for me. However, since I've gotten on your site, I seem to have turned into a vegetarian - a vegetarian who primarily eats stew. This is probably a good thing, I know, but I'd like to have meat again one day.


In terms of cost, deliciousness, and stretchability, and laziness, what's the best cut and species of meat, in your experience? Whole chickens?Hi Beth, love your site and your recipes! I'm not from the US so sometimes I can't get my hand on some products. The ones I feel I miss most is 'smoked' stuff, smoked paprika or that different kind of canned tomatoes you use. Have you got any suggestions on what a good alternative may be to still get this American style smokey flavor?Beth! I love your blog and have been using recipes from it for a loooong time.

One question, though: Why are there so few fish/seafood recipes?It's not a silly question, at all! I almost wrote a blog post about that once upon a time, but never finished it.

I like to choose vegetables that are more sturdy (not soft, low water content) because they last longer in the fridge. Think "crunchy" vegetables. Prepping them ahead of time but keeping them stored separately helps them stay good in the fridge, then you can just assemble each day in minutes. Hearty greens like kale last longer than soft things like spinach or mixed greens, but if you buy them in a big tub they'll last longer than the kind that are in a bag.

Those are my quick tips! Maybe I WILL write a post about it! :)I agree. I'm usually terrible about eating leftovers. However for my new years resolution I've been preparing my week of lunches every Sunday. Somehow mentally I consider them "premade meals" not "leftovers" and it's much easier.I am a traditionalist, I usually have two eggs, sunny side up, and three slices of bacon with whole wheat toast. It takes a total of 15 minutes to make (I also prepare my french pressed coffee during that time), and 5 minutes to clean up. I enjoy having this breakfast, because it is one of the few breakfasts that keep full and energized throughout the day. Oatmeal is great, but I tend to be hungry an couple of hours later. hey beth, I love your blog. You have helped me learn to be more creative in the kitchen and very easily taught me to do things I never thought I could do. With that out of the way.

How often do you experiment with a recipe that doesn't end up making it to the blog?

p.s. the book is great too!Hahah, my favorite splurges are cold cereal, frozen pizza, and maybe fancy cheese!

I know, I know... I need to make videos! That's the future of blogging. I'm super private, though, so I've been hesitant to share that much of "me" with the world. Also, there's a lot to learn about equipment and production, so it will be a big project. I probably will end up doing it, though. :P

I actually don't use a recipe organizer. If I want to save something for future reference, I just bookmark it in my browser. Love your site, Beth! I'm a college student that loves to cook, and I've shared a bunch of your recipes with my friends who were fairly new to cooking and they've loved them.

My question: I know your site obviously focuses on budget-friendly cooking, but would you ever consider doing a splurge day? Maybe one day a week where you post a recipe that's a little pricier than your typical fare -- it doesn't have to break the bank, though! I'd love to see what you'd concoct on a slightly larger budget.The trick to cheap eating is to know where to go for what. I regulalry make the "circuit" on a few stores. The differences can be quite large, even without specials.

For example. I have a green grocer across the street were I live right now. A head of red leaf lettuce sells there for $3, $3.50 at the Safeway up the street, or I can walk two blocks down to the no-frills where they sell the same head of lettuce for $1.50.

This is true for pretty much everything. So I suggest to keep the pricing for the items you buy most often in your head and compare as you go shopping.Honestly, I don't keep track. I just go by the rule of thumb that if I can't smell the herb or spice when I sniff the jar, it's probably not going to do a very good job of flavoring my food.When you're first starting out, it will all seem very overwhelming. It will definitely take time to learn, so don't get frustrated or overwhelmed. My best advice is to be observant. Look around and take note of prices. Notice what is less expensive and more expensive. Look at how different forms of one vegetable will be different prices (organic, conventional, pre-cut, single portions, etc.). Produce is often sold in several forms, so give the produce department a good look through because they won't all be shelved in the same spot. You'll learn as you go and you WILL make mistakes, but those will help you learn.

As far as what is in or out of season, that will depend heavily on your location. Watching the prices every time you go to the store will help you learn this. You can also find charts online that might help, so try googling something like "What produce is in season". Buzzfeed also does some awesome round ups each season that lists the produce items that are in season and gives some recipes you can make with them. &lt;3 Buzzfeed!First of all I love your website. I never create a menu for the week without consulting it first. You have really helped me to expand my cooking abilities and try new things. There are so many recipes on your site that have become a staple to our diet. Also, your recipes helped me ease my husband into Sriracha. Now I'm pretty sure he couldn't live without it. Thank you for being awesome.

Do you have a recipe, meal or cuisine that is either a goal or something you wish to master?

Do you watch cooking shows? If so which ones? Thanks for the advice, this sound like a great tactic! I've been thinking too much about preparing meals for near immediate consumption. I am obsessed with your Louisiana red beans and rice recipe. Thank you for all your tasty &amp; affordable recipes!

What's your favourite way to use coconut milk (or cream)? I have cans of both that have been sitting in my pantry for way too long!Oh, and I usually freeze in single serving portions, so I can just reheat in the microwave. I keep a LOT of my food in the freezer to make them quickly reheatable. :) I find the things that work best are soups, stews, pasta dishes, and casseroles. I put together a list of my top ten freezable dishes a while back, although I could probably add to it now!

Here is the list: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/04/top-10-freezer-meals-2/Where do you live? I'm just curious, here I think a bunch of fresh cilantro is about 50 cents (US). I've never thought of it as an expensive ingredient, so I'm curious to know where it's so expensive. Check out [Eat The Seasons](http://www.eattheseasons.com/). It is a great resource for what is in season! Hahaha "Voonderpot" :) Love it!

This morning for breakfast I actually had one of the Nacho Taters that I made yesterday. :P Weird, I know. But I love savory food for breakfast!

http://www.budgetbytes.com/2015/02/nacho-taters/Hahaha I love this question. My favorite splurges are cold cereal and frozen pizza. I normally don't buy cold cereal because it's expensive and I can't stop myself from eating the whole box. After I was done writing my book, I was SO sick of cooking AND eating, that all I wanted was cold cereal. True story.

I decided to splurge yesterday and buy a box of cereal (maple brown sugar frosted mini-wheats, I think) and got home only to find that I accidentally left that bag at the checkout. I was SO SAD. I was really looking forward to that cereal. Ha!Hi, Beth, I love your blog! Two recipes of yours have become a real standby for me when entertaining a small group or looking for a quick dinner.

[Oven Roasted Autumn Medley](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/09/oven-roasted-autumn-medley/) : sometimes with spicy andouille

and

[Turkey and Stuffing Casserole](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/11/turkey-stuffing-casserole/) : except I normally do it with a divided chicken and once did it with halved cornish game hens.

I have followed your blog for years and look forward to more recipes!

Random Question: What shows are you watching?What are your must-have-on-hand spices?I grew up in a big family (7 total) and my mom was always cooking. Fast food gets really expensive when there are a lot of mouths to feed, so cooking was pretty much the only option. I spent a lot of time just hanging out in the kitchen because of that. I've always found it fun because it's like a mix of science and art.  :)Ooooh I love your blog! I'd like to ask: what has your blog meant for you and what does it mean for you right now? Bit of an abstract question, but I wonder what role it plays in your life! Thank YOU! Your encouragement and support is more appreciated than you know. :DI usually make 1-3 recipes per week, depending on what they are (is it a single pot dish or a "main" and sides?) I usually eat that for 3-4 days and then supplement the last few days with meals from my freezer. When I cook a recipe, I always pop a few portions of it into my freezer, so I always have a rotating stock of reheatable dishes to choose from. Of course, not every meal freezes well, but enough of them do to keep a good selection going.Hi Beth,
Thanks so much for your hard work! I love your blog and I just got your cookbook for Christmas. Your salsa chicken casserole is a staple around our house.

I know you do a lot of vegetarian recipes, but I was wondering if maybe you could do an allergy series at some point. I have an allergy to dairy (not lactose intolerant, something else unknown). I usually just omit the cheese, but it'd be cool to see some meat and vegetable recipes specifically geared around this. Likewise, I know a lot of others have allergies (celiac, nuts, whatever) and I think it would be neat if you did an allergy challenge the way you did the SNAP challenge. For example: week 1 - avoid ingredient x; week 2 - avoid ingredient y, and so on. Many people think dietary restrictions necessitate expensive cooking, but it doesn't have to be that way. I think you'd be able to get that message across :)

Thanks again for all you do!

P.S. Have you ever tried baking your naan on a pizza stone? What temp would you set your oven to?Beth, I want to say that your site has been a godsend since I found out about it last year, to the point that 99% of the time I don't go hunting for recipes anywhere else when it comes time to plan my week.

Saving money isn't even my main goal (but it helps!). I mainly wanted to cook more for health reasons, and I think it would be better for our culture and our environment if we all did more of it. The layout and apparent philosophy to the site is great for this. No other recipe site has every step photographed and is as free from pretense as yours is. Just want to say thanks and keep it up!

Questions:

* Honestly, I haven't cracked your book open too much, as the site is so much more useful. My wife and I got your book simply because we wanted to support what you do. How much time does it all take you a week and far does this gig go to supporting you? Have you considered putting up a donation button or setting yourself up on www.patreon.com?

* Who are your food heroes? Have you read much from Micheal Pollan?

* As much as I love your site, I would really like to have a text list of recipes somewhere, for ctrl+f search-ability or just being able to skim down a list. Does it exist? Would you consider adding it if not?Yep, I've got a full blog reader full of stuff ranging from food to fashion, home decor, and science. I put together a short list of a few of them here: http://www.budgetbytes.com/around-web/[Copy Me That](http://www.copymethat.com/recipes/) is fantastic (and created by a redditor!).  They have a toolbar option and also a mobile app.  It's been a lifesaver!What's your go-to for snacks? I'm usually eating granola bars/fruit, but I'd love to see some alternatives here.

What's your dish for parties?

Thanks for doing this!That's one of those skills that gets easier as you go. I definitely couldn't do that when I started the blog, but now it's second nature. To build a recipe I tend to start at the bottom or base and decide what my cheap filler ingredient will be (usually pasta, rice, beans, or something like that). Add to that some vegetables, meat, a sauce, and maybe somethings special like cheese or nuts and you've got a meal! :)Hey Beth, love the blog and the book! I've been using your recipes for sometime. I just made the honey wheat bread a couple of days ago and it's great but super dense. Do you have any foolproof methods for getting a fluffier texture? Hey Beth! What was your kind of "lightbulb" moment when it came to your eating habits? What made you realize that you had to find a better way to feed yourself inexpensively, without sacrificing flavor?

Also, I just wanted to say that I use the honey sriracha sauce that you made on [this recipe](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/12/honey-sriracha-chicken-thighs/) on almost everything. I use it as a noodle sauce, a marinade, and even on wings. It's freaking amazing.The sad thing about blogging is that I always need new material to post, so I rarely get to remake previous recipes that I love. I can't say that I have an all time favorite because there were just too many good ones, but when I need something easy, delicious, and cheap, I tend to make some sort of variation of this Penne Pasta with Sausage and Greens: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/09/snap-challenge-penne-pasta-sausage-greens/Tips for freezing steak?  I don't eat a lot of pie, but I prefer desserts that have either tart or bitterness to balance the sweetness. So, for pie it would probably be something like strawberry rhubarb, cherry, or key lime. :)Where do you like to splurge in the kitchen?No Frills is a bit out of reach for me walking, though I may find my way to sucking it up if the difference is that big.

I got in touch with a meat seller in Kensington and they've offered to show me the ropes of meat buying if I make my way down there, so I'll probably do that this weekend. Thanks for the solid suggestions.Is deli meat bad for you? Should I not eat sandwiches for lunch every day?Wow, who inspires me? I've been trying to think of an answer since you posted this 20 minutes ago and I'm a little at a loss. There probably isn't one person in particular, but anyone I meet who overcomes challenges or negativity in their life. Those are two very difficult and powerful accomplishments and they inspire me to do the same.

Tips for shopping for a meal plan as opposed to a single meal: You have to be deliberate. Actually sit down and plan it out. Pick specific recipes, list ingredients on hand and what you need to buy. Pick recipes that include similar ingredients to reduce leftovers and shop your pantry/fridge/freezer to see what needs to be used up first.I feel like if I go the Chinatown route, I'll need to start carrying cash. Is this the case? I prefer to use my credit card for all my purchases if I can help it (I keep track of spending via online banking).I throw together very similar chickpea stir-fries. So many delicious variations! One of my favorite meals, for sure.

I'm a sucker for lots of spice -- coriander, cumin and/or curry powder. We always eat these with greek yogurt or sour cream, and lime if we have it!Also a cooking newbie here. How do I make a salad? I know that sounds like a silly question, but from grocery shopping to chopping vegetables to storing, how do I do it?Sounds delicious, shame that fresh cilantro costs more than all the other ingredients combined :(I've been making your recipes for a long time, thanks so much!

* Given that you're budget-conscious, what do you love to splurge on (food or otherwise)?
* Why don't you do more videos? Missing out on those YouTube dollas! Haha.
* What do you use to organize your recipes? Now that Ziplist is gone, and after trying a few apps, I still haven't found the perfect solution. I'm currently using Evernote.How long do you keep your spices?I'm a total newbie not only in the kitchen but in the grocery store as well. I want to buy produce but don't know where to start. How do I know what's in season? How do you choose a head of lettuce or a container of strawberries or a bag of spinach? What makes a good apple different from a bad apple?Hi Beth!  My wife and I are big fans.  We have a 19 month old and our days are very short due to early bedtime, so we really like that your recipes are simple and quick.  We make a lot of food ahead to keep in the freezer in order to save time.  Which recipes are your favorite for not only making ahead, but reheating quickly?  We freeze casseroles and stuff like that, but they always seem to take an hour to bake, even when they've thawed in the fridge.  Do you have any advice for recipes that wouldn't take as long to reheat?I love these type of easy recipesHi Beth! I love your site. A few of your recipes are staples at my house now, especially Italian Wonderpot (We call it Voonderpot).

What did you have for breakfast this morning?Hi Beth!

About a month ago, my husband and I decided we needed to reboot the way we were eating. Too much processed  'convenience food' and not enough 'real' food.  An easy but vicious cycle to get into with two toddlers. Our spending sucked, the food was blah, and we just generally felt gross.  I found your blog about 3 weeks ago and have been cooking from it almost exclusively since then. I have yet to find a recipe that we don't like. We're spending less on food and eating so much better than we have in quite a while, so thanks so much for the kick in the butt to get us to quit making excuses.

For my question:

What's your favorite indulgence? When you've had it up to here with responsible grocery buying and are ready to really splurge on ingredients and make a fabulous meal or dessert, what's your guilty pleasure?I know you have a background in nutrition, but what got you interested in cooking in the first place? Do your parents cook a lot?Hi Beth I don't really have a question just wanted to say your site taught me to cook well as a college student and has provided me healthy, delicious recipes AND saved me lots of money to this day! I also purchased your book and try to recommend your site to any friends who are struggling with figuring out how to cook for themselves. Thanks so much for everything that you do!About how many different meals do you prepare to eat a week? How do you keep the meals you make fresh?

I currently make three different meals each Sunday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'm worried that what I make on Sunday, might not always be safe to eat by the next weekend. What are your strategies for keeping your meals safe to eat?I've followed your site for a couple of years now, and many of my favorite recipes come from it (dragon noodles....omg).  Thank you for what you do : )

Do you follow any food blogs?  I think a great idea for this would be to find a way to use leftovers for lunch the next day. So, using the basic ingredients from the previous meal and making something different for the following day. I hate when I finish a meal with a lot of food leftover, so maybe it would be cool to find a way to create fun and new recipes for this purpose. I think a lot of people would help out with this, and also enjoy using this site! I'm always amazed at people who can look at a few ingredients and say "Hmm, let's make something from them" without needing to consult cookbooks or recipes.  How do you formulate a recipe?Do you have an all-time favorite recipe of your own?

What are some tips for shopping for a meal plan instead of shopping for a single meal?

Microwave yes. toaster oven noDo you have access to a microwave at work?  Toaster oven?

If you're able to reheat foods at work, the possibilities are nearly endless.Eh you'll be fine. Get a fridge and start small and you'll be in good shape in no time. If you have any friends that you know know how to cook, ask them for a lesson and you'll buy the ingredients and alcohol.

My bf pretty much only knew how to cook meat on the grill and cook eggs when I first started dating him. Honestly, you could probably get pre-packaged salad packs, a pack of steaks or chicken breasts, a loaf of bread, some fruit, a few russet potatoes and a few eggs and start with just simple meals. Just think of something you want to eat and then look up the recipe and go buy the ingredients and tools and give it a shot. The Internet is full of advice on simple cooking. You're going to waste money and food in the beginning but that's what we all did and you'll eventually get the hang of it.Looks great and I hope she gets a lot of good questions! #####&amp;#009;

First off I'm on mobile so forgive me please. Where are you at in the country and what is your living situation (apartment, house, can by the river)? Second, start little. A sauce pan, measuring spoons, an individual sized thing of milk and half a box of annies mac and cheese can be dinner. After acquiring a fridge, buy a half gallon of milk, its cheaper, lactose free keeps longer if you aren't a big milk drinker. Target sells 6 packs of individual frozen veggies that steam in the bag. Jar of sauce plus rice, pasta or quinoa plus protein plus veggie is dinner when you get a little more comfortable. Even start with like minute rice boil in the bag or even the precooked packs.

Start small, don't get discouraged, there will be meals you make at first that suck. You will get better. Three cookbooks I recommend How to Boil Water https://www.amazon.com/dp/0696226863/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_8CJ2ub16JTM6H , Just 5 Things: Easy Gourmet Cooking with Just a Handful of Ingredients https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003XU7W4Q/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_dEJ2ub0RP9NQV , The Complete Cooking For Two Cookbook https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936493837/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_WFJ2ub041R713 . Use in this order for learning. Again sorry for the crap formatting, I'm on mobile. If you have any questions feel free to pm me, I would consider myself a healthy, sometimes lazy, fairly cheap cook at home. I love egg fried rice, I will definitely try that. Thanks! Okay so you may never see this but dude buy a piece of fish throw on olive oil salt and pepper (salt and pepper packs can be stolen from McDonalds if you're not keen on getting a $1 shaker set) wrap that shit in tin foil and bake at 350 until desired (rare medium ect.) I like mine well done so that's somewhere around 10minuets. That's a one person meal for like $6, in stuff you need to buy which is olive oil, seasoning, and tin foil. And you don't need to keep it cause you're not buying a 12 pack of fish just a single serving. No refrigerator necessary. If you're feeling fancy get a plate out cook that fish and microwave some uncle bens rice. Put them on that plate you got out ans Boom! Dinner for one. Did I just blow your mind? Probably. Youre welcome. I've been looking at these, but haven't been able to determine if they'll actually cook food, or if they're only good for reheating.  Any thoughts on that?Thank you for this detailed post! I'm definitely going to try this out :-)Thank You!Center of the US?If you have a little oil - vegetable or olive oil is my go-to - it sort of flash-boils the water off the frozen veggies so they cook straight from frozen pretty nicely. What I do is this:

- Heat skillet on medium-high with enough oil to just coat the bottom.
- Add frozen broccoli, stir fry mix, whatever and agitate until everything is uniformly coated in a little oil.
- Let everything get back up to temperature, agitate a couple minutes.
- Drain the liquid that melted off the veggies (a combination of ice melt, "sweat" from the vegetables, and oil - I just tilt the skillet over the sink and hold everything in with a lid or spatula) and throw it back on the heat.
- Add seasonings of choice, cook to desired consistency.

Crank up the heat if you want a little brown on the outside, just depends on personal preference. I like to do my broccoli until it's just warm, but I'll cook zucchini and onions and other stuff until it's basically charcoal just because I like it.That may be my favorite whoops link everYum, this sounds great! Thanks for the recipe!America's Test Kitchen had an episode showing how to make Wild Rice &amp; Mushroom Soup that looked good, but I haven't tried it.  Here's a [recipe link](http://www.food.com/recipe/wild-rice-and-mushroom-soup-493380).

There's a video too but you might need to be an ATK/Cook's Country member to view it.I aim to strike a balance in my nutrients. Protein is more expensive then fat, fat more expensive then nutrient rich vegetable, and all that more expensive then carbs. So I expect to pay more per calorie for chicken breast then rice, but I can't expect to be nourished from rice alone. Have you tried turning leftover meal parts into new meals, example you had chicken with broccoli and rice for dinner, next day toss leftover chicken with rice, peas soy sauce and an egg for fried rice? Or died that mentally bother you as well?

Edit:didn't read far enough downThat's a good point - hadn't considered that.  In practice I can't see us getting into it more than a couple times per week.  Still a solid point though.Oh, for sure, leftover spaghetti is way better the next day, and occasionally some other stuff. I usually don't make enough for leftovers, actually, since I can barely open the container without gagging. :( I never bring home leftovers from restaurants.Ditto, their produce prices are awesome. The two of us can go through mad amounts of broccoli, Costco has 3 lb precut bags for less than $5 here. You can't buy that amount in heads at the normal store. From your description I'd say you're quite above average in today's economy. You mention your hobbies. In another comment you mention the cost of ingredients + cookware vs. eating out. Put it this way, you probably bought a fair amount of quality camping/outdoors equipment over the years. Think about how often you use them. One could rent equipment from REI, etc. but you know that's not cost effective at all for someone who partakes in these hobbies semi-regularly. Compare this to eating. You eat everyday. You will never not eat. You will eat until you die. Why rent (eat out) when it is much more efficient to own (cook)?My leftovers are better than what I eat initially. More time to sit in da juice. I mean restaurant leftovers can be nasty if it's nasty food in the first place. But home cooked leftovers are usually better.I don't know why you're getting down voted.  I live out of a mini fridge and it's great.  You keep less crap in your fridge. You also don't like leftovers so it would be ideal.  It would keep your electricity cost down and it will also force you to eat your food. Food wot stay as long in your fridge so you have a lower chance of spoilage. There are mini fridges with decent sizes freezers so I would look into those.  You need a mother.Oh sorry, I missed that point.  Could make it on demand I guess, but yes.I was mostly proud of the dressing tasting so good! haha I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed and crossed my fingersGet a fridge and get uses to left overs.

Check out /r/frugalHow many servings is this?When I was first on my own I realized I had no cooking skills, although I was gifted some pots and pans, and also was blowing allll my monies on eating out. I also HATE leftovers.

I would tackle dinner first.  Lunches out are cheaper, and if you get overwhelmed you'll quit.

Invest in:
1. A small fridge
2. A crockpot
3. A sauce pot
4. A frying pan
5. A cookie sheet
6. Some high heat cooking utensil (like a silicon spatula and wooden spoon, for instance)

For starters, try planning 2-3 meals a week at home.  I get meat on sale (either purchased and frozen the previous week, or I check the sales papers before I go) and use http://www.allrecipes.com to plan the rest of the meal.

When you are getting started, spices are going to be a HUGE up front cost, so if you buy garlic and italian spices on week 1, try to find other recipes that use those in week 2, etc.

Once you build up your pantry, (flour, sugar, regular spices, etc), then you will only need to buy the fresh ingredients each week. Meat, cheese, fruits and veggies.

I currently feed a family of 3 for roughly $200/week (but it has taken me roughly 10 years of learning to cook, trying new things, and cutting back gradually to get here.  I now make all meals at home, we almost never buy bread products, because I make them, etc)Yep, I worked at Sam's Club for a half a year or so, and it was by far the worst job I have ever had. I was a cashier, and the amount of pressure they put on you to sell credit cards and upgraded membership cards is just horrible. I would never recommend working at Sam's Club to ANYBODY.

Yes that's the secret sauce. Google other recipes, too. I know when I looking for the real movie butter topping, there were a bunch of people who had different methods.

I do want to say, don't fuck around with any consumer products, like Kernel-Seasonings and the Orville's Butter. They don't produce that real movie theatre taste or smell.. even though they promise it.

Good luck and post your result!This sounds delicious, I added it to my recipe list and will try it within the next two weeks! in Thailand, every shop that cooks chicken does this and everyone is fine. I do as well at home. This is over cautious and not necessarily true.Nah, it's just gelatinzed starch with a couple of hard bits here and there.  It's what people do to it after that makes it unhealthy. ;)checking in from Thailand; this isn't Thai without fish sauce, coconut milk, and chilis.I think one goldfish would be more than 150 calories for 55 fish! Some get up to 12'' long...He doesn't even have a fridge to put the soylent into.macadamias; they are super delicious, crunchy, and they are a lot of calories for the energy, and healthy!this reminded me to dig into my soup; its been in the fridge over a week. will report back if I dieI second this. I used to live in Toronto on a budget: the Chinese supermarkets are great for cheap meat, Kensington market sells some good seasonal veg and no frills is perfect for everything else. i mean even counting that he eats out all the time 800 a month is pretty incredible... i literally eat out every day and spend maybe 400 a month (caveat - i do a lot of eating at the school's hospital cafeteria)Well, I don't blame you for not financing a $2000 fridge, because that's just ridiculous. Get one for $500 or so. Take the $500 out of your food budget and it will force you to start cooking that month! Good luck.Also, if the initial cost is too inundating, check out goodwill, or IKEA if used weirds you out. buy something lower cost at first and work your way up to the nicer stuff. you won't be as upset if you accidentally melt a spatula (not that I've ever done that...)in the unlikely event you get sick from eating refrigerated food that is 3 days old, your body will strengthen itself and you won't in the future unless you are immunocompromisedno. if you have an extreme immune disorder you may want to follow all of the US food guidelines (I am not sure about that I am not a doctor), but most other countries completely ignore those rules and everyone survives miraculously. Food will regularly be sold from restaurants that has been sitting out for a few days (not even refrigerated) no problem. If it smells and tastes good, its good.I just came to say that I've been there sir.Ok, firstly, dude buy a fridge.

You need it to keep your groceries in order.

Secondly, it's hard for us to write a shopping list when we don't know what you like to eat.

And thirdly, I was in a 100% eat out scenario for a while when I had a kitchen problem. DO NOT SWITCH TO HEALTHY FOOD IN ONE WEEK AFTER EATING OUT 100% Your body goes into some type of shock and gives you horrible digestive issues, so go 50/50 and then a week or two later make the full jump.I know! I want to help him too. I almost want to say, "PM me any time you have a cooking question too." OP-as a matter of fact-Go ahead and do that if you have a cooking question. If you can make it to the Chinese markets in Chinatown they are dramatically cheaper for produce. Meats are also decently priced. My personal fave is on the east side of Spadina just south of Dundas. Such a good selection of Asian stuff too. Soy crumbles have less fat than ground beef--I like to mix them with beans occasionally for tacos, burritos, etc. You can always add a little brown rice, too!Chili is really easy too. Thanks for the advice, I will have to explore those options. But before then I'll have to find someone with a truck and a couple people to help me move it. I don't have a lot of friends in the area :(https://www.youtube.com/user/CookingShooking is a newish Youtube channel in the same vein started by a very enterprising and talented teen, which I think is really, really awesome :)It's generally considered unsafe. It puts you at risk for infection. If you are healthy, like over 7 years old but under 50/60, and not pregnant, you will probably be ok - maybe some mild diarrhea, likely asymptomatic.

But why put yourself at risk for infection?Yo dude. My dearest mother got me a cookbook called "cooking comically". Its awesome. I'm normally like you, just eating out everywhere but this has got super easy recipes with all the ingredients. And its really good. You should check it out. Its like a long rage comic bookI make homemade granola on Sundays, and it lasts me through the week. You can control the sugar content if you make it yourself, and add as many nuts as you want for some added satiety. Serve it with milk or over yogurt, and it's something I look forward to every morning.

[Teochew style porridge](http://kitchentigress.blogspot.sg/2012/07/teochew-fish-porridge-video.html)Super stupid question here. How do you manage to keep greens/herbs fresh 2 weeks at a time, or do those count as "we need it for dinner"? We go through them pretty quickly (We have rabbits in addition to loving salads) - but I still feel like the last few days of those two weeks wouldn't have the most beautiful greens in the world. You're probably going to need to take baby steps.  I'd recommend starting with frozen foods. Good quality frozen foods. Prepared dinners will save you money and be convenient for you.  Get them from trader joes or whole foods and store them in your freezer. It will still be cheaper than eating out every day. Some of these dishes will need to be warmed up in a pot, pan or in the oven. This will get you accustomed to using your kitchen, and familiarize you with utensils, cooking temperatures, etc.  Building a level of comfort with and habitually using your kitchen will prepare you for your next advance: marinating and sauteing simple dishes. You will definitely need a set of pots and pans and a large cookie sheet to get started. A decent 10 to 12 piece non stick set is around 100 bucks at homegoods and cookie sheets can be found at the grocery store. Dont want to clean them? Get the throwaway aluminum pans. Whatever. For now, just get into the kitchen more.  I helped my husband change his habits from a peanut butter sandwich in times of hunger to one who boils pierogies and bakes up some frozen garlic bread. At least it's a quick hot meal, and its not slathered in grease for 5x the cost at a restaurant. I hope this helps you. I buy dried edamame in the healthy "hippie" food section of my grocery store. If you can't find that, try looking for frozen. Eating it plain is good too. I imagine if you cracked the egg and put it in something it wouldn't explode.

I really just wanted to tell everyone that if you microwave an egg in its shell it will explode, because it's a fun game. Also did you know that its really really difficult to break an egg if you push on it end to end?

Egg facts.That's like the mentality that buying a prebuilt computer is cheaper and better than building it yourself.

Knowing that doing it yourself is cheaper, and better, is what will help too.Youtube is a good place to look to vegetarian channels

https://www.youtube.com/user/Manjulaskitchen has mostly Indian style cooking, but there are tons of different recipes there and on her website.

Well, I often see used fridges in great condition in craigslist. It seems like a lot of people remodeling just want to get rid if them. Also try free cycle, if there's an active group in your area. I'm no germaphobe, but I don't eat (typically) eat leftovers. The smell of "old" (which could simply mean that it's sat out long enough after cooking to be room temperature) food makes me sick, unfortunately. :(Great thank youa thermal cooker can also work. kinda pricy but it works and works wellinstead of rolling the thing and freezing. consider rolling in a good wax paper and freeze the meat and microwaveable stuff. then when it comes to taking your burrito to eat just nuke the filling and add the good stuff like sour creme and guac. Don't forget to poke the yolk. Just keep decreasing the time till it stops exploding? Usually takes 1-2mins for my microwave.This is how I make popcorn with the Whirley Pop:

* Turn on heat, add coconut oil and flavacol salt. For a big batch, a big spoonful of the coconut oil (its solid at room temp) and a good amount of the flavacol...i'm using that shaker so like 6 shakes. Let coconut oil melt.

* Once its mostly melted, add popcorn. Start turning handle nice-and-easy so it spins and spreads everything around evenly. Don't stop spinning until popcorn is done popping.

* Then start microwaving the butter topping in the microwave, do like 1/4 cup in a small glass or mason.

* Once the popcorn is finished popping, pour it into a bowl and pour the heated butter topping over the popcorn. Mix it around and possibly add more flavacol salt to taste.Hi, I didn't down vote you but I believe the "carbs/insulin makes you fat" theory championed by taubes has been widely debunked in recent years. eg. http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.sg/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html

The focus on the website advertising might seem to be weight loss, but they adjust the meal plans for those wanting to gain weight or maintain their current weight.

For twenty dollars a week, roughly, AUD, you are given grocery lists and recipes.  The recipes are very easy as they assume you can't cook, and they are created by accredited dieticians in line with Australian government nutritional guidelines.  Many are based on popular recipes, healthified.  A couple are ghastly, but most are beyond good and into really satisfying and Yumbo.

Your twenty bucks will also shout you a heap of exercise advice and motivational stuff.  Just a thought if you wanted to steer yourself onto a healthier course.Definitely.

If you have a mandolin slicer you're all set, if not just slice as thin as possible. You can bake them at 300 ~15/20 mins. I like to throw them in a skillet over high heat and some peanut oil, either way sprinkle a punch of salt and pepper an a light dusting of garlic powder. Sometimes I'll throw some cayenne pepper in as well. And if I bake them I drizzle a little evvo first

It is never too late to start nurturing yourself!

Think of all of your favourite food - chances are good a few months from now you can make those dishes yourself and they will taste better than restaurants and takeaways because you can tailor each dish to your own preferences.

Good luck with it all - hope you find your inner cook and really enjoy the food adventures ahead.  Cooking for your friends is a delight you owe yourself.

How does that work? How does it taste? Don't you have to boil it? Regarding the "yucky leftovers" bit: 1) Sometimes leftovers are disgusting. Sometimes they're even better. You won't know which is which until you get a fridge to keep the leftovers in so you don't get salmonella or listeria or something. 2) I know it's not something you think of right away, but have you seen those people who freeze casseroles ahead of time and then just pop then in the oven when they want to eat? You can do that too, and with minimal leftovers. Divide the recipes into thirds and get very small baking dishes. Freeze those in your new fridge that you seriously have to buy. Pull one out after a long day at work, stick it in your oven while you drink a cold beer from your new fridge, and in 45 minutes, yum you've got a single serving of tater tot casserole. (That one makes fucking amazing leftovers, btw)I totally buy my (browning and mixing) meat in tubes. At Aldi. Frozen. Super cheap. How about a compromise and let's say OP will settle on a mini fridge to start.I hope you will also take this guys advice about looking into a refrigerator, even if it is a mini fridge to start.Plantain chips!! mmmmmmmm with olive oil and lime juice and then sprinkle with chili powder and some cayanne pepper. Put them in the oven (400 degrees should do it) for 20 min, flip them half way through. Delicious!! Got this from [thug kitchen](http://www.thugkitchen.com/)Really? Aw that's not very nice. If this happens too many times, it will cause them to be more strict with the return policy that everyone is currently happy with.My favorite candy/ice cream replacement for late night snacking or sneaking into movie theaters instead of Dibs.

Seedless green are the BEST. That's... impressive and disgusting.There's already been lots of good advice on getting started posted, but once you get into the swing of cooking for yourself, check out http://www.copykat.com for copy cat recipes of popular restaurant dishes. Most of them taste pretty close and you can make them for much less than what you'd spend eating out. Olive Garden even has some of their recipes right on their website. You can also half or quarter most recipes if you find they make too much food or maybe share some with a friend. =)Ok so I love my girlfriend but cooking is just not her thing, ["Help! My apartment has a kitchen"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618711759/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) was probably the most useful thing for her. It gives it to you in understandable ways tells you how to do thing like prep and onion, what a stick of butter weighs, what tools you need for things. It's just all around a good book, with manageable proportions (few left overs) and easy to follow instructions. OP is apparently unaware that many home-cooked foods seem to get better the next day. Really missing out on civilized life!Hey if I can just weigh in with a teeny bit of advice - youtube videos.

Watch people on youtube make food. I find it extremely motivating when I don't feel like cooking. You'll also have someone teaching you, which can be easier and feel less challenging than learning on your own. Lastly, it means you don't have to get a cookbook because all/most of the recipes are free.

[Chef John](https://www.youtube.com/user/foodwishes) is my favorite because he sounds so nice.

[Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=249k2WymdFc) is also great. He barely yells at all in these videos, and they're super helpful.

I understand you might feel overwhelmed, but just go at your pace and enjoy the experience. Cooking and food will become a whole new world. ... dude do you want help or not?You silly Billy.Do you have a recipe for this perchance? Like do you just layer zucchini?I know im late to the party and someone may have said this..  Is there anyway you could ease yourself in by going to the grocery store instead of eating out? Say you have a craving for a burger. Google some recipes on how to make a burger and fries. Hit up the grocery store for the ingredients and go home and make it.

You wouldn't have to buy a fridge right away because you are only making one serving.  You'll learn some cooking skills.  No leftovers. The grocery store also makes pre-made food which may also help with the transitionWait. It doesn't? Once my dad returned a mattress to Costco no questions asked. *He used that mattress for 7 years first.*Walmart has price per oz. listed with their prices, I don't know about anywhere else.Another option is frozen edamame. I buy bags of salted, frozen edamame from Trader Joe's, run it under some warm water, and eat it - you can usually make a $1.99 bag last for three meals.Get a meat thermometer. Look up safe meat temperatures. 165F is perfect for chicken. I usually cook meat at 350 or 400F and just google shit like 'oven chicken thigh 400 time' to figure out about when I should check the chicken to see if it's done yet.

Get a pan. Put some tinfoil down. Put piece of meat on the tinfoil. If you want, make a 'boat' of tinfoil around the meat to keep the juices right under the meat instead of spreading out. Put seasonings/oil/butter on the meat. Put it in the oven for the googled amount of time. When it's done, pick up meat, toss out the tinfoil, you have a clean pan. Looks good to me! Put your damn leftovers in the fridge at work and eat them the next day foolI think I'd start with writing down a list of 7 breakfast lunch dinner snacks I liked. Then figure out the ingredients for those, and the total cost of you ate those 4 weeks in a row.

Don't buy cookies/sweets etc. you'd be amazed by how much that saves you (use the oven. It's much cheaper to buy flour and bake your own cookies, house will smell great as a bonus which is a good supplement to the antidepressants. replace the sweets with fruit leather - handy way to use up fruit that's getting too ripe.)

Then see if you hit 200 a month.

Eat a vegetarian meal once or twice a week to save on meat. Buy meat in bulk and freeze in one person sized portions.

Eat a bean salad with rice. Maybe a little chicken, beans, onion( I don't like raw onion but do like them in a salad when fried/until glazy), bell pepper, tomato, raw spinach or lettuce. Try adding cumin to see if you like that.
If you do Google Moroccan recipes with dried apricot, chicken, raisins, cumin. Serve with rice and Moroccan carrot salad.

Eat pasta once or twice a week ( lasagna in oven, or pasta with red sauce and ground beef, or pasta with white sauce and mushrooms, or a cold pasta salad - use up left overs!- with leafy greens, tomato, feta cheese, pine nuts, avocado, corn, dressing: throw a bit of honey-olive oil(3 parts)-balsamic vinegar(1 part) in the magic bullet ).

Eat rice three times a week. Vegetarian with a fried egg and stir fried veggies ( green beans with tomato, or a mix of shredded cabbage with onion and garlic, add broccoli or cauliflower. Or with corn, green peas, carrot in small chunks. )

Or spicy with tomato, onion, bell pepper, chili pepper, pineapple, chicken.

Or curry: onion, curry spices ( come prepackaged in different flavors), chicken, green peas, carrots, left over potatoes, cauliflower or broccoli, can of coconut milk.

Eat potato two times a week. Normal with beef and veggies, or mashed with salmon ( I love steamed salmon- throw in steamer for about 15 minutes with a little salt and pepper to taste and you're done). If with salmon try adding boiled carrots with a little butter and parsley as the veggies.

Try stamppot. Very easy to make. Cook potatoes and mash them up ( little bit of butter or milk helps with the mashing) with raw chopped kale. Add some sausage or bits of fried bacon. Also nice with a pickle on the side. Great winter dish. Instead of kale you can also make stamppot with sauerkraut, or raw endive.

Eat salads. Or fruity salads: Raw endive, or raw chicory, or raw celery sticks chopped up. Add apple, banana and orange and a little mayonnaise.

Grate carrots. Add soaked raisins and a little mayo.

Once a week ( or less) eat 'junk food'. If you have flour and yeast make your own pizza dough ( it's pretty easy!!). Add toppings. Throw in oven. If you want to spend some time DIY fries: cut raw potatoes. Soak in cold water and then dry. Fry in shallow layer of oil that doesn't completely cover them. Fry in batches so they have enough room in the pan. Fry twice. First to cook them ( 10 mins or so). Then take them out (bowl with kitchen towels). Then dry again to crispen up until golden brown.

Make a few freezer meals for when you don't feel like cooking.

If you like you can bake your own bread. It doesn't take nearly as much time as most people think. Also store bought bread often has at least 20 ingredients and added sugar and other crap. Bake your own. It's water flour salt and yeast ( or sourdough instead of yeast ).

Get free sourdough starter from carlsfriends.org - I've been baking my own bread for years now. Takes me 15 minutes of mixing every 3 days if I do it by hand (or 5 minutes of work and 10 minutes of watching the machine mix;) ). Let rise in warm place for a few hours ( until the bubbles on the surface pop) throw in oven for 45 minutes. I don't do the whole preheat the oven thing. Works great. Tastes amazing. House smells real good. Saves money.
Same time/procedure for yeast leavened bread( which my parents prefer). Add nuts or seeds etc if you like those in bread.

Feel free to PM with questions :)Try making them into smoothies if you feel that they are already over ripe. You might consider looking into soylent.Leftovers are the easiest thing to deal with, imo.  If you have any leftovers, bag lunch.  Simple.

I somehow manage to feed a family of 5 on about $200/week and I rarely have leftovers.  Yes, we have a boy about to hit teenaged years and is sprouting about an inch a month, so I know exactly where most of my leftovers do go.kijiji/craigslist.

Literally 30 free fridges on my towns kijiji right nowWhere do you live, dude?  I will literally come over to your house and teach you how to cook.  I will also take you to the store and help you buy some pots and pans and stuff.i'm going to have to try all of that. how do you go about making the popcorn? as in: in what order do you add the ingredients and at what point during the process?

i'm so intruiged right now. i've been looking for a good popcorn for years now. I haven't used the ceramic myself even though I know people who love them. I suggested it based on cost, to be honest. And because people say it's the closest thing to nonstick. I survive on the following:

1. Enamel coated cast iron (such as Le Creuset) for my cast iron needs (heats up evenly LIKE A BOSS and oven safe)
2. Stainless steel tri-ply (it was $30 bucks, an off brand at Costco)
3. A seasoned carbon steel wok for all my stir fry needs (doesn't heat up that evenly, but is almost nonstick when properly seasoned, so I use it for eggs).

I also realized that fat isn't a bad thing since I was having trouble hitting my calorie count needs for each day, so I use more oil these days. Sticking is a non issue. In college I lived with a friend from High School who taught me how to cook and she would always say that I was probably "doing it wrong" if I didn't add garlic and onions to a dish.

She was right. [Plan to Eat](http://www.plantoeat.com/ref/e66ebd43f7) has really helped me - I was in the same boat, and using Plan to Eat and a lot of simple foods, we saved over $3000 last year from our usual food habits. PM me if you need personal help, I've been there."You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle."Check out Moroccan tagines. A tagine is pretty much like a crock pot. Lots of varieties - fish, chicken, rabbit, beef, lamb. Just cook it on low and don't add as much water/stock if using a crock pot instead of a proper tagine.Mujadara is great. If you like spices, check out rfissa - it is a Moroccan dish that serves lentils over shredded flat bread and with chicken. I've made the lentils solo a few times and put them over rice and its delicious. Also check out recipes for Afghani lentils - you can make these cheaply with canned tomato, peppers, onion, and spices (cinnamon, ginger, cumin). Yeah! Freeze a few portions of each one, and then you can defrost different ones in different weeks. Then it isn't the same thing multiple times a week. Offering you a shopping list, in a separate comment bc my other was already long.

I would suggest:

* chicken, (you can buy an already cooked rotisserie chicken, I strongly suggest that over buying raw, but if you'd prefer frozen chicken fingers will fill in alright)
* eggs
* a nut, walnut, almond, cashew or peanut would all be fine choices
* feta cheese
* tomatoes (2-3)
* olives (a can or jar)
* spinach (I'd suggest raw so it can double as a base for salads, one bag)
* lemons (1-2 is fine)
* pasta
* bread (I suggest fresh italian/french bread from bakery section over factory sliced bread)
* 2-3 pasta sauces, perhaps a tomato sauce, and a pesto
* 2-3 salad dressings (I personally love chicken, spinach, raspberry vinagrette and walnuts)
* sandwich condiments you like (mustard, ketchup, mayo, relish etc)

If you already buy tuna, it will also work well with these ingredients. You also need:

* microwave-safe tupperware
* small tupperware containers for condiments, salad dressing
* a pot
* a pan

What you're going to want to do is cook all the pasta, and put in a tupperware container in the fridge. After that, you have all the ingredients you need for pasta, salad or sandwiches. All of the items on this list can be combined, offering variety.

Per week, you should think about having one meat and about 3 types of veg/fruit on hand. If you like greek yogurt, that would also fit nicely with these ingredients. Look for variety in your sauces, salad dressing and condiments.Do you know where I can find good pressure cooker recipes? I have a really big one I never really use. It would be cool to learn how to cook with it.Everyday I put about 1/3 cup salsa in a pan, two egg whites and taco seasoning. Cook foe about 5 mins. Then top with plain greek yogurt. It is close to a taco taste with all the nutrients and few calories. Try not to cook the same thing every day. And try to alternate meals - for example, if you eat Thing A for dinner and have leftovers, leave Thing A in the fridge for dinner the next night, and make Thing B for lunch. By dinnertime the next day, you'll probably barely remember the night before. Then move on to Thing C and B for dinner/lunch.I love popcorn, carrots, or bell pepper strips. If I want more flavor I buy the kernels seasoning. Ranch is awesome on everything. For more of a snack feel, baby carrots or other cut up veggies (peppers, cucumbers) are really good with hummus or salsa.How is ceramic? I use a regular non-stick pan and I find that sometimes, it's not really the best. Things don't heat up that evenly. My roommate has a glass pan and for sauteing, that thing is a fucking marvel to use.That is AWFUL.

I'm not saying YOU are awful, but you need to learn, fast.

http://i.imgur.com/ZrrUOry.jpgCheck the serving size on that meatloaf. It may say "Serves 4" or something. Reduce the ingredients by proportion. Also, not every recipe needs to have every ingredient listed. I habitually leave out certain things if I think they're unnecessary and a hassle/too expensive. I also add things not in the recipe if I think they might make the dish taste better. That sort of knowledge involves a good sense of taste, though, and for cooking, developing that sense might help.Recipe for Chloros Zomos.

Introduction:-

To a certain extent, this drink is the result of my own experimentation,
although I did have two sources of inspiration. The purportedly anti-cancer
Gerson Diet, which primarily consists of apple and carrot juice, and Dan
McDonald's Lemon Ginger Blast.

The name is a slight play on (and homage to) the Spartan Melas Zomos, or Black
Broth, which was made from boiled pig's or other animal's blood, and a certain
amount of meat, garlic, and vinegar. Chloros is ancient Greek for the colour
green, which my drink is with the presence of celery leaves. The Spartans presumably
used their soup as a means of obtaining their necessary nutrition and protein
while on the march; and it is recorded that in old age, the men who had grown
used to the broth, still preferred to eat it over anything else, when they
were at home in Sparta.

My intention with this recipe is that it be a staple in a somewhat similar
manner, while having considerably less objectionable ingredients for modern
sensibilities. The drink is extremely healthy, and something which I recommend
both for the curing of disease, and maintaining good health. When I was in
Kyneton I would sometimes drink it when I felt it necessary, and I buy a
somewhat more limited version of it on most days here in Nimbin.

Ingredients:-

1 Apple, cut into quarters.

1-2 Carrots, depending on their size, sliced.

1 Lemon, quartered with the peel left on.

1 Avocado, quartered.

4 Celery sticks, 10 cm or so long.  Make sure to include a good amount of the leaves as well.  The colour this creates is beautiful.

1 half teaspoon of unground Fenugreek.  If you can get the ground stuff,
that's fine.

3 cloves of Garlic.

3 teaspoons of powdered Turmeric.

3 teaspoons of powdered Almonds.

2 grams of fresh Ginger root.

200 ml or so of Water.

Method:-

Combine all of the above in a blender that has a jug with a 1-2 litre
capacity. Do not put all of the ingredients in at once, however. Put the apple
pieces and the other larger ingredients in first, one at a time, and use a
small amount of water each time as lubricant for the blades.

Once all of the ingredients have been properly blended, the jug can be taken
off the blender pedestal and put in the refrigerator; although if it is not
sealed, this drink should ideally be consumed within a maximum of 24 hours. If
I was going to take some of this while travelling, I would keep it in a
thermos flask, where it would most likely keep for longer.
Yeah I'm the same. I just don't get how you can spend so much more than that and not have it be intentional? I just eat a lot of eggs and milk. And I eat meat pretty often. I only buy it when its on sale at no frills thoughI'd go with salads and pasta. For pasta you should cook a whole batch, then heat up the portion you want to eat with the mix-ins you want. For sauce, 'cream of X' soup works pretty well, you could season it if you want. If cheap isn't so important, you could just buy pre-made pasta sauces.

So you've got a batch of pre-cooked noodles, before you leave for work throw some with some veggies, meat and sauce in a microwaveable container. All you have to do before eating it is heat it up.

Salads are similarly easy, toss ingredients in a container, and pack a container of dressing on the side. Come meal break, combine and eat.

I would also like to introduce you to the brain-child of my lazy cooking days, a little something I call 'meat salad'. You start with pre-cooked meat, whatever you like, although I mostly used chicken or ham. Then add one or two vegetables and a cheese,  (tomato, olive, feta; spinach, mushroom, swiss; corn, carrot, cheddar, etc.) and microwave it. All the prep required it to chop or shred the ingredients, and it's super-tasty.

Also if you like eggs, they are easy to prepare and go nicely in salad, pasta, sandwiches, pizza, etc for a quick way to add protein. You can also focus on canned chickpeas or nut (like peanuts) to add protein and therefore an energy boost, without the hassle of having to prepare meat.

You should buy a pot and a pan. You really will never *need* more than that.A rice cooker isn't really necessary, and if you're on a limited budget or in a limited space it's downright wasteful unless you're using it every day.  Same with the water kettle.  You can do both of those on the stovetop pretty easily.

If you do use them daily, that's a different story - my electric kettle gets switched on twice a day - but they're definitely not essentials.Canadian here. Grocery bill comes down to around $30/week for me. I don't buy meat because it's a hassle, and eat out if I want meat. Total food may be around $50-70/week, including booze. I obviously don't eat meat every day.Some mini fridges are awful.  Mine at school was either freeze or barely cold.  I just swore off dairy products and delicate produce like lettuce.$1000 for a fridge?  My partner and I have a fridge similar to [this](http://products.geappliances.com/ApplProducts/Dispatcher?REQUEST=SpecPage&amp;Sku=GTS15CTHRCC) (ours is even smaller at 11.9 cu ft) and it's plenty of room for the two of us.  It ain't fancy, but it keeps things cold.Costco has great products and prices.

Costco also invests heavily in their employees; great pay, strong benefits, vacation time, etc.

Sam's Club and Walmart are the same entity and the shabby regard they show their employees is newsworthy.

Patronizing companies that treat their employees well and shunning those that do not is important.

In the end, giving a shit feels better than zero fucks given.+1 on plantain chips. i love them and they make me feel better because they're not regular chipsif you can find a restaurant supply store somewhere, they'll have the best pans and everything for a lottt cheaper than shit like martha stewart idiot brands.

get 1 10 inch teflon frying pan and a lid for it. $20 + $10 tops.

wooden spoons so you dont scratch the dickk out the teflon ~$2

get a rice cooker. $20

any store sells glass/pyrex baking pans, get one of those and start baking whole chickens.

like really you can cook just about anything with an oven and a pan with a lid. there is zero effort involved here. just put a chicken in the bitch and wait until its not salmonella.

if you're used to paying $20 for a damn chicken breast at some halfass restaurant i think you'll be disgusted how easy it is to do at home for like $1. the magic of salt oooOoOooo

~ worked in restaurants for like 15 years. ~
Aight fair enough, but ew73 was talking to OP's situation. Listen, I've also been without a decent fridge and the answer has always been processed food or meals that consume almost all ingredients in one go. I personally loved getting a whole bunch of ramen plus various seasonings to make it interesting.

Someone else mentioned adjusting the dial, so if there is an accessible temperature control, then use it.[Lactose intolerance can occur in children/infants as well, although much less frequently.](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=lactose%20intolerance%20in%20infants&amp;es_th=1) The first result and the one from the Mayo Clinic explain this. It may cost $30 to make if you have none of the ingredients and you make super fancy stuff. Most people who cook regularly will have most all of those ingredients already, and will only need one or two things. And it makes a ton of food.Holy shit, I love this subreddit and how chill it is. Anywhere else on reddit, you would've been utterly destroyed with downvotes for even mentioning bottled water. But on this sub, it's just some more legit advise for someone trying to live a little more efficiently.My grocery bill for one month is $75, max, on a good month. Mostly out of need, but I can't fathom having $225/week grocery budget! Oh, the things I could buy with that...

The rest of the comments are gold. /u/ooglygooglypants hit the nail on the head, and everything he says is awesome, so I won't say it all again except the key points: You'll need a fridge. If you won't buy one, might as well keep eating out. And yes, you'll have to start eating leftovers unless you want to throw away huge quantities of food, in which case again - might as well just keep eating out instead of wasting it. I'm not talking about OP. I'm talking about me and my apartment. The cool thing about reddit is a lot of times threads will be useful to many more people than just the person who originally asked the questionYou need to learn how to cook one of your favorite meals that you eat when you go out.  From this you will learn cooking skills and be able to branch out from there.  If you don't know anyone that can help you, cooking wise, YouTube is a life saver.  You need a medium to large skillet, and a pot to boil water to start with.  Like others have said get over left over aversion.  Spaghetti is great for multiple meals.  Crockpots are great for soups, which can make multiple meals.  OP should also check out some of the Jamie Oliver vids--as much as I love Gordon Ramsay, he's not exactly beginner friendly.OP spends 1k a month on food. I'm pretty sure he can afford a 100$ mini fridge.Plantain chips, korean seaweed, root vegetable chipsYea...I'm the only one who eats hummus so I'd either have to go on a huge binge (which I'm sure defeats the purpose of a healthy snack) or throw a party...Looks like I'm throwing a party!there is the brickworks farmers market not too far from youSafer that way.  There's lots of cool people here but all it takes is one jerk to ruin it for everyone. Suggestion noted and applied
Food is my passion but I'm pretty sure most of your questions here have already been answered.  I just wanted to say I'm literally excited FOR you.  I hope you learn to love what you make and eat.  I taught myself to cook.  I've been practicing for 10 years and I've still got a long ways to go.  Internet really helps move food knowledge along faster than a book in my opinion.  Go you!  Don't get too discouraged.  You can do it!Start with Breakfasts and lunches:

Breakfasts: Buy bag of bagels, add some of your favourite topping (margerine, butter, herbed cream cheese). Toast with peanut butter and jam. Buy some apples, bannanas, oranges, and other cheap in season fruit. Make the occasional scrambled eggs + toast, omelets (scramble eggs, put into pan, let them heat without stirring them, dump cheese &amp; veggies and meat on, let cook, eat).

Lunches: Take afforementioned apples, bananas, oranges. Bake some super easy cookies (I use this one and I seriously am as dumb as fuck when it comes to baking: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/ ). Make sandwhiches. Peanut butter and jam, peanut butter and banana, nutella and banana. Get more elaborate; lettuce (small head) + tomato + lunch meat + cheese + nice mustard (I use organic stone ground). Take the left over lettuce, dump on some caesar dressing, look in your bulk section for cheap crutons and facon bits, scrape on some paremesean cheese (great in those omelets, too).

Simple as fuck dinner: Get one of those 8$ rotiserrie chickens from the grocery store, a bag of potatoes. Boil the potatoes, put butter in, mash them. Buy some celery and carrots, cut em into sticks, eat em with a bit (but not a lot) of ranch dressing. Delicious, not terrible for you. Take the left over chicken and use it in your sandwhiches for the week.

You can do all this with a 20$ mini fridge off craigslist and your microwave.I put a bag of carrot and celery sticks in my lunch every day. It really makes a difference in filling you up, but it doesn't add a lot of junk calories. Also, the crunchiness is an awesome complement to a sandwich.I don't even use a knife or stir.  I throw in a couple whole chicken breasts and taco seasoning, and they fall apart after letting it cook for 6 hours.

If I'm feeling daring I throw in a pack of ramen towards the end.Unfortunately I have done a lot of finicking with the dial :( when I turn it a minute amount, it'll go from freezing everything to making everything spoil because it's not cold enough. Very frustrating.Hey don't get overwhelmed.  Cooking is a lot of fun if you do it for joy.  I find it to be very creative and stress-relieving.  Also...yes you could go spend that $12 on at Jimmy Johns...but that probably only gives you one meal.  $12 of a meatloaf (you can even throw in a side of potatoes) is probably going to give you 3-5 meals. :)

I'd suggest watching mountains of youtube videos.  And Google is your friend.  You can google the answer to pretty much any silly cooking question and find what you need instantly.  Get a fridge. Then:

Easy/healthy breakfast:

Get:
yogurt (preferably a good plain yogurt)
banana
thawed frozen berries
granola or some sort of rolled breakfast cereal (something that looks like oats, including rye or some kind that starts with a t, the name of which I don't remember)
a good fruit and nuts mix (i get a yummy one for a little more than $6 a lb in the bulk bin of the grocery store by my house)
some sweetener &gt; maple syrup or honey works best

Place yogurt in large bowl.
Cut up banana and place that over yogurt.
Put grain over that.
Put fruit/nuts mix over that.
Sprinkle sweetener on it.
Stir.
Enjoy.
Repeat. This may end up being a silly question, but have you tried adjusting the temperature knob in the fridge? Every fridge (mini-fridge included) I've ever owned/used regularly had a knob like [this one](http://www.staticwhich.co.uk/media/images/adhoc/2--analouge-thermostat-324708.jpg) that you could dial to make it warmer/cooler. If everything is getting frozen, you might be able to set it warmer to make things be chilled properly.Thanks for the advice. I was worried he'd think that I broke the fridge, since I've been living there for a year and was just too timid to say anything about it before. It was like that when I moved in, but I guess I have no way to prove that...I'm not talking about OP now, I'm asking for myself. And I don't spend $1000 a month in restaurants.

A lot of times posts are helpful to many other people besides the person who asked the questionHey I've been thinking about your dillema for a while now. You need a crockpot. It's the easiest shit in the world, you don't need to know anything about cooking at all. You literally just put some stuff in a giant bowl and it's ready to eat in a few hours. Chicken, beef, veggies, canned soups, whatever, it's super hard to fuck up.

Also, going from eating out all the time to eating at home is a pretty big transition so don't feel like you have to immediately start cooking everything form scratch. If your goal is to save money, frozen dinners and hot pockets could be a decent stepping stone or a fall-back for when you don't feel like cooking, you can pop something in the microwave instead of going to Jimmy Johns. Every damn time I try to make skinny girl popcorn it burns, EVERY time. I've just opted for the Orville 100 calorie packs instead. Microwave popcorn is also incredibly unhealthy due to the packaging.Ok lets do some math. You are spending 1k a month eating out. That's 33 bucks a day. That's 11 dollars a meal. So anything we do under that is bonus.

Step one, as described by others, but a nice nonstick skillet that is bigger than you think you need. It's going to cast you maybe 30 bucks. Then buy two dozen eggs. No fridge?  Doesn't matter. The eggs will be fine for a week. Splurge on the eggs. Get the ones that cost 4 bucks a dozen. We are at 34 bucks or about one days meals. Throw in some good butter. Doesn't need refrigeration. Four more dollars. With this, make scrambled eggs. Buy some hard dry sausage or salami. Scramble it with the eggs. This is now your oh shit I'm at home and don't know what to do.

But a bag of sweet potatoes. Stab a sweet potato with a fork. Put in microwave for five minutes. Smother in butter. Add cinnamon if you are feeling fancy. Now you have protein, fat, and carbs, no fridge required.

If you have ten minutes on the way home stop and buy spicy Italian sausage (the loose kind). Dump it in a pan and stir it under it isn't pink. Pair with sweet potatoes.

Until you get a fridge, buy a cooler and some bags of ice. Yeah it's not awesome but it will keep your food safe and at least leave you with decent leftovers.  Eat at home for dinner for two weeks and you've probably saved enough for a fridge. Now things get fun.

There are two books I absolutely recommend. First is for the sad sad basics. Buy the starving students' cookbook by fed hall. It has - bunch of recipes with very specific directions, cheap ingredients, and minimal tools. Use this until you save some money for a fridge, and maybe 200 bucks for more tools. Just think 200 bucks is probably less than you used to spend in a week eating out. And hell what are we two three weeks in? Suffer through for 30 days, how bad can it be!

Now you have a fridge, money saved for tools, and a few options like omelets and grilled cheese sandwiches. Now it's time to decide if you want to get serious about cooking.

I loved Tim Feriss's book the four hour chef. It's not a book about cooking as much as it is a book about learning to learn. But the recipes are easy to follow, and the food is delicious. If you are a foody this is how you make it at home.

Best of luck to you and proud of you for trying!In that case, get your landlord to provide a working set of appliances.  Apartments / rentals come with an implied warranty of habitability, which includes working appliances.

Refer to your state's landlord-tenant law for specific remedies.  /r/legaladvice may also be able to help.Late to the party here, but yeah you need a fridge and freezer. This doesn't have to be that complicated. Just get one dish to be somewhat palatable and go from there. I make a lot of stir frys because it's easy, quick, and you can change it up with just a few different ingredients.

So Get a stir fry pan or a wok with a lid. You can do a lot with this pan. Once you have that you can head to the grocery. Generally you want a protein, vegetables, sauce/seasonings, and maybe the option of some type of carb or starch. Boneless skinless chicken breasts are a good start. Then veggies - broccoli, mixed stir fry veggies, whatever you want. Frozen is fine and much easier. Then sauces. These are probably next to the salad dressings. Maybe some teriyaki, pesto, or tikka masala. If you want get rice or some sort of pasta. That will require another pot though. Also grab some vegetable oil.

When you're ready to cook, cut up the chicken into bite size pieces. Put a small amount of oil in the pan and turn on the burner to half to 3/4. Put the chicken in and stir every now and then until it's cooked fully. You may need to drain some of the juices out. Next add the veggies and put the lid on. Stir and drain as necessary. When those are all cooked put the burner on low and add your sauce. Stir that up, put the lid back on and wait 5-10 mins or so. Put that in a bowl on its own or over some rice/pasta. Once you get the hang of it you can start to get more creative but this is what I make for myself 2-3 times a week. It's fairly healthy and make good leftovers. I feel ya. I eat the same thing for lunch and dinner for three days in a row and then switch. Craigslist is good for finding appliances. Of course they have been used, but sometimes you can find something close to new... and cheap!As someone who gone hungry before it is outrageous that you would throw perfectly good food away. Order less, eat the leftovers like someone who has a lick of gratitude, give it away to someone else (a homeless person, a broke intern, somebody) or go without. Did someone not raise you right? That made me legitimately unhappy.Food safety in the US is micromanaged to death. I cant tell you the amount of high quality BBQ Ive gotten from my boss cuz he is under the impression that cooked meat spoils after 3 days... Wrapped and fridge kept!
He's spending $1000 in restaurants. He can afford a fridge.:)Oh good! :) Do you have any ideas?


Also, maybe keep an eye out for super simple ways of cooking?

Ex: I make mashed potatoes by adding butter, diced potatoes into a pot, stirring until the potatoes are covered, then topping the whole thing off with chicken stock. When the excess water is boiled off, I have super soft mashed potatoes. Cheap, healthy, quick, easy, very tasty, and didn't give me gas! I just followed this recipe and it turned out great! This is fantastic and exactly what I was looking for in this subreddit! Thank you!!!

Edit: The recipe also gave me enough for 4 meals which will save me time tomorrow!Dude, if you can afford this much on food each month, there is practically no basic fridge outside of your budget.

You need to reevaluate what you think is worth your money(you mentioned before that a fridge is there to keep lettuce cold, while being totally okay with spending large amounts of money on eating out. You're an adult. Make a list of pros and cons. Grow up), then man up and you know, get a fridge, and go to the grocery store. flour* sorryI used to do that too! It's super nice getting nice home-made food all the time without having to cook every day&gt; It's hard to believe, but i've always subscribed to idea that it's cheaper for one to just buy a prepared meal at a restaurant then go out and buy $20-$30 for stuff to cook some thing.

I just have to ask ... were you raised in a wealthy household?

Because I just can't imagine this mindset from a functioning adult who wasn't waited on hand and foot growing up.First get a fridge, a decent one will cost you one month food budget's worth.

And second, YouTube.  Whatever you want to make, look it up and follow along.  Don't understand the word saute?  Look it up, there's a thousand videos about sauteing.  Maybe watch a couple to get more info/different perspectives.  The video recipes are awesome because they will give you and idea of what the steps look like and what the food should look like.  The best ones will teach a little technique along the way.  One of my favorites is Chef John, his youtube name is foodwishes.  To be honest, most of his dishes will be overly complicated for you at first.  But it's easier than you and once you have the basics down, you'll be good and I've yet to be disappointed by his recipes. He's also a classically trained chef so you get some good techniques that are used in the restaurants you've been living off of.

Also, Alton Brown's Good Eats is on Netflix and elsewhere.  He approaches cooking in a more technical way, explaining what's actually going in the process.  It's really helpful for more analytical, technically minded people.

You gotta eat, you might as well eat good food (and not pay an arm and a leg for it).I'd recommend asking for edits but not letting anyone edit it.  That could get messy. Yes, but babies aren't lactose intolerant.

For example, lactose intolerance is defined as "Lactose intolerance is the inability of **adults** to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and to a lesser extent dairy products"

it's the first line on Wiki...Mint.com


give it your bank and credit card login credentials and it pulls the data. You have to sort shit like that purchase at walmart that was lightbulbs from groceries to household but its pretty solid.


its prety helpful.  It alerts me when bills are due as wellGet some nice tupperware. Crockpot + tupperware will help you portion things out.Thanks bro!


Pm sent about that other thingCan I ask what you use to categorize your spending?I dont really have shit to get dirty. 5 things in a pantry and plastic cups in my cabinets arent really screaming "dirty slob". I dont take left over home and I dont cook in my house. Its actually incredibly spotless. My spare bedroom is kind of cluttered with my home office and fishing shit on the walls and camping gear in the closet though. But theres nothing just lying about. Okay, here's what I think.

It's great you are buying a fridge, that's step one, but honestly, it's going to be a huge shock, if it's not an emergency, just go one step at a time, pick something, watch a few youtube videos on how others make it, do some shopping, make it happen.

If you go from eating out every day, to never doing it, it's going to be super rough, figure out what you can do well, easily, and then grow from there.
I, in fact, just did.Yeah thats crossed my mind a couple times today..I'll take 1 week worth of groceries please.... ill circle back around


*drives away from pharmacy windiw*Ice makers are overrated
if i were you i'd invest half of that 1k a month on cooking classesFreeze it, and it will never go bad :)Not a bad ideam you cross post itHahIve been hitting up cooking apps and youtube channels all night so farI like a pulled beef burrito, and it cooks up well in a large batch and freezes beautifully.

I take a large roast, chuck roast is my favorite, throw it in the crockpot with some water and beef bouillon (I actually use Better Than Beef Bouillon and love it) and a couple cans of green chiles.  It goes great with just beans and some pepper jack cheese.Are you an ex girlfriend of mine?I don't even eat $225 worth of groceries in one *month.* That buys a ton of food for me.

Your going to need a fridge. For sure. You're not going to be able to eat healthy without one.

Check out budgetbytes.com for some great recipes. Lately, I've been eating baked chicken a lot.

http://everclevermom.com/2014/05/easy-weeknight-paleo-chicken-best-drumstick-recipe-ever/I'm sure you've heard this by now, but you should buy a fridge - definitely one that comes with a freezer. Keep a few frozen pizzas or a box of chicken nuggets in there for the one or two nights a week where you don't feel like cooking. Trust me, you will feel like that sometimes, and $5 for a frozen pizza is a lot better than $15 for a carry-out one.You can also just put corn kernels in any old paper bag with a bit of EVO and put that in the microwave and boom you have popcornWash them, dry them, freeze them on a baking sheet. Optionally cover baking sheet with freezer paper or parchment paper.

I prefer to take them off the stem first, but it works either way.lolI bought a box of frozen chicken at Costco. Went to open it two months later (I had been out of town), it was a frozen solid block and I couldn't get anything out of it.

I wen to go return it to Costco, put it on the counter, an open box, seals gone, and said "I want to return this, I bought it a few months ago and I don't have a receipt."

The guy smiled, said okay, let me look up that receipt for you. Then he gave me my cash and said have a nice day. No questions asked about anything.

Best return policy ever.
When I looked at Sams Club for the things that I would buy at the grocer, the unit price was higher, and they only carried brand instead of generic.

Then again, I was looking for Peanut butter and Oats.Where do you buy 50 pounds of flower?I've wondered if that was worth it, I'll have to give it a try. Late to the party, but fellow single, high-earning guy here. I suggest cooking once per week.

First, pick something you really want to eat. For example, lasagna. Look through some recipes online and pick one you like.

Go to the store and buy everything you need. Don't forget a pot for boiling noodles. Strainer. Lasagna pan. Measuring cup. Measuring spoons. Knife. Big spoon. Plastic containers for leftovers. Also buy all the ingredients including the spices.

Next Saturday or Sunday, follow the recipe. Not sure about something like how to brown beef or slice mushrooms? Youtube it.

That night you'll have a lasagna feast and it will be good.

Put the leftovers in single-portion plastic containers. You'll get a few more meals from your lasagna. If the first lasagna was good, why not have it for dinner tomorrow night? Maybe switch it up by picking up some garlic bread or a salad on the way home.

The first one might cost you $100. But you also bought (and used) some kitchen equipment.

OK, now the important part. Do the same thing the next weekend, but make something different. Beef stew perhaps.

Do this for two months and your kitchen will be in order and you'll know how to cook eight things.

Good luck out there. Lol you have got to be kidding me. How did you get this far in life?What about those of us who can't afford one? My apartment came equipped with a shitty mini-fridge that only freezes everything, and pretty much all my paycheck goes to bills and rent.I like Goldfish. 150 calories per 55 fishies. Can't beat that!at least get a mini-fridge! with all the money you save making your own food, the fridge will pay for itself :)China Town and Kensington Market were my places of choice when I lived in Toronto. That and No Frill's for canned goods (e.g. beans).Not sure if it was mentioned, but you can get away with very few items to start. Fridge is definately a necessity, but beyond that Ikea and other places sell "starter kits" which usually have some pots, pants, boards, knives etc.

Additionally if you don't know how to cook take a look at your local Y. Mine is offering cooking classes where they teach you basic knife skills etc. Not sure about how much, though I think it's &lt;$100 and a pretty good investment if you really do start from scratch and don't know how to cook an egg or burn water.Maybe I'm a bit desensitized.  I see people in /r/personalfinances who spend just as much as food, but they have a fridge, and they're also $30k in credit card debt, have no savings, and they're pretty sure they're ready to start the process of buying a home.  OP is a lot better off than a lot of people I give budgeting and financial advice to.I don't blame you for gas phobia. I once saw someone with a badly burned face and he said it was from gas range explosion. His advice was use electric.My mother is allergic to dairy, gluten, tomatoes, and onions. She makes her own almond milk and says it's awesome and cheaper! But it does required some super nice blender she just got for x-mas.

I don't know the whole process but you soak the almonds overnight to skin them and then just blend them up with X amount of water. You need that special blender to make it not as grittyI spend almost $30week in food. Healthy fresh food. I cook on sunday for the work week. you can do what we do in Asia, just leave the food out if its safe. Almost anything will keep for at least 12 hours unless your in blistering heat. Most meats here have been sitting in ~90 degree heat for many days and no locals get sick.I prefer lentils and rice, khichidi style. It's cheap, filling, and delish. My family frequently makes 3 bean chili with added TVP on Sundays, since it's cheap, delicious, and filling. Everyone can have seconds or thirds!Yeah, but for 6 people, not one person like OP. So 33/week per person.Rice soup, or congee. Cook rice, and then add stock and cook more, until it's soupy. Mashed potatoes, etc. Soft tofu, heated up, with a dash of soy sauce on it.
Indian might not be your speed, so I'm not going to recommend it. The place where you're fucking up is realizing a meatloaf will feed one person for multiple meals. At least 3-4.

So yeah you could spend $12 on Jimmy John's or the same amount on a meatloaf.... but the Jimmy John's is $12/meal and the meatloaf is $3-$4/meal.

Shiitake dashi is something you can make yourself by simmering dry shiitake mushrooms in water or vegetable stock. It's good to use in place of the regular dashi.
Depending on what store you go to, you can get miso that doesn't have bonito or fish added to it. I've had more luck at organic stores, and places like wegmans.Soak them overnight, then use a pressure cooker. I would use stock instead of water for pressure cooker. To piggyback on your comment: OP, you don't even have to buy that much meat, it's just cheaper in whole form. There's a counter for that at most grocery stores, and TJ's has deli meat prepackaged. I prefer dark miso. Brown rice, black rice, barley... The rich flavor is amazing, and shiitake mushroom compliments it very well. When I was in college, I would top rice with a dollop of miso and a little bit of butter. Probably my weirdness/borderline malnourishment.Months of wages saved up will not help you if the company goes under, or you get injured, and you're living on a fixed income without a fridge and the knowhow to boil pasta. You are spending nearly my entire monthly rent, weekly. You have a 15 year mortgage and less than a year's wages saved up, yet you're spending more than your mortgage payment (assuming it's in the pie chart) on eating out.

Go get a saucepan, some heat source, and at least some Progresso soup. If you really want to get fancy, get some bread to eat with it.


You can usually find some on craigslist/kijiji! They're a lot cheaper! The worst you might have to do is bleach the heck out of what you get.Scrambled eggs. You can make them the night before, store them in the fridge, and heat them up in the morning if you are careful to undercook them a bit. They'll finish in microwave.I don't think slob is totally warranted... Sounds like he's very clean, almost a germaphobe if he thinks left overs kept in a
fridge are gross.Lol that's crazy. I buy motorcycles off kijiji (Canada uses it more than vraigslist but same type of site) a lot and same deal. "Decent condition" motorcycle = a frame from one bike an an engine from an entirely different type of bike.sooo....200 a weekNot quite the same but I'll eat on things until they get moldy or start to smell bad. When things go bad they go bad quick and you know it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

I know it's been said but I think it bears repeating. OP, get over your aversion to leftovers. Cooking single size portions is a lot harder than cooking things that'll last a few days. Therefore you're making it harder to get healthy. Agreed! What are the soups?I cook up a double batch of a similar recipe to this [this one](http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-inexpensive-lentil-tacos-304604).  It takes the water longer to boil off with a double batch.  Scramble a dozen eggs and toss some cheese on when you roll them up,  and you've got a dozen breakfast burritos ready for the freezer and/or microwave.I'm removing your post because it links directly to a recipe website.  You can make a text post containing the entire formatted recipe and a link to the source but you cannot link directly to the website.  There are tips on formatting your recipe in the sidebar. Okay, skimming replies, I don't think a lot of people are touching on something: it's not about the money for you. Probably the subreddit bias, ha.

Lots of people have given you really great advice about what to buy ingredients wise, but if you get a basic Costco membership (assuming there's one near you) you can stock up on groceries all at once place. (You need a fridge. Just get one.) Easy way to go about it is try as many of the free samples you can to get an idea of what you think you can eat for a while.


Then do a quick search for simple recipes and if you're interested, pick up a few of those ingredients. Build a little ingredients web. That should about cover variety. If you need help easing into something, Costco has lovely pre-cooked meals or components to help your way. (Like chicken-noodle soup, roasted chicken, etc.) Bulk may or may not be your friend depending on how much food you eat though.Hey, Lots of great advise in here but i'll add my two cents.

Things I buy and Cook as a college student that are quick and cheap and healthy:

instant oatmeal, storebrand.
a big bag of potatoes
a big bag of onions
peanut butter
bananas
frozen veggies (my grocery store sells premade mixes like a stiry fry veggie mix or individual veggies )
frozen chicken breasts
tortillas
canned beans (sometimes 99 cents at my store)
pasta
canned pasta sauce (not white sauce! that stuff is literally butter, milk, and cheese)

You'll probably want a fridge. Maybe even a little college dorm sized one that alot of people have? Those usually have a little freezer in them too. It wouldn't be the best thing but it'd be cheaper than a full size one.





Not a vegetarian, but I'd be interested in this as long as the recipes are both cheap and healthy.  I've got environmental concerns.i love these so much but they hurt my teeth :( You could do Parkay Spray. I don't want to know what's in it, but it tastes butter-ish and it's very low cal.&gt; I also love really crunchy, crisp grapes.

Try frozen grapes sometime.I would suggest keeping food in the work fridge since you seem to be there more than at home, and/or keeping veggies which can be stored outside of a fridge at home and some canned protein sources like tuna.

Getting out of the office is important. Is there a park near by, or a comfortable spot outside somewhere which is good for people or pigeon watching? Make the break about the place and stimulate your senses with trees and a breeze rather than relying on expensive food. Bring a wrap, salad or a picnic to eat in your spot.


You dont need a fridge for tomatoes (theyre better out of the fridge) carrot (store them in a cool cupboard in a brown paper bag), capsicum (buy them fresh and they last forever), red onion, or kale (keep it in a vase with some water, it will last forever). All of those go great shredded in a wrap.  Make it in the morning, throw a can of tuna on there (use one of the ones with flavorings like mustard and mayo), it will take maximum 10 minutes (note-the veg wont last outside of the fridge once cut, so use it all or snack on the rest while making the wrap. Bonus healthy start to breakfast). For the picnic, pack some celery sticks (the vase trick works for them too), some peanut butter or tahini to dip them in, tomatoes, fruit, crackers, whatever.

Can you keep stuff in a work fridge? If you can, you can buy better proteins like a bbq chicken, smoked salmon, cheese, plus a bag of salad greens, and some aioli, and throw together a wrap or salad before heading out to your lunch spot or home for your commuting dinner. You can also keep milk in there and have porridge for breakfast at work.

Is that kind of food appealing at all? I can help you make a list and meal plan based on this if it would help.Can confirm.  I used to deliver appliances for Lowe's.Step one: get a fridge.ive had a hard time finding it, personally.  and it's still covered in plenty of oil.This is a great suggestion. Even more so considering that I don't generally make enough of sides. Leftovers are just extra of the main course and can definitely be repurposed for other meals. Thanks for sharing! There are many reasons why a woman might not be able to breastfeed. Sometimes formula is a requirement not a choice. Seriously?  He doesn't own a fridge, spends $12k a year on eating out, clearly has no sense of personal responsibility or decision making skills. Any reasonable adult is going to run like hell from this guy. Every where I've found sells it at about the same price. I guess there's not much profit margin in formula. If you know of any place I'd greatly appreciate it. Couple of more months then we will switch over to almond milk or lactose free milk. It will literally save us 300/month.My family sighs over leftovers. I try to change
them up. If I roast a chicken, I'll make a chicken
soup or stew with what is left over the next day.
I use rice or egg noodles for the starch. Same for a
beef roast but I like to add some barley for the stew.
So it's not the SAME meal they had yesterday, but
it passes as a "new" meal for them. I don't waste
the food I buy, and they have new different meals from
the same main ingredient. I think the saying for this is
"cook once, eat twice". so far works for me!I'm in Florida. I shop pretty much at Walmart weeks to week. In the kindest possible way, I urge you to suck it up and buy a fridge and a few cooking supplies. I don't know what your long term plans are, but if they involve a spouse or every having kids, you should at least learn some basics. And not to mention the fact that you can eat much healthier at home. So it's an investment in your long term future and you may even find it fun!

Actual cooking is easy now with tons of recipes with step by step directions online. Start with small easy things that can be staples and branch out from there.

Get 1-2 lodge cast iron pans. They can go in the oven and are super cheap. Buy one cookie sheet. Get some kitchen towels or oven mitts for handling the cast iron and cookie sheet. Get two pairs of kitchen tongs because those things are super useful. Get a silicone spatula or two and a big spoon. Get 1-2 cutting boards, a decent knife for chopping - doesn't have to be expensive - and a microplane because fresh grated cheese and citrus zest both bring wonderful flavors to a meal.

Lots of veggies are delicious just tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper (I use lemon pepper) and roasted at 425 until they just start to char - usually 20-40 min depending on the veggie and thickness of cut. You can do this with carrots, potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, beets, Brussels sprouts, etc. if you want to get fancier, shred some Parmesan on top when it comes out of the oven and some lemon juice/zest. Or drizzle some balsamic vinegar on there. (You can buy pre-made balsamic reduction which is convenient and delicious.)

Grilling chicken is dead easy. A foolproof method is to put a pan on med-high with a fat (olive oil, bacon fat, whatever) and let the chicken brown for a few minutes without moving it. Then flip it, put a lid on it, and set heat to low. Don't touch it, don't look at it, don't take lid off. After 10 minutes, keep lid on and just turn off heat and leave it on the warm burner for another 10 minutes. Trust me. It will be perfectly cooked, juicy, and will taste chickeny instead of like a flavorless puck.

Breakfast? For week days hard boil some eggs in advance. Bonus - you can take them to go. Put eggs in a pan and bring to full boil. Then turn off heat, put a lid on and leave them for 12 minutes. Transfer to cold water to cool and then put in fridge. Done.

Scrambled eggs take 2 minutes and you can jazz them up with diced onions/peppers, feta cheese, tarragon, etc. Eggs are good for you. Spend the extra buck on free range omega-3 ones.

Weekend breakfasts? Line your cookie sheet with parchment paper - not wax paper - and throw some bacon on it. Put it in a cold oven and set temp to 425. Check in 20 min or when it starts to smell bacony. It will probably be almost done. If you use thick cut bacon (recommended) it will be more like 25-30 min. When it seems close to being done, push some of the bacon aside, and crack some eggs on the sheet. Bake another 6-7 minutes until eggs yolks just start to glaze over. Boom, perfect, chewy bacon and the creamiest sunny side up eggs ever. When you have that down and can eye your bacon's doneness, experiment by throwing in other stuff, like asparagus or make a sweet potato hash to cook with the bacon. (Just be ready to rescue your bacon if the other stuff needs more time than you guessed.)

Baking breakfast is SO easy, textures are better than pan cooking (bacon cooks evenly, you won't overlook the egg) and it looks all artisanal and pretty coming out of oven. Plus 0 minutes spent bent over a hot stove getting splattered with grease. You will feel like an accomplished badass, pulling it out of the oven.

Also, get a slow cooker. If you really can't handle leftovers, a small cheap $20 one will do. But I think you should consider a bigger one. You don't have to eat the same thing the next day. For example, I cooked a whole chicken in mine this week with carrots and potatoes and then the next day I shredded the leftover meat and mixed it with some tomatillo sauce, Mexican cheese and some sauted onions and peppers and threw it in a parchment lined cast iron pan and warmed it up in the oven. Two delicious, totally different meals and less than 15 min prep for both. You can do pork shoulder and cook it with minimal seasoning and have a hearty roast one night and BBQ pulled pork the next.

A rice cooker might be useful as well. Throw some rice on, stir fry a protein, toss in some veggies, and there's a healthy meal.

Just find a couple go-to easy recipes, get comfortable with them, and use them as a base to experiment from. Make a goal to eat dinner at home ____ days a week, then work breakfast in there and then if you really get on a roll you can start making meals ahead of time, upping your goal number of meals at home, and planning lunches. If you have time, spending a couple hours in the kitchen on the weekend pre-cutting veggies and making things ahead of time can make life much easier. And make a habit of cleaning your kitchen every night. It's impossible to keep up the habit of cooking daily if your work area is a mess.

If you start to have fun with this, you may want to get a high powered blender for easy breakfast smoothies loaded with healthy stuff, making soups - which you can make ahead and freeze - and for making stuff like hummus. Would you quit judging the guy and help out? He's admitted he wants to change and is asking for tips, not to be kicked.Thanks! I make a lot of soup and it never occurred to me to throw some in there!With the limited material we have available  there is no way to truly know the situation. So if we were in a bar I would buy you a beer for your polite and reasonable stance.

I would like to point out that most of his answers are excuses rather than action. Which is an indication of an addictive behavior. He doesn't even own a fridge!

In the end I want to help.  From what I read, he is either a troll or has a serious issue. To hammer the point home, we often have posts on how to live on $25 dollars a week or so.  Maybe OP doesn't need to live that cheaply, but at $250+ per week eating out, he could buy your suggested inventory today, and still come out way over budget for a thread like that.  And it's a one time expense.That must be some bitchin soup. Thank you!!I think you should try it on r/frugal.

They will be far more encouraging and helpful
than what I'm seeing here.Probably already mentioned but /r/slowcookingI'd pair that with things that are pretty strong flavored as well: dried fruit, nuts, mushrooms, citrus, bay, asparagus...

Turkey as a protein, definitely. Scanning through my cookbooks I'm seeing a lot of shrimp as well.

You could cut it with brown and/or white rice if the flavor is too strong and make a pilaf! Throw it in some poultry-based soups as well.I realize this seems uncommon today but back in the 70's I remember my mom cooking for a bachelor who didn't know how to cook. The only thing he knew how to fix was canned soup, so don't feel too bad. The key thing is that you've realized you could save money cooking so you are willing to try something to change your habits. Good for you!

Here are some suggestions to help you out, I know it seems intimidating to try and plan entire meals when you have no idea how to cook. Pick out what might work for you and just be willing to new things. Here is the fun thing, with Youtube you can find videos and watch how other people make things. Find a video on how to make scrambled eggs, or fry up hamburger and see how it's done, that may help to remove some of the intimidation factor.

 * Make a list of the kinds of foods you like. Do you like veggies, or do you prefer meats? How about fruits, pastas, breads, rice, how do those fit in? Don't think too much about it, just jot down some foods you like, this will help you in finding recipes that you like.
 * You can cook for yourself and still cook unhealthy food. I recommend getting familiar with the food groups, portion sizes, etc. Again, Youtube is your friend or see if there is an adult education class where you can learn this information and ask questions. This is to help you figure out portions, what will help keep you doing well, etc.
 * Look for a cookbook for children. I recommend this because you have no experience cooking and a cookbook like this would fit with your experience. As an added bonus, you might find information about nutrition that will also help you. I still have my children's cookbooks from 4-H just for reference.
 * Since you are just starting out you probably don't have the interest right now in taking a lot of time to cook. So check out the box dinners aisle, the canned soups, etc. The dinners are usually pretty simple to fix and have good instructions on the side.
 * Don't worry about starting off with a lot of cooking pans, you can get by pretty simply. And they don't have to be new. I recommend getting a small sauce pan (1 qt), a larger sauce pan (2 qt to 3 qt), a skillet, spatula, stirring spoon, one or two knives for slicing, measuring cups, measuring spoons and a cookie sheet. There are other items you will want to get as you get more experience but these very basic items will get you started. Check in thrift stores, don't worry about getting them new for right now, unless you are worried about using old items.
 * When you get a refrigerator, you can start planning for left overs. I understand about not liking a lot of leftovers, I don't like the texture and they seem odd. However, some foods work as leftovers, I fix up a batch of veggies, herbs and some ground meat every other week for my lunches. I freeze half and then eat on the other half for the week. The items I pick don't get that soggy texture that I don't like so I don't mind eating on them for the entire week. As a treat, I then eat out from work once a week, because it is nice to get out of the office.
 * When looking at the cost for items, remember that you will get multiple servings. For example, for the meatloaf recipe you quoted a price for, you would probably get at least 3-4 meals from it. Don't like leftovers? Then freeze part of the hamburger, fix up enough for one serving, then fix up everything fresh when you want a new batch.
 * Have patience with yourself, and remember you don't have to train to be a chef, you just want to learn how to cook some things for yourself so you have more money to spend in other areas. I've been cooking since I was very young and it's only in the last 7 years that I've gotten comfortable with it. Start simple and gradually add things. Every little bit you can do, even if it's just one or two meals a week will help.

Good luck to you.You probably eat much healthier than I do. lol

I also go to the grocery store much more frequently. I don't have a car so I only pick up a bag or two of groceries at a time. Some months are more than others when I run out of certain staples and that month was a particularly low one.  One of my favorite meals is chicken and rice, and it can be both healthy and very filling!  Unfortunately you'll need a way to grill/bake/saute chicken and a small pot to heat the cream of chicken sauce.

All you need is some chicken breasts, instant/regular rice, cream of chicken, and salt and pepper.  If you want to toss some veggies in there, go for it!  You cook the chicken, make the rice, and heat the cream of chicken into a nice creamy sauce (adding a *pinch* of salt and some pepper/other spices) and then just combine to make a pretty darn good meal, in my opinion.  Give it a try!$165/mo on groceries? Wow. I spend that much on one trip, usually more, and I go once every week or two. And it's just my girlfriend and I, and we cook simple dinners/lunches.Straight upYou don't own a fridge?  You are the 1%Is this mixed wild rice (brown rice with wild rice) or straight up wild rice?Many grocery stores will pick out your groceries for you and have it waiting for pick-up. It comes at a price, but that doesn't seem to be a factor. Good luck. Here's one with a good overview from Serious Eats/River Cottage:

http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/09/nasty-bits-offal-deviled-kidneys-recipe.htmlHave you searched online for cheaper buying options for the baby formula? I feel like that there must be a site you can get it cheaper Yes, but a huge portion of humans are lactose intolerant (especially in certain areas -- a huge number of japanese are, for example, iirc) and don't know it. Also, certain women have medical issues that make breast feeding impossible. Also, adoption. Even a mini-fridge works, especially if you don't want to invest in a full-sized one. We have one at our house in England and it helps us keep from buying too much and having things spoil. Sometimes I think it would make my life easier having my own mini rather than sharing one with other people.My meals during my bachelor days by super easy, super fast, as little cooking as necessary and not much money. Try starting here.

* ramen - add water, microwave, some ramen you gota add boiling water to (gota use a pot)
* mac'n'cheese - couple different kinds, but the hardest of them you just boil the noodles and add whatever it says
* microwave meals - stouffers is your new fast food, insert into microwave, insert into microwave and enjoy your feast, kind of pricy (but much less than eating out!)
* pasta - pick any pasta and any canned sauce. Boil the pasta for however long the box says, microwave some sauce and put it on the pasta. You wana get crazy; mix and match the canned sauces, throw ground cheeses in it (any really, white cheeses are best), put a little olive oil in it
* texas pete - texas peat isn't a meal, it's what makes meals. Buy any meat at all, put texas pete on it and cook it in the oven for however long google says to cook it. Salt's pretty good too.
* crock pot - just put some meet in it with bbq sauce and it'll come out awesome, let it cook on low all day long
* milk - milk is awesome for when everything above is too more effort, just drink several cups and it's basically a balanced meal. Blend it with protein powder, chocolate, oats, peanut butter, bananas and/or basically any fruit for variety and more calories.
I can also attest to the instant pot. It's fantastic.  I got mine as a Christmas gift. It's rad.  It slow cooks, rice cooks, and steams as well as any dedicated device.  I also made yogurt in it once; I've never made yogurt before but it was pretty good.

Pressure cooking though, is on another level.  Dried beans cooked in 20 minutes at pressure (30 min overall?).  The other day I tossed in some broth, diced potatoes, diced carrots, a few raw chicken legs,  dried split peas.  15 min at pressure and I could peel the meat off the bones with a fork, and I had some pretty great chicken soup.

I've heard good things about using one to cook tough cuts of meat, so that might be my next adventure.Yes! Paper bags also travel easily to work. Plus you can flavor it however you'd like.
