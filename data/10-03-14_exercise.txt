this is inappropriate. If you were really concerned you could inbox her instead of putting it up in a bid to win some fucking karma. Congrats! Awesome progress.Just a few hints:
Do they have small plates and large plates?  If so, grab a small plate each time.
Find the food that is closest to it's original form (less processed), ie, take baked chicken over chicken nuggets.
Avoid meats and pastas covered in cheese and/or white sauces.Thank you for the encouragement! Congrats on your progress!
I still look in the mirror and see 220 lbs me. I don't know why. I have to physically put my pictures side by side in order for me to recognize a difference. However, from my photos, there seems to be a huge change in my face. It's bizarre.

What are you doing that's helping you get fit? How long have you been at it?Really fast weight loss like that is often glycogen loss.  Your body stores glycogen in the liver and muscles as energy, and that glycogen is packaged in a significant amount of water.  When you go on calorie restriction like that, your body uses up the glycogen stores and you lose water the glycogen was packaged in - this alone can cause several pounds of weight loss without any additional fat loss.

 If you feel like 1500 calories a day is truly unpleasant, maybe aim a little higher, like 1700 or something.  You want to pick a strategy that you can keep with forever, even if your weight loss is more gradual that way.  You might find that the symptoms will normalize over time.It did, I was full the rest of the afternoon :) Thanks!! I try not to stress it, but it's a process! I'll start going for walks now that the snow has started to melt, the up-keep of the roads around where I live during winter is subpar.

How do you "justify" to yourself the time you take out of the day to exercise instead of studying? I always feel guilty when I do something that isn't studying during exam periods...I started a selfie project too! I think it's a great idea. I think one of the ways we stay fat is by lying to ourselves about how we look. If you can make yourself look at and accept who you are, change comes naturally. wow!.. good job!. keep it up.

http://i.imgur.com/caJyO1I.jpgThank you and I will check out all the local hotels.At home we've done a pretty decent job of eliminating the HFCS. WE'e also been going toward organic. I think a lot of the difference is being stuck in a vehicle so much for me and not cutting my caloric intake.Good morning. Here with you as always.

My pledge for today:

* I will not order or buy junk/fast food, especially not at the end of the day, when I will probably feel exhausted and stressed by the amount of work I have to do this weekend.
* I will log all my meals.
* I will stay within my allotted calories.
* I will eat the healthy snacks I bought to keep me strong and focused on my job.
* I will stay hydrated (8+ glasses of water).
* I will take active breaks, get off my desk, stretch and walk a little.

Good luck to everyone and thank you for this.You look great! Awesome job. Also, I feel you on the selfies. I'm only down 20 lbs (40+ to go), and I can't stop admiring my own face! I think I'm fascinated that it's actually working.I was an equal opportunity beer lover, but I agree I like the benefits of no beer more.Why do people disagree with this method. I assume that after a series of successful full days,  you have the momentum to keep going for longer, "now a full week..." etc. maybe you have forgotten what normal looks likeI suppose... but I'd only need to lose 40-50 lbs, not sure if that would make much of a difference.Not trying to start an argument here, but.... That's a really personal comment to make to someone, and honestly I don't think you really have any business calling that out based on one picture. The after picture appears to be at perfect "selfie" angle, which makes people look thinner. Thank you, you might be surprised. I didn't realize I had change much until I saw the older picture.I just keep going. I don't go to the gym period, instead I exercise by going jogging, going to a dance class or playing soccer.

In exam time, I skip the soccer, but still set aside time to go for an evening walk with my partner. Exams can't be an excuse to stress it. I love IPAs and probably drank them the most.

My favorite beers are stouts. Its just harder to find a good stout on tap where I live.I'm sorry, this is off-topic, but I love your username! Also, keep on keeping on. We've all been there. As long as you get back on the wagon you're winning!I swear someone should make  a combined app for women that tracks weight loss like MFP and our cycles with warning messages for impending bloat. How is it that every three to four weeks out blows my mind? This time six pounds melted off as I started my period. I think I'm going to start putting a star on my birth control pills miss cycle with a warning.Thank you :)Probably forever. I have blood sugar issues. Beer tends to spike it worse then other alcohol.

I still have it at October fest or st Patricks day, but it used to be my go to drink.Look up your BMR, and using this http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/ I got a BMR of 1931.8, so from that calculation if you want to bulk up while losing weigh as well you should stay above that. People generally recomment a calorific decifit of 500 calories, so stay around 2000 kcal/day.

Also you can't lose fat in specific spots. You'll lose fat where your body takes the fat from. The fat on your stomach may be last to go. Great job! You're stunning by the way! I think you are looking for http://ilostwhat.com/

Congrats on the 20 lbs!I still occasionally drink, but beer spikes my blood sugar too much. I could probably drink ultra light beers, but that's just wrong.I think you might be looking for [I Lost What](http://ilostwhat.com).are you trying to lose weight? then take "healthy food" out of your vocab. now go read the FAQ, get a food scale, and start counting calories. you can make a lot from the basic staples: milk, bread, egg, cereal, fruit, peanut butter, rice, beans, canned/frozen/fresh fruits and vegetables, canned pasta sauces, nuts, condiments, canned tuna, canned chicken, deli meats and cheeses, cottage cheese, yogurt, grits, ice cream. get some frozen foods or dry-packaged snacks with reasonable caloric contents that you can just throw in the microwave. you can microwave eggs, you can make salads, you can get premade bacon and chicken to just pop in there too. you can boil water with your kettle so you can make pasta and rice or even hardboiled eggs.Thanks, I do know this.

I do not eat very much and what I do eat is *usually* very healthy (the main vice here is alcohol). However, I've gained weight as a result of medication.  I'm off the meds now and am no longer gaining weight, but I'm not losing any either. I think a quick diet to shed the new weight followed by my normal diet should be fine.I live by exrx.net! Good luck!Are you happy with your current lifestyle, your current weight, and the way you currently look?Just a little advice here...

You shouldn't avoid sugar, it's necessary for your body's functions.

What you want to avoid are: aspartame (neurotoxin), corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup (imitates the hormone that tells your body "I'm hungry go eat something").

The latter of which can really screw you over in a diet since you'll be sitting there going "I think I'll go eat something" even when you are full or not hungry. **Read the ingredients on EVERYTHING.**

Also personally I wouldn't avoid bread (just cut back on it, avoid bread with HFCS) but that's a personal choice.My friend poked fun at me for it by saying I eat like a little bird :P

I find it hard to eat a lot now, given the change from way-too-many-calories to just-enough. Sometimes I'll drink my calories just to get myself up there (homemade smoothie with protein powder in it, the rice/pea kind not the bulking kind) What I do is calculate the amount of calories in the entire box for the mix only. So for example, if there are 1000 calories in the whole box, and you use half the box, there are 500 calories of the mix alone in your pancakes. Then add in the calories for the eggs and stuff. I'd use a food scale if you have one to be as accurate as possible. That way you can weigh out the exact amount of mix you use and calculate the calories from there. I hope this helps! Thank you good person ;~;

I am fainting in high temperatures due to a (medically confirmed) blood sodium drop, characterised by similar symptoms to hypoglycemia, I take salt tablets to stabilise myself but my doctor said try not to overexert in high temps while my hormones try to stabilise or...something

And I'm not omitting oil and sugar because I'm scared of it, ingesting it makes me feel very ill and that is why I keep it to a minimum (and I eat healthy fats like avocados and nuts and white cheese, but I mean like I feel very ill if I eat something fried) No its most defiantly not, 1000 is very low.Sounds like she's just trying to go with what's "normal" and not what is correct.Most days I eat less than 1000 because I guess the sudden change from 2500+ per day to 1200 per day kinda shrunk my stomach?

I try to at minimum eat 1000, because triple digits per day is probably not healthy for me ;~;Never done one of those in my life.. but thanks! Hi there :) It seems to me like you are way too stressed about this whole weight loss thing. Just relax and breathe a little, read some books, watch some movies, get your mind of losing weight a bit. It shouldn't consume you like this. There is no need to be scared, it really is nothing to be afraid of. Your BMI is 25, you are normal. Oil isn't bad for you, read r/keto, we need oil to keep our body healthy.

If you are fainting, you really need to start eating more nutrients to give your body what it needs. Love your body, your stuck with it for life :) Just try to have a healthy mind!You can do it!!nervous intensifies

I just hope that given my lack of exercise I won't come out fat from this and from the occasional times I strayed

tfw legitimate cundishuns Not idea what this diet is but the only "diet" that will help you lose weight is counting calories, plain and simple.Stop. I run half marathons too! I did a few fulls in my early 20s but probably never again. And I love craft beer. Michigan IPAs for the win! We're twinsies, hahaha. Yes you are freaking out over nothing, one day of bad eating doesn't make you fat, and if you eat at 1200 calories a day you will lose weight, slowly but surely. The best exercise I would suggest to help your back are dead lifts, but apart from that just lose weight and hope it gradually gets better.Pseudoscience gimmick.

Just count calories. You answered your own question. Get back on your plan. You are freaking out over nothing. One or two days of going over your deficit will not ruin what you've already accomplished.Wow. Amazing! You're gorgeous!!well, I mean, you don't just develop stage 3 kidney failure overnight, it's classified in stages for a reason, so I doubt the weight loss diet had anything to do with that. why did her doctor not know about the kidney issues before she went on the diet? furthermore, the diet actually sounds quite reasonable but that's a very vague description of a diet. that doesn't explain what she's eating or how much. there's a lot of information missing here. Okay, thanks! Good luck with your last 15 :) In general terms, the healthy amount of weight to lose per week is 1-2 pounds. It is possible to lose more than that per week, some people lose more than that per week without setting it as a goal, but setting it as a goal is not recommended.

You say you feel like you eat too much, but do you **know** if you eat too much? Have you kept track of how many calories you consume and how far that is from what you should eat to lose or maintain your weight? Perception can be deceiving.

It would be sensible to start by establishing some quantifiable facts, such as your current weight, height, and BMI. That way you'll know if your weight is healthy or if you're overweight, and if so, by how many pounds. This will give you a better idea of what your goal should be, and what is the sensible time to achieve that. I think it's definitely a combination of everything happening in your life. Many might see the situation negatively, but I'm sure the possibility of having cancer was met with a lot of fear and anxiety over the future. It's like you got a second chance at life, in a way. I think it also showed you the effect, and downright pain in the ass, an unhealthy lifestyle can have in you're life. It's not quite worth it. I see it all as a blessing in disguise.

You may not even know this, but you're now CHOOSING to not be the victim of your circumstances. Possibly before you just couldn't lose the weight or be healthy for a myriad of reasons. You saw that woman and realized a true desire, and that is one of the first steps of transformation. She may have inspired you, but YOU took action!

This is a little hard to understand, but there is no such thing as time - it's just a perception. The past, present and future all exist in a quantum wave of probability. No one knows yet how, why, or what makes this reality the one we experience when all possibilities exist. But I believe we have a conscious power over this.

Our desires or intentions send strong waves of influence to the "future" and recalculate the quantum wave function. The future in turn sends back information in the form of inspiration to us that we experience as intuition or a gut feeling.  As we learn to quiet our mind from all the internal chatter, that tells us what our opinion should be, judges ourselves or others, thinks about the past/future, etc we are more able to think about our true intentions and listen to our intuition the universe is sending to guide us to fulfil that desire. But thought isn't enough, this whole process influences our actions. And as we shed the limiting beliefs and fear over taking that action, we can say "fuck it, let's go!" and live a life we love!

Good luck and much love to you! Please message me if you need any support at all!

Thank you, and congrats to you too! I'm a week down today and I got to weigh myself (being strict - only once a week) I've lost 7.4lbs, feels so good. I'm so grateful for this subreddit and people like you with your good advice, it really helped for everything to click. We all sound like a crazy cult talking about the "Click" but I am so excited!

I've some cocoa butter upstairs I must start using it. I've also heard exfoliating might help so I must get a shower brush and of course, stay hydrated!

Best of luck in your journey and keep in touch, I want to see skinny birthday pictures :)2lb is fine, you just need to be on a solid deficit. Remember man diet is 80% of it.I totally get what you mean about the phone! I really hate how much power it has over me. Getting rid of IG and fitocracy and all those tracking apps was so freeing. I'm glad I'm not the only one going through this journey! How has the change been for you since your trip? *is it safe?* that depends on how many calories this amounts to every day.
Temporary changes to your diet will only ever give you temporary results. If you're serious about losing weight and keeping it off, you need to look at changing what you eat not just for 15 days but for life. This is definitely the mentality to have. I luckily never got caught in the "exercising to eat back" thought process but I've got some pretty wonky ones in its place. Good luck with your running! "some sort of professional" sounds like a crazy quack.

I hope she's in the hands of actual doctors now. This post makes me sad :(Hahahhahaha I can see it now.. yikes!Yeah, fad diets lead to quick results followed by devastating failure when you go off the diet and regain all the weight.

I don't believe that you read the FAQ's because if you did, you would already have the answer to this and what you should be doing instead. Thank you, that really was inspiring! Today is a good day, my fear of loose skin has subsided and I lost 7.4 lbs this week :) More motivated than ever!you're making things too complicated. read the FAQ. you don't have to follow a fancy diet to lose weight. stop making excuses.2lb a week is too high? funny you should say that as I've looked through other posts on here and multiple people are saying 2lb a week weight loss is great ahaI don't think you should have this much water weight this far out.  Depending on your weight, it can be very unhealthy to lose this fast. We'd need to know stats (age, weight, height, activity level) and average daily calorie counts to know for sure.I've had a big fall too but we can climb back on and we'll get there!I would read the FAQ at /r/fitness and /r/xxfitness and start a beginner's program like Strong LiftsThe difference is you look better than me. Did you tell your trainer that you wanted to be toned? What goal did you tell her? Also, do you recommend a woman or a man for a trainer or it doesn't matter?Hey. You're awesome. For real.When I first started lifting I did hire a personal trainer to write out a plan for me and help me with good form. We worked together for three 1 hr sessions. I basically told her I wanted to get more into heavy lifting, not for competitions or anything but just for its health benefits.
Also you are the exact same height and weight as me so that's kinda cool lolI did this before posting, but found nothing. Can you explain what I missed, please?Your weight loss goal is too high. This is a lifestyle change not a diet. Read or reread the FAQ.Well I think for you the time has come to create a new account... because "halfway there" for sure isn't accurate anymore! :D You look adorable.Read the FAQ.Glad to have you back on the wagon :)Beautiful!  And I'm so jelly of your hair color.
This is why I hate loseit on reddit. This community is unsupportive, mean, sarcastic and rude. Other forums are encouraging, supportive and friendly, all while being critical. It seems like every time I write a comment in this forum I get the same bitter attitudes.
For someone who is overweight, maybe burpees do more for them than an expert, Mr. universe like yourself. It's a great way to bump up the heart rate between toning/weights. But what do I know?Gurl. You look amaaaazing.

Any tips on the power lifting?What?!? Of course it's not normal.

The only person who can advise you both on this is her doctor.Yeah, my concern was not only how It could affect my weight loss but also how it could affect my health, because I'm not familiar enough with how the body processes certain things yet. Brown urine is a sign of too much protein, right? I don't plan on eating more than the 100/110g that's been happening. Also, before I started "dieting" I was eating so much of everything that I'm sure I was eating more than that every day anyway, an never had any problems other than getting fat lol. Maybe that's how I need to compare it.Yup, I just posted a thread about this here the other day. Mine are always a powerless guilt after having "unknowingly" binged.Thank you!  That was last year, I'm trying to get back to that same size again!  I hit that point and figured I could relax a bit, and with summer and all the awesome microbrews around where I live, things got a little iffy.  Add to that switching to training for a half-marathon and I just packed on some fat.  Working on it now, back to intervals and lifting and it's all coming back.

I agree, there's a different kind of support in meeting with other "ex athletes."  Good luck!bit of hoison sauce  &amp; some soy sauce and some freshly grated ginger. mmmmmmmmmmm...

ps if you get ginger peel it, then throw it in the freezer, it keeps perfectly well, just pull it out to grate some then back in the freezer.I was the same, I couldn't figure out why I wasn't losing fat even though I was exercising and eating healthily and its all because I wasn't tracking my food... turns out even I was eating healthy food, i was having far too much of it (3 bananas a day as snacks along with porridge for breakfast and rice for dinner wasn't going to work with a 120g carb goal!!) Since weighing everything and tracking my calories and macros I realized how much I was eating, I was around 200 calories over my TDEE every day even though I ate super healthy.Fantastic. I have to add a "well done" too. A lot of inspiration and keep it up :)

Now I need to get cooking. Because those food pictures... You can dot his! You have the willpower, our support and the support of your awesome wife.

Add me on MFP (audiojister), there's a lot of awesome, supportive redditors over there.This is absolutely incredible and you look amazing. I'm envious of your skin tightening in the neck and lower face; as a fellow loser, I still have a ton of it loose. Did that just happen or did you have to get surgery?I like how you put the "took a break" into quotes because whereas a real break can be benificial, taking a break from striving from your goals is not. At least that's how I interpret it.

Also congrats on rocking that half marathon. The best I could do so far was a 10k in a bit over an hour.

Good luck to you, too :)read the FAQ, figure out your TDEE, do the math, count calories, get a food scale and weigh everything, introduce some exercise once your knee finally heals, profit. So much this. Also, maybe that's an age thing, but I really appreciate bodies that tell a story. Every body is beautiful and I love get to intimately get to know someone with all their scars, moles, wrinkles, etc. Flawless is boring. No haha I'm M/5'10 / SW 200 / CW 169 / GW 165 (will probably lose more though) :) Having to go into surgery must have been really demotivational. But I'm glad to hear that it seems to have worked out fine for you.

I used to weigh myself everyday as well and I have seen those variations of up vs. down in correlation to the foods I ate. I still have to figure out which foods correlate stronger to the down part though. Definitely a thing I will put more focus on in the next few weeks. Thank you for pointing that out!I'd think you're a badass for losing all the weight. I think most guys would. If he's so caught up in looks that the scars are a problem move on to someone who isn't a tool.

Source: I'm a guy.Thanks for the motivation. I weighed myself and it was better than expected (262,68 lbs/119,4 kg...man, I guess I like the kilograms better :P). Anyway, it's time for breakfast and then excercise afterwards.

Thank you again!Thank you so much. I have read your post several times.
I will start using MFP again and stick to it.

And yes, my wife loves to cook, and she loves to cook healthy. She's read a lot about healthy food and healthy way of living. She also run 10km three times a week. She can help me a lot.
I just hope that I can continue with this change in my life and in my eating habits, and not go back.I've got to find if anyone makes this magical low-calorie bread around here...Massive Cold Traffic Conversion Boost (4/26/14) Has Agr Screaming To The Top. Monster As Well... Just Test Your Traffic!I don't think she has an eating disorder. In her before pic, you could still see her cheekbones. I bet they're just very prominent. On a side-note, you look amazing halfwaythere!! Whoa.


(I actually said that out loud)She might just have a very delicate bone structure.

She definitely is unrecognisable compared to her before pic.God damn girl!!!Good work for recognising that you've fallen off, and for setting yourself a goal.
You've done it before so you know you can do it again :)I feel you. I have to track because my memory and instinct are not working :)The good news is that the main tool for weight loss is dietary rather than exercise.  It's a lot easier to cut calories than to burn them.  Of course, you do notice a huge difference if you go from being regularly active all day and having your metabolism run on high from that, but really it only takes a few hundred calories or even just 100 calories overeating per day to pack on pounds over time, so the weight you put on when you become less active can be due to just a seemingly small excess.

I think you need to find a good calculator for daily calories for your height, weight and body fat composition  for a sedentary lifestyle, then track your food.  Don't start out by planning food within some small calorie budget.  Instead, just log what you do eat.  If you want, you can just write it down and put it in a calorie counter at the end of the week.       There you will see where you're going over, and find little things that you can change to go back down.

You don't have to look at it as removing things from your diet, but instead with swapping them out.   Preserve your protein intake for lifting, but look at high carb snacks you have and replace it with something lower carb.   A bag of chips/crisps could be replaced with carrots or edamame ( &lt;3 ) or even just a smaller serving of chips.

Any trick you can find to lower your calorie intake will help, and losing weight will probably let you do more because of less stress on your knee.

Keep lifting because it will help offset your BF% and raise your BMR slightly, and generally just because it can help you feel better.

Good luck.Best way I can think of is - make your own pancake mix! It's just flour egg and milk, you crazy person!

But seriously, see how many calories in the whole pack by weight, say, 200g or something, and divide it by how heavy your 5.5" pancake is. Ie, 200g is 1200 calories, your pancake is 20g therefore divide 1200 by 10. Then if you're using anything other than skimmed milk just add in the calories of your milk.


(I'm wondering if US packages even have total weight calories on them? I have no idea so if this is no help, sorry!)I've been smoking for almost 10 years, I started smoking a vaporizer and haven't even had a craving for a cigarette in months. Now I hardly smoke the vaporizer unless I'm drinking which isn't very often since I'm counting my calories and drinking doesn't really fit into my daily limit.I am so eagerly wanting to hear an answer to this, I have the same issue. I read somewhere a serving was 4 pancakes, but the numbers don't add up, because the box says 1 serving plain mix is 150, but made as to instructions is 250?? But the instructions say to add 1 egg and 1 tbsp oil, which is ~200 cals. So confusing!!Between MyFitnessPal and FatSecret (the only two I've tried) I was more impressed with MFP library of entries. But that was over a year ago. Here is [an article](http://lifehacker.com/five-best-food-and-nutrition-tracking-tools-1084103754) from lifehacker.com about the top five tracking apps. Pros &amp; cons.

What is your lodging when out of town? Many hotels will feature a small gym room or a pool. Or if you use the economic hotels, a closeby higher end one may let you go in and use their gym facilties for a small fee. Source: my husband works in a hotel, lowest rates in town, people stay there and then walk across the parking lot to pay $10 to use the other hotel pool (which is still cheaper than staying at pool fancy hotel). Another hotel thing, I've seen people literally run laps around the hotel my husband works at for their fitness. You could also look into /r/bodyweightfitness for a routine you can do without a gym. Taking priority of taking yourself can happen anywhere. If you decide it HAS to be in a gym that is a limit you are imposing on yourself.

For eating out try to request whole foods at retuarants. Ordering a platter is probably going to be a huge calorie load and not balanced for your nutrient needs. I don't know what you diet like, but ask for the rate of some chicken breast and an apple. Another idea, in the midwest (MN, WI, etc) gas stations have picked up a trend of stocking some pretty good items for food. Like ye olde time general stores. If you ever see a Kwik Trip gas station while traveling you can count on them for some food choices.When I first went vegetarian, I had a dream about mindlessly eating some pork, and I woke up absolutely *horrified* until I figured out it was a dream!

I think this is just your brain confirming that you're on the right track.Okay, I'm going to keep strength training and have 2000 calories a day like you recommend, and yeah I would say I am skinny fat, and I used to be 160lb and have been overweight/skinny fat all my life so that has probably distorted my perception of my body.Cut back on anything with corn syrup/HFCS, lessen your portions (easier after you do the former).

That stuff is pretty nasty (imitates the hormone that makes you hungry) and can be hidden sometimes... even in bread products.

For example, the fast food place "Culver's" has a large selection of burgers, but only one is completely free of HFCS.
This is typical for a LOT of hamburger/hotdog/bread slices; I've even seen HFCS in whole-grain wheat bread.

Ketchup also has HFCS, which is used in a lot of foods.

It might also help to buy ingredients for meals, and mass produce them when you're not working... freeze them and take them into work.

All in all, remember you *can* do this~Okay, I'll try for 2000 calories a day and stop cutting, and I'll keep up my strength trainingPart of me wonders if I have an under-active one... it takes almost nothing to make me feel depressed, feel tired/exhausted all the time, etc.I just wanted to point you to /r/C25K, a great way to start running and a nice structured program to keep you motivated.

Aside from that, well done and good luck with the surgery.ThanksThanksEat less calories then you burn every day - that's it. You can still have the sugar if you want, it's how much that is key.

It's important to learn how many calories you should be eating and how many calories are in the food you eat. For every 500 calories you eat below your TDEE each day you will lose 1lb a week. For your size you could go as high as 2-3 /week.I'm worried you might be too thin for your health. Are you ok? If you need to talk, there is always /r/eatingdisorders. What's your activity level set to on mfp? If you put it as sedentary, then you will "earn" extra cals. But if you've entered yourself as highly active, then mfp will already expect high burns from you. It sounds like your meeting those numbers though since you were only off by 26 cals. But if you change to sedentary, your food cals will drop by a lot since mfp expects less activity from you, and then you will earn a lot of cals back from your workouts. Personally I set it to sedentary cause I'm more pumped when I see I've earned food cals. Hope that makes sense. Just water weight. Don't worry! This is normal. Your weight loss will slow down/begin a steady pace within the next few weeks.2lbs a week is great progress! Keep it up!It sounds like you are on track. Keep doing what you're doing.
Two pounds in a week is really good. This is bang on, I can attribute my 59 lbs lost to this. Make small sustainable changes and keep it simple.

I didn't have to count macros or eliminate foods I liked, I just stuck to the calories.Wow. Thank you. Those were great answers. I have a lot
of the same motivations although my kids aren't hypothetical
anymore. Also, I eat frequently which keeps
me from getting too hungry and overrating garbage. Good luck
and thanks for sharing. Look at the progress YOU have made, not what others have achieved. You are changing your life around and this wont happen in just a few weeks or months so easily.
You could check and readjust your calorie intake, or add in extra exercise.
What exercises do you do ? I find when I am doing kettlebells or lifting, I tone up easily but also lose weight more easily than if I just run. It also makes me appreciate what my body is capable of and then I want to feed it the best nutrients possible.
Actually, no. I'm not counting calories. I know that works for a lot of people, but I don't have the attention span to do that. I try to remember to plug what I eat into my FitBit app, but I think that happens about 33.3% of the time. I like the FitBit; I don't know how accurate it is in the way of calories and all that, but I do enjoy the graphs and visualizations of my progress. That's pretty neat. I also compete with my friends. I'm hugely competitive so that's a driving factor for me.

I was never big on drinking pop. Even moreso now. It's just too damn sweet. I'll have a jack and ginger from time to time, but that's about it. I eat zero fast food. Zero junk food. (I.e., potato chips, donuts, garbage like that. Empty calories.) I will have oatmeal or cereal for breakfast. (Reese's Puffs. I don't feel the need to wake up and eat a super bland cereal. It's a jump start to my day. Chocolate and peanut butter make for a happy day. I only eat a small bowl, anyhow.) my biggest difference is the FREQUENCY at which I eat. So I'll have my breakfast, and then I will eat an arugula and avocado salad for lunch (or something of the sort), I'll have a granola bar or some microwave popcorn in the mid-afternoon, and then some fish or a lean cut of meat paired with a veggie for dinner. I have been huge on salmon lately, and I love pairing it with brussel sprouts or asparagus. Let me tell you, these were two vegetables that I was not keen on to start. You google around, find some good recipes, and some lemon pepper, and we're in business! The longer you eat clean, the more you'll appreciate the vegetables. Cutting out the fast food was the hardest for me. I often work twelve hour days, which makes for a long, long, tiring day. You want to get off, grab something  quick and easy from Taco Bell, and then collapse onto the couch and watch Netflix. Something I've noticed, especially now that I'm more removed from the situation, I've realized that fast food made me feel like SHIT. tired. sluggish. just all around gross. Poison for your body. What I'm doing now is creating genuine fuel my body can use. Doing this fills me with energy, and because I'm eating ALL DAY LONG; I don't ever feel hungry. I also drink a boatload of water. I drink between 75-100 oz depending on the day. A belly full of water makes it hard to stuff yourself with food. I also had a doctor tell me that your body will tell you that it's hungry before it tells you that it's thirsty, so your hunger may ACTUALLY be a sign of dehydration. Also. The more you drink water, the more you crave it. I was never a water drinker until recently. Now I can't get enough. (I'm still a snob; it has to be SUPER cold.)

The reason why is simple. I don't want my weight dictating my life. Sure. I'm a woman. Sure. I want to look good. Sure. I want to be beautiful. We all do. However, my reason is because I want to be able to run and womp with my dogs. Because my future (hypothetical) children deserve a mom that can play with them; not to mention LIVE longer for them. Because I want my back and feet to stop aching incessantly. Because I  want to rock climb. Because I want to hike. Because I want to go spelunking. Because I want to skydive. Because I want to be able to carry my groceries (all in one trip, obviously) to my second story walk-up without getting winded. Because it isn't enough just to be alive... want to LIVE. I don't want my weight to be what is holding me back. I have this thirst for life and adventure; I refuse to let my size be something that  decides whether or not I can accomplish something. My mother also had two heart attacks before she was fifty; I don't want that to happen to me. You're so pretty! You go girl! I had this problem with my dreams pretty bad when I had an eating disorder years ago so my input only goes so far. I only currently started eating healthy after years of binge eating disorder (super common problem for anorexics who recover without professional help) and haven't had one dream about over eating since I started 6 weeks ago. I chalk a lack of those types of dreams  up to the fact I'm much more mentally sound now around my relationship with food.
So just incase you might possibly maybe be a bit on a similar page that I was on when I was anorexic- you might consider for a second that you have some mild mental illness going on. Only something along the lines of your mind getting the flu rather than a full blown disease like anorexia. Only you know if this is what's going on. Researching eating disorders can help you determine if this is something you should be thinking about. In the case you are suffering from a smudge of ED- some deep soul searching about what you're up to with your new lifestyle could help fix up your subconscious. I personally have to meditate on how I feel about my new adventure everyday to keep my mind in check.
Who knows- I'm guessing you'll get plenty of comments assuring you perfectly mentally healthy people have these types of dreams, too :)
Congrats on 4 weeks by the way! TILYou should post this in r/fitness also. Thank you, too. This subreddit is kind as always.Is there a salad bar? That's your best bet. I can say from experience that I never deducted exercise calories from the calories I consumed in a day. If I ate 1,800 in a day and ran off 300 calories I would not eat it the 300 back. I looked at exercise calories lost as a bonus. Great job! Are you counting calories now? Can you say more about
how you did it and why?  I just had a lumpectomy on one of my breasts last month.  It was a fibroadenoma that was over 5 cm in length.  Ask your surgeon questions if you have them and don't be nervous.  There are so many things that can go wrong in daily life that surgery under a controlled environment while you're hooked up to machines watching all your vitals is actually a pretty good place to be.

Keep on keeping on!Peach, eh?  The green tea one sounds interesting, I'll have to see if I can find it.  Thanks!Haha ahh if only... pineapple is my kryptonite.Audio books and podcasts are a great way to motivate.  Try Audible for books and I like Beyondpod for Podcasts.  This American Life podcasts are an hour long, perfect for a 3-4 mile walk.Ooh I like the mixing flavours, hasn't even thought of that.  Thanks!  I may try that with the few I already have.Like herbal tea you mean?Which brand was that?See I've tried it and I find it has that gross aspartame-y aftertaste.  :/I haven't tried the Kool-Aid ones but I'll have to look for those.  Don't think we get Nesfruta.

I'm liking the sound of that cherry one since you're the second person to recommend lol.  Thanks!I'm not sure we get that brand in Canada.  I'll look for it though, thank you!I'm not boy on orange but I like the sound of the Dasani one.  Thanks!Hmm... we may not have the black cherry one in Canada but I'll keep an eye out for it now.  Thank you!Fruit punch isn't bad.

I haven't seen the raspberry around but I'll keep a look out for it.  Thanks!Ehh.

Broke university student, can't afford it to begin with.Not sure what type of fast food places we're talking about, but if I get fast food I usually just get a grilled chicken sandwich and toss the bun.

You can lose weight on fast food, you just have to find your calorie goal and stick to it.Hey all. This is my 2nd day 1 for the new year. I'm 28, 5'4 and 179lb. I have a sedentary desk job and lifestyle. Although this is starting to change as I've started doing some active activities on the weekend and try to get to around 8000 steps a day (with fitbit).

I've already started by incorporating more exercise and eating healthier. I still crave and am tempted daily and thought this might be a good way to hold myself accountable.

Lurking on Loseit is one of my favorite past times and today is the day I am going to stop lurking and start contributing. The reason I started this whole journey was because I realised I started getting symptoms of PCOS and started stressing out over it. Doing some research I've realised my weight is also a huge contributor to PCOS and hence I am here.

If anyone would like to add me on MFP: rainie2487, we could encourage each other and keep tabs and see the progress. :)

Good to see there are people posting here regularly. It's great to see everyone realising their dreams. Speaking on the behalf of males everywhere.  Nothing distracts me from naked booty, boobs and lady parts.  Explain after "fun" time if you think it's necessary.  If he is a good guy he will be more concerned for your well being than anything else( he will probably more interested that you are OK now and in the future as opposed to what happened in the past).  Trust me, if ladies are showing the naked parts we are happy.I hate these ridiculously negative, judge mental posts. I got one of the same when I posted my story here. You have no basis for assuming the worst about the op. People come here for support, not abuse.Beautiful comment, very insightfulJust water weight falling off. This happens to nearly everyone at the start of a diet, your body is just adjusting. Don't expect to keep losing at this rate.Wow! Amazing!

What's your deficit? I've been at goal for a while now, but have struggled with fluctuating +/- 7 lbs. I now am maintaining at 1250/day and working out every day but alternating workouts. I think I might be at a place where I could eat more and gain some muscle, but I've become happily accustomed to this level of eating and exercise. It doesn't feel intense anymore, just normal. But some days I feel hungry so I let myself eat more. It hasn't been easy (I posts recently about a new bingeing habit that developed) and I'm still figuring exactly how to healthily maintain. My point aimed to be that you certainly don't have to be as intense as I was/have been, but that you likely will need to play around a bit to find what works for you! Congrats on starting your journey (again)! I know what you mean about it feeling different. I've "tried" to lose weight many times but i think the longest I lasted was a month. Usually it's a week or less. This time instead of being on a strict diet I am just counting calories. Six weeks and going strong! I really feel like I can make it this time.

Anyways, just wanted to let you know we are in the same boat. 24/f sw:251 cw:239 gw:200 by my birthday in July and I will go from there. I too worry about loose skin. Today I went and bought myself lotion with cocoa butter in it and I'm going to try and use it everyday. I drink at least 8 glasses of water a day - usually closer to twelve, and I'm planning on starting resistance training in the upcoming weeks. I just have to figure out where to begin. But I try to remind myself there is no point worrying about loose skin right now. Right now I am focusing on becoming healthy, because that's really the most important thing. agreeI'm not trying to figure out if I'm hot or not. I have not had cosmetic surgery, but I have several large scars on my body, from a surgery, a medical incident, and a car accident.  Not one partner I've had has ever had a negative reaction.  Some were curious, most didn't notice until weeks/months into the relationship.  One night stands/casual hookups never mentioned/seemed to notice at all.  And, with time, they fade to skin color and are pretty unremarkable. It looks gay, have you never heard that expression?

Maybe on some subconscious it means associating something with something someone is trying to get attention for that they never had.I know this conversation ended awhile ago but I wanted to agree with you. If you're eating whole foods and cooking for yourself, I prefer LI.Grats. Personally I don't think my face would look much different if I lost weight.The naan stop is the best name for a food truck.Well thanks! You made my night. Wow, you're gorgeous! On what planet do you live to think ear gauging is a common gay thing to do? I'm gay and can honestly say that for every 1 gay guy with gauged ears I know at least 5 straight guys with gauged ears - so really, it's more like "that's so straight". You really do not see much gauging in the gay community. Thanks or humoring my vanity XP

For real though, that is super flattering. Thanks. 51 lbs is no joke! GOOD JOB. For real. You lose 50 lbs and you know for a fact you can get the rest of the way there. I've had an unsuccessful back surgery, and a severely damaged leg.  Chronic pain each and everyday, so I completely understand.  It absolutely is 80% diet.  I do not exercise at all other than normal daily activity.  I started logging on MFP and have lost 17 lbs in just over three weeks.

Seriously.  Just log your food, no exceptions. It's incredible how simple it actually is.  Sending you the best of luck!!You look awesome! I've seen some of your posts in the past. I've saved them along with other people to look back on for motivation. I've lost 51.5lbs since August and 111.5lbs since my highest weight. I still have about 35-45lbs to lose. I hope I look as good as you when all is said and done. Great job! You're an inspiration! Thanks for sharing your hard work with us. :)When I went shopping for clothes at Kohl's and saw myself in the mirror. I still think their mirrors are totally warped, I don't look that gross in any other mirrors, but that was over Christmas break and now I'm down 5 lb and 4 inches from then.Same here, way body sacrifice than food items. I love Belgian and German beers, but I like having my clothes fit more.Same here, way body sacrifice than food items. I love Belgian and German beers, but I like having my clothes fit more.It's fine. A lot of times the start of a new diet means cutting out all the shitty processed foods you were eating before which were stupidly high in sodium causing you to retain a lot of water. Even excessive carbs can have a similar effect. When you start eating properly you stop retaining water and lose quite a bit of weight very quickly. After 1-2 weeks this effect will have passed and you'll be able to see just fat loss at a normal healthy speed. I agree with the others on here. Two pounds per week is the healthy rate to lose weight. If you lose more than that you are at risk for losing muscle instead of fat which isn't going to give you the results you want when you look in the mirror. During the trek of losing weight, there have been studies that showed an intake of gelatin to increase the skin's elasticity helped reduce the loose skin. Staying well hydrated and using a really good moisturizer to keep your skin healthy will also help.

Also, for a 5'5" male, I think 120 is way too low. I'm a 5'2" female and think that reaching 130 will be low enough for me. While exercising to lose weight, you're so much more likely to put on a decent amount of muscle which weighs heavier than fat. There comes a point where the scale isn't something you can rely on as much because of the muscle gains. I'd look more into your build and what would be a healthy weight for your build if I were you. Different people are built differently, which means that your bone structure and amount of natural muscle or muscle building ability should be taken into account. It's not always about the number on the scale. I know this is a little more than you were asking, but I would hate to have your heart set on a number that turns out to be unhealthy for you. I wasn't able to quit until I actually wanted to. You have to not want to smoke anymore. But running a lot will def make you want to quit especially if you are competitive. Then you will do anything to be faster so quitting is easy. Honestly... You needn't even mention them unless your clothes are coming off and in that moment he asks. That's just my idea of it though.

I used to be embarrassed by how teeny my chichis are and I never said anything until they were being gawked at by my husband for the first time. By which point it didn't matter because all of the clothes were off and the frisky business was on!Please marry me?How many cals are you eating and what macros are you using?? I'm finding I have a similar issue... I'm training hard at the gym but then I'm starving so I overeat. Keep up the great work dude!!!Added! I've actually toyed with the idea of splitting the household's monthly grocery budget in half. My SO could have one half for the month and I would have the other to spend. My SO doesn't really watch what he eats either and it bothers me. I'm trying to lose weight and be healthy, which you already know is difficult with other stuff in the house. I've come to this conclusion:

I have complete control of what I have for breakfast and lunch because of work. I can easily do breakfast smoothies and get lean chicken and steamed veggies for lunch at work. Dinner is the issue. I am going to have a stash of veggies and healthy sides for me at the house and only eat a small portion of whatever it is that he cooks for dinner. This way I can make sure that I have more veggies in my diet than anything else. My SO, I have to admit, has gotten a *little* better at making more health conscious decisions when cooking, but it's still not where I would be satisfied with. He's a big fan of having pasta or rice with every meal, which takes up a good bit of empty calories. It doesn't leave much room for the vegetables that I'd like to get in my daily consumption. This plan would make us both happy. He can eat what he wants and I can keep my meal plans on track. Just because it's there doesn't mean I have to eat it. These veggies can even be in the form of those frozen steamer bags that you can stick in the microwave to be something super simple. No stove required on your part if he decides to get takeout! So cool...I know you worked hard!!I came to suggest Couch to 5k also! It's a great program- entirely accessible without expensive gear or memberships (just make sure you invest in a good pair of running shoes if you don't have them already).

What's the crease on your belly? Surgery scar?Why not drink beer? Most beers have pretty good micronutrient profiles and as long as its in moderation alcohol is correlated with greater longevity (increases up to 7 drinks a week, plateaus up to 14, decreases thereafter).Swimming is much easier on the joints - if your overweight your knees are going to take a pounding.  Plus you work the rest of your body. If it's an option look into it. &gt; you look like a different person

Because he is, functionally speaking, a different person.Amazing! You look ridiculously good! Keep up the hard work :D and feel free to add me on mfp. I need more motivating people like you on there :) my username is jsdsvThank you for this.  I am nervous and I was wondering about the need to purchase a sports bra before the surgery so I would have that to wear afterwards.  I will have stitches and they told me they would need to be taken out after 10 days.  I am planning on going back to work the following monday after the surgery and my parents are going to be coming to help me, of course my husband will be here too.  Again, thank you for the information, this really helps me.this is what I did. It go to a point where I was getting blisters on my feet all over the place. and swimming burns an amazing amount of calories.This. Although I've found that I have a "happy weight" that my body likes to hang at when I'm properly dosed. I gain like crazy as soon as I stop taking my meds (IE: i had an issue getting a refill called in around the holidays and was off of my synthyroid for 3 weeks and gained 15 pounds. granted there was a little overindulgance with the holidays, but not 15 pounds worth). I've now been back on for a month or so and it's starting to melting back off. I'll hit a wall once I get back to 150 though, and it will be back to the "normal" struggle.Put on 20 pounds over the summer because of this. Re-lost 10 after I started counting again.

Whenever I read about someone who is struggling to eat enough to maintain their weight, I'm always curious as to what they're actually eating. I'd like to throw in my recommendation for couch to 5k as well. It really eased me into running in a good way. Good luck with your surgery!That's awesome, keep it up! I hope everything goes well for you!&gt; I need something that burns fat and is a mixture of cardio and strength training

My friend, enter the kettlebell.&gt; minus a stoner taco bell binge

Beefy 5 layer burritos and potato burritos will be the death of me.Macros will count too, it's good to always aim for more protein/healthy fats and less carbs, you'll feel more satisfied throughout the day (I'm sure you know this by now.)

So I plugged in your stats with a basic TDEE (mifflin-st jeor formula to be exact, someone might chime in and say there's a better one) Here's a bullet list of stuff you should know:

* At sedentary level (couch potato all day) **Your TDEE (total daily energy exependiture) is 3440**

* This means that if you wanted **to maintain your current weight, keep eating that many calories each day.**

* In order to gain weight, you will have to eat more than 3440 calories each day.

* **ALWAYS REMEMBER: 1 pound of fat=3,500 calories** To fat you must eat at a *sustainable* deficit each day.

* **To eat at a deficit, you need to eat fewer than 3440 calories each day.** If you wanted to lose 2 pounds a week (2 x -3,500 calories) you should subtract 1,000 from 3440 and eat approx. 2440 calories each day.

* It might be tempting to really slash that down and lose more faster, but you need to keep this **SUSTAINABLE** &lt;- HUGE KEY WORD THERE. You do not want to restrict yourself so hard that you get to the "fuck it" point and just go on a binge.

* It's okay to overeat now and then. Life will happen somedays you'll end up at a surplus of calories. The trick, as most skinny people will say, is to not let that happen that many times in a row. You need to be able to bounce back up and continue your deficit. Don't beat yourself up if it isn't everyday just be sure to log your splurges and keep yourself accountable.

* As you lose weight, your TDEE will go down. You'll have to recalculate often.

* Weightloss is like 80-90% diet, not exercise. **You will not be able to outrun your fork**

* Use exercise for fitness. I use it as therapy, whenever I feel anxious or angry or stressed I get on my little non-electric elliptical and workout, it's helped me stop treating food like it's a drug.


So, **TL;DR: You just need to eat a *little* less and move a little more. It's tempting to be more aggressive but you want this to be sustainable and you want to give yourself the time to evolve into healthier eating habits so you don't fall off the wagon again.**

Invest in yourself! Download a calorie counting app like My Fitness Pal and put in your stats and just start this shit up for the last time. Absolutely. 2 inches off my waist &amp; 5 lbs lost since Feb 4. Biggest change is my attitude about food, I'm working too hard in the morning to ruin it by overeating. It's a rush when I'm on the last mile and I realize how far I've come. I feel strong again. I gained 50 pounds in less than a year last year during a battle with severe depression after losing my mom. Now I finally feel in control again.  Wish you the best of luck in your journey to health. ok sweet this really helps I hope that maybe in 10 months i can have my own 2 pictures and a transformation story&gt; Quit quitting. The failure doesn't happen because you went over your calorie limit or have a binge, the failure happens when you quit.

This was fantastic to read. Thank you!Congrats on the weightloss! Think I just needed a reality check about intake/have some myths debunkedI'd say plan out in advance what you're going to eat, giving yourself a decent amount of healthy snacks, and stick to that. Then when everything is done, treat yourself somehow. Maybe get something done at a spa, go skiing, something fun.My friend, you are not fat.  In fact according to the Wolfram-Alpha calc referenced above you are 19 lbs *UNDER* weight for your height, age and gender.

Also, bear in mind that the basal metabolic rate (dubious on it's own as this is actually highly variable from person to person) it spits out does NOT take into account calories burned due to activity.  Most likely with your activity level you would need AT LEAST 2,000 calories a day (probably closer to 2,500) to maintain weight.

Body dis-morphia (distorted body image) is a very real thing, especially if you used to be overweight.  It is commonly dismissed as a 'female' problem, but it affects many, many guys as well.   If you are 5'10, and 140 lbs at 16 and you are convinced you are overweight, despite the objections of people who know you (i.e. your dad) it may be affecting you.

Anatomically speaking, any 'flab' you have is either residual weight from pre-pubescence which will go away as you develop (which you can delay, btw, by eating well below your caloric needs, which it seems you are) or just excess skin as you are almost certainly under-muscled for your frame.

Again, strength training will help your frame, but even more important than that is your mindset.  It seems like you have some pretty unhealthy and unrealistic ideas about yourself.  It might be worth speaking to someone in person to figure out exactly what is driving this.Hahaha! Ok that made me actually laugh out loud! Thanks for the laugh and the congrats!That's what I'm thinking now. Someone suggested macro counting, but i dont know much about that.

Anways. I'm 6'1"/~400lbs/Male/23yo.

Thanks for the support!Very wise of you to say, you're right.

I do feel better in my own skin; and, working so for hard these past few weeks, it's nice to know I'm actually lighter than I thought I was! A touch short-sighted on my part, I know :P

But for serious, what is up with the inconsistencies...odd.[Fitness Blender](http://www.fitnessblender.com) has awesome, free videos that incorporate cardio as well as strength training. Some of their strength training involves free weights, while other videos use mainly body weight. Seriously though, they have something for everyone at every activity level.

I started using their videos when I was at 245. I had to modify some of the exercises to make them work for me, but eventually I found myself able to do the unmodified versions. I'm now at 194 and still losing. I still use FB videos and I've also started running. I know the struggle with boredom all too well and can definitely sympathize. One of the reasons I recommend Fitness Blender is because they literally have hundreds of videos. And, as you get stronger, you can choose ones that scale up in difficulty. They also offer 8 week programs like [this](http://www.fitnessblender.com/plans/fb-fit-8-week-fat-loss-program-to-lose-weight-build-lean-muscle-and-tone-up) that give you some real structure.

Anyway, I hope this helps. Keep going, keep losing, and don't give up! Keep looking for ways to shake it up and challenge yourself. You can do it OP.Hey man, yea didn't mean to come off harsh or anything.  Sounds like we are in agreement.And eating the Soup and veggies is always more satisfying afterwards! For me anyway.You look great!Hey all, I've decided it's time to get this party started.

A couple years ago I went nuts, cut back on eating way too much, to the point I was a character out of a Snickers commercial, constantly hungry, crabby, etc. I also busted my ass at the gym and was miserable. It worked, in the course of a year I dropped a ton of weight and it was obvious, but I hated it. So I ended up slipping off both tracks when I went on a vacation and pigged out, didn't exercise and didn't return to either dieting or exercise after. I quickly ballooned up to even heavier. From 185 down to 150 up to 200.

Last year I tried again, but I decided to only exercise, since the dieting made me cranky, and that really didn't work at all since I wasn't careful about what I ate at all. I tried to just run it off at the treadmill. Now, starting in 2015 I've been pretty good about adhering to 1500 calories a day, give or take 100, and I've been doing light exercises 3 times a week, mostly trying to build habits, nothing much. I'm hoping this will be the difference. I'm hoping to burn off a lot of the fat and then build up some muscle. I'm not looking to bulk up a ton, but I'm hoping to relieve some back pain that's plaguing me and be a bit stronger and leaner overall.

I'm currently at 184 pounds, 5'5" and I am a software engineer desk jockey.

27 year old male, named Matt, checking in :)What is your diet usually like? It sounds like you might be restricting yourself too hard based on what I read. I went through a lot of the same stuff for years, go on an aggressive diet for a few days maybe a few weeks and and then crash and burn and "fuck it all let's get a cake to go with that pizza."

What really helped me was to simply count my calories and not ban *anything*, the rules were it just had to fit within my daily allotment. If you eat at a deficit, you can still have sweet tarts, just maybe not as many. It will take discipline to monitor yourself like that and so many dieters ex that stuff out completely but I've felt like my little indulgences have kept my weight loss sustainable for the long run.

If you're comfortable with posting your gender/height/age/weight I'd be happy to help you calculate your TDEE and figure out what sort of calorie budget you have to work with. You might actually be surprised how much you can eat and still lose 1-2 pounds a week. Nice work, keep it up! I'm coming up on my 50th day. Feel free to add me (anyone) as psh8989 on there. Always helps having more friends!Remember it's not about the number.  The scale is a tool used to measure loss and gains.  You don't weigh less because one scale says so.  I know you know that but I still feel like it needs to be said.  You want to use the same scale for your measuring for consistency, nothing else.  Same thing goes with weight.  It's not about how much you weigh, it's how you look and feel.  Don't be obsessed with a number, be obsessed with you.Yeah, turns out it's TWO cups.

Woops.Definitely continue on.  You've gotten some good tips here, plus as you continue on, your consistency and control will just get better and easier.

I've lost 96 lbs. in 7 months on MyFitnessPal and walking.  This stuff really works!I miss beer, too. I drink mostly IPAs and they are high in calories. I reach for a Founders All Day IPA when it's nice out and I have to have one (or after a run as a reward).Pm sent. Thanks!Wow that's a lot of weight to lose especially when going through recovery from an injury! Keep up the awesome work!!My maternal gma had breast cancer when I was a little kid, so I about passed out when I found a lump in my breast at age 16. I was a ball of nerves for the next 2 months until I worked up the courage to tell my parents. The doc decided I had to have surgery to remove it. I remember everyone being very kind (good for you for getting a different doctor when you weren't 100% satisfied with the level of care!). I was nervous until I fell asleep under anesthesia, then I just woke up from my little surgery nap and went home. They put an ace bandage around my chest and I had to stay home for a couple days, then wear a sports bra for a week or 2. They used glue instead of stitches so they didn't have to remove anything, just check the healing progress. I actually had this surgery again for another lump (both were fibroadenomas) when I was 19.

Make sure you have someone who loves you and understands that 1st time surgery is spooky (no matter how tough you are) to go with you and take you home afterward. I did not have a reaction to the anesthesia either time for this, but when I had my wisdom teeth out I woke up and  sobbed for a couple minutes, which is not uncommon (my dad had no idea what to do with me except hug me awkwardly :P).

Also, you can mention to your doctor that you are feeling a little apprehensive about 1st time surgery (and don't be afraid to advocate for yourself when you're at the surgery center too). I was nervous enough because of the surgery but I also don't like needles, and I had some pushy nurses who wanted to put my IV in early. My very understanding anesthesiologist caught wind of this (i.e., saw me getting agitated) and came over to shoo them away &amp; make sure I didn't have to get the IV early. Plus my mom was waiting with me before the surgery to help advocate for me.#####&amp;#009;

&gt;The __physical activity level__ (PAL) is a way to express a person's daily [physical activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity) as a number, and is used to estimate a person's total [energy expenditure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_energy_expenditure).  In combination with the [basal metabolic rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate), it can be used to compute the amount of [food energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_energy) a person needs to consume in order to maintain a particular lifestyle.

You can eat below your BMR -- your BMR is part of a formula that combines with another acronym PAL to calculate your TDEE.  It's not a lower limit of eating.  PAL = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity_level

You -should- eat back some of your calories in MyFitnessPal -- you expended them, that took extra energy, so you'll be a little hungrier on those days.  But overestimation is a risk, so eat back 2/3rds and leave 1/3rd for bonus weight loss at best or in case of an overestimation at worst.  If you seriously get into workouts, you need to fuel your workout -- a few carbs before, some protein after.

I've lost 96 lbs in 7 months on MyFitnessPal and walking.   I am using the MFP defaults, letting MFP figure out my calories, and eating back my calories.  Nothing special.  (Don't complicate it unless you're truly a special case.)This happened to me.  I started for about two, maybe three weeks, then I had emergency surgery to remove my appendix.  Then a month after that I got a new job and was focused on that.  From when I started in June to when stopped in the beginning of July to when I restarted in October I gained 20 pounds, 9kg.

I almost let my self slide over the holidays and in fact would not record my weight on myfitnesspal since I was discouraged with that I was the same or higher.  In January I said, fuck it; up, down, left, or right I am going to record my weight everyday at the same time.  I think I have only missed maybe a day or two since the daily weight check.

Too be able to see what dinner of chicken and rice does to me the next morning vs when I have a foot long sub with everything on it.  This really made watch what I was eating since I was able to see the results.  Now I think more when I plan for meals.  This worked since I see quick results good or bad of what I ate and/or burned off at the gym on the scale.

Since then I found an eating lifestyle that works with my body and I am losing weight.  Are there days, yes days, where it is no loss and sometimes a gain, but the overall trend is down.

For reference my starting weight in June was around 265 pounds, the restart in October I was was 287.7 pounds.  This morning I was 248.0 pounds.  My goal is 200 pounds.  I am almost half way there.

Just get the mind set of fuck it.  It is strange that I can remember my starting weight of 287.7, but there are days from when I weigh myself to when I enter it in myfitnesspal I forget what it is.  I guess I know where I do not want to go back to.Looking great! No more beer forever for you, or just till you hit your goal?Ok, good to hear! I thought I was taking crazy pills :-|

I never liked that digital scale anyways. The number changes on the way I'm standing on it, it's redic.There is tons of YouTube workout video, it's what I do because I can't afford a gym Bread, alcohol, and pasta are all big culprits to bloating. Lack of enough water can also disrupt digestion which can feel like bloating. Try high protein, high fat, low carb and increase your water. Might help?  Also keep in mind your body needs to adjust so give it 2-3 weeks of diligence before deciding if it helps or not.

I reversed a life time of ibs, nausea, and bloating when I finally buckled down and pulled a 180 on my diet. I was sure I was eating "healthy" until I got honest with myself. There is absolutely **nothing** wrong with eating fast food from time to time, and making it fit into caloric goals. Depriving yourself, in fact, leads to failure more often than not. The whole point of losing and maintaining weight loss is being able to substain it. For a lot of people, this includes indulgence like kfc or ice cream or whatever their poison is.

Saying someone is blatently wrong when in fact they are stating an opinion, is an asshole thing to do. The person was not wrong. Did I call you wrong? No, I just merely stated your attitude is shit. People can have different opinions and people can lead different lifestyles than you. I know plenty of people who are not overweight but eat fast food and drink soda all the time. They merely keep within their calories.

Seriously, you need a reality check. You're abrupt and abrasive, and come across very rude. I'm not even the only one who noticed this, I am merely pointing it out. If OP can work kfc into his diet while still eating mostly healthy and maintaining his loss, then so be it. Me? I drink monsters and eat tonnes of carbs. Guess what? Lost 15lbs so far. It's all about moderation, not deprivation.#####&amp;#009;

BMR x PAL = TDEE

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity_level

That's why the BMR has relevance, but it's actually the TDEE which is the start of the weight-loss equation. Thanks for all the advice! I will prelog my meals and I have healthy snacks! Most people will say to not eat below 1200 calories a day for basic nutrition, and a lot of short girls usually stick to 1200 a day at /r/1200isplenty.

Focus on your TDEE at sedentary- it's 1599 (lets say 1600) that means if you ate at 1200 a day your daily deficit would be 400... since you need a deficit of 3,500 to lose one pound of fat you'll be losing less than one pound each week unless you add in some exercise (and don't eat back those calories burned.) Even then don't expect much more than 1-1.5 pounds loss per week, it's the curse of being a short girl.

I highly recommend trying out 1200 a day, it's a little rough at first and you have to constantly keep yourself in check but unless you plan on working out like a beast it's sort of the best way to lose fat.

Yes!!! Every digital scale my family and I have stepped on is 5-10 pounds heavier than dial ones. Why? Idk but I trust the dial ones more. I trust the shift ones the most. By shift ones i mean medical ones where you slide the weight left or right until the thing balancesI ended up resting today, I was feeling exhausted. I think my body is getting used to the new exercise routine and calorie intake, and the period was just too much. I did go grocery shopping and got healthy snacks in preparation (baby carrots, celery, greek yogurt). It will be a rough weekend, but I will eat healthy, work hard, and take active breaks. Thanks for all the support!1280 ... which is below your BMR ... is fine.

1599 minus 1280 is 319 ... you'll lose a pound every 9 days or so ... not including exercise.  At 5'3" that's a decent rate.I agree, forgoing them altogether is probably the best route. Imthink the easiest way is to just keep eating the same thing.
One and a half english muffins, three tablespoons of almond butter, yogurt and V8 till dinner puts me at 550 calories.

I can estimate dinner pretty well because we usually cook the similar things or go to places where I know what we are eating. Just gotta keep it up. Go back to youtube, and look up Obesetobeast. He's a 24 year old who went from 360-190 and you should see his lose skin. But he has a video on his channel, on how he's come to love it and love who he is. He even refuses to get surgery (and he also proudly displayed his loose skin on the Ellen show).

Trust me he'll make you feel better. He's a very optimistic, down to earth youtuber who worked his butt off to lose and maintain his weight.It was one of the side effects that my psych nurse explained to me.  It can also cause blood sugar spikes.  I'm taking Seroquel, which if you google you'll find a ton of people dealing with much bigger weight gains than I am.Haha, it has been fifteen years on and off, that I have to keep leaning. Haha same thing about ascribing it to "gains" haha keep telling myself I "need" the food. Same excuse Imhabe been making and getting fat on since I was 19.I love me some food, and I'm with you, I never want to stop loving it, but I think we can still love food and be healthy about it.My god...

I'm stealing these.I've been studying a bar exam for the past month. I am already barred for my current job, so that means I went from running around back and forth to court being on my feet all day PLUS gym time in the PM to sitting on my butt studying ALL DAY LONG. I've been essentially sedentary. I cannot waste one second doing anything other than studying or sleeping (besides mental detours on reddit, clearly :P ).

What worked for me was prelogging my meals, ordering my groceries, and having everything prepped and on hand in designated calorie amounts. If there's no junk food with you then there's nothing for you to binge on. I tried not to stress too much about my diet being perfect, and I allow little treats (had some ice cream tonight.)Lol way to take what I said and turn it hateful.

All I was getting at, was the fact that your attitude is shit. You're not any better than anyone else on here, and you're going around preaching advice and calling people wrong when they have different opinions.

Sorry to say you're not a weight loss expert. Neither am I, but I and the others here don't act all high and mighty and better than anyone else.

Really, you should feel shame, for blatently calling someone wrong. Shame on you for acting like a weight loss god/dess. Shame. Now go have a slice of that humble pie and come back when you can act decent.I saw ingress too, but I haven't tried cause when I go to walk I walk only in one route, and as my city is quite irregular (with lots of steep roads), I don't usually change my path ):maybe you were overtraining and that led to a sharp increase in appetite that caused you to eat over your maintenance calories. Maybe take it a little easier when you do go back to working out? Or fewer days per week until you hit your goal.

Congrats!!!No, I don't. I use it on Android, tho. Idk if you need it for iOS, but I guess you don't :) You actually need lots os memory cause the app is huge (almost 1gb)Feel free to try the lower calories, but 5'8" is not small for a woman. I'm the same height and losing weight (slowly) at 1650.  I could never handle 1200, that's just way too little for my body. You're body may be different, but I would go harder on exercise if I were you. :) I'm just so happy others can see it too, thank you!Thank you for the kind words!!!I totally understand, it's odd and confusing at first to try and turn around your grocery shopping cause you're thinking "am I even gonna use it? How do I cook that? Can I even make this?"

Simple staple items and some seasoning can be amazing.

For example: 1 chicken breast cooked with some paprika, oregano, garlic with some rice and steamed veggies (you can get bags of these for $1 or less that you cook in the microwave, takes like 4 min) and boom you've got your protein, grain and veggies and its filling. Go ham on those veggies if you're feeling really hungry, with a small sprinkle of salt and the tiniest plop of butter I can inhale some broccoli and cauliflower when I used to be iffy about it.

Example 2: chicken breast sliced into strips and cooked on the stove, add in some onions and bell peppers.  Get (keep sodium in mind though) or make fajita seasoning add a corn or whole wheat tortilla and boom bad ass fajitas!

Healthy food doesn't have to be difficult just gotta think about it a little more :)My boss and I are both working towards our weight loss goals while living with people who eat whatever they want. Boyfriend for me, husband and 19 year old son for her. Instead of getting jealous of the bad things they eat, we look up all the calories the next day. It strengthens our resolve when we see that they had a 3000 calorie dinner or whatever. Knowing the numbers helps us keep it all on perspective.

Also, I don't really cook for my boyfriend when I'm watching my calories. We each do our own thing for meals. This is easy for us though since we only eat together twice a week due to different  work schedules, and even on those two days we're sometimes going out to eat. Even if we do eat at home, we each have whatever we want. It helps that we are both big time convenience eaters, so frozen meals and things are our main staples. Unfortunately I can't seem to get into cooking two separate meals or cooking meals for just one person. Thank you and I have been more relaxed about it since i've started. I'm gonna do couch to 5k starting in march and thats when I'm really gonna take it serious about everything. So really I'm learning the basics.The short story is that I don't stress over counting them. While I see the importance of being sure to provide your body with the correct building blocks, I think there's more bro science than real science to the actually dieting.
I do make sure to keep a balance to my diet and include a fair amount of protein daily because I'm a muscular guy and I'd like to keep it that way. I stick to chicken, fish and eggs when I'm cutting and occasionally dress my salads up with some beans. I fill in with a lot of veggies to feel satisfied with my meals without piling on the calories. I like to mentally assign different foods with a calorie to benefit value. For instance I generally don't eat bread. I'm not against carbs but bread has very little value per calorie. Thanks I will!Or don't skip MFP. Maybe it doesn't work for you and that's fine, but it is a useful app that actually does help people to change their lives. MFP has taught me how to set limits that I would never learn by just following the guidelines of a fad diet. Those look delicious! Nicely done! You look great! That shirt is practically swallowing you!Wow, that's so awesome! Congrats!Small changes like getting soup and veggies instead of potstickers will add up very quickly! Congratulations on the first five, here's to the next five.Definitely will do this and track more closely without adding activity. Thanks so muchPerfectly acceptable! It's a guideline only to prevent people from trying to cut too severely, but when you're female and small your TDEE and BMR are usually so close together it's hard to make any significant deficit if you don't go below your BMR.

Try 1200-1300 and see if that's something you can sustain. Yeah, I guess all I care about right now is just strengthening the muscle I have since I'm weak. Thanks for the reply!Quick, come up with a weight loss program and advertise it in your interview. This is your chance to become a fitness guru like Richard Simmons.

Seriously though, congrats!!!!Ride the wave, man. If the scale doesn't show you what you want, just acknowledge that the choices you made are done and gone, and new choices are presenting themselves all the time. Make good ones. Don't give into guilt or shame or that voice that says "Man, I should've done things differently." It's cool. Time for the next chapter. Keep us updated!Thanks for the article!If it helps, OP, I started out at about the same height/weight as you (am 5'4, started doing TDEE around 230 or 235 or so), and I ate around the cals per week that funchords suggested (1572). I also ate more when exercising (i.e., I ate back my exercise cals).

Now I'm around 187 I'm doing 1380 per day, and still eating back my exercise cals.

So yeah, I think that 1200 is low for you, but if you're doing okay on it and getting enough macros/nutrients then, go for it. Would recommend at least eating more on workout days, though. I NEVER drink soda, I don't drink as much water as I should but I'm definitely getting better, I have MAYBE 2 alcoholic beverages a month, I eat whole wheat pasta, veggies, I never add salt to anything, no allergies, and I have red meat maybe once or twice a week but other then that it's chicken and fish, only whole grain bread.Ingress is pretty cool. It's kind of like capture the flag. You walk to different portals and have to take control of them. It is nice because you end up exploring and seeing places you would probably have never noticed in your surrounding area.Bloody periods (unintentional joke there). Perhaps a session on a game or something? Or an episode of a show you like? You should be taking enough breaks for your own mental health, as well as your ability to perform well. Good luck with your project and your weight loss.Because my BMR is 1500 (calculated based on sedentary activity level) and I was always under the impression that going under your BMR is counterproductive for weightloss/unhealthy, etc.

If this is an incorrect assumption I will surely cut calories because I have to force myself to eat 1500 most days. Just never knew that going under BMR was acceptable. That is awesome! Great job on your progress!You look amazing! That's exactly how I looked at an 8-10 and I miss it! Thanks for the supportive chat!! I love meeting other female "ex athletes!"I've found that if I attach massive pain to not working out or exercising, it get's me out the door. On days that I can't be bothered running (I'm a distance runner) I ask myself 'what is the consequences if I don't do this run and the answer is lose fitness, not compete well in races, etc.. For me this is extremely painful.

Attach massive pain to the idea of not getting where you want to be. And you'll find the drive to get things done no matter how you're feeling.

Remember: getting going is the hardest pard and once some results start to show, a snowball effect happens, and progress will be a lot quicker and easier.

Hope this helps I was in the beginning,  now I have a good feel for how much I eat and my caloric intake so I don't use it as muchYep -- get yourself some good shoes. It will even help with the shin pain. When athletic shoes get worn out, they can actually do damage to your feet because there's no padding or support.

When I started walking seriously, I had horrible shin pain until I was fitted for running shoes. I went to a runners' store and they did the gait analysis and put me in a pair of Asics that are designed for my degree of pronation. As /u/TraineWreck said, they aren't cheap. The pair I have now set my mom back about $100 (Christmas present) but it's well worth it for the comfort. At the very least, get yourself some new insoles that are made for athletes. I use the SofSole insoles. Why don't you just quit smoking and look into a good ecig? That way you won't be inhaling all the carcinogens &amp; cancerous chemicals but still get nicotine and other enjoyment of smoking? Smoking cigs will cause you to just get super tired/winded really easily especially if you're going to do cardio. So you probably won't get as efficient of a workout because you can't do as efficient of a job due to the effects of smoking.If you are doing cardio, you can use a heart rate monitor like a polar for more accurate numbers. The MFP and machine guesses are wildly inaccurate, generally in the upward direction. That sounds sedentary to me, especially if you have a non-physical job and if you're using a motorized vehicle to get around. Feel free to add in exercise afterward if you like but do keep in mind that most calories burnt estimates (especially on fitness machines themselves) are overestimates.

That would make your tdee about 1780. I'm not sure why you think 1500 is as low as you can go because that's not even low enough to lose 1lb per week. It's 1/2lb per week at best if you're accurately counting everything.

Eat fewer calories. zxwut, it's really handy. I did a 12.3 mile trail run in this yesterday. Carried water, fuel and phone. All hands free. You have to find what works for you, but you need to be strong - your pretty much in ground zero for gaining weight.  Be strong.I just see definitions like [this](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/tools/bmr-calculator) where BMR is described as "It represents the minimum amount of energy needed to keep your body functioning, including breathing and keeping your heart beating."

So then it sounds concerning to go below that minimum, if you get what I mean. A lot of articles/sources/people say that going below BMR is dangerous, but then others say that is just a myth. So that's why I'm confused.It's perfectly fine to go below your BMR - your body can just pull what energy it needs from your stored fat (that's what it's there for). For many though, it's a fair guideline to suggest that they don't go below it so you don't build yourself an unreasonable and unsustainable plan - but when you're female and on the short side going below your BMR is for many sustainable. True that. Thanks for the info. Hard to trust cookie cutter plans like MFP, IIFYM etc. Seemed more feasible coming from a person.Out of curiosity what are your macros like? Do you cycle them on rest days vs lifting days?And there we go. Wow at least I don't feel so bad now! Moving forward I won't track my activity on MFP. Thanks so muchGreat job! You're on track! Others may or may not agree with me...but I wouldn't worry about the sodium since you're getting started. I mean, if you currently have a medical condition where you should watch that, that triumphs all...but if you don't...meh. I lost about 30 lbs tracking calories and not worrying about much else. THAT is what made it easy for me to stick to. The fact that I was thinking "oh! I have space for a slice of pizza, sweet!" Is what made it easy for me. Now on my last 10-15lbs...now I'm looking at protein, carbs, sodium, all that fun stuff.

I don't say do it my way, I'm not a doctor and different things work for different people, I'm just sharing what worked with me. Oh! I think one big thing that helped is that even when i was only watching calories, I made sure I drank plenty of water.

I didn't have any problem with sodium making my kidneys retain water because frankly....I was naturally consuming less sodium because I was eating less overall since my original diet was high sodium anyway.

You sound like you're doing a great job this week, keep up the good work. I'm rooting for you. :) I had the exact same wake up call. I'd moved out for the first time, I was working two jobs, I wasn't giving food a second thought. Well, at least not until I hit 250 pounds and I could no longer shrug it off as "gainz".

So I sat down and did the math and I blew myself away. I had been eating breakfast, then eating my lunch *on the way to work*, then going out for "coffee", then going out for lunch, then picking up something to chew on while I drove home, having a big dinner when I got home, AND HAVING A SNACK BEFORE BED. I tracked a week and say I was eating 5000-6000 calories a day. Not to mention spending a fortune.

Needless to say I was humbled by the size of the meals I made on my first day of counting. OH!!

If you're using exercise calories at what MFP estimates it to be and eating all of that back, then there's the problem. I have this problem as well (5'0'' at 250 lbs).  My heart's gotten stronger, and my leg muscles aren't screaming in pain as much any more but my feet are just dead or ache so bad I can barely walk at the end of a workout.  I'm going to have to agree with the folks that said better shoes.  Until you get those, very wooly socks might help.

On the elliptical I constantly shift my feet every few minutes from the front to the back of the pedal, and I'll go up on my toes for a few minutes.

It's gotted better over time.  I haven't really lost weight because I don't do any follow through with my diet, but my feet are adjusting to the weight bearing.I really look forward to reading this! Congratulations. You are now an inspiration for many!The only reason this could be bad is if your TDEE actually needs to be recalculated because of weight loss and therefore lowering it (meaning, you don't really have 500 left).

I see that you have lost 110 pounds (congratulations!), so you probably do know about readjusting your calorie goals from time to time.

I refuse to eat if my stomach is physically full and it would be painful to eat more, no matter what my calories are.

That aside, I have been a lot less hungry on the days I have been super active lately (strange), and on those days, I am making sure I don't eat under even though I am not hungry. This is because muscle development, or at the very least maintenance, is very important to me during my weight loss.

This is one of the issues I see the most disagreement on /r/loseit about.Very true! You what Snickers, you're dead right, thanks... even if I do, I'll wear it with pride. After all a handful of skin is better than the barrel of fat I have now.

My plan is 2lbs a week if possible for now and slowing down to 1/.5lbs  as the weight reduces. I guess I'll do all the other things too, to have no regrets, exfoliating, moisturising, and of course staying hydrated. Thank you I am that way specially with things that became a lifestyle. I only eat grilled chicken anyways it just taste better in my opnion. I'm most likely gonna start bringing food with me to work so I can stay on the right track so I can start seeing the changes. Thanks again I don't think there's any problem with it as long as you are tracking calories-- You can stay on track that way. If you have a period of a few days where you go over maintenance, you can look at your food diary and say to yourself "I have to get back on track."

If you weren't calorie counting, I would be very worried about the calorie creep because of your extenuating circumstances (artificially increased appetite).

I am curious-- I have heard of plenty of medicines that change your appetite and increase blood sugar (making you at risk for developing diabetes), but never ones that literally slow your metabolism. Is that something your doctor or the literature actually informed you of, or is that just how it seems?Thank you for this!I have been putting it in my mfp app :) and also the green beans have a lot of salt in them so I didn't know if I should eat them or not. Actually just recalculated it and my BMR is 1504, TDEE is 2067. Maybe I'm overestimating my calorie burn "Custom fit shoes" = simply going to a good shoe store and being measured and fitted by a professional, the way your grandpa bought every pair he ever wore.

Two most likely sources of foot pain: improper fit, and lack of support. Buy some good athletic shoes in the proper size, and add a quality arch support to them, like Superfeet or Spenco.

Me: been selling those very things for a living for 15 years.I just try to keep my blood sugar up enough. So, protein and veggies in your diet will help maintain that blood sugar for longer than carbs.

And I take a walk if I can't concentrate anymore. I agree with /u/funchords about small healthy snacks because I think they help maintain the blood sugar well.I think the popcorn chicken kids meal is less than 300 calories. The chicken littles are good too. I think the great beans there are smoking like 30 calories for a serving.....you could eat a whole bunch of green beans and a piece of chicken and be okay while still getting full. Just plug it all in your mfp app and you'll do great. :) 5'8", I estimate low on the activity level because I don't do much cardio and strength training doesn't burn many Cals. So I would say a step up from sedentary. 23 years old and 150 lbsYou were receptive to the message/image. It simply was time...No my TDEE is like 1800 and some change. BMR is different I thought. Good on you... keep it up... I wish I could jog! But my knees and feet won't let me!I had to relearn this myself :( hopefully this time for life!first of all, you're young. second of all, the slower you lose the more likely you are to not have loose skin. third of all, there's no guarantee YOU will get loose skin. fourth of all, even if you do, so what? Would you prefer to just be 110 pounds heavier instead? Worrying to this degree about 10lbs when you're clearly still in a healthy weight range is absolutely something that should concern you more than the mere 10lbs itself. Oh my god yes. I have had to do the most work to figure out how to have the patience to not see my GW till over a year from now.You look fabulous. All the modifications are working in your favor!Yeah, this is what the OP was really looking for. You're using food to compensate for mental and emotional exhaustion. That's something I would sit down and have a good long think about. Yuuummm! Good job!Please don't feel bad and worry yourself about me :) I have a great life with a fantastic lady who is level headed and practical. We do very well together.

This isn't about me though. This is about you. Are you here because you want to lose the weight you gained, or are you using this as that other sub, where people judge attraction? If it's the first, we can help. If it's the second, you are in the wrong sub.  What is your activity level and stats (age, weight, height). Depending on your stats, 1500 may be barely any deficit at all! I'm still a few pounds into the overweight category and 1500 is only a 200 cal/day deficit for me. /r/hotornotGood, I hope you learned something You're saying 1500 is your TDEE then? If that's the case, yes, you have to eat less than that to lose weight. How much of a deficit are you eating at?

This is all an equation. What you think should be may not line up with what should be based on your diet and exercise. If you're not losing, you're not at a deficit. There are people who lose weight and preserve muscle mass on a keto diet, and those who do the same with a more "traditional" diet (myfitnesspal for example defaults to 50% of your calories coming from carbs - so for 1850 cal/day that would work out to about 230g). You're coming in right in the middle of the two - you're just fine.

Edit to add: sounds like a case of you get what you pay for ;)I'm pretty sure you would burn more calories being awake cause you'd be moving around a bit or something.

The thing about not getting enough sleep that is bad for weight loss is that it can cause water retention and reduce your will power when it comes to your deficit and motivation to exercise.That sounds awesome!  Do you need a step counter/anything other than your phone for it to work?I feel bad for tou. You believe in the archaic notion that men shouldn't be compassionate and show emotions. God I feel bad for whoever you marryI added you, PM me a non weight related Goal to add, otherwise you're all set. :)The app that plays my music, lolCongrats! I'm 5'0 and also started at 174. I'm at 149 now, so we're pretty close. Are you on mfp?Then maybe it would be a good idea to discuss in therapy the fact that you don't want to get out of the house and feel too embarrassed to go to the gym because you gained 10 pounds. That's more worrying than your weight, which is healthy from what one can see in the picture. You don't want to know about your weight, the scale tells you that, you already know how much you weight and if you're overweight or not. You want to know about your image, you're asking us how you look. You want us to judge you, probably as harshly as you're judging yourself. TL;DR figure out if it is stress fractures or plantar fascitis cause those aren't gonna go away till you rest rest rest.

"Foot pain" Is super generic.

* If it's plantar fascitis, the solution is insoles, stretching and some rest
* If it is stress fractures, the solution is stop walking while they heal

The pain could also be a more fleeting transient thing.

But, if it is plantar fascitis or stress fractures, they aren't going to go away until you stop walking as much as you can and rest your feet while they heal. Both of those issues are exacerbated by carrying a heavier weight.

Stress fractures can be protected against in the future by improving bone density (Calcium, etc) and plantar fascitis can be protected against with proper stretching. If it's stress fractures, stretching the painful area will exacerbate it.Try to start making healthier choices at KFC first - they have grilled chicken and veggie options, which I know are still fast food, but you need to start small and work your way toward a complete lifestyle change. I can just sense you're more like me and need to start small when it comes to this kinda stuff. I would then incorporate a healthy, homemade meal from home a couple times a week from there. Just keep going until you start seeing these changes manifest into a new reality for yourself.Thank you. Idk I have always been told going too low is bad and according to bmr calculators, 1500 is the lowest I should go because that is the minimum my body needs to perform essential functions. Being that your ex and gf are smaller (and shorter) than me already it would make sense for their intake to be lower. Lower weight=less  calorie energy needed. But given that I haven't seen as much progress as I wanted, perhaps I will start cutting 100-200 cals from my daily intake. Thanks for the input Huh, I didn't know this existed. Looks cool. I know, right?!? Like, I totally expect it, but when it happens, I'm like "What am I doing wrong?!?"I am OP you idiotKFC

I have always chose to stick with honesty, not that touchy feely crap. It has always served me well. Anyhow, carry on with your "disorder."I saw a women jogging and I wanted to be in her.You look fantastic! Great job!Weight loss might be all in the kitchen, but that doesn't mean regular exercise, including cardio, isn't good for the mind!Nice pun but no they always look gay. Just saying You must be a dumbass. I actually have been DIAGNOSED you idiot. Man, I hate men who are the "suck it up" types. You're like my farher: cold, rude and just an asshole. Fuck your life and get off my question, you're not welcome and I seriously hope you don't have a gf because, like my dad, you probably tell her she's fat. Again, fuck you I have definitely seen some progress but not nearly as much as I feel like should have been possible in the time frameYes, sorry.that really was the point. OP posted a picture of the back of her knees. Not the face, body, whole legs or arms. Just the back of the knees and wants to know if we see 20 lbs. I love to help and encourage people on here but this is just ridiculous. My husband is not attempting to lose weight, though he says he needs to (and in fact does), but I refuse to let his lack of willpower affect my success.

I do end up making two dinners. There are snacks in our house, though I try to make them healthy because even though I'm not going to eat them, it's still better for everyone to eat as healthily as possible. But really, I can't control his fast food habit, and in the end I'm only responsible for myself.

Basically, I cope by having iron clad determination not to fail. I make healthy substitutions in the dinner I make for him and the kids, and stick to my plan.

The first couple of weeks were hard, but now I'm used to it, and actually I get some twisted sense of pride in myself for repeatedly not caving.I am in therapy. I'm not worried about that. I'm just worried about my weight. Being in therapy is good for me and I like it, but I'm trying to figure out if I look heavier.A lot of people compare BMR and TDEE by saying BMR is your TDEE when you're in a coma. ie, literally the least activity possible.I had plantar fasciitis, so I can sympathise with the foot pain. What has helped me is using ice packs after a long-time on my feet, and stretching them before and after and any other time it crosses my mind.

My pain has all but vanished, my feet ache a little bit after a long time,  but it's nothing like the pain I had before. The thing with caloric goals is that you start with calculations then you let your body tell you where you need to be. I see countless people on here frustrated and ready to just give up because they're doing everything right but they aren't losing weight. Everyone's metabolism is a little different. Not vastly different but it's not crazy to say that maybe your base metabolic rate is 200 calories a day less than your neighbor. Just do what works for you and make sure when your calories are low that you're eating nutrient rich foods so you get the most benefit from every calorie consumed. Everybody now thinks they have some disorder and are a special snowflake. You're not. This isn't hard stuff; you just have to do it.

Or continue to make excuses. It doesn't matter to me either way. Ok, here it goes. Regardless if you have gained 10 pounds, from the current picture one can tell your weight is healthy and there is no reasonable reason for you to not leave the house and feel embarrassed about going to the gym. Your attitude and the way you speak about yourself suggests you have serious self-esteem/image issues. Therapy might be a good idea.That's a little bit of a stretch... :D

But I no longer have them so thanks bud! Nice. No good for me since I can't walk to Walmart, but good advice for others.Well I want to get down to about 170lbs so we'll see.

I actually eat variations of this most of the time.
I eat light breakfast, a meat for lu ch and mostly veggies for dinner.
 Just more extras, sauces , seasonings etc.

But over time the extras catchup with you like the occassional ice cream, big lunches , big breakfasts etc.  Living with others makes it worse.

The last year I put on most of the last 10 lbs. But it took about 9yrs to put on the last 20.

I should have done it when I hit 190 to get back to 170 or so.I did state earlier that it should work for an average person and as a population level statistic.  It just doesn't work well for people with an athletic build.  It's something to consider when looking at BMI.  BF% is a much better indicator of health.  People can have a perfectly healthy BMI but have a high BF%.  Would you say they are more healthy?

edit: Thank you for this exchange.  You made some great points and in my case, I've always been against BMI as it's always put me in the overweight to obese category, so I tend to rail against it.  Have a great weekend!Mine is supposed to start in a few days, and this whole week I've wanted to EAT ALL THE THINGS!oh you're the type who doesn't believe in talking to people without berating them. Typical guy who I would say needs therapy. Rude asshole. Learn about how eating disorder sufferers think before you open your wack ass mouth jerk

Thank god I'm not with someone like you. I may be 5'3 and 118 lbs which you might think is fat, but I'm not an asshole, steroid pumping male in the gym who makes nasty comments. Ugh you seem like the exact type I avoidNot really, actually. Maybe an inch at the most. I would just get back into the routine you were in before you gained. Wow, that's an amazing transformation!why is that the lowest you can go? I'm a 5'11" male with an athletic build and my weight fluctuates regularly from 185-205. I like to indulge a bit in the holidays. It's a calculated gain and loss cycle.  Anyway, during the winter when I'm laid off and only running twice a week and doing light workouts I eat about 1200 a day to lose weight. During the summer in the peak of construction season when I'm training for mid runs I allow for 1800 to keep me around 185.
My girlfriend who is 5'7", reasonably athletic (casual runner) and built well (125-130lbs) but not hard bodied eats 1200 or less a day. My ex wife was 5'4" a steady runner and very slim (100-110lbs) eats around 1000 a day. I really don't.

What you need to to take your pride, shove it up your ass, and knock off the tough chick crap. Once you finish doing that, read the FAQ's, get your overeating reigned in, and do some exercise that gets you moving around a little bit. KFC makes the OP happy.  You believe that the only options are "don't eat KFC" (ie. not be happy with food choices from time to time) or "eat KFC and be hungry" (which is a state during which most people are uncomfortable/unhappy).

&gt;you're wrong

That's interesting, you'll have to come over and tell that to my scale then.  I eat fried chicken, pizza, and ice cream often and my 34 lb weight loss disagrees with you.But the legs are what you should be looking at. I feel like my legs are visibly thicker.Well in the photo it's hard to tell any weight gain because of the baggy shirt on the right. If you have gained weight, you can't really tell. I would start tracking your calories and go back to the gym. Start now, so that you don't gain more and regret it later. Weight your food. Measure accurately. You may be overeating.

Also, don't worry about other people's progress. What you're thinking is going on probably isn't true and doesn't help you at all.

Have you lost any weight in that four months? If the answer is no, you're overeating. Yes. Exactly. My personal anecdote is from yesterday. I wake up at 6:00 in the morning every morning. I go to work for 8 hours and leave at 4:00 pm. I drive home, try and relax for a few minutes, and then I leave to go to law school from 5:30 pm until 9:00 pm. When I got back home at 9:15 last night, the only thing I was motivated to do was go the fuck to sleep. Instead, I forced myself to go to the gym and get on a fucking treadmill for 30 minutes just because. I mean 30 minutes isn't much exercise, but it was more about the principle of knowing what needed to be done and just doing it. No mystical motivation fairy involved. Fair enough then. But I maintain that generally speaking, BMI works. You have fat, not excess fat.  You're supposed to have *some* fat.  You have no excess fat, in fact you're on the low end of the normal range.

A teen male should have 11%-25% of body fat. http://www.livestrong.com/article/281660-healthy-body-fat-percentage-for-teenagers/  ... That **Wolfram-Alpha estimates your current body fat at 11%,** given your statistics.  You cannot go lower without risking your health.

Body Fat is essential to protect your organs, regulate your body temperature, provide energy between meals, absorb shocks to your bones, help cell function, and to help your body absorb certain vitamins.  It doesn't matter.You're advice is obnoxious.  The OP is used to eating lots.  That doesn't obligate them to eat lots of KFC.  The question was, "can I eat KFC and lose weight?"  The answer is "yes, you can, if you budget for it and restrict your net calorie intake."  In your own words, "period."

The OP can still eat "all day" as they want, so long as they're not eating KFC all day.  They can eat KFC once per week or so, maintain a deficit, lose weight, and be happy.

I don't see why your world-view of weight loss requires everyone to be miserable and not eat foods they like.  This is an unhealthy relationship with food and you will fail in reaching your goals if you view some foods as evil and never to be tasted.You need schooling on how to talk to people. I do have eating issues, but that wasn't my question.I think you need to quit these foods. It'll be hard, but you can do it. I know what you mean about not being able to only eat one. That's why I don't buy cookies, doughnuts, or any of the foods that are my weakness. Once you start eating healthy and get all of that out of your system, you probably will think those foods taste weird. For instance, i LOVE flaming hot cheetos. After almost 3 weeks of healthy eating, I decided to get one of the really small bags that are 160 calories. I ate it, but they tasted weird and I noticed how salty they were. Made me not want to eat it again. This could be a good option. Its just while I'm working is when I usually eat it I don't go out of my way to eat there. Wow way to be an ass with that comment*I deleted that part just now so it wouldn't confuse other people like you
I'm not trolling and yes she's seen me in the past six months, but I'm retaining more wayer now than ever. I look heavier than ever before I'm 5'11" with an athletic build. When I'm really active I eat roughly 1800 calories a day to slowly lose weight. During the winter when my activity levels are down and I want to cut I drop it closer to 1200 a day. I don't worry much about weight fluctuation as long as I stay in the 185-205 range. Yes I track fairly meticulously and if I can't measure exactly I overestimate so I don't overeat.

Currently my goal is 1500 which is the lowest I can go for my weight and activity level&gt;I ask this because I've completely quit sugar and bread to help lose weight. But I work at KFC and like eating there. If I still watch my calories could I still eat there?

I don't see the words "daily" or "regularly" in there, do you?Swimming?Not [particularly](http://imgur.com/F3kJYEk).god damn gauged ears are fucking gayWell like I said I work about 50 hours or more a week and I'm always moving but it isn't that hard to pack healthier food before I go to work because I want to lose weight.At least take the picture with the same clothes.You're awesome! Thanks ! Do we have similar stats?Restricting yourself from the things you like forever and ever without flexibility.... THAT is not maintaining a healthy lifestyle.If you haven't been to the gym in 3 weeks, but gained 20lbs in 6 months, then wouldn't the receptionist have seen you with the weight already? This post doesn't make sense and you must be trolling. Theoretically yes, the food there isn't any good for you though.  How about making it your special treat for doing good?Exactly. Nobody likes brushing their teeth. We get disciplined and do it anyway. Because if I relied on motivation to brush my teeth, I'd never do it.

Same with exercise. Same with diet. I want to eat mcdonalds. I would love to stuff my face with chips. But I can't and have to stay disciplined, otherwise I'll put on another 20lbs like I did last year, which obviously is not what I want.OR, you could eat a little KFC, make reasonable choices, and NOT be hungry all day.  OR you could eat lots of KFC and exercise more that day/week to make up for it.  OR you could eat lots of KFC and restrict a bit later that week to break even.

The picture you're painting of "eat KFC and be hungry or don't eat it ever and be thinner" is really unfair, since there are more options.I didn't pay him, he was a friend of a friend so he was giving out advice. So my macros are fine as well. I had a feeling that my intake was fine but at the same time I question my carb intake. Your knees look fine. You may need to reevaluate your caloric goals and/or possibly take further steps to ensure you're counting them properly. Exercise is a nice bonus when trying to drop weight but this is a battle won in the kitchen.

How many calories a day is your current goal? Do you measure and weigh your portions?The big change came when my soon to be ex husband and I separated.  He lived a very sedentary lifestyle so I did as well. I had to train myself to only eat when I'm hungry rather than out of boredom.  Also,  ive made exercise my main form of stress relief.  If I'm angry,  or upset I run and let the good endorphins ease the stress rather than something else.  Okay thank you. Yeah I understand I work there about 50 hours a week and I'm so use to eating all day but I will quit. Should I pack meals because sometimes I work hours like 3 to 12 or 8 to 4?I'm so glad we're discussing this. I plateau and every month it's a surprise somehow.Trying to stay @ 500-600 cal a dayI was unsure if custom fit shoes would fix my problem, but I think I'll get them now, thank you!Hello there! Small tip for snack storage: I make it a point to put all of his junk food in one cabinet and my healthier snacks in another. It really helps to only see MY options when I open the cabinet door.This is the real answer right here. It's tough to hear, but it's 100% true. Like OP said, motivation naturally waxes and wanes. Discipline is a constant if we put in the effort. We are all in charge of our own present choices and future consequences. Not some ephemeral motivation that you wait for, so it can do the job for you. Take charge and take control. You will be rewarded once you start seeing results, and you are able to take 100% credit. Exercising helps my mindset. It makes me feel much better and relieves a lot of my stress. So in a way, exercising does help me lose weight. You're either a troll or have self esteem issues. I haven't decided which yet.

If you're not, get your diet right and go back to the gym. He wants to lose 100 to get to be 120.It sounds like this nutritionist is a high protein, low carb, low fat advocate. If what you're doing is working, stick with it.

Usually, they don't get on your case until you try to argue you need less than 1500 cal to survive.Are you aware that unlike the term "dietitian" which has a protected definition with a very specific educational requirement, literally anyone can call themselves a nutritionist. I'm a nutritionist. Congratulations - I now name you a nutritionist too!

To maintain your current weight (based on your gender, age, weight and height, assuming sedentary) you'd need about 2200 calories to maintain your current weight. So yes, 1800 would be an appropriate caloric intake and does correlate with about 1lb a week weight loss like you've seen (a daily deficit of 500 calories would result in 1lb per week). I would not increase your caloric intake unless you significantly increase your exercise.

1g of protein per kg of *lean* body mass is a common recommendation.

And yes, the "reverse diet" bit is complete bs. Your body "adapts" to eating my by storing the excess as fat. Based on what this person has said I would suggest canceling and finding someone who's actually qualified to give advice.

What was it you were hoping to get from the nutritionist? You have a plan that's working - why change it? I eat different breakfast, and what I want for work lunch, I tend to eat only 800 ish calories before dinner so I can eat a meal that's not really 'healthy'.My BMR has gone from 2600 to 2000. I have been eating 1500/1600 kcals throughout the process.

Not sure what you mean by ""coma" calorie burning", but it is fine. If your muscle mass is above average, sure. Just saying it has to be pretty high to be in the obese category. Well done! My situation is almost identical and I'm struggling to motivate myself to stick with lifestyle changes... how did you do it? Did you have to change anything psychologically?  I've been losing about 2lbs a week since January you, can do it! :)At least until you get a feel for them. I can't count for more then a couple of weeks, but once you understand how many are in what you can start to fix things.

Though my personal line for people having issues is: count for a week.That's so awesome!Good job!Thanks. Doctors are educated and smart and usually good at what they do, but they can make mistakes. It's hard too, because we trust them so it's difficult to second guess their advice.

I'm so glad that you're going to be okay after your surgery. It's scary going through that and not knowing what's going to happen, if it's cancer, or if it's not. You're a total badass for going through all of that stress and going even further by choosing to be healthy. You must be a super strong person. Keep it up! :)Agreed.  People can never guess my actual body weight for this exact same reason.  Muscle is muscle and it adds weight, but you still look smaller.

Good luck on your journey!  160 should be a piece of cake for you!Going to give this a try! Thank youNope, I'm not, just muscular and short.  That's all there is to it.  I have my body fat monitored on a regular basis by certified professionals, I was 21.5% and 165 lbs and there was no concern about my actual weight, because every other factor that you could measure showed that I was in great shape, body fat, metabolism and VO2 max were and all in good places.  I also was a size 6-8 at that point, now I'm an 8-10 trying to get back down to that (stupid beer).  It's entirely possible.  BMI is not a good way to look at body composition if you have any sort of muscle above average.  I was an athlete all through my childhood and that's just it.  I work out and I do lift weights, but I'm not swole by any means.    You don't need motivation. You need discipline. Get off your behind and go do some exercise. Motivation won't change your habits; discipline will.I based mine off experience. I'm 5'4"/F and have weighed from 130-180 when not pregnant. I look and feel best at 150, that puts me about 5 pounds into the overweight category according to BMI. fortunately I don't give a crap what the BMI says, it's a tool, that is useful but is by no means a definitive measure of health. I tend toward very fit when I'm working at it but I'm not so muscular that that's why I prefer 150. It just happens to look better on me. Also my curves completely leave at about 148, which doesn't look great on me.

If I were you when you get close to any arbitrary goal, re-evaluate until you find what you like.Congrats! Side note: I read that as butt not belt... had to double check what sub I was in! http://nomnompaleo.com/post/1626071845/another-simpler-version-of-cauliflower-rice

You need to eat less then. People with screwed up thyroids can lose weight just as anyone else. You don't magically ballon up; you still fall under the same laws of thermodynamics.

Hopefully it helps... I was prescribed Synthroid after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 10 years ago.  I thought "oh, this is it!  This will solve my weight problem!"  Wrong.  All it did (weight wise) was level the playing field.  It doesn't change anything otherwise.  I still have to track, exercise, watch every calorie, and work at it just like everybody else.  Once your thyroid is medically adjusted, you are just like everybody else, it doesn't factor in.

I will say, I feel a thousand times better with treatment.  Things I didn't realize were related to my thyroid got so much better.  I'm not cold, my hair doesn't fall out, the mild depression and sluggishness is gone.  I'm so much happier now that I'm being treated appropriately.  But related to weight loss - nope.  Nothing doing there.  Sadly it's an excuse a lot of people use, but if you have an issue and you are appropriately treated, it won't impact weight loss.What is "crazy healthy"? Do you drink soda? Water? Alcohol? Eat veggies? Pasta? Salt? Have an allergy? Eat meat? Bread? Grains?

I'm learning " healthy " is relative.I know lots of people like Fitocracy, maybe look into that. Looks like you posted two different people! Congrats.What everyone else said plus i believe 120lbs for a 5,5 male is way too low. Check what is a healthy weight for your height but if i were you i wouldn't try to go below 140.As long as you're being completely honest with your caloric intake, skip the scale for a little while if it causes too much stress and derails you.

I, however, am the complete opposite. I need to know on a weekly basis what my weight is. I've started keeping track of my measurements as well because I'm one of those people who will always see themselves as a hideous 1000lb land beast. Having my weight and measurements recorded makes me feel better because I can see tangible evidence that I am losing weight no matter what my fucked up brain is trying to see when I look in the mirror. Sorry for this, but you might like not my honest comments.

Since you know you are hypothyroid, I have to assume that you are being treated for it, yes?  In that case, since your thyroid hormones would get checked periodically to make sure your doses are appropriate, then you no longer *are* hypothyroid.  You are euthyroid, as in, normal.

Losing in that case comes down to diet and/or exercise to net a negative calorie balance.  If your thyroid tests on meds are normal, then you can estimate your TDEE the same as everyone else does.  If you are not being treated for hypothyroidism then... why?Especially for "beginners" (i.e. overweight people who haven't done strength training before), it is absolutely possible. And not just in the armchair biologist "theorizing" sense. They've actually put people through the process and measured that it happens.

http://muscleevo.net/lose-fat-gain-muscle/Nice job, you are looking good :)I'm sorry to hear about your mom.  I had people tell me to not wait and to get a second opinion, but I thought the doctor new more than me, or them.  By the time I went back to him I had heard enough from other past patients to know I shouldn't have waited.  Your advice is spot on.  Thank you and I'm going to hope for the best for your family.  :)Woop, I look forward to getting started with you on Monday... Now go enjoy your weekend! :DYou are definitely not alone. It sucks seeing how easy it is for some others, but I know that when I finally reach my goal it will be worth the work. Truly getting healthy and sustaining it  takes a lot of perseverance That was a future version of you! Keep it up!It is! I had a mini celebration dance! Thanks!This is just hearsay, but I had a teacher once who had her thyroid removed because of cancer. She ballooned, they were giving her drugs to help stimulate the thyroid and it obviously wasn't working because she didn't have one.

She looked into asian holistic remedies and started eating seaweed. It seemed to work for her.Thanks! It's the same for me! Everything else has stayed the same but my belt area! Thank you.  I'm proud of you too!  South Beach/Paleo to start. Keto if you are super motivated.

Skip MFP. If you can't convince yourself to change your life without an app, you won't stick with it.I coped with this by adopting intermittent fasting.  My first meal of the day is our dinner, which I don't have to be overly restrictive over as I have lots of calories available to me within my budget.Thank you.  I'm going to keep putting myself out there every day and try to get to where you are.  Have you seen a positive change in your body composition?Thank you for the advice.  I will have a three inch incision on my breast so I think I will ask about the silicone scar sheets.  I'm going to google them right now.Drink lots of water and build up muscle!  It'll take time but your skin will bounce back. :)

Congrats on the loss!Stay hydrated and make sure you build some muscle while you lose. Hahha, those all look amazing, and like way too much work for me :) congrats though! I am in the exact same situation as you, I feel like I wrote your post myself! I agree with the planning out a healthy meal plan, the thing I have found works for me the best is eating little and often which feels weird being a binge eater/restricter. You feel like eating that much will make you gain weight but the key is to make sure it is all healthy and not a big portion. This may not be the best method for you but this has been working for me so far. I still have binges about 2 times a week but rather then a few weeks long binge cycle like I used to after that I just try and think back on the meal plan tomorrow and try to continue as if the binge never happened and that usually stops the binging, it doesn't help to get caught up on it, that just makes you lose motivation.

I think also find a few different exercises that you enjoy Doing so that exercise isn't a chore and doesn't get monotonous, if exercise is part of your plan that is!

Another thing as well is it may help to keep a little journal type thing to write down what you eat and how you feel each day when you eat these things. It may be a trigger for some people and may not work for you, but I try and write down how I feel when I binge so I can try and stop if before it starts and figure out what triggers it. It also is a bit of a kick up the ass when I read back what I've eaten for the week because it makes me realise how often the binges happen.

I hope some of those things help even if is just a little bit!

Try not worrying about exercise until after you lose the weight. And then don't even worry about "cardio". Honestly, I still can't believe people think it helps you to lose weight.

Weight loss is 100% diet.Good for you!

Best wishes for the surgery.  It is scary, but bring someone with you to take you home after.  Have a nice, comfy place to rest at home, and be sure you're stocked up on food and liquids. Someone to call on if you need help or company.
I had a lumpectomy, so surgery is spooky to go through.  I am glad you are taking steps (literally!) to improve your health beforehand.Pretty much guaranteed. But, whatever it was, it only took eating 58 calories more per day than I needed to gain 60 pounds. The guessing we do without tracking is clearly not that accurate.I think that sounds like an awesome idea!! That actually really excites me :) I am going to put in all measurements and exact weight on Monday (I'm going away for the weekend) but I am 5'6" weight between 290-300 (haven't weighed myself in awhile) and my goal is also 180!! Today I Will:

* Not overeat.
* Relax.
* Drink plenty of water.
* Try to stay positive even though I'm feeling crappy. (I think I'm coming down with a cold or something, started feeling it yesterday and ended up skipping the gym as to not infect others.)
* Make good choices at the grocery store tonight. Generally it's not bad, but a word of caution. Long term high protein can be hard on your kidneys. If you get to the point that protein is being excreted in your urine, that is a very good indicator you're eating too much protein because it's a sign your kidneys are working too hard. Kidney problems can equal blood pressure issues. The numbers you gave probably wouldn't put you in the high protein range but it's just something to be aware of.I'll be sure to keep y'all posted.  I figure it will be another 1.5 years before I reach my goal weight.  I'm doing it slowly.  But I'm sure I'll post before that.  Probably when I need an ego boost.  :)Yeah, I love it but my bf not so much. I recommend just trying it out and seeing if it works for you. Good luck!Thank you my dear!

I actually cared a lot more about clothes back then.  I had to put more effort into finding things.  Clothes probably hang better on me now.&gt; travis1414

Thanks, I will!  Yes, a long hard road ahead but getting those numbers down will keep motivated.  That and having friends on MFP who I know will see what I do each day!I want to be like you one day.It feels good to get out there, huh?  Good for you!!!I've read mixed comments on this topic. I think it takes a lot of work and the right eating to actually gain muscle, so if I experience a gain, I rarely attribute it to muscle. If you search "muscle gains while losing" or something in the search box, you will find some existing threads on this that might help.Hey Carosonev93, I've just started my journey recently, Valentines to be exact - I decided I didn't want to be fat next Valentines, it's not fair on my body or my boyfriend. I've 100(ish)lbs to lose and much like you I have failed in the past but honestly something feels different this time.

Anyways I was thinking why not be online weight loss buddies? Someone to chat to about the up's and down's, the successes and failures. Might help to keep us motivated. What cha think?

My Stats - 25/F/5'11 SW:289.3lbs  GW:180lbs

Get yourself a zeroable electronic kitchen scale. Weigh the cereal. Weigh the dinner ingredients. The scale is going to be affordable and it sounds like you may well be underestimating. Even if you aren't, that will be valuable info you can't verify without a scale.Hey, that's great!  Make sure to post a link when it's out.Feel free to add me on MFP! travis1414 (where I lack in creativity, I make up for in sprints)

And remember, hard work pays off! Work hard. It'll suck but it's so worth it. This is (or was) my situation too, only it took me a lot longer (8 months!) to clue in.  I'm much stronger, my shape has changed a bit, but no real weight loss.  Looking back I realise I was actually eating more because working out made me ravenous.

Kind of pointless to have a healthy breakfast if you follow it up with a hobbit-esque second breakfast of chocolate milk and a muffin, eh?  Whodathunk.  Anyway, after posting on here this week and hearing a chorus of 'count your calories!' I signed up for MFP.  Currently on my third day, have been maintaining a deficit every day and that's my aim ongoing.

I hope other people in the same situation read this and start counting calories, rather than do what I did.
Thanks! I forget the name of the type of pants they are. I use to wear them all the time until a small hole formed on the butt seam. So I just wear them as pajamas now!I love black rice (higher in protein, has a nice texture) as an addition to stuff like thai curry soup. Quinoa is also a good alternative. Having said that, if you don't mind, maybe make rice for your spouse and a different carb for you? I make sweet potatoes for myself instead of white, and other substitutions that don't take a ton of extra time or dishes...That's really great to hear, and inspiring. I tip my fedora to you, good sir. What is it that is going up and down for you?  Are you just trying to change your diet? Exercise?  Everything at once?

Without more info about your particular situation it's tough to give good advice :/Try lacing your shoes differently if the pain is on the top of your foot.  You can Google how to do it.  I was having foot pain on the top so I re-laced my shoes and the pain went away and hasn't been back.This week I decided that not only do I need to get in shape, but my dogs do too. So I've started then on C25K with me. We are all panting and dragging by the end, but they seem to love it. Now when I put my running shoes on they start getting excited to go.  I'm hoping they'll keep me motivated and we will all be running 5k by summer!Cannot recommend a good pair of shoes enough!  I started walking in normal tennis shoes that felt comfortable and still had issues with slight shin pain.  My first upgrade was to a pretty generic pair of New Balance shoes instead of Sketchers, and the difference was incredible.  I caught a nice sale and got them for ~$50 and I bought a pretty discreet pair that I can wear to work without drawing any attention whatsoever.

After a few weeks with those, I bit the bullet and got some walking shoes and custom insoles fitted for me at a running store.  The store ran me through the whole fitting process, including foot scans and recordings of a barefoot walk on a treadmill to see what type of shoes might work best for me, and then had me try on 6 different pairs of shoes with the insoles to see which ones felt best.  I spent a good hour and a half with the sales guys, and they answered all of my questions thoroughly.  Sadly, custom fittings of shoes isn't cheap, so this ended up costing me ~$200.  They feel AMAZING though, and I've been doing 3-4 mile walks twice a week and a 5-7 mile walk each weekend with zero pain (all on concrete).

Can't say for sure that it will help with the particular elliptical issue, as 3 minutes seems pretty fast for pain to kick in, but I will definitely say that upping my shoe game has by far made the biggest difference for me personally in increasing my workouts and reducing pain. Hey congrats, it's so encouraging to see all the progress people are making.  Thank you! I think I am going to try my fitness pal again! I am also going to start recording more stuff on paper. I like your idea of pros and cons list, I've never tried that before! Thanks for your response and time! I'll keep lifting and try and stick to a reasonable amount of food dailyWow, you look like a different person, congrats.  I'm a couple of days into using MyFitnessPal and I love it.  If results like yours come about through that, I can't waitTry weightlifting and eating more for a while. A little bit of fat can look a lot worse than necessary if there isn't a good muscle base to support it. I look better now at 140 than I did at 120 before I ever started lifting.You might want to check out /r/RunningWithDogs/, it's not hugely active, but there is a fair amount of advice about easing your dog (and yourself) into running if they aren't regular runners.

Best of luck with everything, it's fantastic. I'd always been fat and inactive since I was a kid, but in the last year running has become my joy in life. That's great! And congratulations on not having cancer--that must be a HUGE relief to you! Good luck with your surgery. I hope it goes well for you and that the recovery time isn't too extensive.

Great job staying consistent too! That's the hardest thing for me. I really admire people who push through and work out every day.

Just a sidenote to whoever: if your doctor confirms that you have a suspicious breast lump and then tells you that you should wait to see if it changes...get a second opinion right away. The threat of cancer isn't something to wait out. Some forms of breast cancer can be more aggressive than others and it's risky to wait. My mom has metastatic (late stage) breast cancer and I wouldn't wish it on anybody. You are getting way too bogged down with the process if this is something you are worried about.

Eat at the same deficit if it is working for you, and as you presumably are, look to up that sleep time. I saw Zombies Run first, but I don't really like to run. So I searched for an app just like zombies run but for walking and came up with this XD

Hope you like it! :)I had a pretty similar week as far as eating pretty shitty food but still tracking most of it. MFP is a game changer. They make it so easy to track what you eat. I've been using it the night before when I'm making the next days lunch so I get an idea of what I can do for supper the next night as well. At my heaviest I never felt pain on an elliptical. I can't even imagine why your feet would hurt baring bad shoes. There is no impact.

I'd get them looked at so you can get some prescription shoes and see what the cause of the problem is. add me: vmstarThanks for the suggestion of progress photos!  I'll give that a shot.  I'll also go add my name to your social thread.I definitely splurge a bit when I'm on it but not as bad as you'd think... maybe that's it though! I'm glad I'm not alone in this!! haha2/20/15: 151.5. That's more like it.Unfortunately, I don't have much choice for my medication.  We've tried a few and this is only one that keeps me off suicide watch.Congratulations!!Nice work and don't be discouraged by the initial gain. I always have to remind myself that it's a marathon and not a sprint. Fitbit is really great btw. Awesome that you got that magic moment! Now keep it going, a dog is a nice reason to get out so that's good. Also think about eating less and healthier it changes your body and your health a lot!

Also, surgery isn't so bad once you're in dreamland. You're going to get through this, good luck! Also I'm happy it's not cancer :) Interesting. I'm currently eating around 50-70% carbs, whatever is in this shake (anywhere between 50-65g of protein depending on whether or not I add the nuts), and almost no fat whatsoever (always comes out to 5-7% of my daily diet. Usually fat is in the nuts or the avocados.

According to my MFP profile, I'm always well below my calorie limit at the end of the day, but about 10g over for carbs, 10g under for proteins, and more than 30g under for fats. Would it be possible for me to put in last weeks weight and this weeks so I can join and start from the beginning? I guess I missed the sign up. I weigh and track daily so I have all of the data handy!

Edit: weight last Thursday was 216, weight this Thursday was 213. I'm 5'7"/female and 26 years old.

Edit2: my healthy thing this week, I had my planned and budgeted for "maintenance" meal and I ended up splitting it into two meals and hitting the gym for an hour after just because I felt weighed down. I love that im starting to crave healthy food and exercise. I know it's just confirmation bias but it seems like EVERY time I start a new diet my co-workers bring in the most deliciously unhealthy food possible. I usually hold out for the first couple of hours then I cave in around mid afternoon and feel horrible about it afterwards. Nice work though!After he told me he wasn't happy and I begged him to give it more time. He left that night and I realized I had done everything I could think of to make him happy...and I  couldn't think of any ways that he had ever done the same. The next day I told him so. A year later and I have found an amazing man who doesn't need try to do thing to make me happy... but he does anyway.   :)And so the fit-cycle continues :)So /u/bachelorettebetty ... how are you doing today? **TL; DR: Read the FAQ, measure yourself, set realistic goals, start counting calories (http://www.myfitnesspal.com/), assess your good/bad eating habits, incorporate exercise when you're ready.**

Here's what I recommend. Once again, this is only my opinion based on my experience. This is a very personal journey. Read all the advice, research, figure out what works for you.

1. Log where you are right now. Gender, age, weight, height, BMI.

2. Log where you want/need to get: healthy weight, desired BMI.

3. Make a list of bad habits you need to stop to make this happen. Do you eat large quantities? Do you eat a lot of junk/fast food? Do you drink sodas? Do you eat a lot of sweets? Are you sedentary? Do you eat when you're distressed even if you're not hungry?

4. Try to understand your bad habits and how to change them. If you use food as a coping mechanism, you need to replace it for a healthy coping mechanism. If you eat junk food because you don't know how to cook, you need to get learning, etc.

5. Make a list of healthy habits you need to lean: eating fruits, eating vegetables, drinking water, exercising, and the most important one: keeping track of what and how much you eat and how many calories what you eat has (http://www.myfitnesspal.com/).

6. Set realistic but challenging goals (with a deadline). Your goal is not only the weight loss. That's your general goal, but to get there you have a bunch of small goals.

6. Consider exercise. You will find many people that will tell you that weight loss is mostly about your eating habits. That the core of it is controlling your calorie intake. This is very true. However, exercise can be a great ally in this process, help you feel more active, improve your mood.

Finally, I wonder if your boyfriend is interested in doing this with you. I hope so, you could support each other a lot.

I wish you well in your journey!Oh, I love Zombies! Run and didn't know this even existed.  Thanks for making a post!  It's kind of gross out right now, but when it warms up a bit, I'm definitely heading to the park with this.  Cheers!  :)Great job!!As a 5'2" lady who's been stuck at the 145-150 range for a while now since the holiday, this gives me hope. Unfortunately, I think I need to get back on MFP as well, since I've been doing stronglifts 3-5x a week with no difference in weight whatsoever, which leads me to believe my cheating is happening more frequently than I realize. :/I looked at your link but it doesn't really change that fact that I've lived in this body, I've seen how I look at various weights, and I usually know my BF. At 18, when I was swimming in college and in the best ripped shape of my life, I was about 145. I'm not worried about getting down there again. At my current weight, I'm not even necessarily unhealthy, as said by my doctor. I'm just chubby and less happy. (I have elevated cholesterol but that runs in my family. My beanpole uncle's is higher, too.) BMI is usually inaccurate when applied to muscular bodies, even lowly non-body builders. I know you're not trying to be rude, I just think you're off the mark here.

As a side note, I have a friend who weighs 156 and we have very similar sized bodies (aside from bust differential). We're very similar in height and though we're almost 40lb apart, we're only one-two pant sizes apart. People always guess I weigh at least 20-30lb less than I do. The muscle mass I have makes a huge difference.Thank you!I never thought it'd be hard, I was just making sure that it wasn't too little. It might be a little tough after all of the Mcdonalds though...Yes, thank you. I would just like to hear people's personal experiences :) Use MyFitnessPal to count calories and don't go over your daily caloric needs. It's that simple. Thank you so much! This was very helpful. It's just hard to think of recipes and such because a lot of recipes use something that I would never normally buy.it's indescribable!! When my roommate asked if I wanted any of the pizza he just ordered I said no and went to the gym instead. But then when I got home and my roommate was already asleep, I stared at the left-over pizza in the fridge for several minutes imagining what I would do to it if I let myself. I'm a glutton for punishment.....and pizza. I still have excess fat though, which I want to get rid of!I still have excess fat though, which I want to get rid of!I have had a similar situation myself, my wife is often underweight and can eat a lot of whatever she wants, luckily she does eat healthy most days, but during the week she has a couple days where she will bring home treats for herself (chocolate / chips / chinese takeout (she works at a grocery store). At first this was hell for me, but that isn't the case anymore.

2 things I did:


1. Learn to live with her eating whatever she wants. I had to have a realization moment where this is my choice to eat better, not give into temptation. I chose to eat badly before, now I need to work hard to reverse the damage I've done to myself. What started out at first as torture watching her eat chicken wings or something I can't have, is now sort of liberating. I choose not to indulge, I feel good because I am choosing not to. I ate badly before when she didn't, and I don't like where it got me. She controls her weight and  it allows her to eat more things she likes, I just live with it now. I can have cheat days / items, just within reason. My diet goals are my own, not hers. I can't spend my life making her hide sweets and change her routine for me, instead I changed my routine for me, and its really great! :) I take pride in those changes, after 3-4 wks of dieting, the cravings have lessened 80% I would say. It gets easier. Eating healthy becomes a habit, except its a good habit :)


2. For the money thing, making different meals etc. We compromise a little. She likes to eat healthy so she is willing to compromise for me a little, she wants me to succeed in this as well, she sees positive changes in me that I am sure she likes too (especially being happier/healthier). So when we eat together, what I do ask of her is part of our meal be appropriate for the both of us. I liked what user tah4349 said about portion size and optional add-ons. We usually pick a healthy protein and prepare it in a way that works for both. For example, I like boneless skinless chicken breasts, splashed with lemon juice and spices (no fat added) baked in the oven in a covered dish (corningware or foil even). My wife also likes this, she can add a sauce to hers if she wants, I choose to go without. When it comes to sides, I request 1 healthy one (chopped veg for salads, green/wax beans, something like that). Then if she wants another side that is full fat (sidekicks / pasta / risotto, whatever) she can. I can either control my portion size and eat a small amount of it to fit my calorie goals, or skip it and have something else (rice cake, extra salad, apple, second vegetable of some type, or just skip the carbs and eat more protien). I ask myself how full I want to be, eating something high calorie might mean I am hungry later (2 tablespoons of risotto dissapointing LOL), this is usually what makes me choose healthier options that I can eat more of and feel full.  I also weigh everything , count everything, it takes me 2x as long to dish up, but its worth it.


So for me its a combo of the 2 things I mentioned above, I have to look at it as a choice, not a sacrifice to eat better. A sacrifice would mean I want to be eating bad but I can't, when really, I don't want to eat that way because I already know that road ends in unhappiness. I hope my comments helped in some way! :)

edit: typo/formattingYou are 5'10" and 140 lbs., your BMI is 20.  If you lost only 10 pounds, we'd start to look at you as underweight.  Excess weight is not your problem, nor are you underweight right now.  73% of men are overweight, you are well inside the 27% who are not overweight.

You are certainly not the fat one in any room.  Would you be so kind as to add my additional information as well? Thank you, kind sir.

5'10"/27/MFirst stop should be to read the FAQ on the sidebar.i did 20 minutes on the bike today on medium resistance, going for 30 tomorrow.WOW. That is a dramatic difference. Great job!Thanks for this- and way to go on 55 pounds!jesus, no. It's so much easier once you make it part of your routine. Get home from work, change clothes if needed, leash up the dog, and get going.

Once you're in the habit of walking every day then you can add on a new habit, like cooking yourself a healthy meal or doing some bodyweight exercise when you get home. Thank you! I opted for fun instead of black or brownThank you! :)You look great! I couldn't even imagine how happy the difference probably makes you!! You look great! Yeah, going to the gym or doing bodyweights would build my strength up, but how am I supposed to lose weight if I don't cut some calories?? I have been fat all my life and I am finally actually making some progress getting rid of it, only to be told that I shouldn't worry about being fat and just get strong. What is important to me is getting rid of this fat and actually looking okay for once, I'm tired of being the fat one in the room. Yes, you have to start somewhere!  And best of luck to you with the surgery and anything  else you may have going on :)  Stick with it, it's totally worth it.It's so weird though cause even when I eat crazy healthy, I'm still bloated! My mom is the same way and we both have unproportional bodies (long legs, really small torso). But I'll keep trying to eat healthy and gain muscle!

Thanks for the advice!I've noticed this too, I agree with comments about the water weight, but personally I think another factor comes into play as well. This is a bit TMI but I found that I generally go from having one bowel movement a day, to having 2-3 a day while on my period. Definitely does not have as much to do with it as water weight, but might play a factor.&gt; I know im loseing the weight but I really have no idea how many Cals im eating .

MyFitnessPal  -- app &amp; website (they work together or separately) does an awesome job with this.

M 51 5'11" (181 cm) SW:298 (135 kg) CW:202 (92 kg) GW: 185 (84 kg) in 7 months using MyFitnessPal and walkingI'm a pack a day smoker, I also starting doing couch to 5k a few months ago. I now run 5k 3 days a week, and am planning on starting the bridge to 10k. I found the effects were the worst during the first few weeks but once my cardio endurance got better I stopped noticing shortness of breath and wheezing (although just because I don't notice it doesn't mean smoking is not affecting my running). I tend to run in the morning so that I don't have to have a cigarette right before heading out, or if I run later I will just chew nicotine gum during the hour before heading out. I'm planning on quitting soon, but goddam that post run stretch and cigarette is my favourite smoke of the day.

TLDR: Go for it. It's possible. Try not to smoke immediately before hand.I wish I had found this sub earlier actually. Many times (before finding LoseIt) I started a diet and exercises and then I was like "It will never work, all doctors say I'm old already" and just stopped. If I had found this sub with my 15yo metabolism probably I would have lost the "half me" I have to :)No problem. I've totally been there. Lost a bunch of weight, gained it back, rinse and repeat.  To be honest, even though I've lost the most weight "this time" around, it's been the *easiest* weightloss so far, I think in part because I've been *completely* surrounded by junk food (both at home and work).

It's turned me into a "willpower machine". And it will likely do the same for you. You'll be unstoppable.

You can totally do this!&gt; dark rice (black rice or wild rice or quinoa)

Please help me with rice ... even whole-grain rice tastes like nothing to me, but my spouse wants rice.  What should I do?My main hobby is motorsports, car racing specifically.  I also instruct up and coming wanna-be race car drivers on how to be faster/better.  One day late last November I was at the race track doing my thing and one of my former students came up and invited me to go for a ride to see if I can help her work on some things.

She has a small(er) race car with a full cage and bucket seats; basically you have to contort yourself to get in or out the car, but it shouldn't be hard to do.  As I was climbing over the roll cage with my helmet and hans on I began to breath heavy and start to sweat... keep in mind its the end of November and temps were in the 50's. I finally made it in the car and then had to buckle my harnesses, which was extremely difficult to do with my big gut getting in the way.

By the time I was buckled in (which took entirely too long) I was out of breath and covered in sweat (thankfully my helmet hid most of this).  It was then and there I realized this is not how it should be and I need to do something about this.  That was on a Sunday.  The following Monday after work I went to the MMA gym around the corner from my house and signed up.

I messed around with some of their programs for a little over a month, going 3-4 times per week, but didn't lose any weight.  It wasn't until I stumbled upon r/fitness and learned about eating a caloric deficit that the weight started to drop off.

I changed my eating habits, started tracking all my calories, eliminated processed/fast foods and when my 2 month membership at that gym expired I joined a real weight lifting gym and began to strength train 3x per week.

Been at it for about a month now and I'm starting to actually see results in the mirror.  I'm down a little shy of 20# so far and feel so much better.

SW:~210, CW:192, GW:???  My goal is no longer a specific weight #, but rather a specific body composition.  I know its going to take time to get there and I'm 100% fine with that.  I love this new chapter in my life and can't wait to see what the future holds.Wow! That is actually impressive. One time I tried cutting all carbs and sugar, but I hadn't too much info and I just ended up feeling really shitty after a month, so I stopped. You do this one month diet and then you go back to eating "normal"? Like, eating everything?

Thank you for your motivation :)If you're on the app, look for a Nutrition display and touch the icon that looks like a pie.I feel ya. Maybe just try making healthy and delicious meals for you both with like triple meat for him?&gt; Because it's clear that I'm eating too many carbs, what's the best way (or really, any good way) to keep fat intake high (but not high enough to actually hurt me)

Here's the thing... as you add fat or protein while keeping calories the same, the PERCENTAGE AND AMOUNT of carbs you eat will be decreased.

&gt; while keeping carb intake relatively low (under 25% of daily caloric intake)?

That's lower than recommended, and will probably make you feel like crap if you go that far or reduce carbs quickly.  Work at it gradually.  I eat 50% (or a little less) carbs, 30% (or a little less) fats, 20% (or a little more) proteins.  I've lost 96 lbs. in 7 months.

According to the Institute of Medicine, they recommend we consume 45 to 65 percent of their calorie intake as carbohydrates, and at least 130 grams of carbs per day.

So let's say you want to go to 45% but you're eating 75%.  Add some good fats and tasty proteins and keep your calories the same.  You'll eat fewer carbs as a result.  It's an attitude of adding, not cutting; a lot easier to mentally handle.

My sleep schedule is really f*cked up. I have insomnia, and I have classes at night, so I usually go to sleep at 6/7am (sometimes I'm lucky and I doze off at 2am) but I always wake up around noon. It doesn't matter how loud my alarm is. Today I woke up at 7am, even tho I went to sleep around 3am, and I did my 5km walk. I'm actually really impressed in how much I'm motivated to do the same tomorrow, as I've always been a sedentary/lazy person. One day I want to say that too "my old self doesn't recognize the now me" :)Thanks for this. I think that due to falling off the wagon for a number of reasons, I've got stuck in a rut of self pity and actually I need to be tougher on myself now and suck it up. I hate feeling shitty and like I undid all my hard work before, but I did it before and I can do if again. I need to get out of the blame game and learn to modify my habits. Thanks for the motivation!This is great, I'm going to have to throw together something similar over the next couple weeks. I've been doing the same. Lost 17.5 lbs over the last 6 weeks and I've dined like a bachelor king.Take into account that over the course of 10 years your metabolism will slow.I'm in your shoes. My husband doesn't follow any eating restrictions (and honestly, a large portion of his diet consists of chocolate, snack cakes, potato chips, and jerky).

The harsh news is that if he's not following the same eating goals, then you *have* to make separate accommodations for yourself. The good news is that it's not the end of the world, although it can be a bit more expensive. But in the end, you'll be a stronger person who is equipped to deal with temptations easier than those who have been surrounded with nothing but healthy food.

My husband and I basically eat entirely separate meals, except for dinner. I'm the cook, so he'll eat whatever I make. If he doesn't like it, that's fine, he'll make something else for himself. And I'll eat the leftovers for lunch the next day.

But hopefully if your SO wants to see you get healthy, he'll agree to making *some concessions* as well (like not ordering a 12-topping, deep dish pizza after you've already made dinner). My husband is kind enough to get a thin crust from Papa Murphy's that I can actually budget into my daily calories.

Here's something you'll have to work through, though:

&gt;If he wants pizza for dinner it's really hard for me to get up and make a stir fry for myself...

Yep, it's hard. But you have to do it. This weightloss road is unfortunately difficult at times. But the more frequently you go out of your way *for yourself*, the easier it becomes. [I wrote a little about this here](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2wfztt/anyone_else_get_jealous_of_people_buying_bad_food/coqjnwe) yesterday, so I won't leave the full novel here. ;) But you'll have to learn to co-exist with the food environment around you, rather than being frustrated that it doesn't conform to your goals.I used to not eat breakfast and it wasn't a big deal, I would get hungry at like 11 and be tempted to have something junky, but then now when I get hungry I'm tempted to eat something junky. That said, I now have breakfast no matter what. I think it was that statistic that most people who have lost weight eat breakfast, which has already been mentioned ITT, that pulled me in and now it's just habit. If not having breakfast works for you then great. Whilst there are certain modus operandi that I would generally see as key for losing weight, what works for you, well works! :)I guess is all depends on the type of person you are.  For me, i weigh myself every morning before i shower and i keep track of every day so i can see how i'm trending. I don't panic if one day i'm a pound or two heavier than the previous day since there are lots of reasons for minor fluctuations (hydration being a huge one). When i see a number a little higher than the previous day it gives me an incentive to do a little better today and when the number is lower its a pat on the back that i'm doing good.
BUT if you're the type of person who see's a higher number and gives up to drown your sorrows in a bucket of fried chicken, then maybe you shouldn't own a scale.

edit: for an inability to type words


tl;dr  if you use it as an incentive then weigh yourself, if you use it as a crutch for failure then don't. Haha thanks for the reply! I think he would understand if I was harsh on him like that, I think I'm the one that finds if hard to be firm, both with him and with myself. I think I cook to please a lot too, and unfortunately now I'm not just pleasing myself hereThis is great advice! Thank you so much. The taco thing really makes sense as I make a lot of fajitas type things at home. Thanks for the encouragement!That's tough. I'm a single dude so take my advice with a grain of salt.

Start by having a mature, rational conversation about this. When you normally cook it should be healthy food and he should just eat it since he's lucky enough that someone cooks for him. If he orders pizza that's his prerogative and you're just going to have to suck it up and eat healthy. But when you're cooking, it's your prerogative what to make. It's his choice to eat it or not. One day you will be the jogger crossing in front of someone else , sparking the inspiration I never had a problem with smoking and working out.  I just made sure not to smoke an hour before and an hour after I was done.  Because the hour before would fuck up my workout, and I'd feel short of breath, whereas in the hour after, it'd make me crash hard and I'd get queasy.... so, if you can go for 3-4 hours without a smoke, I think you're fine.  If you're a heavy smoker though, you'll probably need to get that under control first.Been there!  My husband is a distance runner.  When he's heavy in training for something, he has to eat and eat and eat just to not feel miserable - 3k-4k calories every single day.  The thing is that we both need to eat GOOD food.  It's not healthy for anybody to eat pizza and junk food all the time.  So in order of importance:

Step 1 - no junk in the house.  Neither one of us should eat it.  And if he wants it, he goes to a restaurant and gets some for himself.

Step 2 - Portion size.  I eat 1 cup of whatever is on the menu.  He eats 3.  (for example)  If I'm not full, I supplement with salad, veggies, something like that.  I don't supplement with more of the entree.

Step 3 - additions.  I make something - say tacos.  On the table there is sour cream, cheese, veggies, protein.  He eats his loaded up to the top with the cheese and protein, less veggies.  I load mine the opposite.  It's all about finding meals that I can make one time and we can each modify based on our needs.  If I made a pasta primavera, he might add lots of cheese and chicken to his, I just leave mine full of veggies.  Look at what you are cooking now.  Think "how can I alter this for me, how can he alter it for him."  There is no reason to cook two separate meals, the meals just have to be planned more carefully.  If he doesn't like what you're cooking, then he can get up, walk to the kitchen, and make his own meal.  Really they key for us was having things like cooked chicken breasts, cheeses, maybe bottled or frozen sauces, etc. on hand that he could add to his food for extra calories but that I could leave off and just enjoy the meal.

It's not easy, but if you plan and are conscious of it, it's very very doable.  As long as you start with a base of good, healthy food, the rest is just mixing and matching.MyFitnessPal was and continues to be essential. I also began lifting weights regularly and doing cardio 3 times per week including lots of squash. Diet is easily the most important factor. I focused more on macronutrients than calories. It's important to know how to properly fuel your body. you look great!  keep up the good work.Yes! Get after those calories. You can do it.I booked my trip to Mexico last week for the last week in March. I started low/no carb on Monday and no alcohol until Mexico. I'm already down 3 lbs. Good luck on your continued weight loss! Safe travels and fun times in Mexico!! Man, I had exactly the same experience on Wednesday. I ran a half marathon in November, then "took a break" from counting calories. I noticed my jeans were a little tighter than usual, gathered up all my courage for about a week, and jumped on the scale. I had gained a few pounds but not nearly as much as I'd expected. Good luck to ya!thank you! :D I have a jawline and everything now!! it also doesn't help I was at a wedding I didn't want to be at in the left picture :P but yeah it's amazing how much I've mentally changed. more so than physically, if you can believe it. This is exactly what happens to me. I drop a larger portion of weight right before my period, then gain it all back overnight about a quarter of the way through my cycle. Hang in there. It *does* come back off.  It's just water weight.haha I will! the first step to realizing I have a problem is admitting I have a problem. I have to get my head out of my butt and realize things on my own. thank you!! &gt; but do you use it consistently?

Yes.

&gt;Do you stay within your daily intake consistently?

Probably 4/7 days per week.

&gt;If I eat one cookie or piece of chocolate, I will eat them all, so I don't eat even one cookie.

I've been thinking about doing this, I'll definitely use it as my strategy from now on.
I'm not fully done losing, but I do have some jiggly skin and minor bat wings that I'm frustrated with. once I hit my goal weight and I don't have to pay for weight watchers anymore, I'm going to use that money to hire a personal trainer to help me tighten up and tone up. thank you!! If I'm cooking for someone regularly (special occasions aside), they will eat what I cook or they will find something else to eat. With that said, if your man is trying to gain and you are trying to lose, you could make his portion much larger than yours. You will both be eating well and he will be getting high quality calories. If he needs more than that or wants junk, he can go buy it or cook it himself.

Maybe I'm a little harsh...Worth mentioning, Banquet dinners are $0.80 to $1.00 at walmart and have similar calorie ranges (210 salisbury steak, 270 McRib knockoff, up to low 400's for the highest meals which still isn't awful). I also find the much more filling than the more expensive meals which are marketed as healthy.I think it's different for everyone. For me, it's a combination of Willpower and Motivation that is the hardest part. When I was at my highest weight, I was very sensitive to comments about my weight, how to diet, how I should lose weight, why I should lose weight, what exercises I should do, etc... blah blah blah blah blah. I know in part some comments were well-intentioned, some were malicious, but everything came across as an attack to me regardless if it was  more like, "lets do more exercise" or "come out to take a walk", because I felt that I was not and never will be the pretty one, being physically strong was not perfect enough if I didn't lose weight.... basically a lot of self doubt (compliments to oneself were hard to come by in my family, it's getting a little bit better, but still difficult). So that made me just give up. It made it very difficult to become motivated, let alone have the willpower to change. Thankfully, I somehow stumbled into this subreddit and seeing all those people (who wanted to change, trying to change, failed and got back onto the horse, and being successful in changing themselves) motivated me. Helped me think, "It will take time and it will be difficult, but I can do this! Other people have, I can too." It helped me strengthen my willpower too.

Diet and training is easier once you have the willpower and motivation to do so and make into a habit. I tried on a pair of my mom's 18 pants and they were tight, so I hauled my ass to weight watchers the following Sunday. I like weight watchers for the community aspect, and mfp for the accountability it gives. I use mfp to help me stay on track with the correct portions to eat, because portion control is my weakness. I eat a lot of small meals a day, because I'm always hungry. I eat 1250 calories a day in 200-300 chunked meals.  You look fantastic! &gt; Why did you take the chocolate?

Turning it down would have felt mean. I could have given a bunch to people in my floor though to get rid of the chocolate.

&gt; You cannot buy a box of cookies.

Yeah, that was a dumb decision. Not again.

I should indeed find healthy snacks.
I'll check it.  Thanks.I use standard kitchen bowls, and usually a 3/4c of cereal, with 1/4-1/2 cup of milk. it works perfectly for that size bowlI've noticed in my body some but my pants still fit the same? It's kinda annoyingProbably a combination of boredom and cravings. Maybe?thank you!! I'm stubborn and competitive, so I made it work enough to not go crazy. I'm kind of crazy anyway, so maybe that's why.  :P I noticed I was on a 6 month plateau doing ww alone and downloaded mfp to see where I could shave points. I was eating at my maintenance level of calories because of the amount of 0 ppv fruits and veggies I was eating! so I view mfp as helping me eat the correct *portions* of food, especially fruits and veggies. portion control is my Achilles heel. How do you get the calorie/macro breakdown?I'm gonna put money on that bowl being *way* more than one cup. A cup is pretty tiny.  (For example, [these "extra small" ziploc containers](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/4675725577761868421?q=1+cup+bowl&amp;rlz=1C1GGGE_enUS382US382&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=898&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.86475890,d.cGU&amp;tch=1&amp;ech=1&amp;psi=2J3nVPb0LJKoogT02oK4Dw.1424465369466.3&amp;prds=paur:ClkAsKraX9kN6G7uKg0Q8_wIcSAVmS1WOwsyvqt3Hl-YKLgulRflJsv1YhY21C7HBuK2eG8bD-RAuUtram9-G9lRglMQrNB8c_YqaytSM5KtNRVXMurGgXRavhIZAFPVH716nsChsNRqaqoroeDvr2Qx6YhPKQ&amp;ei=353nVJi4HIKvogT1i4LwDg&amp;ved=0CK4BEKYrMAE) are 1 cup in size"

Make sure you're measuring that cereal. Weighing is even better. One cup of cereal is a *very small* amount, so if it's fitting nicely into your bowl, and you're eyeballing it, you may be pouring way more than the serving size.  :)

I know for me, cereal is something I don't have that often. For the tiny amount you get per serving, it's just not worth the calories (to me). If I were to pour an eyeballed serving similar to what I'd eat in my pre-diet days, it would be a 500+ calorie meal.I re-gained the 60 pounds I'm currently working on losing over the course of 10 years. If you do the math on that, it's only being over my actual needs by 58 calories per day. Without tracking, there's no way on earth someone can consciously manage it that closely.Thank you :) I'm glad to be here.F) Belief

For the few percent who are successfully dieting and keeping it off, there are the rest of the people who don't believe that it is even possible for them.  yeah I hear that! I carried my weight really well, and I'm short so I guess I hid it better? I'm aiming to lose 75 pounds, and I'll still be at the high end of my BMI at that weight. #hobbitproblemsoh I still have cravings. sometimes I make allowances for them, sometimes I tell myself to shut my pie hole and get my head out of my butt :P the key thing I've noticed with exercise is that I have to enjoy it. if I don't enjoy it, I won't keep up with it. I love Zumba, so I do Zumba. I love hiking (and I'm in SoCal so it's awesome to hike), so I hike. I hate lifting weights/gaining muscle, so I'm still trying to figure out a way to make it fun like I did with my gym routine. I invented this idea called Disney Cardio (I even made a hashtag on Instagram. check it out). I watch a Disney movie with a soundtrack and I run during the singing parts and walk during the talking parts. I love it and it distracts me enough to enjoy being on the treadmill/elliptical for more than 10 minutes. Ah, I see. No problem, I will PM you with information.This post has too little content  **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Floseit&amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2wl3qr/figured_id_join_the_trend_35_lbs_down_face/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

I cant see any info other than "this is private" I weighed more than twice what you weigh and often didn't feel "bloated."

You're not overweight by any measure  -- not a little, not maybe -- just not.  By all means, work on your musculature.  You may even put on some muscle pounds but muscles tend to lift and accentuate positives to our eyes (and you'll feel great, too).I may or may not have looked up Jessie spano when the first person mentioned her. I don't see a resemblance, but Elizabeth Berkely is beautiful so I'm taking the compliment! I think you'll be okay. Just try to get calipers and make sure that you aren't losing muscle and you should be fine.Bingo. I've never seen a 1 cup cereal bowl in my life. Do you have cup measures? A digital scale? Both are under $20 total and will make all the difference in the world.
my friends laugh at me because I'm so clueless when it comes to flirting. they say I need to wear a sign that says "help me, I'm oblivious to flirting and need direct compliments!" o_OWill add! Mine is scrumpy90&gt; watermelon cubes with lime juice and salt.

I'll definitely try that
So are you saying I should just stay fat?Welcome back, we're glad you are here.This right here.  I've gotten into a good rhythm of working out, and actually enjoy doing it, and most days I'm having to fiddle with my diet to actually reach my calorie goal, not to stay under it.  I want to do it, and I'm not having to force myself to do it, now that I know what I'm actually doing, lol.

But man.  Can this 100 pounds be gone right now?  I've already been doing this for a week!  That's totally long enough to be fit, right?  Ugh.Yum!!!! My new thing is making giant skillets of stir fry using Pasta Zero, 15 cals per serving of pasta plus tons of veg and bit of stir fry sauce. I had a massive plate the other night and it was under 200 cals!That is the best feeling!

I just take mega mens because that was what was in the house, and it fortunately has that stuff.Congrats you look great!! I'm mostly a lurker too but I've been commenting more today. What did you do to lose the weight?Consistency - all of the above are freaking easy just usually at very different times, it's just having them balance each other long term that's hard!A minimum of 20% of your calories should be coming from protein. If you're eating 1500 calories/day, you need a bare minimum of 75g. Any specific multivitamin you would reccomend?I don't have breast implants but here are my thoughts.  Having body fat, like on your stomach, shouldn't make you feel bloated. Feeling bloated is directly related to what you've eaten. Looking bloated is most likely related to diet or cycle, too (water retention). In the end...diet is your biggest concern here.  Now, losing 5-8 pounds is not likely going to make your boobs sag, I don't think.  You likely won't lose 5 pounds of pure fat, you'll lose 5 pounds of fat/water/muscle/waste/etc.  On top of that you don't lose 5 pounds of fat from one area, you lose it all over so it will come from your boobs/stomach/butt/back/legs/feet/etc. so it's not going to come all from your chest.

My advice would be to not worry about losing weight, specifically, because if you want to aesthetically improve your stomach it's all about muscles.  Add on the muscle!

tldr:  bloated "feels" aren't from body fat, and muscle is awesome.You can PM a moderator and request accessTricky! Could you ask your doctor about this? You don't have much to lose, but you're right, that's a common place to lose from. If you don't get advice from people who have done this, I'd say check with a doctor, just to be sure.I think I recognise you...Just wanted to let you know that I've had that surgery done and you'll be fine! Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have from a patient point of view. I had very minimal recovery time and was back in the gym within 2 weeks. Also the surgery part itself was very quick and easy. I just needed someone to drive me home because the drugs made me loopyWow, that is some dedication.  I used to have that level of motivation going from 210-&gt;160 (I would sometimes go to the gym twice a day), but I may have burned out a little.  Are you at goal yet, or still trucking along?Very true, as I cook for most of our meals I normally don't end up buying pre-packaged but I spend a ton of money on fruits/veggies as a lot of what I like are currently out of season (ie. fresh raspberries) I may try this.  I keep my carbs relatively low (under 80 a day), but I've never gone "full" low carb and into ketosis.It's really helpful see that I am not the only one struggling here.  I think that simply knowing I am not the only one with a seemingly bum metabolism makes me feel a little less alone in having to restrict my calories and sweat my ass off to sloooooowly get to a healthy weight.All of those look so tasty!
My big thing right now are fish recipes and soup/chili recipes (as I'm in the NE right now where we are dealing with -10 to -25F windchill, a good hearty soup or chili is an amazing productivity booster for the day).


Can You Stay for Dinner is great! I got a decent recipe for buffalo chicken rolls for the superbowl from there.


Awesome!this is absolutely very wise. I can't deny I'd actually like to not be overweight though, after literally all my life as nothing less than overweight and sometimes much more than that... I feel like I don't want to be like that when I die, if that makes any sense. I don't want to die the way I've always been, I want the petty satisfaction of saying ok I sucked for most of it but then I finally did it. Something like that. Yep, I have a friend who is basically trying to outrun her fork, poor girl.  The more she works, the hungrier she gets, so even more she works.  Endless cycle.Cool, thanks.  I'll take a look.I do love me some salt.  :)I think it is.  Pretty sure whatever the serving size is fits nicely into this bowl.Very possible, yeah.Good catch, I see where it could be read that way and you gave me a chance to clarify.  I think it is straightened out.  Appreciate the comment and your detailed reply.Thanks!  I've found that unhealthy pre-packaged stuff can be super expensive, so I've freed up a lot of my budget by not buying things in boxes.I've been overweight since puberty to some degree or other, so I'm pretty much at peace with always being so.  My goal is to be *less* overweight than I am now, that way I won't be beating myself up for not reaching a goal I've never achieved.Hey /u/TheyFoundMyOldOne

I pretty much agree with all of this.  There's really no need to turn you into a calorie counter, don't worry about it.  Make no changes and follow the rest of /u/ebrau36 advice. hereGreat job! The poverty challenge sounds pretty intense (honestly I'm not sure how much I even spend on food).


Keep it up! It sounds like you are doing great! :) Take a multivitamin that includes Zinc. Eat plenty of protein. You can try exfoliating but I wouldn't go spend a ton on creams etc. A massage can help by increasing blood flow to those areas.


I hear when you hit 9-10% body fat for men, your skin makes remarkable improvement. Above all, give this time!Just think... you'll be that inspiring person soon, too.  :)

high five.  o^/ Well I think you just found your problem. I know, believe me I know, that you want to place the blame somewhere else. I am intimately familiar with that state of being. But you are pretty much spelling out in black and white right here that the problem is laying with the way you're alloting and tracking your food. You are a victim of portion creep. This!! I have struggled with my weight my whole life. In 2011 I was at 153 then got pregnant and yoyo'd ever since to about 175/180. In 2013 I lost about 25 but I weighed myself so much I got really obsessive. I finally through my scale away. And ended up at 186!!! I now own a scale but have committed myself to only weighing in every 4 weeks. It's not the best for everyone but it's what I need to keep me motivated. Seeing an 8 pound drop every 4 weeks vs seeing a possible 2 pound drop every week is just more motivational for me. that really resonates with me, I carry my weight like a male in my belly area, and I can't picture myself without a tummy, which is kinda sad. I've always had it, even as a kid. I totally understand. My very first goal was just to be in the healthy weight range. Or lower end of overweight.In addition to some great advice given here, I want to add that the calculators are just estimates. You have to play around to see what works for you. At 5'3", I lost 1.67 lbs/week for about 3 months by eating 1,200 calories a day PLUS working out at least 45 min - 60 hours a day, sometimes doing two workouts a day.

I started with 1,200 calories/day, saw the progress I wanted, and stuck with it. When I wanted to get closer to 2 lbs/week instead of 1 lb/week, I added in more exercise. The key is to find what works *for you.* It won't be exactly what calculators tell you, it won't be what works for your girlfriendif you are losing weight at a slower pace than you want, you need to either eat less or move more, or both.

And the reason it's "harder" to lose weight for us short people is because (a) the difference between our BMR and our TDEE in sheer magnitude (i.e., number of calories) is smaller than taller people, giving us less wiggle room and (b) as a result, in order to lose 2 lbs/week, we need to stick to a low caloric intake *and* expend energy via working out, otherwise we would need to eat like 800 calories, which is a bad idea for lots of reasons. your answer makes me think of how many people say "I just want to go back to what I weighed at 18", probably because many people put on weight since college, but I was actually already heavily overweight then, I'm about 10 kilos lighter now !You have a 1-cup sized cereal bowl? I just keep reminding myself that there's really no other choice.  What I'm doing is not that difficult, frustrating, but not difficult.  So what are my choices, give up?  I'm 38, I know what happens when you say "fuck it".  So I'm stuck doing what am doing, but I'd give anything for it to just been June already.  Then I can be obsessed with maintaining... It will be interesting, I've never reached maintenance mode before.Hey there, I actually am coming from a similar area. In December of 2013 I was hospitalized and diagnosed with panic disorder and GAD. I was put in an SSRI (Citolopram) and a Benzo (Xanax). For the  first month I almost never ate and when I did I felt sick. I lost 20+ lbs and coincidenatlly got to my goal weight, albeit in a very unhealthy manner. I was weak and as lazy as lazy could be.


Flash foward a month and I am going on dates and eating again, thankfully. I got back to a healthy feeling and I was still sub 200 lbs. I was determined to keep the weight off. This seemed to go well for a few months but I was secretly putting on a few pounds per month. This really killed me in May of 2014 when I started going out almost every night but had a complete disregard for me weight. By August I was back up to 220 lbs, I gained nearly everything that I has lost. Then to top it all of I got into a relationship where I was completely complacent with my weight and gained another 22 lbs.


Now looking back on this I wish that I would have kept on track with my weight and what I was eating so I am now doing what I wish I would have. I use MFP to calculate **EVERYTHING** that I eat and I weigh/measure everything before eating it. I also weigh myself every day and some days I weigh more and a majority of days I weigh slightly less. It can be discouraging but it also helps keep me honest and on track.

I also posted this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2vy10r/looking_for_mfp_friends_to_help_keep_each_other/) last week in an attempt to make losing weight more social. So far it has been a reat motivator and it seems like everyone is enjoying having internet friends to cheer them on throughout their weight loss process.


I feel like I may have scrambled my ideas a bit while writing this so feel free to PM me with any questions that you may have. I came from a similar point and have myself heading in the right direction.


Good luck!


**EDIT** I forgot to mention something, I think. If you do not want to weigh yourself then I suggest taking progress pictures. Sometimes you lose a little bit of weight but your body shrinks a lot. I have gone weeks thinking that I was making very little progress because my weight only went down a few pounds. Then I compare my pictures and I look like I lost a significnt amount of weight. ~1600 is his maintenance calories and what he is currently eating.  His weight is normal.  I am not advising him to lose weight, I'm advising him to make no changes.  I tried to use that site.. of course there was a total of *one* reference picture for my height ... I'm 6 foot. Not very common for a female.I personally did the same thing you are talking about. Smoked a pack a day while doing my weight loss, recently quit and started vaping. Smoking defentely effects your running but you will still see progress. I was still able to do an hour of cardio without any major breathing problems ( I did need to stop and catch my breath from time to time ) My advice would be to do it anyway, if your looking to start exercising do it. Do not skip the exercise because you smoke, its not all that big of a deal that you do.  If the cardio is too hard some days, try some resistance training.


Also... I highly recommend vaping to any smoker, it has done wonders for me and my fitness. Hope I helped.I started at 244 and couldn't really tell until I hit right where you are at now. After that it felt like I was changing every day.  Keep the faith and don't lose your motivation. You will be amazed how you feel after you drop another 20!I smoke. I have lost some weight over the past year and started running. I did my first half marathon in Dec 2014 and outperformed my expectations. If you start running and you feel winded, think about quitting or cutting down but don't let the fact that you smoke keep you from getting out there for a run!It depends on the person, for me I need to weigh myself because I am not seeing physical progress and when I see the numbers on the scale go down it's a huge motivator for me to keep at it. Three or so years ago I was scared to weigh myself, even when I started eating better/less and exercising more. I knew my starting weight was somewhere around 190lbs and by the time I checked my weight (by force at my doctor's office), I was down to around 165 and was ecstatic. However, after that I continued to not look at the scale and after I graduated college I gained it all back plus some more because I was still feeling good about myself but forwent monitoring my weight changes.


But this story was for me personally and everyone is different. So find what works best for YOU and stick to it! :)


As for the medication, I have no idea what it is but have you tried asking your doctor is there an alternative you could try that might not be so hard on your metabolism?Focus on doing HITT cardio instead of just running or doing normal cardio. Works much better for shedding fat. Also, I would try a radical diet change because maybe your body has adjusted to the kids of food you eat. For example, if you eat carb heavy, switch your macros so you mostly eat protein or fats.Your TDEE without exercise is 2177 so a 2000 calorie diet wouldn't take you very far.  At your ideal weight, your TDEE without exercise is 1572.  Eating 2000 without exercise when you're at your ideal weight will make you gain weight.

Let's go with 2177 which x7 days in a week is 15239 plus 3 workouts of conservatively 300 calories each makes it 16139

To lose a pound a week, you want 3500 less than that.

To lose 2 pounds a week, you want 7000 less than that.

So that's a weekly budget of 9139 calories.

I would want to eat a little more on exercise days (3x1400) and a little lighter on non-workout days (4x1200).

You will lose weight more slowly in the 2nd half of your journey.  Do not drop your calories as you lose weight as you're already at minimal levels.  It's okay and normal that the last part takes longer.  You've got this.

I cried when I read this. I am tearing up because I could not imagine finding a lump and I pray the surgery goes well for you. I also cried because I can tell you mean it, I am down some weight but I am still striving to be like that women you saw. We will get there. I am proud of you!I agree! Everything else is fairly easy once you get into the habit of it. I try to be patient but some days I just want to see some kind of improvement so I know that I'm on the right track.This is fatlogic, body shape really has very little bearing on the medical definition of obese, which for the vast majority of people, apart from maybe Olympic lifters and the Rock, denotes the weight's effect on one's overall health.  Where the weight is distributed might have a minimal impact over a lifetime of where problems occur, but the fact is extra weight will cause problems.  As /u/notevenapro said, the numbers put you in the obese category and therefore even with a short torso and long legs you are at an elevated risk for multiple health problems and long term damage to the body.

Until you accept this you won't make very much progress because it will only be an excuse for you not to take your diet seriously or medical opinions seriously.  It will make it easier to tell yourself that a couple scoops of ice cream at the end of a rough day or just one day out drinking with the friends to take the edge off really won't have that much of an impact, and even if it does, that's OK because, really, you're not obese, you just have a few pounds to loose, what is one more pound tacked on to that total.  Then one more becomes 5 more and 5 becomes 20.  Until each pound matters, each meal matters, and you realize the effect just 10 pounds lost will have on your chronic problems' severity, you will not make any lasting changes or progress.

I don't say this from an outsider's perspective, I had a similar start with depression, anxiety, exhaustion, not so much with the pain, and was at about the same weight. I was easily able to tell myself that it wasn't much of an issue, I am tall, well proportioned and relatively "fit", or what I thought was fit.  People never believed me when I told them what I weighed because I "didn't look it", and so I was able to justify not making any changes and having fast food for lunch every day because otherwise I was doing fine losing and gaining 5 pounds every other month.  At some point it just clicked, I was spending so much energy justifying my habits, my looks, my activities and basing so much of my self worth on them and at the same time not taking any of it seriously.  The moment I did take it seriously and started holding myself accountable for the mental gymnastics and lies I told myself, and started counting calories correctly, paying attention to my macros, walking the dog beyond the front yard and gaining confidence, it was a snowball and for me there is no going back to that kind of thinking and hopefully that body.How are your macros? Have you ever tried Keto diet? I know that it has helped many, especially makes. Dieting is easy - just eat less and learn to say no

Training is fun - an hour/hour and a half to listen to music and push yourself to your limit without outside distractions.

Willpower - This is only used after coming off a "cheat", or whatever you want to call it. After, you are just following a routine. It can be hard jumping back on the wagon, but it is always worth it. After you have been in the cycle for a bit, I crave the normal routine, so after a while this is easy too.

Motivation - You wanted to change for a reason. You were fed up of being fat, out of shape and generally in a bad way. This hasn't changed because you have lost 5lbs, 10lbs etc. The motivation is always there, it is just if you follow through with your motivated thought process.

The hardest part about losing fat is maintaining the fat loss. You get constant feedback while losing, be it the scales, peoples comments, having to get new clothing, being fitter, being stronger or a host of other things. There is always a new goal in sight. When you have hit a healthy weight and move to different goals, the feedback slows down and can even become negative. "You're losing too much weight" "You're at the gym too much" "Just splurge, you don't have to be so strict now" for example. Some people have enough self control to splurge. I dunno what to tell you. Obviously you struck a nerve for many people so you seem to be the common denominator. Yeah, or something where you don't have to weigh yourself like Whole30 or paleo.Thanks for the wishes. My biggest problem is my head when I'm hungry. When I started losing weight, I always thought of being skinny as the solution to so many problems. Now that know what it feels like, my head says: "Being skinny is cool alright, but it isn't that spectacular. You know what is spectacular? Some more peanut butter!"

I don't think I'll ever stop loving food. And I don't want to. But I have to manage eating reasonable servings.Great job! It feels so good to have some tangible evidence that your hard work is paying off- my belt holes are the only difference I've noticed,  so I totally get that!You can google "Calories needed to maintain". Once you have that number you can calculate yourself how much you need to reduce that number by to lose a certain amount  week. A pound is 3,500 calories. If you deduct 500 from your current maintain intake you will lose 1lb a week. So in a year you are down 50 pounds. To maintain based on what you said it is 2,700 a day. You would lose if you went to 2,000 but based on what I have read most girls shoot for 1,200 to 1,800. You should talk to you Dr. also.I am currently in a nutrition class, and my calorie limit is based on my RBM minus a deficit to lose 1 lb a week. My nutritionist is of the "slower is better" mindset. I was trying 1200 calories when I was doing it on my own, and it worked for a while, then BINGE. So that may be where she's coming from.

If you're doing OK with the 1200 then by all means go for it! Some people can get that to work especially when nutrition density comes into play.

If you're having trouble with the 1200, you could have your RBM tested and get "real" numbers telling you exactly what it takes to lose 1 or 2 lbs a week. Yes, a negative one.Why are you advising him to cut?  He is growing and underweight.I like this calorie calculator... http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/If you don't have access to a gym check out the following sub reddits and look at their beginner routine.  I wish I started this stuff at your age, it will get you strong as shit.

Thank you. After briefly looking at it, it looks like what I have been searching for. I will definitely have to explore it more though.He is correct.This, absolutely.See my reply to /u/funchords above, but let's review this:

* You are a growing, active (you cycle, strength train, etc.) teenage guy
* You are 5'10
* You are 140lbs

There is NO reason you need to lose weight.  Your dad is right.  There is no reason to be eating &lt;2,000 cals.  For an overweight adult who is finished growing and has a bunch of excess fat to lose, yes going under 2,000 cals is okay.  You are not in any of those categories.

&gt;I just have flab on my stomach and ass that I want to lose

This is WHERE your body stores fat.

Here is my advice to you:

* Be active, get a lot of fun movement (cycling, hiking, walking, sports, whatever you enjoy)

* Try to cultivate a good group of friends and enjoy being a freakin' teenager.

* Strength training is awesome and will pay dividends throughout your life.  If you don't have access to weights (or don't like them) check out /r/bodyweightfitness.  It is an incredible resource.

* Get plenty of sleep every night in a dark room (no screens in your bedroom).  Shoot for 8-10 hours

* For diet just eat REAL foods to satiety (until you are full).  Meat, vegetables, dairy, eggs.  I would limit processed foods (sugary shit in packages), but honestly you are young and active so you can probably get away with it.  Just don't eat this stuff on the regular.I gave up my scale for Lent.  I'm not Catholic, or religious at all, I just like a challenge.  And I know that for me, I get too obsessed with the scale.  I weigh myself 3-4 times a day.  I let the number in the morning determine what type of day I'm going to have.  It's not healthy.  So I put up the scale for the next 6 weeks and I'm going to focus on just sticking to my logging, my calories, my exercise, and being healthy.  I don't think you're crazy at all, you have to do what works for you.

I do have a pair of "aspiration pants" that I'm going to use to track any loss/gain during Lent.  They're jeans that I can button, but would be uncomfortable to wear during the day.  I know if I can't button them, I must be gaining.  If they get comfortable/loose, I must be losing.I definitely think it depends on each person. But for me, getting motivated was the first hard part. Then having the willpower wasn't so hard, and because I was motivated with willpower, getting the diet sorted wasn't too hard.

I'm only now getting ready to add in exercise, so for me at this moment, that's the most difficult part. Aside from the "everyone is different" mantra, have you tried going low carb or keto? It may not just be all about calories, but the type of food you eat. /r/keto

It could also be your gut bacteria. You could always experiment with probiotics.

It could also be that your math is wrong on your calorie counting. Or the label lied.
None of the above.  The hardest part is patience.After years of focusing on exercise, it's so refreshing to not feel guilty about not doing it.  I ran today after 8 days off and it was great.  What was better, was the 8 days of life happening and me not feeling guilty about not exercising. Hey /u/funchords I'm calling you out for giving bad and irresponsible advice to a minor.  This is rediculous.

You are advising a (growing) 16 year old male who is 5'10 and 140 to be eating WELL below his maintenance in order to pursue a dubious weight loss goal.  The wolfram alpha calculator is bullshit.  The kid is growing and active.  If you want to promote/enable anorexia, do it somewhere else.

Wowww, what an slimdown! Well done! I bet that you must feel so much better as well!

I had lost 26lbs as of yesterday and although others are insisting they can see it, I don't believe them, I can't notice it. This gives me hope though!! Thank you :)Hey! Good luck. You know what you're doin'. You've done it before. It'll be easy-peasy!F) knowing when you're actually ready to tackle all of those things (so maybe E, a combo).

I knew all the information, I had access to a gym, I had healthy food in my house, and I wanted to be slim and healthy. I just didn't want it enough. I was happy and my husband didn't (still doesn't) mind some extra weight on me. It wasn't until (a) I realized that I was slowly but steadily putting on more weight, and (b) I got tired of being in the back of the pack in almost every race I took part in, that I realized I wanted to change. Since making that decision, and taking a couple of important, and (for me) life-changing steps, it's actually been relatively smooth sailing. *knock on wood*

And I think it's different for everyone. I think a lot of people in the fitness (or nutrition) industry don't recommend lower-calorie diets, especially combined with working out. But you need to do what you feel is best for your body. If you're happy with what you're currently doing, I would suggest discussing physical stuff with her, but maybe skipping the nutritional discussions. Not all trainers have a background in nutrition, so it's possible she's not speaking from an educated background on the topic. It's possible she IS, but also that she's not. Build muscle, keep hydrated, moisturise with bio oil/coca butter.

Other than that, there is nothing you can do. It may not change, it may get better. You've just got to wait around 2 years and see what the damage is. BIGGEST one. Make sure you are super serious about losing this weight. You have to want it bad, just like it says in this video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ

Diet, excercise, pills or personal trainers advice wont mean shit if you are not serious about losing the weight. Make a oath that even if you lose NO weight in the next month, you will still keep trying. You will feel like this is a waste of time, you are making no progress, and everyone is laughing at you.  Pure will and the want for change will be what determines success with weight loss. Man up and get serious.One thing I found about starting a change with a diet, and when I quit smoking (its been about 7 1/2 years now) is that when you start to change one thing it makes it an easy excuse to push it off for another day, then another day, and then another day. You could go cold turkey, which sucks, or you could also incorporate it into your C25k training. Slowly start weaning yourself off of the cigarettes as you add distance and change your diet. It will be a gradual change for everything across the board and may be a bit easier.

I will say that when I smoked and went running, it was not fun. I could get a bit phlegmy, and eventually it was smoke or run. I chose to run.

Good luck with everything! I can not overstate how much I love terrible jokes like this.Thanks!! Absolutely, this sub helps remind me that if others can do it, I can too.I am a 218lb woman who is now jogging for an hour at least 4 times a week, and I'm embarrassingly slow and it's hard, but I can now go non-stop. I sometimes find motivation to keep going in the hopes that I'll inspire someone else to lace up their shoes and get out there no matter what kind of shape they are in.  I'm so glad you posted this. That's a great idea!! Thanks! Good luck! You can do this!Give it up to 2 years of maintenance and your skin will shrink back as much as it can. You can also build muscle to help fill in the saggy parts. That means resistance training. Check out /r/fitness or /r/bodyweightfitness. Push ups by themselves won't get you very far. If you still have a lot of loose skin after that, which is a real possibility, surgery is your only real option to get rid of it. And one day YOU'LL be someone's inspiration too.  I'm no great athlete, so I was very surprised when this happened to me: I was doing sprint drills on a treadmill with walking in between. An older lady I often jog next to (but rarely speak to) was finishing her workout while I was in a walking phase between sprints, and she turned to me to say "I just wanted to tell you that you run like the wind, I want to run like you."



I was flabbergasted. I had no idea people would think that about me; I normally think of myself as running just for me, not for anyone else. But I'll tell you what, the rest of my sprints that day were a hell of a lot easier with that mantra stuck in my head: " You run like the wind."


So remember, just being out there and pushing yourself to be as good as you can be, that is inspiring to people. It's important to be self-motivated of course, but it never hurts to consider that you got your start from seeing someone else being driven, purposeful, and healthy. You might be that inspiration for someone else some day.I lost 75 pounds doing keto and not worrying about calories. however, I have been Platued for 2 months of pure frustration and anger, I started keeping track of them last week. I am excted to read this post as OP for the hope that I can break it doing this.Thanks!! After this time, I will definitely make sure to keep on going and not doubt myself.Thanks!! You will definitely get use to it. I surprise myself every run to see how much longer I can run without being tired. I use to look at the future runs and wished I was on that week, and now I am! I honestly don't have any other motivation other than seeing the results week after week. I think that becomes its own reward. I'm looking at achieving my goal weight by the autumn and then the real hard work of maintaining begins. It's the first time I've done something like this and believed in it as a lifestyle change rather than a diet. Thanks! It was hard at first but I never regretted a workout! I always feel more energized after running. Also, I know it sounds cheesy, but you might want to check out Overeater's Anonymous, I found a lot of their stuff really helpful, most of the people there have some kind of eating disorder (my friends with bulimia I met in recovery, for example, along with a lot of people like me who struggle with restricting/binging patterns).That's how I do it. I'll eat a whole package of Oreos in an evening so I simply don't buy Oreos. Problem solved. I use that simple method with all junk food. I have enough control to not buy it but no control if it's sitting in front of me. doing pretty good.  Also trying to shape up.  probably would never have made the progress I have without /r/loseit, /r/progresspics, and /r/fitness.Likewise. I find it really straightforward and like the fact that the maintenance phase at 6:1 is so simple.If I skip more than a day on the treadmill, I can't sleep that second night. I have to get up and do a few runs up and down the staircase to use up some energy to calm down -- which sounds like a contradiction, but it works.Someone call China, Another Chin has been lost.Love your attitude and love your screen name. I rarely notice screen names, but I couldn't help but hear Fry's voice while reading it.I am in the same boat, I stayed away from MFP for so long because it triggered me (and because I was afraid it would trigger me). What worked was planning every meal for the week with a dietician (my average insurance paid for this visit completely) so every day I knew what i was going to eat, i knew i was getting the calories my body needed, there was no guesswork or last minute "what do i feel like" involved. I also avoided sugar and white flour like the plague and my cravings disappeared along with them.

Now I can use MFP again, I'm not perfect but when i find the obsessive thoughts coming back, I try to remember to go for the slow game, or to focus on lifting more or running longer instead of weighing less.

The takeaway, I guess, is that I used my fear of being triggered as an excuse for a long time. It will happen, you just have to keep trying things until something works.damn, son! how've you been? i up it on my gym days and will try to stay in the 1300-1400 range. i've been feeling fine, at least in the short term.Well there goes my theory, though there could still be some water weight discrepancies since you're weighing in once a week.That is true. Calipers, actually, are pretty easy to use incorrectly. I've been using visual estimates/navy tape test to give myself a rough idea, then making the final call based on mirror progress.old eic brotha!

1300 calories does seem pretty low to me.  From what I understand if you're a guy, you should probably consult a doctor before cutting calories below 1500.  TDEE calcs are not 100% accurate.  Everyone's body and lifestyle is different, so it might be fine for you.  But it might not.

If you do continue with 1300, you'd probably want to at least take a multivitamin.5 foot 10The only other thing I would add is to drink lots of water and tea before and after meals to keep satiated. I gave up alcohol for lent so that's helped me.Take the time element out of it.  It's okay if it takes 6 months or 2 years, right?

Given your past, I would set your calorie limit to 1400-1500 and forget everything else.  This is the right number for someone who is 5'5" and 145#.  No scale.  Do whatever sports or activities that you like but disconnect them from your weight loss effort.  Said differently:  do not exercise for weight loss.   Eat like you're 145 lbs..

Keep your food logging tight and precise, never stop logging that and it'll never hurt you.  But you've done this enough to know that weight loss is about the diet.  If you eat like someone who is 145#, you'll have a deficit and your weight will eventually fall to the right level.

You'll see your weight here and there, when you visit the doctor and etcetera.  That'll be enough confirmation that this is generally working.   If you do settle out at 155, then your personal metabolism is a little different and maybe 1350 is your better number.  Go there and your weight will eventually follow.  Full disclosure: I ran a marathon last summer (Chicago: 4:30:31) and was a smoker all through training and up until the marathon.

That said, I wasn't a *daily* smoker. I would probably go through about a pack over the course of a weekend if/when we were out drinking. I didn't ever smoke during the week though. Smoking has always been a drinking related activity for me. Also, I was running 7 miles a day 5 to 6 times a week leading up to training with the same smoking habits, so my body was used to it.

Now, would I recommend doing this? Absolutely not. Did it make long distances harder for me than those who didn't smoke? Duh. Can you be somebody who runs and also smokes? Yes, you can.

While I think quitting smoking is a great future goal for you, you're right in thinking one thing at a time is the best approach. Just keep in mind that you're going to have to work harder to run than non-smokers. It's certainly not impossible, but also not easy.


There's two types of carbs, and that's the most vital thing to know.

Good carbs vs. Bad Carbs.

Good carbs are found in vegetables and nuts. They are complex and require energy to break them down (calories being burned).

Bad carbs are found in bread, dough's, pastries, cookies etc. These are simple carbs and don't require very much energy to be broken down, they simply enter your bloodstream right-away and peak your blood sugar level... leading to fat gain.

So before you worry about how many carbs you need, focus on WHAT carbs you need, and eliminate the ones you don't. Bad carbs= fat gain. Good carbs= energy and require calories to be burned in order to break them down.Thanks! As for motivation, I'm turning 34 next week and really want to be a MILF at 35. Petty and shallow I know, but my kids go to a very small school where every other mother is all clique-y, and I've always been the fat one.

Obviously being healthier and all that other crap is good too. But mostly I want to look the best I ever have entering 'midlife'.While your doctor may have his patients' best interests in mind, he should also be cognizant of the fact that 1000 calories is really hard to stick to and if his patients cannot stick to that diet they will end up failing. Which is 16 pounds less then what he wants to lose. 2 pounds comes off a lot easier at 100 pounds over weight then 20 pounds over weight.I suspect I will end up between 210-225 myself. My tentative goal is 218, a few pounds out of obese BMI. Once there I plan to build physical ability and maintain my weight. Thanks!Gotcha! Thanks for the advice. Will get some healthy snacks, drink plenty of water and get up and walk. Thanks.&gt;  2 pounds per week is the typically the highest acceptable fat loss without damaging yourself.

I agree that's an aggressive plan but isn't losing 2 pounds a week = 104 pounds for a year?Awesome dude!  Huge differences, and don't worry about the fast weight loss, I did the same thing the first time round (70ish lbs in 4-5 month period).  Best thing I can tell you from a pure health standpoint, is keep on exercising.

A year ago when I started losing again, I looked as exercise as a means to an end, simply get on that damn bike or elliptical to help reduce weight.  At this point, I do it much more for the benefits of endurance and improving my health (heart rate is wildly lower now) than the weight loss (I've finally gotten on board with calorie counting) so that takes care of itself.

Here's to kickin' ass!Yep! I hope it works out for you!I think we're pretty much in the same boat.  I dieted like this for a while last summer and even during the hottest days I felt comfortable so it's nothing new.

Short of consuming more calories I was just curious if anyone else had found a solution?Good for you!

Eating is largely driven by attitude and emotion and it sounds like (comparing this post to the first) you seem to have gotten happier with the exercise change, and that is going to have a huge sway on your eating habits.


You don't even have to "eat clean" for weightloss, eat the things you love but less. The best thing I did for myself is to have a food diary (myfitnesspal, AshenMoon if you would like friend to help support you), you get control back over food by knowing just how much you eat (calories wise) and this will help you win the battle against over-eating.


As far as self-sabotage goes, here's an interesting read on ["planning to fail"](http://vitals.lifehacker.com/the-benefits-of-intentionally-failing-on-your-diet-1682610160) where basically the writer talks about how you should not rely fully on willpower and self-control, and how you can take steps in order to prevent relapse/complete failure of your diet. Keep going!!That's a good amount of protein in one meal... men should have 70g, women 60g -- daily minimum.  This base amount is to preserve your lean tissues.  A little more, even better.

Now that it is a shake, however, is a short cut. It's okay, short cuts are a good way to get started. Shortcuts are time savers.  Use this time of working on your diet to learn about protein (and all nutrition) from real food.  It's not urgent, but it is an opportunity.  I've learned so much this past 7 months and the changes I'm learning now will benefit me forever. Salt maybe. I know that I can retain 2.5 lbs of water weight if I eat too much salt. Totally understand this. In college I would grab snacks, caffeine, weed, and sometimes even a fucking milkshake to get my head into work-space. I still smoke a bunch to keep myself on track with heavy mental lifting projects, but realize that's not for everyone. What you might want to do is plan yourself one REASONABLE reward for the end of work each day. As well as giving yourself a treat, it could be a nice way to relax and transition out of work space for the day.I do this each and every day, I sit at my desk in the office. I changed how I eat while there so that its not going to impact me in a negative way. I bring a bag of Mini-Carrots, Flax Meal nuggets, rice cakes and a couple water bottles with Lemons squeezed into them. I nibble on this over the 10 hours I am there, I get up and walk every hour to stretch and refocus the eyes and mind. I program like this for 10 hours a day, I have lost almost 40lbs and I'm not hungry all the timeNo way. I have a great dentist but it isn't the same office where I got my braces. I actually have to call them today so I am TOTALLY going to ask them about this! The price tag has been the only thing that has kept me from pursuing it. Thank you so much!!! Smoke and exercise, it was also a choice I made.  Through my various attempts to quit, I've seen even just ONE DAY of not smoking makes huge gains on my endurance and the longevity of a more intense workout.  Do what works for you, but heres to quitting!I don't have any advice on this, I just wanted to say thank you for posting.  I smoke and at this time, I don't want to quit.  I love smoking! To a non smoker I know it sounds weird and probably stupid.   I currently get some cardio with my stationary bike and in warmer weather I kayak.I actually went to the orthodontist about two weeks ago to get a mold for something called a spring retainer, that (hopefully!) will adjust my teeth. I felt a bit silly being the only adult-patient in the office full of 11 year-olds getting braces on, but it's never too late! I get to pick my new retainer up on Saturday, and I'm excited to see my teeth realign!

I've put it off for years because I assumed that it would be a $1,000+ price tag to fix, but my retainer only cost ~$200. You got this! You're awesome!I'm the same sex/age/height as you!

I'm currently up past my initial weight again (268, ughhh...) and struggling to find the motivation to begin losing again, but!

3 years ago, I lost 60 pounds by diet and exercise going from around 250 to 190, and I didn't notice any physical difference until I hit the 40 pound mark. I know exactly how you feel. By 60 pounds I looked like a different person. So, keep going!Protip: Sprinkle watermelon cubes with lime juice and salt to turn it up to 11Screw "ideal" - ideal is whatever works best for you. It sounds like you are totally on top of things, and when you're able to add in gym time, or free up some time for whatever else, great. Focusing on the diet is where it's at. All too often, people don't realize this. Good for you for understanding this and working with it. Keep it up! Aww, thank you.
Yes - all the bad food is out of the house, and has been for awhile.
I can't control myself I have access to it.
All calories are either carbohydrate, fat, protein, or alcohol.  None of these -- none -- are inherently bad.

A 210 calorie serving of mixed nuts has 7g of carbohydrates and 19g of fat and 8 g of protein.

* 171 calories of fat
* 28 calories of carbohydrates
* 32 calories of protein

So, yeah, it has a few carbs but it's mostly fat.

So looking at the weekly nutrition breakdown of your diet in MyFitnessPal (looks like a pie chart), how is your diet breaking down?  http://www.eattoperform.com/eat-to-perform-calculator/

I use this guy for rough estimates on my macros.I did this also. I feel like NOW I'm ready for my retainer but it's much too late. Flood your mind with stimuli constantly reminding you of what you want and why you want it. Pictures, videos, music and movies (all fitness, exercise or nutrition related). At first the exercising will be tedious and annoying, but eventually you'll pick-up momentum and it will become both easy and addictive- especially when results start coming at light speed.

Aim for this, and when you get there, you're an unstoppable force.
I was just thinking this. :O

And great job! Love your glasses as well. :DThank you for all the advice :) I will definitely get up and walk around from time to time.Instead of eating the only thing that was in my refrigerator - a frozen lasagna - I went out of my way to find something else to eat.

And then my dinner that day was lettuce + olives + soy beef.

But I didn't lose any weight this week...probably water retention due to PMS.Here's my opinion. Note it's just an opinion:

-Severly reduce McDonalds intake. Aim to only eat it once a week. For the rest of the week don't even eat a fry. McDonalds food is full of sugar and trans-fat and little else. So it's full of bad stuff but barely anything good.

-Observe your hunger. Question yourself: Am I really hungry or am I just craving the pleasure from the taste? If it's the latter your cravings are emotional. The only way to stop emotional eating is to not do it. Be warned though, without this crutch you may feel more depressed at first. You will get over this.

-Start exercising. It doesn't have to be fancy. Start off with a 30 min walk once a day. Work it up to twice a day. It will get you out of the house and give you exercise at the same time.

-Substitute as many processed bad foods with whole foods as possible. You don't need to starve. Just change what you're eating.

Good luck!Tons of protein. Protein cereal. Eggs. Fish. Chicken. and someday, you'll be that someone, for someone else. You can totally do this!

Just remember that beautiful bodies are created in the kitchen.

Every single time you are tempted by food, ask yourself, "Will this help me look good in a bikini?" If the answer is no, put the fork down or if you have to, walk the food outside to the trash can.

15 pounds by April 24th is totally doable. Stay focused. Track you food. Rid your home of all junk and temptation, if you haven't already. And lastly, visualize how you will look and feel in Mexico.

I have faith in you! My doctor told me what I should weigh...so that helps! I also use mybodygallery.com to see what I want to look like eventuallyYes.  I was trying to spare everyone that mental image, but yes.  :)Your willpower is totally admirable. I've had a terrible week as well, but also feel more control over my stress than before I started. Thanks for sharing, you got this!Gotcha. I think the recommended intake is about 1g per kg of body weight, or more, for protein. I upped mine because I find it makes me less hungry overall. That could help you cut back on carbs.

Fruit is absolutely great for you - plenty of fiber and vitamins - but it's also super high in (natural) sugar. Veggies are less so (although a sweet potato always cranks up my sugar for the day), so maybe try incorporating more veggies and cutting back on the fruit. Or try lower-sugar fruit in your smoothies/shakes to cut back on the carbs. Alternatively, eat whole fruit instead of making it into smoothies. It's way easier to go overboard on fruit calories when they're in liquid form. And now all this talk of smoothies has me craving one. Oh dear :)I'm also not weighing myself anymore.. the number just got to be too crushing when it stopped telling me I was losing 2-5lb/day, and I fell off the wagon hard.

I figure this way, I will just keep trucking along with my healthy habits, and the arbitrary number that I don't even know, can't ruin my day/make me want to say 'fuck it' and eat ALL THE CAKE!

I'm trying to pay more attention to how I look and feel, as opposed to what the scale says.I know I based my current Goal Weight on a weight that I was at years ago and not based from the BMI table.  For 6' it says I should weigh in at 184.  When I was 18 at the end of basic training I weighed in at 190ish lbs, I was not healthy and I had lost a lot of upper body strength.  I can't imagine that I would feel good dropping below that so I don't really care what the BMI table says.  By the time I completed my technical training I had gained back some of my muscle mass and felt much healthier, and I was about 205lbs.  So I set my current goal at 210 mainly because I know as I start getting there I can adjust fire and maybe not go that far.  Hell me at 225 and healthy looks really good.  I have a ways to go to get back there, and I have taken a couple of detors along the way, but I am already feeling much better and that really is my ultimate goal-to feel better.Thats a private sub. How do you get in?/r/edrecoveryI,m not weighed either. I know I,m not where I want to be yet, and facing all the ups and downs on the scale driving me crazy and then I eat. I am much better eating better, being in a deficit, and exercising, when I am wanting to finally weigh I will, but not yet.Cut out the before bed snack completely. It might be tough for a few days but I bet after this period you won't feel the need for it any more. It's good to go to bed not being entirely full. I usually leave at least 12 hours between dinner and breakfast.I love both eggs and fish, and I eat a lot of nuts and organic peanut butter. I do eat the occasional steak but that's maybe once every 3 months because it gives me such bad heartburn. Pork is out of the question. I also love chicken but no one in my family likes it that much so I don't get to eat it as often as I'd like. I'm also told I should be increasing my fat to 50+g per day because I have low testosterone. you avoid loose skin by losing weight at a healthy rate. How do you feel about eggs or fish? I ask because my current sources of protein are light tuna (canned); eggs; 0% yogurt (neither an egg nor a fish, just worth mentioning); and beef jerky (not for you, I understand). These are all low-calorie, low-carb (less so with the yogurt, but not outrageous) options that are high in protein and very satisfying. I love almonds, but if I can only manage 8 of them, I feel kind of let down. A tin of tuna with a serving of whole grain crackers is (personally) a more satisfying snack.

Just a thought! That's scienceI usually have a shake for lunch that contains about 50g of protein. Not sure how much more I should be having. That is an unhealthy rate to lose fat at. 2 pounds per week is the typically the highest acceptable fat loss without damaging yourself. If you are young enough the skin will shrink back some, and gaining muscle will help fill in some of it. But there is nothing you can do to completely avoid it outside of surgery. Just drink plenty of water and read the FAQ.Are you swole? If you're really muscular, I'd be inclined to believe you but unless you're ripped, sorry. Take a look at the link I posted in a reply to OP. 165 at 5'3" is almost in the obese range.While not stressful (or necessarily intellectual, hmmm...), I do have a desk job, and have found it super helpful to plan out all my meals and snacks for the work day.

I make a big batch of a few different soups and chili, pop them into individual tupperware containers, and freeze them. Those are lunch (could also grab one for supper if the day were that long). I pack a mini can of tuna and a serving of whole grain crackers for my 1st morning snack, and a piece of fruit for my 2nd morning snack. I don't always *want* the fruit, but I workout at lunch, so I feel better mentally if I've had a little snack beforehand. I eat lunch post-workout, and if necessary, I eat another piece of fruit on my drive home.

Before I did the bit batches of lunches, and the planning of snacks, my day was a crapshoot. I would pick something up at the grocery store before work, and then hit McDonald's at lunch 3 out of 5 days a week, at least. The way I eat now is much healthier, takes the guesswork out, and is cheaper. It doesn't take as much planning as I had originally thought, because every few weeks, I just make another couple of big soups or toss some stuff in the crockpot.

I think if you figure out how many calories you need per day, and then ration them out so you're eating every couple of hours while at work, you'll find that you're more satisfied and less likely to eat stuff that doesn't benefit you.

Lastly, if you are able, get up and walk around (even if you're just pretending to go to the bathroom when you don't need to) to give yourself a break. Sitting all day is a killer. Literally. It's awful for the human body.

Good luck!! That's why I went from trying to lose 2 pounds a week to 1.  I figured I wasn't eating enough calories.  I'll have to check my protein levels. I started out at 225 back in 2008 or so and managed to get down to 183.  Then I got lazy about counting and my weight started going back up.  When it hit 205 I decided to get serious again.  So my body has been below 200.  And so help me it will again!  :)Lol, so true about the poor eating decisions whilst drunk. Only time I crave fries and chicken tenders is drunk. Sigh. It's best to all around just cut back on that front. I've been doing pretty well with it.Not too recently, but I had some blood work done late last year.  Everything came back normal.Instead of just looking at removing foods, you need to also work on including others. You have zero protein in your diet and very little fat - it's no wonder at all you're only getting carbs when you're missing whole food groups. No girl scout cookie tastes as good as saving 20 dollars that could go to something like new clothes or shoes. Eyeballing it, but the bowls I use are 1-cup size.

Between 70 and 150 depending.

During the week, yes.  I keep a water bottle on my desk and refill it many times throughout the day.  On weekends I slip on the water intake but I'm trying to rectify that.

Yeah.  Friday morning right after I get up.Thank you! Every Friday morning right after I wake up, right before I shower.My suggestion would be to eat as you normally do for 2-3 weeks and track every single morsel of food that passes your lips.  From the tracking you should be able to determine your approximate daily caloric intake.  From there reduce it by 20% any way you want.  You'll lose for sure, and when in plateau reduce your calories again by about 100-200.do you weigh yourself naked every week? denim can make for the difference.What is your height?  This is important.I'm hoping that's what it is.  I try to minimize the fluctuations by weighing myself at the same time every week under the same conditions.  I understand fluctuations happen but DAYUM!I'm not a vegetarian but I eat so little meat that it's not even really worth mentioning. I have bad acid reflux when I eat red meats. Basically anything that is just bread or sugar.

The reason things like fruit and veggies don't count as "carbs" is because they have very high nutritional value and lots of fiber.
Make sure you are getting a fuckton of sleep in a cool and dark room (8-10 hours).

Try reduce stress/cortisol.Cardio 5 times a week for half an hour before dinner would probably help, and might be required. You sound kind of like me, where I already eat decently usually, but still gain a little up to a certain point (though I am a dude). When I do cardio at least 3-5 times a week, I lose weight. When I don't, I gain slowly. And if you are also like me, taking a 15 minute walk won't do it, because I don't break a sweat or really even have to work that hard. I have to get on the elliptical and CRANK it to high BPM techno for 25 minutes (with a 5 minute cooldown) to really see results. But I can lose 3lbs a week or more if I keep it up!Losing weight isn't always about just eating less calories either. In some cases you have to up the intake in order to drop the poundage. I know muscle physiologists, when asked what to do to lose weight, don't say the first thing is to cut calories. The first thing they say to do is to up protein intake.Good to read you focus on getting active and eat healthy. Do that and make sure you adjust the daily kcal intake since it will vary (if that is the correct word) depending on your weight (as you lose it), etc.

When it comes to weight, I recommend progress pics instead. Take one everyday and be patient and don't compare them day to day. Your weight isn't everything. If you eat healthy and are active, it's the most important thing and you automatically lose the fat. Fruit killed my carb count, so I changed my macros. I was tired of a single banana throwing off my whole day. I still don't eat much fruit, but I found that changing my macros in MFP made it more manageable for me. I tossed out anything that was heavily processed or refined, and replaced it with whole grains, dark rice (black rice or wild rice or quinoa), sweet potatoes instead of white, etc.

All of the stuff you're eating is healthy, in theory, but can be really high in calories or sugar. Nuts, while they are crazy delicious and have healthy fats, are so high in fat (and, as such, calories) that it makes it tough to fit them into a lower calorie deficit regularly. Are you looking for good sources of protein? I didn't see any meat mentioned - are you a vegetarian? Muscle does throw things off, but you'd have to have a hell of a lot of muscle weight to be 160.

Take a look at [these women](http://www.weighttraining.com/features/female-bodybuilders). Granted, they have very low body fat in the pictures but take note of their heights/weights. If you're not a bodybuilder, BMI is usually a good indicator.I was never a super heavy smoker, but since I've started regularly working out I only buy a pack every six weeks or so. I think quitting for a lot of people who exercise has less to do with wanting to increase performance and more to do with the fact that exercise de-stresses you. You just don't crave them as much. It might take awhile though, because after my first few runs I wanted a cig like nothing else XD. That is so awesome that it clicked for you. I used to think of healthy people as some other "type" of person that I could never be. That was just their thing, what they're into. Sucks that I wasn't like that. But then I kind of had the same epiphany you did "why not me?" and holy crap what do you know, I'm capable of doing healthy things too. Two years later, I have a gym membership, a personal trainer, I have supportive friends and family groups on facebook where we talk about diet and exercise, I know what healthy foods to eat without having to research it, I can give other people advice even. I have muscles?! It's insane. Good luck to you with your surgery.

I went through something similar when I was 26 with a lump on my thyroid - either it was going to be deadly cancer, or benign, no way to tell until they remove it. It was my first time having surgery, I was really scared of general anesthesia, I had never even had my wisdom teeth removed. I just stared at the ceiling until they put me out and next thing you know I'm waking up. I did have an anxiety attack about 10 minutes after I woke up, but I told them and right away they gave me some Xanax and I was fine. It was actually nice recovering in the hospital - the nurses came by every so many hours to make sure I got my pain meds before any pain kicked in, I kind of felt like I was at a spa because everyone was tending to me, hehe. The lump ended up being benign. I recommend using silicone scar sheets on the scar once the incision heals.Check this out, it works fantastically well assuming you still track your calories.  http://examine.com/leangains-faq/ I'm not weighing myself until April (last time was mid-December). I feel really good about it. I can see and feel changes, and not having the ups and down of facing a scale each week has made it easier (for me) to stick with my routine of eating well, staying within my deficit, and going to the gym. I know that I'm not where I want to be yet, but it's only been a couple of months. I'm well on my way, and I like the progress that I'm already seeing. Any change on the scale will just be a bonus. This sounds so stupid. Are you a writer for The Onion- a satire magazine.  This is a juxtaposition. Idk what u doing but gjYou're right. I need to reward myself with something other than food. I will "prepare myself for battle" with baby carrots, celery, and watermelon. I'll be like the healthy warrior. Also lots of water and tea ;)

I thought about incorporating exercise as a fun way to rest from the mental work and keep myself active, but I just got my period and I'm not feeling physically great, so this will have to wait for next time. It's a great idea, though.

Thanks for the advice.protein bar, lean cuisine, protein (chicken), veggies, and some nuts sometimes as snacks.Wow that's awesome! Keep it up :D Calories in vs. Calories out.

I'm a 5'2 woman who also works a desk job, and I don't really have much of a sweet tooth or a hankering for fast food.  Regardless, I managed to shoot up to 150 at my heaviest.  I am also a big fan of the booze.   I dragged my ass to the gym 4 nights a week and did strength training and weight lifting, but I didn't really start losing weight until I started counting calories.

Download MFP today and do some reading on calories in vs. calories out.  ITT: Canadian party. The second-best kind of party.What re the quality of your calories?  I ask because I'm wondering the same thing.  I seem to not lose an ounce unless I eat less than 1300 per day.Carbs are any sugar and any starch.I strongly suggest you find another reward system, such as breaks, perhaps even to perform light exercise in if that's your thing. Also, how about you "prepare yourself for battle" the healthy way? I find whenever I have snacks I will want to eat them all, so instead of high fat/salt snacks I have been eating celery and carrots. I still eat as much as I want but without the pesky calorie and water retention down side. So perhaps find a substitute (I highly recommend vegetables) and if you drink a lot of fizzy drink, perhaps do sparkling water? My bro is doing a PhD and he loves sparkling water.Just to note, depending on muscle mass, it absolutely might be an acceptable weight.  I'm shorter than OP (5'3") and I don't think it's really all that possible for me to get below 160 without seeming anorexic.  I hit a low of 165lb with 21.5% bodyfat last spring, and there wasn't a whole lot more for me to lose.  If I had gone down to 18% body fat, I probably would have been right around that 160 mark.  Going by BMI is not the best way to go if you have an athletic history/build.  It's meant more for population level statistics and for the average person.
  Same here! See you on the other side!Great job! And thank you :)I'll look into it!! thank you :)This is what I'm doing.Wow that's an awesome way to do it. I'm sick of snacking on carrots, I'm gonna start saving 100 calories for popcornWe both added edits and we're on the same page. :)You think 5-10 years?  Wow I didn't think of it like that.I gave up fast food over a year and a half ago. I'm now at the point where I can have it occasionally and not crave it after. I ate McD's on New Year's Day to curb a massive hangover &amp; I enjoyed it.. but didn't crave more. Coming from someone who used to eat fast food 3-5 times a week.  I'd suggest going cold turkey on it for a good 6+ months if possible, though.Yeah, this is how my mind is starting to work too. A few days ago I was craving a chocolate bar. So I looked up the nutritional info and found out it has 290 calories, and I thought "I'm not going to waste 290 calories on a chocolate bar when I could eat two fruits and some yogurt." Bye bye, chocolate bar ;)Haha thanks on all the compliments :)You might eat healthy foods but to lose weight you need to eat less of them. Check out the FAQ, start counting calories Hot damn that is a tiny face!
You look great!Ok, a couple of things may help.

Alcohol is metabolized quicker by your body. So although the calories are the same, when you drink alcohol your body burns that first instead of the fat. When you drink you also make poorer eating choices.

You can lose weight with a sedentary job. Calories in have to be less than calories out. Its that simple. Figure out how many calories you are eating now and how much you want to weigh. MFP does this for free.

Good luckYou're absolutely right. I have total access to a gym with an indoor pool, and am a stay at home mom with plenty of free time during the day. Yet I've resisted going at all out of embarrassment and lack of knowledge.

This coming week, I'm going to go at least twice, and continue to increase the frequency.

I've been planning to start at least swimming but haven't because excuses, but I'll use this as motivation to get my butt in the pool.

Thanks!Thank You! only like 70 more lbs to go!I have a lot of muscle. The "healthy weight" ranges are not one size fits all. I go more by BF and even at 170-180lb, I had a lower BF than my thin friend, and I was in the good/acceptable range. BMI is a measurement I never pay attention to. I've been "overweight" by BMI standards since middle school, which is when I started lifting weights. Thank you very much, swimmer's thighs. I know you're not being mean at all, you're just bringing in a measuring tool that doesn't work for me.

Edit to add: 160 isn't necessarily my long term forever goal. It's my Vegas goal. And it's the point where I'm going to have the doctor do my blood work again and see how my cholesterol has improved. It's the point where I reevaluate what more I can do or if I'm happy. :)I'm sorry too Sorry for the slow reply, for whatever reason Reddit didn't notify me of your comment. Thankfully, I looked under my messages anyway and saw it. I'm  thinking of adjusting my goal weight to 115, or even 110, depending on how I feel at 120. 110 will be my stopping point for sure though.

[MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com) is my friend when it comes to losing weight. I also use [SkinnyTaste](http://www.skinnytaste.com) for recipes frequently. SkinnyTaste is great because they show you how many calories each meal is. Their recipes are really yummy too. I'm on a 1,200 calorie cap a day with MFP, and that's with a goal of losing 1 lbs per week so it's safe, and easy to keep the weight off that way. You'll probably have at a different calorie cap than me being 5'1", so keep that in mind.

My typical day for food looks like this (although if you're not 5'4" and not wanting to lose 1 lbs per week, I wouldn't suggest following this. Just sharing to show what typical calories look like.):

**Breakfast - Yogurt Parfait**
* Chobani Greek Yogurt - Vanilla Non-fat, 1 cup (180 calories)
* Chopped pecan halves, 4 pieces (69 calories)
* Clover Honey - 1 Tablespoon (60 calories)
* BlackBerries and Raspberries - 1 cup combined (62 calories)
**[Breakfast Calorie Total = 371]**

**Lunch - Salad Bowl**
* Safeway farms Cafe Bowl - Cranberry Walnut Salad, 1 container (These salad bowls at Safeway are awesome btw!) (210 calories)
**[Lunch Calorie Total = 210 calories]**

**Dinner - Spicy Honey Chicken, Rice &amp; Green Beans**
* Eating Right - All Natural Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast, 4 oz (130 calories) (I also put lots of spices on my chicken for this recipe: curry, chili, and red pepper flakes along with the honey)
* Clover Honey - 1 Tablespoon (60 calories)
* Near East Rice Pilaf - Roasted Chicken and Garlic (As Prepared), 1 cup (220 calories)
* Del Monte - Fresh Cut Cut Green Beans, 2 cup (80 calories)
**[Dinner Calorie Total = 190]**

**Snacks - Granola Bars &amp; Vitamins**
* Safeway - Chewy Granola Bar - Oatmeal Raisin, 1 bar (90 calories)
* One A Day Womens - Vitacraves Gummies, 2 gummies (10 calories)
**[Snack Calorie Total = 100 calories]**

**[Total Day's Worth Calories = 1,140 calories]**

It's all in the diet when it comes to losing weight. If you're burning more calories than you're intaking, then you are guaranteed to lose the weight. That being said, losing weight isn't a steady decline. I weigh myself daily and see a lot of fluctuations on the scale even though I weigh myself at the same time, first thing in the morning, without clothes on. The fluctuations are from a variety of things, like how much sodium intake you had the day before, waste, water intake, muscle weight, menstrual cycle, et cetera.

I also started doing yoga as often as I can which is usually daily, sometimes every other day, with [Fitstar Yoga](http://fitstar.com/yoga/). I do yoga not to lose weight, but to help define my muscles, get stronger/healthier, and to help with stress. I don't "eat back" the calories I burn during yoga, or any other exercise even though MFP encourages you to do so. Calculating burned calories isn't an exact science and I tend to keep gaining weight if I rely on eating back the calories MFP says I burned. I just eat at, or right under, 1,200 calories a day. You look amazing! Good job! I used to smoke a shit ton, like a pack a day, and a couple years ago I decided I wanted to get fit and start running. I started off with just intervals of 1 minute on 2 minutes off (pretty much the same as C25K but I didn't know that program existed at the time so I made it up as I went along) but shortly thereafter exercising became really difficult for me due to smoking. I was pretty motivated, so I quit. It kinda sucked but the adrenaline from progressively running further and losing weight made it worthwhile.

TIPS FOR YOU!- 1) If you have health insurance, talk to your doctor about being prescribed Wellbutrin. It's an antidepressant that's also sold under a different name, Zyban, as a smoking cessation med. Before I started taking it I was smoking occasionally just due to social situations but I haven't had the urge to smoke at all since starting to take it. 2) Get an E-smoke. If you aren't ready to quit entirely than you can at least change from smoke to vapor which isn't as harsh on your lungs. There's varying nicotine levels for people who are just coming off cigarettes and people who have been vaping for a while (12%, 6%, 3% 0% nicotine) and you can move down to wean yourself off on your own terms.

Good luck!Congrats! You look like a new woman! I look forward to seeing your future post when you reach your goal :)If "I don't wanna" is your only excuse, then I think you should make yourself anyway. Smoking and losing weight are very similar. You get the same little voices in your head--indignant, in denial, and making excuses. What is making you want to lose weight but not quit smoking? I don't understand the logic.
Sometimes I have a craving and I add it in, and I think, wow, I can totally eat this today!  I remember during Christmas at work there were mini peppermint patties, I logged 3 to eat, wasn't too bad.  I added 3 more, in my head I knew it was twice as much, but seeing those numbers destroy my calories for the day.  It was easy to just stop at 3, I mean 300 calories wasted is one thing, but 600, on candy when I can eat an entire dinner instead?  No freakin way.Thanks for this. I hadn't actually done the math, but seeing that it's a 10% loss is somehow super motivating. That might be another way for me to track my success.You got this! It's gonna be a tough adjustment being bombarded with work and still eating right, but if you do it enough times it'll be something you do naturally. I did take beginning measurements, but except for the Dr measuring my waist, haven't taken any follow ups. Good time to do that- thanks for the reminder!Look into paleo - it sounds more in tune with what you are wanting to do.


You're right - carbs are in places you would never imagine.  It isn't just bread and pasta, it is ALL kinds of sugar (fruit included) nuts and grain, etc.
I will prepare healthy snacks, water and tea. I know it'll help a lot.
Thanks for the advice!You're absolutely right. It is more about emotions.
I will drink lots of water, prepare my normal meals, and stay strong.
Thanks for the advice and the support.If you're limiting your diet to food that you don't really like that much, it's going to be harder at first then it needs to be.  You said it's easy to eat healthy and then later on make bad choices.  You need to find a balance and tracking will help you do that.  It doesn't have to be all or nothing.  Track what you would want to normally eat for a week.  Do it honestly.  Have a week of "delicious" eating and see where that puts you calorie wise.  Then look back through your week and see what can stay and what needs to go.  For me, eating bbq ribs once a week was killing me, it was like 3 times the calories of all my other meals, so, no ribs until maintenance, which is fine because I've eaten thousands of ribs over the years.  8 months without them will be ok. What did stay was NY steaks, and scones and butter with my veggies, blue cheese crumbs etc...  the key is moderation along with information, not blind restriction.That's a great technique :) I will definitely do this next time I feel like eating crappy food.I did this! And it worked marvelously for me!

I didn't weigh myself for about 6 months when I first started changing my lifestyle. In the past, weighing myself was SUCH a game of Russian Roulette, because if I was up even a little, it would throw me off the rails and I'd revert back to my shitty habits.

But by not stepping on a scale for a while, what happened was that my focus shifted to how I looked and felt. I knew I was losing weight, I could see it and feel it, and other people could, too. I just trusted that what I was doing was right (calorie logging of very healthy meals, lots of green things, whole grains, lean proteins).

Now I weigh myself daily but when you're emotionally tender in teh first few phases of weight loss, I think weighing yourself too often can be counterproductive.

Best of luck!Yes, it was an overall lifestyle change for her. As a teen, she was an average 8 and at her biggest after having two kids, she was about a 14-16. She never ate terribly but she did make small improvements and now she's a very aerobic in-shape small 10. She looks fantastic and she's been happy for years! It doesn't hurt that she also looks 10-15 years younger than she really is! She really is my best friend and inspiration!I am glad you are doing better, that last post read like something you would find in /r/tumblrinactionI work from home, and it's pretty much all computer based. To avoid falling into the snack trap I keep a tub of cut up celery and radishes so that I can grab some greek yogurt dip and vegetables when I feel peckish. It's also really important to keep hydrated so I try to have a bottle or jug of water at hand. When I get a break I will have a cup of herbal tea.

I just find that if I have healthier foods easier at hand I will eat those instead of raiding the biscuit tin or cheese shelf.Think back to when you were 110 lbs heavier- when you REALLY wanted to lose that weight. Would you eat those extra 500 calories then? My original GW was something that sounded pretty good and actually achievable to me (150 lbs). It's changed since then. I'm at 139 right now, and I'm aiming for 130. When I get to 130, I'll re-assess how I feel about my body and either sit at maintenance and body recomp, or lose another 5 or so lbs.  Like another poster said, the end number is slowly becoming less important as I get closer to my goal (obviously I still want to see 130 on the scale though!)I smoke just under a pack a day. I also go to rugby practice and do my best to keep up with the group (I'm one of the guys in the worst shape, but keep up with the other forwards), and do and hour of cardio at the gym without too much difficulty.

Don't put off exercising because you smoke. The worst that can happen is that you find you need to start smaller and make it work.If you're not noticing your results, then it's time to crank it up. Let this serve as more motivation to work even harder. You've picked up momentum and can now get this ball rolling down hill.

This irritation is to serve you to want it more and to want it sooner. Its like life is throwing this at you because now you're going to step it up. At this point its a total bummer, but looking back on it when you DO reach your goal, you'll think how greatly that dissatisfaction served you to increase your motivation and keep going.

Go and get it.I started jogging about 2 months ago. I also smoke almost a pack a day. I would go a mile at a time at first then take walk breaks when I needed to. Now I can run two miles at a steady 5mph without stopping. I could probably go further, but I'm limited to where I can jog.

I've got to tell you, it was really easy to work up to that point. I take a week long hiatus from it every now and then and I can pick it up like I never stopped. I'd say give it a go. Just like dieting (lifestyle change) it's all about persistence.

I'm sure down the road I will want to quit because I will reach a plateau and won't be able to run faster or longer, but right now I'm fine. I don't think I could give up my cigarettes and calorie restrict at the same time.

Side note! I also hear cardio is great to help quit smoking and curb cravings. It will be an extra tool for when we quit!I'm glad you didn't stick to the 1000. That is asking a lot of someone to change their lifestyle THAT drastically. With many obese people, the maintenance calories are ~3000 or greater. I feel like asking 1000 will discourage people who may not learned how to eat the proper nutrient rich "filling" foods. 1400-1600 gives you room to learn and have your required nutrients without feeling super hungry and helps someone drop 3 pounds a week, even without exercise. Anyway, congrats on your incredible weight loss. Thanks :) It is maddening when it stays still though isn't it? But hey, check out your flair, that's amazing!It's unbelievable how in the left full body picture you can just *tell* your self esteem is fairly low and the smile may be a bit forced, where as in the right picture you just look as pleased as punch and very happy. I can't blame you, you look fantastic. It really is, even things like throwing out the bad stuff is new. At Christmas there was nothing unhealthy in my house after the 26th, I used to live on chocolate presents till mid-January ;P
Everyone's weight loss techniques are completely unique to them. If it make it easier/ makes you happier then that's the way to go. Nothings more depressing than stepping on the scale and seeing the numbers either not move or go up. You're right, that will either stop you from trying or push you to try more extreme and unhealthy methods of losing it.

The use of the mirror is always the best way to go. You'll still be able to see yourself lose weight and you won't be stuck dreading the .2lbs gain on the scale (which scales often screw up because they're not entirely accurate). This way when you do lose weight, you'll be able to see it, and if you do have a small gain, it won't destroy your motivation.One of my favorite things to do is add the food I want to eat and see how it effects my calories.  Then I ask myself what I want more, to lose the weight or eat this same crappy food that I've eaten literally thousands of times that doesn't even taste that good and will most likely make me feel like shit.  Deleting those entries is so empowering.  I gathered all the information and made a choice.  Food doesn't decide, I do.My top teeth moved slightly. I wore it mostly but my bottom teeth have the permanent retainer. Your mom sounds incredible.  Did she change her eating and everything?  I am using her that way.  And you're right, she ALWAYS wants to go.  :)Thats good still you keep it up. And let your self relax.Thanks!Thanks for the advice!I have the same problem. I'm 5'2 and even though I work out 3 days a week and eat Clean most days, I can't get under 150. Some weeks I even shoot back up to almost 160 with no Change in diet or activity level. It's extremely frustrating because I'm getting  married in October and I just want up get to 140 but it seems impossible. (I should note that my normal weight until 2 years ago was 130, so this isn't an outlandish goal ) The only time the scale ever really moves is when I cleanse. It's so hard to not compare yourself to those you're close to. My mom is a personal  trainer and my two younger sisters (one of which just had a baby ) are all thin as rails and I'm sitting over here like a chunky monkey. Both my sisters don't even exercise and they eat whatever they want. It's so disheartening. I hide at family gatherings so I don't get caught in pictures. I feel your pain, for real. All I can say is keep trucking and don't let it bring you down! Eventually you'll find that combination of diet and exercise that breaks through your plateau. That's awesome! Use your dog to hold you accountable, you know they'll always want to go :)Good for you! My mom started running about 10 years ago and could barely do a mile. Now she runs a 2:00 half marathon in her early 50s. I second any Couch to 5k program. Intervals of running and walking (and bags of frozen peas for your aches &amp; pains) is the best way to go!Good enough.  Your Sedentary TDEE is about 1700 at 5'10" and your BMI is 20.09 which is fine for your height.

Show this to your dad if he wants some confirmation:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=tdee+5%2710%22+140+lbs+16+year+old+male

As for the little bit of flab, I'd keep eating at 1600 and let growth in height take care of it.  It's hard to tell at 16 what is left-over baby weight and what you'll take into adulthood.

Edit:  lest I gave any other impression, my advice is to make no changes.  Eat as you're eating today.  Just wait out that little bit of flab that is borthering you.  I don't understand why "eat when you can" means you can't eat less at the times you normally do eat. It takes literally no time to make 1/2 cup less of whatever you're making, and takes seconds to measure and record it. Thank you for the link.  I'm going to spend some time today, after taking my kids on a hike, reading peoples stories.  Weighing yourself at the same time every time is important! Also if you're tracking your weight and calories accurately then it should be a downward trend. It'll have peaks and valleys but it should continue downward if you're always at a negativePrepare your meals as you normally would, drink lots of water to stay hydrated, and only resort to a healthy snack if you get tired. It's tough to get used to but it can be done; it's more about emotions than needing to fuel your body. I used to have unhealthy eating accompany stress but it's just a coping mechanism I accepted as somewhat "normal." It can be changed, and you'll feel better getting through a day while eating right, and changing a bad habit into a good one.I'm seconding most people's comments to get a therapist onboard. But here's a suggestion: Instead of counting calories, maybe create a healthy meal plan and stick to it.

It might get boring, but you could try planning out 7 days of healthy meals and just sticking to that without logging anything. Personally, I find travel makes picking healthy food choices and lower cal options easier. There are always lean protein choices, veggies, and tons of other choices to choose from. Buffets, too. There's usually tons of veggie options and lean proteins. Just avoid the high carb, calorie dense sides, or fatty/fried proteins, and it is so easy. Still, live life, too. Don't not order some super delicious looking burger or other treat. The other thing about travelling - more time for exercise, often more chances to walk places or be physical. Thank you for this.I only lose during 1 week a month, and then 3 weeks of plateaus and small gains and losses.  It's kind of lame.  I do notice that my measurements will drop a little during that time even though my weight doesn't and that makes it better.Thank you.  You're right, the little bit of jogging I've been doing has felt good.  It just makes me feel more confident!Probably 9 months or so. I started C25K in March of 2012. I was a new years resolutioner when it came to quitting, so January 2013 I quit. For the most part anyway. I spent 2013 just casually smoking (i was a pack a day smoker previously) while drinking/hanging with friends,  then 100% quit in 2014.I don't usually eat breakfast for the same reason. I do have fruit around 10am and sometimes a little butternut squash soup before lunch. I eat more at night and that's fine as long as I'm in my target calorie range it doesn't matter what time of day the calories are consumed. Whatever works for you. As a side note, why be concerned about losing weight quickly? Slow and steady wins the race. Honestly, I'm not exercising anymore. I stopped going to the gym.

I know that isn't ideal.  But the reality of my situation is that at this juncture I can control and stay focused on my diet, and that is about it.

I still walk my dog, but for the time being my weight training has stopped.  I am hoping to be financially stable enough to rehire my trainer in April. Hahaha, ok :) I will.&gt; How am I UP 2 1/2 pounds this week?

You probably aren't. Dude, I can fluctuate by 4lbs in a single day. I mean I eat over 11lbs of food and water every 24 hours it's a wonder my body finds any equilibrium consistently in the morning.

This is where weighing once a week can drive people mad. Because oh look, a fluctuation coincided wit a weigh-in!Be her!  You absolutely can.  I started jogging in late March of 2014 and never looked back.

The Couch to 5k app, and [sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/) are great for getting up to speed, so to speak.

Also, congratulations on the results of the biopsy (even if you have to have surgery)!

Edit to create an actual link.Remember the moist towelette part of that. Nothing messes up a mechanical keyboard like watermelon.. just take my word for it. This is pretty much my story too! Good for you for figuring out what you need to do! Especially if you are still exercising, I think you should be able to get to your goal! And even if you don't, you're going to feel amazing! Good luck friend :)Congratulations! I'm doing ADF right now, and I'm down about 25 pounds in 3 weeks. Apparently I used to do IF when I was younger before it was an actual thing. Now that I've seen the studies and read about all the health benefits, I'm a true convert. No, but set another goal.  You're 5'4" and fighting a metabolism issue.  Set mini goals based on the calendar.

I use MyFitnessPal too.  Today is day 224.  Every 30 days, I celebrate with a post here in loseit ... this is my most recent one ... http://redd.it/2uzbvk

And while you won't be able to give weight or BMI, you can do pics and measurements and other notes or measurable progress as you see fit and motivational to do so. It's not cutting back on calories per se it's cutting back on specifically fat. Anything under 50g per day for an extended period of time and you're asking for a reduction in t-levels.I will get watermelon too. Thank you so much for the advice :)Thank you, thank you!

I will get myself some carrots, celery and pop corn. I will drink water and stretch.

I appreciate it your support a lot.You can exercise and smoke... these don't have to be mutually exclusive. You probably want to avoid smoking for a while before you run, though. If the running causes wheezing then there might be an issue... that doesn't mean don't exercise, but I'd see your Dr. about it.

But overall, regular exercise is a good thing. There's no reason that having bad habits means you can't have good habits. For a couple reasons I think you'll find that running will actually help you quit smoking... so it's actually laying the groundwork for successfully quitting smoking.

You are me when I have scheduling and forecasting to do.  In ten past i would do the same. Now I try to munch and crunch on healthier things - baby carrots, celery, and popcorn - oh boy popcorn.

Keep up with your hydration- you've been awesome with eliminating the Coke Zero - lots of water.

Lastly, get up stretch, and walk.  The more we sit, the more "bored" we get.  Give yourself breaks! I'm doing a lot of computer work as well right now. I work sitting down at work and then program at home. On days where I have huge projects to work on, I modify my settings on mfp to adjust to a sedentary level of active, while maintaining some caloric deficit (I go from 1000 to 500). This allows me to constantly lose weight, even if there is a decrease from 2.5 to 1 pound a week. In addition, I keep watermelons and a moist towelette next to me while I program. Very low calories and they will fill you up. I think a pounds of watermelons is like 135 calories. Always think of the toilet roll analogy.

Take twenty sheets off the start of a roll...you're not going to see much difference due to the larger circumference. Take twenty sheets of a roll with only forty left on and hey presto, less circumference and bigger perceived change for the same amount.

Either way you're off to a good start so just stay consistent.25 / 240 = 0.104166...

You are right at that 10% point where people start to notice just by looking at you.  I wouldn't be surprised if that starts happening.

Are your photos same pose, same angle, same clothing (color &amp; type), same distance?  Those details matter in a good before &amp; after.  And even if you have many of those, it can really go wrong.  Take a laugh at mine... the two middle pictures aren't a mistake, those are correct, but it sure -looks- like I went backward!  http://i.imgur.com/bj8xSzv.png

Yeah, 10% is my experience for the first people to notice.  And weight being the touchy subject that it is, even if they notice it doesn't mean they'll say anything...Good for you! Also, you're beautiful!Incredible job! Very impressive!I will do this :) Thank you so much.I searched r/loseit about loose skin and read somewhere that compression helps, so your instinct is probably right! You could probably find the post with  some luck. Other things mentioned were moisturizer,  healthy diet with adequate vitamins and minerals, slow steady weight loss rather than big calorie deficits, and building muscle.1000 calories is the standard diet he puts all obese patients on.  He just wants me to lose as quickly as possible since my BP and HR was so high even while treated.

He doesn't know I am staying around 1400.  He is happy with my loss and said I am doing excellent.Are you taking measurements? Mirror and even pictures can be deceiving, get objective evidence. Also consider the paper towel effect, the more you lose the more obvious the physical changes will beYou're right. Diet is everything. Keep up the good work, and I'm sure you'll look and feel great on your trip! You can do it!Check your iron level. A common symptom of anemia is feeling cold. Take a supplement if your diet doesn't include a lot of iron-rich foods. Thank you, FC.

This is what I used to believe too, although deep inside I knew I was wrong.

I'll make a trip to the supermarket and buy those baby carrots and healthy snacks. I know I need the mental distraction and not the calories.

Your advice and support is great, as usual.

Yea, tell the brain it just lost this battle, that excuse isn't going to fly anymore. That being said focus on nutritious foods that provide energy rather than rapidly digested carbs that crash blood sugar and leave you reaching for more foodAs long as you are getting all the nutrients you need, and you feel fine then it isn't a problem. By this point you know what your body needs. When you reach the weight you want, you aren't going to want to be 500 under your maintenance everyday, but occasionally won't be an issue Where can I find more info on this calculation? (googled but looking for more credible info)Okay, so I'm new at this, but when that happens, I'm essentially eating all the time. The trick is, it's raw vegetables -- carrots, asparagus, string beans, whatever. Minimum damage to the bottom line, the feeling that I'm eating (oh, how I love to eat), and probably the occasional vitamin, too. Personally, my thought is no harm done.Exactly.  One of the largest focuses of your body is to maintain homeostasis.  That means keeping everything the same.  Your body doesn't like change.  It knows how to function with what it has and when you change that it can get confused.  That's why fasting or binging can work to break plateaus.  That big shake up confuses the body and forces it to change.Computer guy here -- I used to believe that intense sessions of demanding programming and algorithm tuning or bug-finding **must** take more calories than casually watching TV.

The science says that the brain does use a lot of energy , but does so all the time ... no more and no less when it is actively engaged:

&gt;What the latest science reveals, however, is that the popular notion of mental exhaustion is too simplistic. The brain continuously slurps up huge amounts of energy for an organ of its size, regardless of whether we are tackling integral calculus or clicking through the week's top 10 LOLcats. Although firing neurons summon extra blood, oxygen and glucose, any local increases in energy consumption are tiny compared with the brain's gluttonous baseline intake.

Still, if I were you, I'd be buying a big bag of baby carrots as a crunchy healthy snack -- at 10 calories an ounce, they're a snack that would feed my need for distraction if not my need for calories.I used to do 45 minutes walking on the treadmill. Now i do 35 on treadmill, 5 minute bike warmup, 4 minute tabata. Its 1 minute less but my legs are so sorr by the end

I don't want to eat more. I want to tell my brain it doesn't need more calories, which you just did, so this helps. Thanks.I know I'm around 5 foot 9/10/114 minutes might be a good start...but it sounds like alot of people have had more success with actual H.I.I.T. workouts that are either 20 minutes long, half on half off. 4 minutes just seems way too low for a truly effective workout, even at max effort you simply just aren't burning as many calories.

This is my understanding of it, but do some research and I wish you the best of luck.Great progress! Congrats on this.Long mentally exhausting hours don't necessitate more calories. Sure you can eat more if you want but you'll just be reducing your deficit. Headaches from long hours are often dehydration, caffeine withdrawal and tension.Considering youre only 140 lbs, and I'm assuming you're over like 5 feet, I'd say just hit the weights man. They'll get your body firmer than dieting more, and you can Take care if the excess fat later if it's still bothering youDon't go low on the fat. Lift weights (that raises testosterone levels).My boyfriend is always one to help me and wants to help me stay motivated. As for a gym buddy. I'm more of a work out alone type person. I get very self concious on how I look when I work out. It's weird I know! Lol. I have a few time tweaked my calorie in take and know how to do that and have my fitness pal to track my food. I'm going to work on getting recipes together to make meal time a lite easier I'm so happy! I managed to button up my old denim jacket which I wasn't able to do so for so many years! The holes in between the buttons still bulges a little but I still buttoned up! :DYou're reaching the last lap of the weight-loss part of this marathon.  The long part comes next -- the weight maintenance part.  You're not there yet, but you can see it in the distance.

In maintenance, you need to manage your deficit -- it's not a free fall anymore, it's an equilibrium.  You eat right for your weight, your weight is right for what you eat.

We live in a world with pizza, beer, pasta, barbecues, pot lucks, buffets, restaurants.  And yet, you and I are committed to never going back to our starting weight or those habits.

So, for the past few weeks now, I've been reintroducing these challenges a little at a time.  Four weeks ago, it was a buffet.  A couple times in the past month, a pasta dinner with meat sauce and garlic bread.  Valentines Day was a night out at a romantic inn.  Those meals were higher than normal for me losing weight, but each one taught me how to handle it better next time and none of them caused me to gain weight or even stop losing weight.  They did cause some stress at first -- new and scary, but it's getting easier.

You're doing great with the tight control, but not far from now will come the time for moderation.  Eating still in control, but no longer in a weight-loss descent.  Start using your extra calories to help you do that in a reasonable way.  You have perfect teeth!I'm pretty sure it's an established thing. In the week or so before my period, my weight balloons (water weight -- also, my appetite kicks into high gear for some reason) and then, when my period starts, the weight disappears again and mysteriously takes my appetite with it. Then everything resets to normal and starts over the next month.

Ugh.This is just like me, I've lost the same amount. How is your body dealing with loose skin etc? Did it take long for you to feel the skin "tightening up"?

Well done OP, hard work, but it pays off and you look great! :-D0.5G of fat per pound of body weightSo, here's my anecdote: A few years ago when I was losing weight for my wedding, I was stuck at 150-2-3-4 for WEEKS. The thing is, I had NEVER ever dipped below 150 as an adult; at my thinnest (@ 5'5.5) had always been about 155. I realized that my body, never having been under 150 probably wasn't too keen on dipping below that number too easily. So, I steeled myself and resolved not to falter on my diet and exercise regimen because I knew, that no matter how stubborn my body was being by holding on to the 150s, the laws of thermodynamics would work in my favor, as long as I ate and worked out at a calorie deficit. Sure enough, it took 3.5 week of extremely strict calorie counting on my part and I hit 148. The same thing happened again when I was nearing the 130s; unfortunately I never made it below 142lbs because I got married, honeymooned, and then got kinda lazy.

All this to say, just keep being strict with your calories, drink your water and just be patient. Unless you're some sort of medical anomaly, your body will eventually give up trying to stay at it's "happy, comfortable" weight and will drop below 200. I promise! Just keep pushing through!! :)5'9" 220 pounds is obese. There is no way around it. Congrats on your loss! I have been doing 5:2 for 6 weeks now. I'm down a total of 16 pounds- it may be more I'll find out my next weigh in. I find on the 2 500 days I make the most of my calories with tons of veggies and lean protein. After a few weeks I quit craving sweets and bad carbs, even on my regular days. 5:2 has really morphed into a sustainable lifestyle for me. I plan on 6:1 when I have reached my goal weight. How do you know your TDEE if you don't know how tall you are?When and how are you weighing?Looking good! Keep up they ecellent work!Hey! congrats on the loss your doing great. Im currently in the same position started at 242 and am now down to 223. I have been going for 6 weeks now and am starting to feel my motivation going! I have started a progress chart and have a little motivation book that I just stick inspiration quotes and pictures in but do you have any hints and tips on how to keep the motivation up? I've been "planning" to quit smoking as well.  I'm ~60 lbs down and probably wont quit smoking until I hit or get close to my goal weight.  It is stressful losing weight, and I don't think I can handle quitting smoking right now either.If we could make people think in terms of BMI instead of lbs. or kg., then you would be *exactly* like everyone else -- we'd have a common frame of reference.  Someone losing over 2 pounds a week who is over 6' tall is just as good as your losing  a pound a week at 5'1" tall. I can imagine it is difficult. However, I wholeheartedly agree with /u/defyangravity/, I would not recommend starting a weight loss process without the guidance and support of an ED specialist in your case. I would start by focusing all your efforts on finding one.

I wish you well in your journey. Please stay safe.1300 is exactly half of my TDEE (per online calculators). That's super low, right?Have you been to a doctor lately? Having standard blood work done (which checks your thyroid) might help. Just keep at it. Sometimes my weight won't change for a few weeks and then I see a large drop. Good luck!I would search at http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/find-help-supportAnd I understand diet control, its just my dad has told me that I shouldn't be consuming under 2000 calories dailyI agree with you, cold turkey is the way to go. I stick with it in January but indulged around my birthday. Thank you!Thanks! And I see what you mean about light exercise curving your appetite! I lost the gained weight and about two or three more  over the past few days and I am now down 20 lbs! And I am in college but don't live on campus and get home late so it's kind of hard but I will try it!I don't actually know how tall I am haha, I just have flab on my stomach and ass that I want to loseThis is something I've been working really hard on myself right now.  I started running a while back and I'm really falling in love with it.  After the initial "I hate you...I don't want to do this...I just have to go until that stop sign" feeling wore off, that is.  So now my goal is the enjoy exercise for the sake of exercise, because I feel so good afterwards, not a means to an end.  I'm working to completely separate the diet from the exercise.  If I *need* to eat because I ran and ran and need a bit extra for the day to not be ravenous, then I eat a bit more.  But that's the only connection.  If I run, I don't "buy" myself more calories in the day.  If I have a treat of some kind, I don't punish myself with a longer run to make up for it.  So far it's paying off both on the scale and in terms of my mental health.Are you possibly adding muscle weight, offsetting your weight loss?Might as well learn this now:  weight is about your diet.

Exercise helps, but it won't make you lose weight if your diet is wrong.  Exercise because it feels great, because you like the sport, because of the endorphins, because it has other health benefits -- but disconnect the notion that exercise = weight-loss or no-exercise = weight-gain ... it is not helpful to you to think that way.  Weight control is diet control.  Exercise is for awesome.

You're 140.  How tall are you?   Do you need to lose weight?  Why do you think so?

The biggest problem is finding an ED specialist at this pointTHANK YOU!!! As of this morning I lost the weight that I regained and about another two or three but I am down 20 lbs!That's true. I have no idea how to find an ED specialist in my area. It seems this area is lacking in normal nutritionists and finding one that specializes in ED would be like find the lost arc.  I am picking a higher weight too rather than lower and I also will adjust once I get there. My first goal so far is just to get into onederland.Awesome work!

Whether 1300 is excessively low depends on your TDEE. See the FAQ for calculations.Nah, I do the same thing.  If you've already lost 50 lbs and staying in your calorie goal then it's obviously working.  I find that when I eat breakfast I am hungrier later but don't have as many calories left so it's harder to stay under my goal.  On the other hand I sometimes feel tired if I don't have a small meal for breakfast so I will eat a 200-300 cal. bowl of cereal once in a while to get a little extra energy.Portion control can be difficult since I work nights. It's like sleep when you can, eat when you can.You beat your plateau, right? Sounds good to me. If it ain't broke...So what got you motivated and was weight watchers or calorie counting the biggest help for you?  Did you do multiple meals a day or 2 or 3 meals?Just a comment -- I used to do this too, during the height of my depression (I wasn't working either). But I found that once I started eating 3 meals a day at regularly scheduled times, it gave structure to my day that didn't exist before, and it really helped me not only lose weight, but feel happier and healthier.

I know you're in a different situation, but it's something to think about. Best of luck! :)The only thing I can think of is that eating fewer, larger meals may result in blood sugar spikes which can have an effect on metabolic syndrome. I would ask the doctor about this. The other effect of a sugar spike is that you tend to get hungrier earlier and eat more.  Of course if you stick to your daily calorie plan, it's not an issue, but I wonder if it makes it harder.

I eat every three hours (small meals or snacks) and it seems to keep me from being hungry.  If I don't eat breakfast, by 10 am I am starving.

Last things is, if you aren't hungry in the morning, having not eaten for 9-12 hours, I would look at what you are eating at night.You need an eating disorder specialist not a nutritionist. The issue is that until you are recovered of at least farther along you should not be attempting to lose weight without guidance. The behaviors are clearly still huge issues and weight loss is only going to exacerbate them.Height does play a role.  Taller people can lose more weight more quickly but it should still be proportional to body size.  For instance whether you are 5' or 6', it should still take about the same amount of time to be able to lose 10% of your body weight.  Have you given it enough time to really evaluate?  Your body can build up excess water weight for weeks at a time causing you to not see any progress on the scale.  If you're still only losing a fraction of a pound per week after 6 weeks or so, I'd say you probably need to adjust your calories downward a bit.  Remember that when you use a BMR calculator it can only give you an estimate and you need to experiment to find out what yours really is./r/1200isplenty is the one they're referring to, I think.I do have a therapist but she specializes in Borderline Personality Disorder (i needed that more when i stared seeing her)
She suggested I start working with a dietitian. But I dont know where to start with that or how to find a good one. Ive been doing well in other aspects of my recovery and that's why I want to start working harder on the disordered eating.Many people don't, Including me. Just being able to move in ways you weren't before is such a change. You notice it after even 10 pounds. It's a life changer and life saver.Are you trying to change what you eat, or just eating the same things but smaller quantities? I've heard many with IBS really struggle with vegetables so if you've introduced new foods those may be your triggers.

Can you try going back to the old foods you used to eat and just count calories and eat smaller portions? From there you can add one or two new foods at a time to see if they trigger your IBS or not. Ohhhhh, I so identify with your post.

McDonald's and I were best, best friends. I went, like, three times a week. If it's at all helpful (and it may not be) I gave it up, cold turkey, in mid-December, and haven't looked back. My body does not miss it, and even when I think about the food, I don't get the same craving and longing for it anymore.

You can totally do this. You absolutely can. You're not weak! Everybody has favourite stuff that's really hard to give up or even curb. The battle never ends but you *will* get better at it.

Good luck! I used to be a heavy smoker. The best shape I was ever in I was jogging 3 miles a day, and playing roller hockey for 3 hours a day. I was also smoking 2 packs a day. I actually smoked while playing hockey, I would just drop back to defense for 5 minutes so I didn't have to stickhandle as much. I don't feel that smoking has ever restricted what I can do, but it was very difficult to get to where I was. Anything is possible, and you'll quit smoking when it's right for you.I went to the gym, which I generally avoid like the plague, because its been so gross and cold outside. I even tried some lifting!

It sucks to see the mods won't sticky this or anything. We need to try and upvote it to the top, or maybe you can resubmit it tonight for all the people who didn't get a chance to see it this morning!Have you seen a therapist? I would not attempt weigh loss without professional guidance as it sounds like you are not far enough along in recovery I sent you a couple of PMs as well. :) Is there a chance of doing this with the support of a professional? Maybe a therapist specialized in eating disorders? Excuse me?Hmm interesting! I've always been told/read that if you don't eat breakfast your metabolism will be way low and you won't burn anything. Man, the things they come up with!/u/reenact12321 - I sent you a PM with my info if it's not too late. :) I've been doing this alone for 47 days, I'd love to be part of the challenge!My goal weight is a weight I remember feeling fairly comfortable at and that I think is attainable.  It's actually still in the overweight range, but I figure I can re-evaluate when I get there.  Or not.  We'll see.And thank YOU for helping to put my loss into perspective!I generally eat healthily, I rarely eat cake or chocolate, should I focus on exercise to lose weight then?You go girl!Are you measuring your cereal or just eyeballing it?

How many calories are in your snack?

Are you drinking enough water?

Are you weighing at the exact same time of day every time?Yes.  If you're still growing taller, don't go under 1600 calories and eat from all nutrition sources: dairy, fruits, vegetables, a variety of proteins, variety of fats -- the key word here is variety.  The only thing that should be cut out is unnatural "junk" foods that are high in added sugars and highly processed foods (cakes, candies, donuts) -- not because junk foods stunt your growth, but because they're full of low-nutrition calories  -- trade those foods for healthy foods. As I said I cut back to 1 pound a week because 2 was just not happening.  But still, gaining 2.5 pounds in a week is ridiculous when I'm trying to lose weight.

I don't weigh my food or anything, but I'm pretty consistent.  I have cereal for breakfast and just go by the nutrition info on the box.  My lunch is usually a frozen Banquet meal (not the healthiest thing, I know, but we're on a tight budget and they're $.90 each) so again I go by the info on the box.

Dinner is the only variable, but I try to be accurate.  The calorie counts are based on what I find in the LiveStrong app that most closely matches what I'm eating.

I also, calorie permitting, have a snack before bed, which I know I need to cut out but damn it's tough.Yeah, I've always thought it is kinda funny (scary) the way society used to think about smoking. I mean, watching old movies or shows with people smoking in hospitals, hospitals!... I still remember my mother smoking in the car with me and my cousins inside, or people smoking in public transportation buses. Man, it was crazy :DIs this the Onion? I agree with you.  I can't really control how fast my body loses, but I suppose that emotionally it is just becoming exponentially harder to lose the weight with even slower returns, and that is really making me struggle more every day than I ever had to before.  I can feel myself wanting to quit, knowing that I'd have to eat even less.  I really hate this extra weight, though, so I guess I will have to make peace with how my body is and drop my calories.I'm not an athlete nor am I interested in being one, my whole family is huge and I definitely have that gene and I passed it on.   So, all things considered, I used BMI 25 to set my goal.  You are adorable. One question: how did you do both WW points and MFP? I tried that for awhile and it drove me crazy. Recently dropped WW and trying just MFP alone. Male.  I take a 30 minute walk on my lunch break every day.  That's really all I have time to do.  On the weekends, when I can, I'll either use the Wii Fit or the Bowflex but I haven't touched either in about a month, so no, not as much as I should be.Right now I have set my goal at the highest weight for a healthy bmi. When I get there I will see how I look and go from there. I think I have a bigger frame than others, but perhaps that is just because I have no idea what I look like skinny. Just pm me the details in the first few columns, I'll add you I can very much identify with this. I've gone through a crazy journey that started as wanting to lose weight but turned into so much more about finding myself and getting to the real issues.

My whole life I've had similar relationships with exercise. I was pretty much trying to outrun/out lift a bad diet, so you can imagine just how much time I had to dedicate to that, then one day I'd become so exhausted that I'd give up and then when I stopped I'd have this moment of clarity where I saw just how obsessed and crazy I was being, and I'd realize just how much time I was sinking into something that really wasn't making me healthier or happier. But I stopped working out, and the one thing halting weight gain was gone. Boom, another 15lbs before the cycle started again.

So, fast forward to a year ago when I got my diet under control. Now my weight was no longer tied to exercise. But personalities are funny, because the same sort of obsessive traits still dominated my exercise regimen. It was tracking times and calories and reps and sets and writing everything down...until I went on vacation where my phone couldn't get any signal. Wow, what a coming to Jesus moment. My phone was this crazy thing that dictated how well I ran or how well I lifted, it dictated how I felt about myself because of what I would log...until I couldn't use it to measure anything. That first day of vacation where I just went out and ran, with no pace time and no distance goal, wow...it's like I fell in love with running all over again.

I don't really know where I was going with this, except that I feel ya man. I feel ya.You look great! Congrats!Ignore the girlfriend's experience, we're all different metabolisms on a bell curve and the calculators don't know anything except the 50th percentile of a large population.  You know yourself better than the calculators by now -- 'd go with your 1600 TDEE if you're confident of it. You know you best.

Now there's an experience that factors under observation never behave as freely as factors not under observation.  It's not that the physics or math have changed, it's because we humans unconsciously do things that we don't account for.  Who knows what it is in your case.

You -should- be losing a pound every 12 days.  If you're not, increase the deficit by another 100 calories and keep going.  That could be 100 from the diet or adding 100 in exercise (that you don't eat back).

Here's the wonderful thing -- you *already* know you're good at this maintenance thing.  So a third option is just to accept the slower rate.  If your goal weight comes in 6 weeks or 6 months, who cares?  The weight-loss part is the short part of a process of weight management which lasts a lifetime.Huh. What happens to me is that I won't lose any weight (or I'll gain a very small amount) the week before my period, and then drop 2-3 lbs within 48 hours of my period starting. I attribute the mini-plateau/small gain with water weight, and then the drop with a week's worth of water retention leaving my body. I think it's odd that you go right back up to your pre-period weight- are you eating particularly salty or high-calorie food during your period due to cravings? It's kind of funny watching old videos of athletes (see Roger Bannister's famous 4 minute mile); they warm up by stretching, star jumps and a crafty cigYou know what's up.I find the protein limits on MFP are really low. I wouldn't worry about it at all. If you're exercising, I would aim for at least 1 gram of protein per kg per day so if you're eating 100 grams that's good.Nothing wrong with extra protein, you will find that the more protein you eat, the less hungry you will  be. IMHO, you should be looking to get around 150g/day to help spare lean mass, but it's not necessary.I'm guessing a sweaty bus ride back home after gym.

This is one of the few things which stop me from going to gym.

But I'm happy with cycling and bodyweight exercisesThat's pretty much it for me! Chicken, eggs, and some assorted vegetables I switch up for different taste. Thanks mate.

Its been about 1 Month now (on my last of 30 pills). I've posted some updates, but overall its been a really good result. I'm glad I got strong armed into going to the doctor about Duromine. At the time I was pretty sure it was just another "fake" diet drug, but its really been amazing.

There were a few side effects, mood swings and insomnia, and I'll probably experience them again when I start the higher dosage in 2 days time, but for now they have become quite manageable.This post makes me want to dance!  Congratulations!!!Knowing myself.

I am a vet student so spend a lot of time studying and dont have lots of time to spare. To spend 40-60 minutes just on getting to the gym isnt time I can spare. And catching the bus is a hassleHmm...about a 1.5 to 2 months ago. Many people have success adding muscle and cutting fat, especially at the beginning of their program. Check out /r/fitness and search for things like "noob gains" or "noob gainz."


I am currently eating at a deficit, doing a strength training program 3x a week, and doing cardio 0-3x a week. I'm down 15 pounds, have more muscle definition, am consistently adding weights in my program, and feel great.


You might want to check out /r/xxfitness (even if you're not a lady) and you will see lots of stories of women who changed from cardio/diet focused to weights/diet focused and the successes they have had. I am currently doing StrongCurves which is an aesthetic program that is popular with women, but I know a lot of people do starting strength as their first program. (Fwiw, I started as a pretty normal sized person but for the purposes of my sport, losing weight and adding strength is important - so 15 lbs is pretty significant for me.)It's going to feel pretty good when you're down 5 lbs. Then it's going to feel even better when you've lost 10. People will start complimenting you and you'll probably notice your clothes feel different when you get to 15. By the time you hit 20lbs lost, you're going to feel *amazing.*

I think people see big numbers that they have to lose and they feel like the reward is so far away. The reality is that the reward comes a lot sooner than you'd think. You are going to feel really amazing once you get to the weight you *thought* you were. And then you're going to have a whole other 20 lbs of even more amazingness to follow it!WOW!!!!! So inspiringGreat thank you, I know it will be hard to give up the alcohol totally, not in an alcoholic way, but I just enjoy a glass to unwind. Plus I'm a bar tender, so post shift drinks are pretty much tradition. It will be a difficult transition, but I've been trying. Thanks though! Almost all meat nutritional info is for raw meat. It makes no sense to list it for a cooked state. Baked, roasted, grilled, broiled, boiled, fried, braised, simmered, sauteed, poached, olive oil, vegetable oil, coconut oil, butter, pan spray, margarine, fat trimmed, fat removed, fat left intact, fat drained, cooked rare/medrare/medium/medwell/welldone.

There are far too many factors to take into account when checking caloric information for cooked meat.

The point is, weigh it pre-cook and then cook it. The weight after cooking is completely irrelevant, snarky mcsnarkerson.Amazing effort!!! Those little changes to how you talk to yourself make all difference. Well done you should be so proud of yourself!! Keep it up my friend :)Right there with you!  Former 461, scale just started with a 2  (299.6) for the first time since I was probably in middle school.

You bros keep it up too!  Awesome, very helpful. Do you have any brand of protein powder you'd recommend? My roommate is doing Marine training, so she uses those giant jugs for workout recovery/muscle something or other (I have no idea what I'm talking about) I'm assuming there is a difference though.

The weird thing is, that maybe its because I'm older, but I'm WAY more confident and happy with myself now, albeit seeing the roll of fat under my bra strap and wondering where it came from, or not liking how large my legs are. As compared to being in college at 130lbs- I thought I was HUGE back then, but I  actually looked great. Now I look in a mirror and see that yes I gained weight and I could really look better and need be healthier, but I guess I don't hate myself, which I guess is a good thing? I don't know.

As far as workout goes, I keep telling myself I'll work out at home, I have a yoga mat and a pull-up bar and some small weights, but it never happens. For me, I think I need to talk with a trainer to get an idea of what workouts are best for my goals, and go from there. I just need to get past the "judgement" I've always felt in gyms, but that was in college, where everyone on campus used the gym as a place to find a date. I pass the gym on my way home from work, so there's no excuse for me "having to go out of my way" or it being "too far" or something. Plus if I'm paying for something $10/month isn't bad, I'll be more likely to do it, since I don't want to waste my money.

Also sorry for the essay, this is partly me being accountable for myself to look back on. Thanks for all your advice!My new tactic for the last month or so is no food after 8pm. My worst possible food decisions are usually after this time. It's not always easy, and the trees make it kinda difficult, but no one dies. Win. Congratulations! I'm just starting down that path and really glad to see people achieving what I hope to achieve!Same boat. Highest weight was 289 in 2011. Did 4HourBody and lost 25 pounds then stalled there. Was taking care of my mom while she slowly died of cancer in October of 2011.

October 2012 to April 2013 I got down 205 through.... less than reputable means. Stayed there until December of 2013 when tragedy hit. A friend that I thought of as family got diagnosed with cancer and I started to comfort eat. Got up to the 230s but managed to stall there. Then she passed away 8 days after the death anniversary of my mom. I started to comfort eat in earnest.

I've happily started this journey again at the beginning of March and I'm back on 4 Hour Body and doing c25k.

SW: 266.4 CW: 254.8 GW: 150Damn.  Sounds like I have some catching up to do.  In Feb. I turned 40 and weighed in at 440.  Been trying in fits and starts to get going since then.  Your story helps remind me it is doable.  On that note, off to the treadmill.Today I will stay under my calorie limit. I will hit my protein goal. I will walk down then back up the stairs at work (10 flights). I will go to practice this evening (roller derby) and give it my all; I will not fear getting tired and looking weak, I will simply do my best with no regrets. Hello! Here's how I'm going to play today:

* Stick to about 1600 calories for a Maintenance Day

* Drink water

* Do stretches (I need it, ow)I think I know what you mean. What makes us think we'll stick to it, even with the distance, is the pools. There are some public pools closer to where we live, but they are usually frequented with people that, well, not to sound snob, but, I'm genuinely concern we might catch something from them by sharing the same water.

And, just to clarify, I'm talking about people who we know do not have electricity and who shaved their children head because of lice. It's the "yeah I'm a bitchy redneck and I like it" kind of folk. We decided paying a little more and going to a gym a little further was a freaking investment in our health.Yep. And what I do is just stick to good behaviors and don't weigh myself on those "bad" weeks. I feel like it does more to make me feel down in the dumps to look at that number than to realize that it's "fake" weight... 15-20 minute drive depending on traffic. It is not the closest gym, and it's not even the closest sport-specific gym. I have a free membership because I work part time. My workout buddies go because I go.I find it odd that they controlled for age, smoking, and exercise, but not caloric intake. It is possible that calorie intake is a confounding variable here (people who chose diet soda were taking in more calories that those who chose to not drink diet soda). In addition to all this stuff, I also find that I'm more conscientious about my body when I'm trying to lose weight, so that means I remember to brush my teeth twice a day, wash my face before bed, floss more often, remember to take my vitamins... all good stuff!Congrats man, keep it up! I lost around 100lbs a few years ago and gained it all back. An accountability partner is a great idea, I probably never would have backslid had I has one, my friends are too nice.That is amazing! And a fantastic attitude to have! Congratulations!Congrats on your journey!

You might want to check out other subreddits like /r/fitness or /r/bodybuilding for motivation and specific questions!How tall are you?That's interesting. What made you realize you wouldn't go?The reason people risk it is because it has negligible observable effects on weight and health, yet really increases some people's quality of life. If it makes them happy, and fits in their nutrition goals, I think it is good because it might allow people the flexibility to keep eating healthfully if they can enjoy their diet soda.Mine is about 10 minutes from home but *is* on my way to/from work. So I feel guilty when I pass it without stopping there. I feel like I wouldn't go as often if it were in a more "forgettable" place. Thanks, I've never heard of coconut oil in coffee, interesting, how much do you use? I've heard that avocado and nuts are great, but since they are so fatty you shouldn't eat too much of them. Is this true?
 about a mile and a half from my office (although a 30 minute drive from my home)My partner used to have really high triglycerides...like in the 500s. Since he has started eating more veggies and reduced his calorie intake to 2000 a day, his number are now in the mid-100s. It was literally amazing how much of a difference. All of his numbers are better and his doctor was really impressed. We uses the MyfitnessPal app, and it really works for us.It's about a three-kilometre walk, or drive. So I guess the answer is three kilometres.But the most delicious in Eastern cuisine. Mmm....Try mixing it up: Different foods, different exercise, different plans and routines. Sometimes our brains and our bodies get used to doing the same thing. Our portion sizes creep up without knowing it. Our bodies get efficient at the same exercises. The only gym near me that I can afford is a 20-30 minute bus ride.

I realized I would never actually go after a 1 day trial.

Instead I have built up a home gym and run outdoors. I might do that, although there's an upcharge for the filet as there is for the prawn cocktail...but OTOH I'll be the only one not spending money for drinks (I don't drink liquor, or very rarely). Handsome!
Congratulations on reaching your goal :)This is great! My husband and I do the same thing :)
So, you have done it 6 months. Which, to give you credit, is a good chunk of time, but it is no where in that long term range. Unless you have very, very meticulously constructing your daily diet breakdown, it is difficult to ensure you get all of the proper nutrients and minerals at 1000 calories. Just because you want your body to function on a tiny amount doesn't mean biology will make it work. POP POP!!!!

Former 430lb guy here.  360 now and counting.Yeah, plus I cook a lot of chicken myself. It's not something I want to get in a restaurant.Good morning everyone!

- Ignore the Mexican food across the street and eat this salad I packed.
- Take the stairs at least 4 times today.
- Shop at Target after work.  :P
- When I get home, immediately change clothes and do a metabolic circuit.

Good luck, and have a healthy day!It's a prix fise or however that's spelled. I am down 15 pounds in 2.5 months and I eat rice almost every day twice a day. For me, a portion is a 1/2 c of cooked rice to fit my caloric goals.


You really need to play and see what works with your body. I am keeping rice for as long as I see results.I don't eat many carbs either.  I'd go with the filet without the glaze, if they can't do that, prime rib, or maybe the lamb.  Avoid the crab cakes as 99.9% of the time they're cut with bread crumbs.  The grouper sounds good, too but I'd put money on part of that 'crust' being breading which I don't eat.  I find cold cut up fruit really helps when I'm baked. It's actually better than a lot of the crap you crave because it gives you a bit of sugar but more importantly trace nutrients and fibre as well. Pineapple, crisp tart apples and cold oranges from the fridge. Seriously good for the munchies. Oh another good one if you're craving something chocolaty combine:

1/2cup of Cocoa powder or Cacao
1/2cup of warm coconut oil
1/2cup of raw honey, you use normal honey too
1tsp of vanilla essence

mix together and put into a container with some parchment paper on the bottom to prevent sticking and put it in the freezer. Cut it up into bite sized squares and you have some nutritious chocolate fudge!!

Cocoa is naturally high in magnesium so it's really good to help with muscle soreness as well! Pleasant bonus!

Obviously don't go crazy on the fudge but it's quite rich, like a good dark chocolate. But those 2 things combined actually have stopped me from a ganja binge on many occasions. :)
 Same. [Was 435, now am 255](http://i.imgur.com/NajLuuo.jpg) and still losing. Y'all got this!Thank you! Will do ;)This was it for me.  I had always refused to try any kind of "dieting" because it seemed like all the diets that people were doing were extreme, like completely cutting out bread, or never eating sweets.  Once I realized I could eat anything I wanted as long as I kept the calories down, it was stupid easy.  The realization that you *can* lose weight just by changing how you eat, even if you don't have time to spend an hour exercising every night, has been a game-changer for me as well.Thank you! :) and Yes!! I know the motivation that comes with seeing somebody in your situation. I'm so glad I can finally provide that for people. You will get there my friend, just gotta have patience and the right mindset. If you ever have any questions don't hesitate to shoot me a PM. Good luck dude!Sounds like you found some new excuses.Don't feel guilty about eat rice. However, I have also really enjoyed baked sweet potatoes with a bit of butter and salt. Very yummy. Love those suckers. They are on sale for a 3 pound bag for 69 CENTS! this week at the store by my house!Thank you so much :)100%. I look at food in a different way now. It's not there for your comfort, it's there for survival. Eating healthier has given me positive results in more than just one way. Despite being done cutting weight, I still plan to eat how I do for hopefully the rest of my life.

I definitely regret eating whatever I wanted out of self pity but you live and learn.

Also, for lifting, I plan on doing cardio in the morning and weights at night. My roommate and his pal go to the gym every night to lift so I'm gonna start hopping on board with them soon. Thanks!! Today has been really good. I killed my lunchtime workout, and have stayed on track with my eating. Somebody actually commented on my food (all my snacks are on the table at our meeting), saying my lunch and snacks looked really healthy. I did not tell them that all that food was just for my snacks, and my lunch was still in my bag... but it's all part of today's plan :)Thank you! I'm really glad I can motivate you. Good luck getting the weight off and I hope to see your progress pics in due time :)I'm about to go strict plain chicken and lettuce.Congrats on the 50 lbs loss.......I started at approx. the same weight as you......and I am down 10....Your story inspired me to keep going....Great work.Shit man, that is badass!
Keep it up!I think the realization and discipline to make a change has to come from within, but the "wake-up moment" might come from any number of external factors. For instance, in my case I saw my friend making an incredible effort to lose weight so she could have a child. That was my moment. I was like, "man, there are a whole lot of things that your body can do  better when you're at a healthy weight. I should work towards a healthier body too." For others that moment might be any number of things, but it can put a strain on any relationship to approach someone about their weight directly. Would not recommend it.safety standards are fundamental!Congrats!  Now get a seat belt for your wagon!Now I want rice.  Not completely on topic but: I look at my stretch marks as battle scares from my heavier days... they remind me of where i came from and the hard work i have done to get hereHere is the recipe I use, which I am pretty sure I probably originally found from someone on this sub.

[I hope this link shows up - first time linking, sorry](http://www.food.com/recipe/low-carb-pizza-84516)

The crust is made from egg, and the crunch comes from the cheese at the bottom. Weird, I know, but I focus on putting awesome toppings on it. I swear, give it a chance. It tastes just like pizza.Congratulations!!!Just about the nutrition value of food, really. The saddest thing was learning how calorie-dense cheese is. I love cheese and I used to put loads on everything--I knew it wasn't a health food but I had no idea how bad my quesadilla habit really was, haha.

It was super helpful when I finally started learning about fiber, though. Knowing how much fiber to aim for and where to get it makes a huge difference in feeling satisfied.Sounds like you're on the right track with cutting out processed foods and you're already eating lots of veggies, so that's great! Too many calories is still the issue though. Try adding in more healthy fats - coconut oil in your coffee or tea, nuts, avocado, etc. This will boost your satiety and pretty much automatically reduce how much you eat. Also, try to get in more protein in the morning. Add a scoop of vanilla protein powder to your smoothie, or have a couple eggs along with it to keep you full. Good luck!Holy shit man. That's awesome I'm literally in the exact same situation as you, I'm just doing about 1200 calories with 2 a days at the gym. I was worried about how I would look whenever I got from 317 to my goal weight of 180. I can only hope I end up like you. Congrats man I'm at 275 right now but your post has given me a lot more to hope for now since most people on here didn't have similar situations around our age. Keep the weight off good luck brother!You look freakin' amazing!!! Congratulations on all of your hard work! :)Nice but you probably didn't smoke a indica strand because that would have made you starving. A sativa strand you would be fine as you were none the less great job on the self control.I love reading the stories on here.

I never used this site in the past to motivate myself to lose weight. However, I lost count of the number of times I've lost and regained my weight. I am not as heavy as some others on here, but I struggled for years with this issue. (I know for my height the suggested "ideal" weight should be about 109 to 115lbs. Meaning I'm about 35 lbs overweight.) I have lost down to 125 lbs several times in the last 10 years.

I can make an excuse why I keep regaining, but there are too many factors. The main issue is I fall back into a personal mind trap often regarding being lonely and not having any luck making friends, or having lasting relationships. I find I lose my weight between the relationships I get in, and maintain for the first couple months of the relationship. Then as the relationship goes on, I start finding myself become more lazy in terms of working out/ walking. Most of the time it's around the time the person I'm with points out something stupid, like "What's the point of walking?" or "Why don't you have friends?", or that even though I been working hard a couple of my exes used to still point out my weight. These are not questions/ statements easy on a persons mind. Other reasons I gave myself were: it's winter too hard to go outside to walk, and I'm moving, I need to focus on the move. Or my favorite one, "I don't have a kitchen" This last one was true for a year. So I ate a lot of food that were able to last in a cupboard like bread, crackers, etc.

Now being single again I'm working on the my mental health, along with losing the weight again for myself. At the same time developing skills I should be able to maintain during any new relationships in my life.

So far without too much change I'm almost down 5 lbs.

Good Luck, to those who are also losing again and also to those who are losing for the first time as well!  In that base. Two years ago I was in the best shape of my life, I had a super healthy routine.  Then I went through a break up, stated a new job, moved, and started dating again in the span of a few months.  My routine didn't apply and I went back to a bad routine.  Two years later I'm back to square one.  But I just started a new job and used that as my chance to start a new routine!  Two weeks in and so far so good!Nice job. Based on what you know now, would you handle things differently if you are faced with another injury/challenge like when you broke your ankle. Also, do you have a specific plan to follow for the lifting.Less than a mile. I walk - gives me a nice warmup/cool down. That's good.  Using a scale takes the guesswork out of eating for me.  I see a number on the scale, so I then find an accurate database listing in MFP that reflects the actual nutritional information of that food and weight, and I log it.  At first there's a slight learning curve for using MFP and it's mildly annoying at first as you accumulate your frequent food list.  After about a week though, you should have a pretty solid foundation with it and the time logging takes will decrease.

I eat a lot of the same meals so I've created saved Meals in MFP that make it easy for me to just click twice to log a whole meal.  If I change ingredients, I'm sure to double check that what I'm putting in my mouth is accurately reflected in MFP.  I've found a lot of listings in MFP with wildly inaccurate nutritional info so I correct those when I find them, then those foods appear in my frequent list.

Hope this helps!Yeah I have found through just counting calories I have started to get a much healthier diet if only because the healthy foods have lower calories and I can then eat more if them....Haha, okay! Thank you! (:People want you to be safe. That's all.Hey! Congrats :) we are birthday twins! I also had a goal to hit by my bday, which I did. So glad you were able to celebrate the milestone. Now keep it up!You can totally see the loss in your face! Plus you actually look happier too. You're doing so great, 70lbs gone is amazing.It seems I might have been measuring my waist wrong. I thought it was the circumference around my belly button, where all my belly fat was, but apparently it's just the thinnest part of my torso? In that case, my waist is 29 inches. Still, both times I measured around my belly button, it was 32 inches, so it doesn't seem like I made much progress there. My belly fat is just very stubborn I suppose :(

Thanks for the advice. I will try more weight lifting. I can't afford another gym membership in addition to my rock gym, but I will order a dumbbell or barbell set so I can work out at home.

I've drank diet pop in preference over regular pop since my 20's- decades- because I didn't want to hurt my teeth.  Not a big pop drinker- maybe a can/bottle a day.  Loved sugar-free energy drinks, though.  I quit cold turkey the beginning of February, and what with trying to drink water, etc., I haven't missed it at all.  No cravings.  I still drink my one big morning coffee, with my one little 3/4 tsp of coconut sugar.  I totally believe in the insulin-resistance factor.  I love all of you guys, thanks for posting.  You are so inspirational! Glad to see you back and hope to see you tomorrow. Good luck with your goals!The positive one is a good one we should always remember, good idea! Now go kick the ass of those stairs!Definitely assume MFP is overestimating with its exercise calories. I log ~2/3 of the exercise calories listed for whatever I do.

Other than that, I think you have two options 1) cut your intake to lose faster, or 2) accept that you're losing slower than you'd like, and stick to your current deficit since it seems comfortable. I know I would pick 2. Losing 21 pounds is awesome and as long as you're headed in the right direction, why worry about the timeline?MY favorite post in reddit lose it thus far. Thank you, totally put things in perspective.Great job!Best thread on reddit I've read today! I would like to join the now under 400 club woot train too! Love Diet Coke.  And Coke Zero.  I miss them...You can have your cake and eat it too!  Haha.Going from 20 wings and fries to six wings and a salad is honestly, a HUGE step! Fries are addictive and sometimes you'll feel like treating yourself after a few days of eating well and end up with the same eating habits as before. So that is a massive step and you have a great mindset! I'm so happy for you! Good job!WOOOT WOOOT WOOTNot quite at that club. But I'm 15 pounds away!!!&lt;3well done man my SW: 320 lbs CW: 295.6 lbs and GW: 200 lbs. I look at these pictures as a huge motivator to finish my goal.I am so envious!

I was finally able to find a pair of boots that fit my MASSIVE calves in Fall of 2013, and the following spring, my mom borrowed my car (which had the boots in them) and she threw them out! She promised she'd buy me a new pair, but this past fall, no one was selling any wide enough. :( Happy birthday!You are amazing. What an accomplishment! Thank you for sharing. I love the clip you posted, and I'm going to try to keep the same mentality!Fine, fine but I'm using the same logic when it comes to the wedding cake ;)Always weigh yourself at the same time every day, preferably in the morning after you've relieved yourself and before you eat. By fluctuating your weigh times, you might become discouraged. In the morning I may weigh 203, but by mid afternoon it says I'm 208. The next morning, however, I'm back to 203 or 202.

Once per day, the same time every day, and you'll see realistic trends.You look great!  Less Reddit more lady killing!  Go!In general, yes, it has to come from within. The only thing I can think of that might be worth trying is convincing her to go see her doctor. Sometimes hearing it from a professional makes a big difference to people.It's a rock gym only and doesn't have standard gym equipment. There is some stuff there that help work out your core and arms (like pull up bar and leg lift machine), but I don't think there's a bench press machine. I have 10 and 15 pound dumbbells at home, but I can order a larger set and start working out with those.

Thanks for the advice!congrats as a former 400 lb. guy i know how hard it is on the body and rejoice in these milestones it did the same and i think it helped me stay on track :) I LOVE rice. I eat white rice every day (a cup a day). I sometimes split it into two 1/2 cups (one for lunch and one for dinner) to accompany whatever else I am eating (chicken, fish, etc.) As long as it is a side and not the main course, I don't see a problem with it.

I have been losing 1 lb a week while eating a cup of white rice every day. I will say that my body seems to work best with a carb intake of 150-200 though and a protein intake of less  than 100. I know everyone else's experiences with carbs may be different.

I did, however, cut out pasta and potatoes.

Brown rice is supposed to be healthier than white, so you're making better choices than me! As long as it's within your calorie intake goals, I don't see why you should deprive yourself of it. Give your body what it needs. Try it out and then you'll see what works for you.Fellow former 400+ checking in. It can be done. I now weigh 280. Keep going bros. I just don't think diet soda tastes good. The only sodas I even like are Mountain Dew and Mello Yello. If neither of those options are available, (no, Sprite and Sierra Mist are not acceptable substitutes), I will drink water or tea.

However, since modifying my diet to lose weight, I find myself drinking soda once per week or less. I've slowly been weaning myself off my regular Taco Bell Mountain Dew and Five Guys Mello Yello. I don't miss it too terribly, but if I order one, I'll keep it within my calorie count.

I'm probably not who you want to get an answer from because I don't find diet soda to be of any use to me.Great job!The incredible shrinking man!  Keep up the good work brother.250 factorial? And you're already back to 200. Holy shit nice job! :)That is truly amazing.  Congratulations on all of your hard work.  :)This is normal for the first couple of weeks, enjoy it!

Yes it's mostly water weight and simply less waste in your body from eating less.It sounds like portion control could be the issue here. That and your alcohol consumption (these are really high in empty calories and can add up pretty quickly). The only way for you to find out would be to record everything you eat (including portions) and drink in a food journal for a week to track where all your calories are coming from, and how much you're actually consuming. You can then make adjustments from there. Hope that helps!&gt;I think it's the sleeping pills which are a gift from Dr. Huxtable.
It would also be a good idea to do some strength training since more muscles will burn more calories at rest (higher metabolism).The Oikos brand is my fav frozen yogurt. I have almost all the flavors but I'm so down with chocolate and cookies and cream.Personally, I had chips only a few hours after my surgery. I also had lasagna and bread for dinner that night. The bread was a little rough to swallow though. It didn't really affect my appetite either. My doctor told me that I didn't need to wait to eat anything in specific and that I should eat whatever I thought I was ready for. I didn't really have any problems with anything other than dairy products which kind of lingered in the back of my throat. That being said, if you think you can handle it, its possible to stick to your normal diet. Good luck!Sorry I phrased that super wrong, I associate rice with higher calories. It does. I'm still eating at a deficit either way.How many weddings do you get during your marriage?  One.

Do it.I went from 5'10" 180lbs/size 14 to 130lbs/size 6 in college. I felt and looked fantastic. Then grad school + job + breakup happened, and here I am, 6 years later, at a whopping 239lbs/size 18. I'm already down 18lbs, but I keep kicking myself for letting it get here in the first place. WHOO!

Congratulations, that's a huge accomplishment :)

Keep working hard, you're only getting stronger!Before I even started dieting I think it goes back before that about 6 months. I read "The Power of Habits" and got a couple takeaways concerning keystone habits...the one thing you do that holds all your other positive habits together. For me that was getting a handle on my drinking as I was in the habit of having after-work drinks that gave me a dangerous tolerance when I went out with friends. I'd end up getting 3-4, drinks when I should have only been having 1-2. Once broke free of drinking at home I then started to go to the gym regularly to lift. It was a sloppy bulking phase that I did for 3 months to increase my strength as much as possible. I learned I love the feeling of getting stronger and putting my surplus calories towards making muscle gains. The whole while I was thinking about cutting...how I was going to do it, how hard it was going to be. That sort of build up of motivation made me go hardcore once January 2nd hit and I started using my fitness pal.

I get on the scale every day and count my food intake, even when it's a nightmare.

It's easy to eat perfectly one day, record it and then weigh yourself and see you dropped a pound overnight.

The real struggle is knowing you just downed an extra 500cals at TGIFriday bc you didn't know they dipped their burgers in butter before they served them. It's hard going out with a friend who is having an crisis with her husband and in the process of comforting them you have a couple whiskeys that turn into going out for indian food. I still enter that in MFP as close as I can. I still weigh myself the next day. It's never good, but the reality is usually better than what I've been saying to myself.

Right now I've been nursing a cold for about a week and I had to take a break from the gym while my body fights it off. It SUCKS. It's hard to know what point I should get back to my routine. But in the meantime all the little aches I've built up from the gym get to work themselves out. And when I go back Im going to try to be as smart as I can so that I don't throw myself back and injure myself.

Again, the big thing about this is knowing **I'm not done.**You got this, sir.

I'm silverml87 on mfp if you'd like to be friendsies.  :)Happy birthday!! Can't think of a better gift to give yourself then healthiness.  Definitely true about angles. From the front, I don't look like I've gained so much weight over the last 5 years. Shape is still mostly the same.

From the side, though? I went from just being a "thick" girl to my gut poking out farther than my boobs.

/u/Zymet did you take multiple before and after pictures? If not, start now! Do front, side, and back, and then front and side of your face. You'll see the difference. Hello, I'm M/30/5'10"/210 lbs. I've been working on losing weight for YEARS at this point, having successfully lost 30-40 lbs on multiple occasions, only to gain most of it back. At my heaviest I was pushing 280 lbs. I stared my most recent journey at 260 lbs and have managed to get down to 210 lbs. Due to illness, injury, and a bout of depression I've gained a few pounds back and am currently at 214 lbs. My goal is 180 lbs. My exercise of choice is running, I've completed eight 5 mile races in the past two years, my goal this year is to be fit enough to begin training for a half marathon. As a diet soda drinker, I only drink it from time to time and have found that after a while my body's need/craving for it and the enjoyment I get from it is slowly going away (I really have no idea why, though there's was a pretty distinct correlation between when I started to increase my exercise &amp; reduced cravings). There have been studies but it's sometimes hard to associate which are "trust worthy" as soft drink industries back studies ALL the time, which might also make the studies themselves biased. There have also been studies that link Aspartame (main sweetener in Diet Soda) with cancer, however one particular study that I've seen was where scientists fed mice aspartame in their food and it was the equivalent of 100 cans of diet soda *per day*. So it's mostly just kind of hazy, most articles I've read say that soda doesn't cause weight gain...it's all of the things you eat with it (which is most frequently junk food) that cause weight. Some people use diet soda as an excuse to eat more calories, while I just find junk food even more enjoyable when accompanied with a diet soda (no idea why really...maybe it's the chemicals?). So for me, I have to be careful as Diet Soda can be a trigger for me to eat more snack/junk food.


**TLDR:** I wouldn't cut it out of your diet if it makes you happy, but I would recommend cutting down (if you consistently drink it) as a lot of soda consumption can mess with the enamel on your teeth, plus there is still sodium in it which can also mess with your water retention. If you are curious about reading material, here's a pretty unbiased article from [Nerdfittness on diet soda](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2015/03/04/is-diet-coke-bad-for-you-what-about-artificial-sweeteners/)Congratulations!I was in the same situation as you are now, just 47 short days ago. 6 foot tall male, starting at 282 pounds. As of a few days ago, I now weigh in at 255.

Losing weight is incredibly easy, in theory. Simply burn more calories than you eat! Easy, right? It sounds like it should be, but as every person in this sub knows, it really isn't. However, there is no earth shattering secret that needs to be revealed. If you've gained weight, you've eaten more calories than you've burnt in the last few years. You simply need to reverse that trend.

I've found a few tricks that have really helped me with that, since I was and still am addicted to good food. I got really big off of eating mostly healthy foods, and not much processed or fast food. I love to cook and love eating. For me, I have a far easier time switching to lower calorie foods than eating less.

For example, buy egg whites and turkey bacon. At 30 calories per quarter cup off egg whites and 30 calories per slice of turkey bacon, it's almost hard to overeat them! For breakfast I'll have an omelet consisting of a half cup of egg whites, two slices turkey bacon, onion, and peppers, for a total of 150 calories. Add a slice of 50 calorie Weight Watchers bread with no margarine and my breakfast is only 200 calories!

Oats make a really low calorie lunch. I like to have them with a few scoops of rasberries/blackberries, and a tablespoon of Skor chips. Tastes good, and comes in at roughly 250 calories.

Supper will often be a half cup of rice, or half a serving of egg white noodles (roughly 160 calories for either), a large portion of veggies (I know, who likes veggies? But they're great for low calories), and 6oz of either chicken or salmon, plus maybe another half cup of egg whites, for a total of maybe 500 calories.

That puts me to roughly 900 calories. I'll allow myself around 400 calories in snacks (fruit, or 100 calorie snackpacks), and a protein shake for 140 calories after my lifting sessions, and I'm averaging under 1500 calories a day. At that rate, I've lost a little shy of 30 pounds in 50 days!

You don't need to go quite so extreme. If you eat 500 calories a day less than you burn, you'll lose a pound per week. That may not seem like much, but if you keep it up for only one year, you'll lose 50 pounds! I highly recommend getting MyFitnessPal on your phone, and tracking calories through that. Be honest when you set your activity level, and don't count any calories from extra-exercise. Yep. Monthly bloat. It just happens. Sucks.

I will say, my bloat has become *way* less pronounced as I've lost weight. Cutting a lot of alcohol and junk out of my diet has also had a big effect. This has been the easiest period I've had in...fuck, I can't even remember. Well I can tell you my personal anecdotal evidence. I used to drink soda like it was my job. In college I switched from regular coke to diet. I got used to the taste and began to prefer it (important info for later). I did if to cut the calories I was consuming, but I never lost weight when I did that, if anything I gained. Of course I was eating mostly carbs and not tracking my portions then.

As an adult I had acne which seemed to be linked to my menstrual cycle, I was depressed often and at my heaviest I felt drained constantly. I had been hearing reports around this time about possible links in the reaction to [chemicals in diet coke reacting to the BPAs in plastic bottles &amp; aspartame possibly raising estrogen levels](http://arizonaadvancedmedicine.com/articles/diet_soda.html) and other scientific studies which basically said diet soda could potentially cause problems. So I decided to give it up and see if I noticed a difference.

What I found is my acne went away &amp; has never come back, and I just felt better. It was a slight difference in feeling but enough to notice. It didn't fix all my problems, but coupled with other small lifestyle changes I started around that time I began to lose weight.

It was an adjustment, learning what else to drink besides soda was not easy at first. I'm constantly having to remind my family I don't drink soda because everyone does in their mind. I drink coffee, water, or tea now. If I get sick I may drink sprite but that's the only time I break that rule.

The thing I mentioned before about getting used to the taste of diet coke, it's like that with giving up soda. You make the decision and you can and will get used to it. Making changes like this has a huge psychological factor to it. When giving something up I'd say it's a good idea to only do one big change at a time and focus on that till you get used to it.  I decide 'this is how it's going to be now' and practice it. In time you will get used to the new habit, but at first it takes dedication until the taste is acclimated or the behavior is learned. I have found its like that with any change to my behavior.

So yeah, give it a go for a bit (like a couple weeks), see if you notice any changes. Not everyone reacts to everything the same way, you may not have any issues at all. All I know is giving it up has benefitted me and I'm glad I gave it up. Fat doesn't make you fat, carbs don't make you fat, protein doesn't make you fat.

Eating too much makes you fat.

Does the amount of rice you're eating fit into your energy requirements? If it does, it doesn't matter.I think this same thing will be happening tomorrow. My Biology teacher said she was bringing in doughnuts for the class on Friday. 2 classes in a row and I have to resist these doughnuts. I can do it though! My fitbit should be arriving via Amazon today as well! Excited!Well, I'm certainly new, and I certainly know that I dont want to be removing lifting either! XD

But the number is interesting, I'm at 265 and MFP just reduced my calorie count to 1800.... which would imply that yours would be more like 1200-1500? That's a guess, I'd have to find a calculator to figure it out but.. just words for thought!

I dunno how much you burn lifting though, if it's in the 300-600 range (which isn't too difficult to do) then... I think you're good in that range. When I get to my goal weight, then we will see about cutting diet coke.

In the mean time, it is my only joy in my diet. Personally I'd do the filet. You can ask them to skip the demi glace, I'm not sure what the calories for that sauce is, but in general, sauces in restaurants are very, very, very caloric. Red meat can often feel rather indulgent even though it's really not as high-calorie as dieters' loyalty to boneless skinless chicken breasts might make you think, and grilled asparagus is a) tasty as hell and b) less likely to be loaded with hidden calories.

Especially consider how the chicken breasts are both sauteed (so add a chunk of calories there) and come with both prosciutto and boursin, high calorie additions, *and* you're not sure what's in the "Lemon Confetti Vegetable Sauce."

The swordfish is another good pick, but research calories in coulis and couscous before you commit to it, and know that lots of restaurants add butter to couscous.

Enjoy! The prawn cocktail is a *great* pick for an appetizer (and plenty of cocktail sauces are actually rather light!) and know that one meal isn't going to fuck you over long-term. Just do your best. If you gain a few pounds overnight, don't worry, it's probably just water retention as restaurants tend to be rather salt-heavy. Two people today who are still the wieght of 3 people each . It's too bad about that coat.. is that leather? Looks expensive.  Maybe the IRS will let you write that off because it'll be useless pretty soon.Hahaha, I know exactly what you mean. I definitely don't want to cut out lifting!
I usually eat between 1500-1800 calories a day. So I hope that is the right amount.Rice is probably the most useless food in western cuisine IMHO.I'm right there with a lot of you. Back in 2009 I lost 98 pounds while on WeightWatchers and was going to the gym regularly. I got down to my lowest ever adult weight at 219lb and was feeling the best I had ever felt. Not long after that milestone I began to let things slip and I gained back all the weight I had lost plus an extra 70lbs. By early 2014 I was weighing in at just under 400lb and was mentally/emotionally/physically exhausted and miserable.

I think one of the biggest contributors to gaining the weight back was not being able to sustain my healthy habits in the midst of a fairly chaotic daily routine. At the time I was working retail hours and commuting 45 minutes or more to work each day. It became easy to eat gas station food while driving to and from work and letting my work schedule give me an excuse to skip workouts.

Fast forward to May 2014....I'm no longer working retail and I no longer have to commute to work. My schedule had become very routine and predictable and so when I decided to start making healthy choices again there was less resistance in my life toward my new habits. In May I walked a local 5K Fun Run/Walk and joined MyFitnessPal. With MFP helping me track calories and set goals and an exercise plan that steadily evolved over several months...I have lost 182lb (and counting)....have surpassed the low weight that I reached in 2009...and feel the best I've ever felt. I've also gotten into running and am signed up for a bunch of 5Ks and even a half marathon in late May!

I kept most of the clothes I bought back in 09 and it's been a real reward being able to dig those out and start wearing them again. Also seeing photos of myself at a lower weight was a big motivator for me to get healthy again.

I still deal with food problems but I feel like I'm better equipped to weather the storms that come along now. Best of luck to everyone working through this stuff....it's not an easy journey, I can attest. I am a food addict.  I am a compulsive binge eater.  There is very much a high that goes with it.  The anticipation.  'Oh God, this is going to be amazing.  I *need* it.'  It's all you can think about.  Your heart beats faster.  You scarf it down.  You're painfully full.  You feel like shit and you're disgusted with yourself.  Why did I do that?? Why do I keep doing this to myself? I'll never do this again... The tomorrow come and the cycle repeats.

I get it.  My highest weight was 360.  I was able to get down to 300 by just cutting sodas and fast food for every meal.  I lost 40 lbs doing low carb.  The lowest weight I've seen in a long ass time was 259.6.  Wow.  I was so proud of myself.  I told myself that I was doing so good that I *deserved* that pizza.  I *earned* that sugary iced coffee.  Once you pop it, you can't stop it.  A little bit of that pizza and sugary drink is like a little bit of heroin to your friend.  I gained back 30 lbs in 6 months.

So what do you want to live for?  Food?  Does food *really* make you happy?  Or does it fulfill something for a period of time and then leaves you feeling depressed and empty?  I'm willing to bet it's the latter.  You don't want to be a fat ass.  You just want your drug of choice.  The only problem with being addicted to food is that you still have to eat.  So are you willing to let food run your life? Or are you going to break your addiction?Bingo! Addressing the root of their eating patterns is the one thing most people skip, so they find themselves back to square one over and over again. Congrats for having the awareness to realize what was going on and aiming to make your healthy changes permanent. That's an amazing gift to give yourself! Happy birthday! And You've been inspirational to me- I was feeling super bummed and tempted to give up because I've been plateauing for the past 5 days, and you've encouraged me to keep going. As a funny anecdote: I gained ~10 lbs in 3 months eating nothing but raw foods and cooked rice/potatoes. (Yes I was one of those people for a while...but I'm sane now, I promise). So, yeah it happens. I ate A LOT.Very interesting, do you have any reference for this?Great job! I know how hard it is to be motivated to work out instead of numbing your depression and anxiety with food and booze. Good luck in the future!Thanks.  I did feel better and actually got a great nights sleep. I'm gonna keep that community clip handy. Definitely lifted my spirits and gave me a push. Not one piece in the outfit I am currently wearing is from the plus sized section.Slow and steady wins the race ....and stays a winner. The slower your weight loss, the more likely the habits that helped you get there will stick. So hang in there!As long as I have the budget for rice/past/what have you, and I'm eating vegetables and proteins in healthy quantities, then I feel no guilt eating it. I just make sure I weigh everything before cooking (plan for no leftovers) so that I don't eat too much.&gt; more calories "attached" to them

???
Ummm...no?Holy fuck dude, what a transformation. You are amazing, thank you for sharing your story!I honestly don't see carbs as pure evil, I just associated higher calories with carbs. I rarely have (white) potatoes/rice/ect but when I do I know what I'm getting myself into because I know they won't fill me up like 200 calories of meat/ect would do but when I choose to have rice, I usually have a good reason. For example, if I have some sort of curry...rice is a must...or if I'm making some sort of soup/stew/roast that just wouldn't be the same without potatoes. For me it's all about opportunity cost, what you give up in order to do something else (in this case: what food you give up if you are going to eat rice)


THE ONLY way to gain fat is to eat 3,500 calories over your **maintenance/BMR calories** . So lets assume your BMR is 2,000 (which is pretty average), you would need to eat 5,500 cal to gain a pound (at least in a given day). Your weekly BMR would be about 14,000 (7 days x 2,000 calories), so you would need to eat 3,500 calories on top of that to gain a pound of fat in a week. So generally, no...a little bit of rice won't make the least bit of difference in your diet UNLESS you eat so much rice/other food where you eat over your BMR.

Edit: for clarity.I just said I did this before. I kept the weight off for a full year and never went above 250. I don't know why everyone hopes I fail. I see a lot of people putting weight loss on some kind of pedestal, thinking it's a magic bullet that will makes their lives perfect once they lose all the excess weight.

It's not.

I WILL change your life in many ways - provided you do the work to make the changes happen. What it won't do is change who you are.

I've lost excess weight twice so far, and the first time was harder for me, but the second time was more excruciating emotionally. I felt regret and hopelessness mostly, for letting myself regain all the weight I had worked so hard to lose, and more. I was so stuck in my binging habits that I had resigned myself to being fat forever.

I gave away all my 'skinny' clothes, feeling like those days were gone permanently.

My turnaround came when a close friend asked me "Have you given up on yourself?" She noticed that all I ever wore were old, baggy clothes.

I had just turned 30.

Something in me snapped. Not at her, but at myself. From feeling resigned, I became angry. I was deeply unhappy and knew I didn't want to live that way for the rest of my life.

So I decided to change. Again. I knew it was going to be a shit load of hard work, but it was do the work or be unhappy for the rest of my life. I knew I was capable of so much more than that.

So I started the next day. I started eating right, exercising again, got rid of the "life got in the way" excuses, and just did what I needed to do.

Now I'm a personal trainer and food coach, and am helping others help themselves.

I won't lie - it's hard work to get into the shape you want and maintain your good health. It takes conscious effort every single day. But it's worth it.

If you're in that dark, hopeless place, know that you CAN get out of it. All you have to do is put one foot in front of the other and never give up.
It's the same for me. What really fucking blows is that in the last few months, my cycles have gotten really short. I seriously am dealing with PMS every 2-/12 to 3 weeks, along with the 5 pound weight gain and lots of facial break-outs. By the time those heal, I'm getting new ones!

I guess it's my IUD.

It does go away, but Christ it's discouraging to know I work *so hard* at keeping my calories in check and the scale goes up anyway. Diuretics and caffeine don't seem to help at all. Running does wonders for the body, stress and soul. Keep it up!Hey, that's hard work. And it's truly the key to success: figuring out how to make these things work. I have that scale too and love it!Do you need to order an "entree"? Sometimes the appetizer options are just as delicious as the entrees and open up your meal options. Just a thought!Really any of these could be fatty and probably are. It doesn't seem like they're steaming anything...so yeah.  If you want something low-cal from that list above, you are going to have to ask for them to alter the preparation or ask for substitutions. Remember, they are a restaurant that is trying to serve yummy food, and the general public thinks yummy=fatty and salty.
I would suggest the filet mignon without the demi glace (or maybe just ask for less of the demi glace...because demi glace is yummy but they are probably going to drench it if you don't say anything). Then if it were me, I would just pull off the bacon from the filet...it's not even very good anyway.This.Yay! Good job!From my understanding and anecdotal experience, excessive carb intake can cause you to retain a little water, which will make the scale look a bit higher.  But as long as you are running an equal caloric deficit, the amount of fat on your body will drop at the same rate, pretty much regardless of macros.  Now, there are great reasons to make sure you are getting an adequate mix of macronutrients, but fat loss is Calories In minus Calories Out, plain and simple.Damn. I had already been cutting back on diet sodas over the last few months (6-12 cans a day to 0-4 a day) but this makes me want to cut back more. I think I'm going to target 0-4 a week as my next goal.. eventually 0 should be fine.Let me tell you. Drunk me's stomach knows NO BOUNDS.

I applaude you - it's so hard to do! Nice work! I'm on my thrid go around. When I was 18 I went from 260, all the way to 190 at 6'3. Gained it all back after several years. Decided to try HCG 3 years ago. Went from 250 to 205. Gained all that back since I started eating like garbage again after I finished. Now I'm trying again. Went from 250 in mid-January to 217 as of today. I'm getting there, but yeah it's not nearly as fun as that first go. I have discovered at 6'3, I had way better luck with women as a fatty.Dude, congratulations. That's awesome. I'll drink a diet Dr. Pepper occasionally (maybe 2-20oz bottles a month, if that?) for the delicious taste and the caffeine kick.  I've never been a huge soda drinker.  I don't feel any kind of crazy cravings when I drink it.  I stick with water mostly.  Water with flavorings too.  And caffeine, sugar-free fruity teas (I do add Splenda).  Those help me feel fuller, longer.  Something about the warm tea that cold or semi-cold water just doesn't achieve.

I'm with you on the salad thing too.  It's really hard to feel like you're not depriving yourself of yummy, not-so-good-for-you food.  I have been on a salad kick lately, but I try to make my salads fun with different tasting vinaigrette or salad stuff.  So far, so good.I went from 157 to 140, and have since gained 35 pounds and am at 175.  It is so defeating and makes it even harder to motivate myself.  I too have just lost 5, but it feels like such a minuscule victory compared to what I was losing before and especially in light of still weighing more than I did when I originally started losing weight.  Here's to taking it slowly and trying not to give up this time!  Glad to know that so many others struggle with the same issue.Keep at it brother!Romaine salads with lite Ceasar dressing (45 calories per serving) have been our saving grace. We usually pair our meals with a salad to get that full feeling and to get some green in our diets.Thank you!  I think I'll just try to stay working in the yard outside as much as possible to resist temptation.  I also have to work tomorrow and Saturday at my second job which is very active.  I'll do my best!I don't really concern myself much with the chemicals. Almost everything you eat has chemicals in it to enhance or preserve. Also, clickbait articles generate 5 new ways to die of cancer every day.

I do not, however,  like the amount of caffeine I ingest when I'm constantly drinking diet soda.

So the soda I most frequently buy is called Diet Rite. It's calorie, caffeine, and sodium free (absolutely 0 of each). Also, it's sweetened with sucralose, if you're scared of aspartame.

**Disclaimer:** I don't recommend using any drink as a substitute for good ole water. I use diet soda very similarly to a snack. It's a once a day kind of thing. I find that if I fill up on soda, I often neglect to drink enough water and eat at appropriate times, because I feel full.
Congrats!  Keep up the good work.  We're all pulling for you!What are banana cakes? Do you have a recipe?!

I like to freeze bananas, mash them (after slightly defrosting), add PB2 and some chocolate chips. Yum.Its very sustainable, I have done it since december and im down 60 lbs and feel great.  Not everyone is mentally weak or soft.Oh and here I was about to suggest carbonated water with a "splash" of fruit juice or the la croix stuffI'm new, so it's probably not worth a lick of salt (which isn't that tasty anyways) but...

I'm assuming you recalculated your calorie intake at 220 when you hit it?
Have you tried to cut lifting out for now (building involves eating more calories, while you may be accounting for that in your calorie counting, perhaps there's some conflict here as to how much you are burning vs how much is being compensated?

Dont give up though! I'm no where near it, but I assume that the final leg of the journey is always going to be the toughest. My goal is first 230 then down to 200 so.. I'm sure I'll know the pain when it comes time.Today I'll eat my three weighed and measured meals and nothing in between.

Today I'll continue tracking in MFP at my new calorie deficit and will continue my 29 day streak of not exceeding my calorie limit.

Today I'll journal about possibilities for maybe one planned day of eating at maintenance calories in the next month or so.

Today I will have a rest day from walking after work.

Today I'll buy lots of fresh veggies and get to creating some mouth watering food in the kitchen.

Today I'll be emotionally gentle with myself, not overreact to miniscule things, and try to get a better perspective on things before forming my opinion.absolutely!Did 30 minutes on the elliptical and a few bicep curls. :)30,000?!  That's intense!Weekends are always hard for me unless I'm **really** busy, which seems to be a lot lately.  If I'm not busy, I'll try to pre-plan foods and snacks like it's any other day.  And if I'm feeling a craving for a snack, I stick with fruits or veggies.  And gum...and lots of water!

Good luck!  You got this!!No thanks. I hate cold coffee. Well, the most important thing is research, the more you learn, the more you can implement. Youtube videos are great because you can see other women doing the exercise. Google search articles and muscle anatomy. Just absorb as much information as you can until, you are confident enough to know that when you step into the weights area, you will know what you are doing.

Now that I've lost weight, I'm deathly afraid of eating carbs and irrationally think I'll gain it all back too. I was wondering where you were.  Sucks on the overeating calories, but just make today better! :)

And no, no one needs *that* much cheese.  =PI make oil-free banana cakes nearly daily. They're all pretty similar, but I do play around with making chocolate, coffee, carrot, blueberry lemon, etc versions. I generally top them with something or another. (Icing if I want a really desserty-dessert, something lighter like vanilla Greek yoghurt with a little extra sugar, banana puree with a bit of honey, or a drizzle of Nutella or peanut butter thinned with milk if I'm being "good".)

I feel like I'm having a decadent dessert every day, but it's actually exactly the same as if I were to eat an English muffin with some kind of sweet spread each morning -- except I definitely wouldn't have that "ooh, had dessert today, how nice!" feeling with that because it's been normalized into breakfast.Is it unusual for stoners to *not* have munchies?

I started smoking regularly around the same time I started working out and fixing my diet, but I've never had the cravings and I definitely don't lose any motivation to get things done -- if anything, I'm *more* productive, because I just get... calm. But I'm also eating better, sleeping better, exercising more. IDK. Maybe I'm just in the minority.Also, you can import recipes from websites by using the URL and it will search all the ingredients and you can just add a serving to your diary. I've had to make a couple of adjustments but it makes things a lot easier than searching ingredients up individually!I used to weigh almost exactly that much a couple years ago. Here I am now, on the verge of 299. It's entirely possible, you can do it!Rock On!Healthy foods will still make you gain weight if you don't monitor your intake. You really should track your daily meals to get an idea of how many calories you consume and try to make adjustments from there. A lot of people also can't really gauge a serving/ect very well from just looking at the food, especially with no prior knowledge/experience, I would suggest getting a food scale- they aren't very costly and can really help you out in figuring out portions. Smoothies are great, but be aware that pure fruit smoothies have a lot of sugar in them (and even more if you add juice), plus if you don't add any sort of protein (nuts/protein powder) then they might not be very filling. You could try experimenting with veggies in your smoothie, the basic beginner's ratio for smoothies is 1 cup veggies to 3 cups fruit &amp; 1-2 cups of liquid (ie. 1 cup packed spinach, 1 cup chopped banana, 2 cups strawberries, 2 cups water/milk/coconut water/ect with a scoop of vanila or chocolate protein powder). I honestly try to stay away from all juices because the sugar content is so high.


A big part of dieting is also psychological...and you need to be happy for a diet to really be successful. For me, I do really like food and it would be a psychological blow to me if I couldn't at least somewhat enjoy my favorite things from time to time so I have never cut anything out of my diet but remain mindful of my daily calories. Make sure you have a healthy body AND mind.


As far as the gym membership goes, I'm a firm believer in home workout...it's just easier and cheaper. I can get home, let my dog out and go change into exercise clothing while he does his business, take my dog for a walk and then get home and do a strength workout in the privacy of my own living room primarily using my own body weight instead of equipment. However, gyms are for some people where home workouts are for others- I just wanted to mention it because you shouldn't feel like you HAVE to get a gym membership to exercise.

EDIT: sorry for the essay, I hope this helps!Keep on keeping on, man. Things will get better. Look at this way, proper diet and exercise, if it's the only positive thing, is at least one positive thing.

Trust me, I've been there. Divorce, loss of a lot of friends during it, loss of job at the same time, I felt like I had absolutely nothing. I could've given up, but I picked myself up and focused on the one thing I could control and it has paved a path to many many good things along the way. Today, I couldn't be happier.

So keep that chin up, and do some chin ups.83 pounds in 4 months? HOLY CRAP! That's pretty amazing.

Good luck on the final stretch! YOU GOT THIS!Well, it makes sense to me.  If you're just working your heart on a bike, elliptical, or treadmill, your legs will get stronger but you're not building muscle anywhere else, so you'll just burn fat everywhere on your body and everything will shrink.  It's like people who think they'll get rid of belly fat by doing tons of situps or crunches.  The body will take fat from everywhere, not just the area you're working on.Both seem like good things to keep you going! Good luck and keep up the hard work!

I started at 263 and my goal is also 185. I'm about halfway there, so I know how hard it can be, but it's worth it!I didn't weigh everything before and just ballparked it, but I recently bought myself a digital food scale. After using it for a few days I noticed I had really been underestimating a few things - chicken breasts for example, I had been guessing they were about 5 oz but then I weighed one and it was 12 oz!! So yes, I would recommend getting one!Use the MFP recipe maker. Enter in every single ingredient that you use and put in the number of servings it is. It saves for future use and you can edit it later as well. I do this for all of my home cooked meals. It's time consuming the first time, but is there for next time.

I weigh everything. [I have this scale](http://www.amazon.com/Ozeri-Digital-Multifunction-Kitchen-Elegant/dp/B004164SRA/ref=lp_289787_1_1?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427141960&amp;sr=1-1). It's less than $20 and does the trick.I definitely understand this. It's tough because there is a common message that people should care about you as a person more than your looks, but the reality is hard to deny sometimes. A sense of humor, a good career, or a great personality are all desirable traits people claim to rank higher than looks, but the real world results some times don't match up.

Good luck with the abs, that's definitely on my list of goals after I lose another 30 or so pounds.For real. My generation is going to die super young if things don't change. Body acceptance is great and all, but saying "HEALTH at every size..." well that's a load of bull.Thank you for sharing :) I've just started going through Byron Katie's work, and am finding the steps very practical. They make you realise just how unruly your thoughts be, and how much damage they can do when you let them control you.

Hats off to you for not taking the Xanax, opting to work through your thoughts first, and taking control of your diet and body. I find those to be amazing tools in improving my moods, self-confidence and happiness as well, and they put me in a much better place. I'm less likely to let myself go to a bad place when I take care of myself.

I'm way, way better than I was years ago, thankfully. Thank you, and I hope things keep getting better for you too!

I know fear will always be there....I've figured out that we've just got to learn to turn it into something productive rather than drown in it or get paralyzed by it.Growing up, my grandfather was a MAJOR supporter of "finish your plate or you're not allowed to leave the table" and since the idea was drilled into me as a child, I've been struggling with it as an adult.  But last night I felt full, and I didn't feel like I had to eat the entirety of the meal. I want you to know that we are seriously all crazy proud of you!! This brought tears to me eyes!!! KEEP GOING!! :) You got this!! Yay!  Way to go!You've lost me plus one guinea pig!!That's awesome!  Keep doin' your thing!If I were in your shoes (and I was), I would shoot for closer to the 2,000 mark.  If you're a little under some days, that's totally fine.  But when you plan your meals, I'd aim for 2,000.  But for me, too much of a feeling of hunger all the time makes it less sustainable, I think.  As you lose weight, your body will need less food, and you can decrease that target to keep the same deficit (most of the apps calorie counting apps will do this for you).

But I agree with UnaBarbaAzul that the exactly number doesn't matter too much.  Make sure you're eating at a deficit, make sure your macros are reasonable (protein-heavy is how I would go, especially when considering muscle), and keep it up with the walking or whatever exercise is working for you.Yep. I used Medifast to lose about 70 lbs over 6 months in 2012. I was feeling great, but the food was too expensive to keep up and I was sick of frankenmeals. So I told myself I would "eat sensibly." Three years later, nearly all the weight is back (I regained 60-65 lbs).

This time, I'm working out 4-5 hours a week and counting calories. So far, I'm losing slower, but I feel better about my method.Yay.
Today I will eat less than 1500 calories.
I will log everything into mfp.
I will not eat fast food!
And I will only drink water. :)[So the idea of replacing every pound of lost fat with exactly one pound of muscle will be essentially impossible for the intermediate/advanced trainee.  Theres simply not enough fat/the fat cells dont want to give up their calories and the ability to stimulate rapid muscle gains isnt there any more.](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/adding-muscle-while-losing-fat-qa.html/)Someone once told me that smoking weed increases your metabolism. I don't know if this is actually true, but if you can resist eating, you may be burning even more calories than if you were sober!*


^*Again, ^I ^have ^literally ^no ^idea ^if ^this ^is ^true, ^and ^researching ^on ^my ^work ^computer ^seems ^like ^a ^bad ^idea, ^so ^let's ^just ^pretend/assume ^it ^is.Yes food "addiction" is chemical, it affects the same neurotransmitters in the brain as drugs of abuse do. Your body is naturally wired to seek out dense calorie sources and you are rewarded biochemically for doing so.
I also think that some people are more predisposed to issues with food than others, due to some sort of imbalance in this reward system. This is also true for drug addiction: some people are predisposed towards drug addiction.
The problem is that humans have increased the calorie density and the palatability of different foods, and the availability and the affordability of these foods as well. To add to this, our reward systems cannot distinguish between these foods and the natural foods that we would have sought in the past.
I'm not even against the processing of foods (to a point), but I think that it has gone too far, and plays a big role in worldwide obesity problems.

If you want to be science-y about it here's a review article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057652/
For a normal sized person, you can either lose fat or gain muscle. You need excess calories to build muscle, and some of that will be stored as fat.  But for an overweight person, you can lose fat and build muscle since your body has the excess calories needed to build muscle stored.

I have had success losing weight with a mix of weightlifting 4-5 times a week with light cardio, on a caloric deficit. My muscles are growing and I have been gaining strength. Very true. I go through at least six cups of veggies and twp pieces of fruit a day. Not to mention at least 20 ounces of lean meat and I stay well below 1800 calories. I'm a daily stoner, if you keep fighting that munchie urge it goes away. Also, anything tastes good when you're stoned. Grab a salad with some protein and nom that shit down.Yah - I'm at 3L of water a day.  That was the first change I made - more water ALWAYS!
You can take my coffee from my cold, dead hands.Yeah, I'm doubtful that it will last.Currently at ~190lbs, 6ft tall. Would really like to get down to 183.9, Normal BMI. Also, hold myself accountable and do core workouts at home, planks, pushups, etc.

Also, enjoy the outdoor weather rather than chill inside as much as I have been.What a great idea!  I know many people are suggesting the chicken breasts, but with sides of prosciutto and boursin?  Who knows how fatty of a dish it could be?  Of course you don't need to eat everything on your plate, but it might be nice to get a side you can eat.Stories like yours are what convinced me to join reddit and r/loseit...  way to go man! keep it up!I think the FAQ says that pear etc isn't correct.

More muscle means burning more calories burned alright.Before you eat more, try eating better. Hundreds of calories of cookies are not the same nutritional value as hundreds of calories of vegetables and lean meat. I don't mean to suggest that either of you are eating poorly, but some people really don't realize how much better good foods will make you feel.Hello everyone, today I'm with you as always :)

* I will hit 30,000 steps today
* I will stay within my calorie goal

Time to have a great 24 hours!I think Midol is supposed to mitigate some bloating from water retention, so maybe look into that?  It could possibly be from the caffeine, so maybe taking a caffienated multivitamin would help on your days before your week.I haven't reached a plateau yet but I expect one soon and that's when I'll stop worrying about muscle recovery and do cardio everyday to burn the rest of the fat off. Right now I just do strength training with mild cardio in between. I've tried using myfitnesspal on and off for a few years. My previous frustration was that it was so hard to account for meals you make at home since it didn't have an option for a bunch of ingredients. I just looked at it and saw they added that option, so I guess I'll have to give it another go. Now the struggle will be trying to figure out amounts of servings of ingredients per ingredient. Do you weigh everything?Now I am totally confused, do you have any reference for this?You're amazing! Do that thing!I will walk around more at my volunteer job, I will log all my calories and stay under 1200, and I will avoid all sweets
.Makes a lot of sense actually. Great find!Great point. I looked at the numbers closer this morning and saw that my blood sugar was perfect. Diabetes runs in my family and I was sprinting to early onset diabetes with the choices I was making. I still have work to do, but so glad not to have to worry about that one for now.You have no idea how much i needed to hear this from someone else.  I have lost 35 pounds since around christmas.  I weigh on fridays, but I set a goal to be 10 pounds down each month.  So, last friday I was 269 (ahead of schedule!) and on 4/1 I was back to 274.  My head knows that there's no way I gained 5lbs but my heart doesn't.  I'm with you.... just going to keep plugging away at the gym and with mfp and physics say it has to happen.

Thanks, /u/timberrrrrrrr you made my day.I like an occasional diet coke/coke zero. I drink about a gallon of water a day so a little diet soda isn't going to hurt me :)You like chicken wings? I like chicken wings. Have you looked into a ketogenic diet?

And I hear ya on the simplicity of it all! I used to hear people talking about "counting macros" and it sounded like a bunch of annoying math.(which was always extra stupid b/c I'm great at math) I would just tell myself "i'll eat less and exercise more and whatever!" and then wonder why nothing worked long term. It's all about taking the time, breaking it down, figuring out the in's and out's and then simply doing it.

**And I'm glad you're doing it!**Me too. Shame lurking here. I lost 20 pounds from September - November of Last year and I've gained it all plus 5. (having trouble editing my flair back.) I hate everything. I feel enormous and miserable and frustrated, but by the time I work 40 hours every week, and eat like crap because I'm stressed out of my mine and too worn out to cook when I get home and I want to see my family at the end of the day and we all sit around like slugs on the sofa because we are literally exhausted... and my options are ignore my family and work out by myself or see my family and sit on the couch... ... ... seriously. So frustrating. And then people are like "Lose weight with these 10 easy tips!" and the tips are like "Eat vegetables!" and "Cut out soda!" ... and you're just like "thanks for nothing. Must be nice to make some "simple swaps" and drop 40 pounds. I'll just be over here with my self loathing chocolate bar because giving up. -.-

And I know, I know, Calories in &lt; Calories out = weight loss and being fat is slowly killing you and etc, etc, etc. I'm just frustrated and discouraged and having trouble getting back up on the horse. I've been gaining and losing the same 20 pounds my entire life and gradually creeping up the scale as I do it. It would be nice, someday to just wake up and not have to battle the scales. To just eat normally like normal people do and be happy about myself and not have to be afraid that I'm going to get diabetes or drop dead of a heart attack because I'm a short female that apparently needs literally 1200 calories a day or I'm going to skyrocket up another 20 pounds.

Kudos to you for getting back at it! I know when you set your mind to it you see results. I'm trying to get back to where you are, I'm just so frustrated. &gt;.&lt;1000 calories a day is too low for you. I would NOT dip under 1200 calories. Please consider upping your calories and taking care of your body. You didn't put the weight on overnight and you shouldn't try to lose at an unsustainable rate. 1-2lbs is a healthy rate of loss! I will gladly help you calculate a healthy deficit if you'd like me to. I guess aim for baby steps. Lots of little steps lead to big changes. You have to do what works for you. Good for you for getting to the gym, and staying close to your limit! And read the FAQ! :)[A Study shows that Diet Soda puts on more belly fat than those who don't](http://news.nationalpost.com/life/food-drink/people-who-drink-diet-soda-put-on-three-times-as-much-belly-fat-as-those-who-dont-study-says)

But I would say stay away from All soda. In fact, Stay away from all drinks other than water IMO. Maybe some green tea (no sugar) if you feel like it helps you.Thank you for the support. I do have a slow cooker. Still can't roll with it. It's not so much that i hate cooking as i hate planning/prepping.

I have tracked my food online for about ten years. Always enter it the best I can even if I'm eating like 3K caloreis in a day.

My problem is I **know** the right stuff to do. It's just doing it. Anyway, day one in and I went to the gym, did go over my calorie alotment but just barely.We already speak on the phone quite a lot. If I lived anywhere near her, I'd take her walking every day. Hell, I'd cook her meals for her if I could.

You're probably right about the stress cycle at play here. :( This is very demotivating. But thanks for your suggestions; I appreciate it.Which still could be much worse The reason it recommends so much is because of danger of malnutrition if you aren't eating enough. It recommends 2400 for me at 300 to lose 100 pounds in a year. I'm having trouble the other way now that I'm paying attention to what I eat so I'm usually around 1800 for the day. Be sure you're getting enough nutrients and if you start to feel tired all the time make sure to start eating a bit more. Hey, just remember. It took you years to get to your worst, it will take you years to get to your best. In a year three months of making healthy changes will seem to have just blinked by. Keep up the great work!Gut health is becoming more important to me as I age, so this is good to know.  I've heard bubble water (i.e. LaCroix) is bad for that too though - and I'm not about to give that up.
That's an awful lot of soda - I'm at 2 cans of diet coke or A&amp;W per day at most.  Sounds like you really needed to break away from it.I don't love sugar free jello either - it's too cloyingly sweet for me.  I also don't like jello full stop because it's made out of horses and that bums me out.
You can eat the healthiest foods and still gain weight if your total calories are too high. You need to track them and you will find where the problem is, it can be a real eye opener. Try myfitnesspal.I like this response.  A lot of my changes have been made to avoid being resentful.  For example, I hate salads as a mealbecause they make me feel like I'm being deprived if that's all I'm eating (versus having a salad as part of a meal).  So I bring a chicken breast and spinach to work and heat it up for lunch - it's essentially a salad but by warming it up, it's like a hot meal and the resentment is gone.  Woohoo!! Awesome! Congrats!Yep, I lost over 100 lbs at one point a couple years ago but slowly put it back on. I'm not quite at my highest (I was at 395 - now I'm at 380 again) but it is depressing that I managed to put it all back on when I was at 280. I'm a fairly big guy at about 6"3' and really wide uh, structure? so my ideal goal weight was only 240-250 and I was almost there. Then depression kicked in again and yada yada ate more gained weight ect. Trying to build up the "umph" to start going to the gym again and getting it back off. You're not crazy! haha; it hasn't always been this way. I can't remember exactly when the hidden score change for comments first started... maybe about 6 months ago?Boom. This right here Originally? "Why?"I sure will! That is amazing! Great job!!!!!Great work and happy birthday!I watched someone who had to be in their fifties lose his fight to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease because he didn't lose the weight.  That was a very real wake up call for me.Regained 75. Easier than you think - you swear never again but loss, moving, stress can do more than you think to those new habits.  Starting over. I believe it is an addiction for me but the food/weight is a symptom.  I am also a recovering you name it (30+ years) and the parallels between the addictions and the downward spiral are the same for me.  The 12 step programs are a must for me.  I don't care what others think, this has been my personal experience.  Best of luck.water +gum helps so muchNo problem :) Here is the thing, you can't add muscle without adding fat. It's funny how much of a difference a half pound can make in how you feel!

Especially when you realize that you were probably eating 4-6 times that weight for each meal. I have no thoughts on soda.  I only ever drink it with vodka, maybe once a year.  Whatever works for you.* I will stay under my calorie goals today.
* I will stay under my calorie goals for the long weekend.  This one is most important.  My first weekend!
[Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7521/abs/nature13793.html)

Your microbiome is so important to your overall health, it's enough for me to have zero soda at all. (Haven't had a soda in 4 years now)New season on Netflix! Watching it now. Fuckin colonel is a dick.wearing a shirt I haven't been able to fit into for about 8 years, updated my flair and  I feel amazing. This sub is amazing. It literally changed (and saved) my life.
It isn't a coincidence that all the HAES followers are either young or constantly at the doctors.It's not a scientific journal, but it makes sense...

[Click Me!](http://www.livestrong.com/article/500114-can-losing-weight-raise-your-cholesterol-temporarily/)Have you tried adding strength training to alter your composition? I've heard great things about it and am currently trying it myself.
It could be too that your reduced intake plus intense exercise may be taxing your system more than you know (especially if you have a very stressful life outside of all of this). I mean you say intensively but we don't know how long you mean and what you are doing so it is hard to analyze.You gained 40 pounds by eating about 140,000 more calories than you used over that period of time.

Track your calories. That will guide you to success. You can do this.I'm still drinking it, not proud.  It may be for the caffeine.  Eventually....Lolll ok, enjoy gaining it all back when you stop crash dieting.I don't understand all the commotion over it. It's colored bubble water with artificial sweeteners. If you like it drink it, if you don't then don't. This "chemical" nonsense is mostly (totally?) bullshit. Maybe some scientific basis but totally exaggerated for clickbait.

The real mystery is why people here hate carbonated water with artificial sweeteners (diet soda), but love gelatenized water with artificial sweeteners (sugar free jello). I'm guessing it's just because being anti-soda is the cool thing to do...not for any sensible reason.You'll be happy to know that I began today. Instead of getting some for breakfast after dropping my nephew off at school I got up earlier and made breakfast. Eggs, a slice of toast, and cantaloupe. I know it's just one meal but at least I started. That is the best feeling in the world! Congratulations!I think it's just our bodies being our bodies.  Mine isn't so drastic, but I do feel it a little.  At least the weight all comes off the next week.  I would say limiting sodium would probably help.  I usually have a pretty low sodium diet as it is, and I think it helps.  Also, just being gentle with yourself at that time is a good practice--it's something you don't have full control over, so let it take it's course, and enjoy the major dropping of pounds when the water weight does come off.This sounds like me! I eat at a significant deficit and work out 5 times a week, but I only see a drop on the scale 2-3 times a month. Not as satisfying as it could be, but everyone's bodies are so different when it comes to losing weight.Same, but 220.

Been here for a few months. Just can't seem to get over it.I don't know how true it is, but I've heard that you burn more calories weight-training than you do with just cardio because your muscles continue burning calories well after you leave the gym. If you just do cardio alone, you won't really change shape, just get smaller. If you're a big pear, you just become a smaller pear. With weights, you build muscle at the same time that you lose fat. I have no idea if this is all true,  but it makes sense to me at least. I drink it with my dinner and don't see any increased sugar cravings. IDK. I know a lot of people say to just cut it out, but I think I'd get too resentful.There will come a point (maybe you have reached it) where it's just part of what happens.

I don't even think about it now; I just go to the gym after work every day.Doh, it was Lyle, no wonder I couldn't find it on google lol :) Thanks for the links!I've seen both studies that say it's good for diets and studies that say it causes weight gain.  I would say, like anything else, it's fine in moderation.Congratulations!!!  Today I will log every calorie into MFP, and stay at/near/under my calorie goal.  I will go to T.O.P.S. and be weighed.  I did it. Currently back in "lose it" mode.

When I was 15 or so, I weighed &gt; 330 pounds. I lost all of it and got down to 170 pounds. In high school, obviously, we spent a lot of time just sitting around in classes. So I thought that was a good accomplishment.

Then when I started college,  I had my own version of the freshman 15 ... I dropped 20 pounds just because I was walking *everywhere*. It was about 6 to 8 miles a day.

Kept it off through college.

Kept it off the first two years after college. Mainly because I had pretty physical jobs.

Then I got my current job. Office job. Sedimentary. And within walking distance was, literally, every fast food joint imaginable. Combine that with living with someone who uses so much butter that it would freak out Paula Dean ...

I put on a lot of it. Ended up right back at 300 pounds. It was so slow that I didn't really recognize it.

Finally ended up in the hospital. Nearly gave myself heart failure.

I'm back down to 220. Have been for 5 months. Can't seem to break the plateau.You guys know there are strains where it doesn't have that extreme need to snack effect?  I'm no marijuanologist but there are a lot of resources out there depending on where you live.

Consequence of restrictive pot laws...I can't get the right strain and am forced to take what I can get!  I did this before when I was at 322 for 5 months and got to 255. I felt great the entire time, light, awake, and full of energy.

I know what I'm doing.No I totally agree, and if you're logical about it you can brush it off, but logic evades many people trying to lose weight :)  So then they do more, they eat less, they work out more and the result is that it just compounds the problem. Then they throw in the towel, all illogical but that's often the headspace people are working in

http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/why-big-caloric-deficits-and-lots-of-activity-can-hurt-fat-loss.html/I went from 280 to 180.... back to 250.  I am now in the early stages of getting back to dieting and regular exercise.  What sucks is that I have forgotten how I did it before (Exercise wise).  I attribute quite a bit of this to work/stress, and have made steps towards finding a new job or new position that would allow for me to be more regular.

I am looking forward to getting back on it.Hi everybody - I missed you all yesterday. I also overate by about 450 calories yesterday. I believe the two are related!

* I will get in a workout at lunch, even if it's just a quick one.

* I will stay within my calories for the day.

* I will have a reasonable supper instead of having nachos for the third night in a row. Even if they fit into my calories, nobody needs that much cheese!

* I will pack healthy snacks for my weekend away!

Good luck all. Happy Thursday.I have put on 84 pounds in the last year, I lost my job and got depressed no longer went to the gym or exercised 90% of my day was laying down, I honestly believe I would have had a heart attack this year if I carried on my bad behaviours my breathing hasn't been good either.  I only joined the gym 2 weeks ago but I have noticed a big difference.My sister and I both do weight watchers and she eats crap. Lean cuisine Mac and cheese, light white bread etc and isn't full and caves to cravings. Cut out those crazy processed foods and use them sometimes. Chicken, brown rice, tons of non-starchy veggies and some fruit. You can't be starving if you eat 4 cups of broccoli with some lean meat. I left soda behind two years ago and never plan on going back.  I feel much better without it.  It is always possible that the effects of diet soda are overstated.  The studies done are not always something you can trust, but that said....why risk it when water is healthier.  I used to drink about 2- 2Liters of soda a day.  Now I drink about a gallon of water a day.

I have noticed that I do not crave sweets that much anymore. That may be becasue I eat healthier overall. I am very proud of you stranger :) well done for going out there and getting the job done! My opinion is: Just cut it. It took me about 2-3 weeks with absolutely no soda, and then I didn't even want it anymore. I'm not totally convinced of the dangers of it, but I do know that water is much betterIt's absolutely unsustainable for you to be eating 1000 calories a day at your weight, espeially with added exercise. Eat enough food to fuel your body.Wow, you went full tough love. But it's good, I like it. As unhealthy as it may be, one way to get me fired up and motivated is to get a little pissed off. For example, 4 months ago I realized how addicted I was to soda. I craved it endlessly. Hot outside? Soda. Feeling slightly sleepy? Soda. Sun in my eyes? Soda. Then one day I got really pissed about it. Why did I let this drink that was horrible for me control me? Why was I practically paying for my corner store's owner's kid's college one soda purchase at a time? I got legitimately mad at both myself and the soda (I sound insane). I was so fired up about it I quit drinking it cold turkey. The first few weeks were hell as I went from 5-6 sodas a day to nothing. I knew that if I let myself have even a sip it'd be game over. 4 months later I have not touched a soda and drink nothing but water and the occasional sweet tea. I need to do the same with CFA. I am mad that I am so willing to be wasteful with my money and my body. I was always thin until a few years ago. Right now, I'm still a "healthy" weight but I can do better. I can be that fit, toned, healthy woman. The only thing stopping me is myself and fuck that. I will be better than this because I can be.

Congrats!! I probably have a few super old clothes tucked away in my closet too lol time for spring cleaning! Way to go momma! Glad you and your daughter had fun :)thanks for the advice! hopefully ill be able to keep it off* Stay positive.

* Go up stairs at work at least 12 times (beating yesterday).

* Eat more than 950 calories, but less than my limit.  (Didn't eat a lot of high calorie food yesterday.)

HAPPY THURSDAY!  Good luck everyone!i lost 80 several years ago and gained about 50 back. its very hard to maintain a strict level of self control for years on end. for me at least. there are so many ups and downs in life.Yeah, don't take the gym cookies! My gym has a pizza night and a bagel morning monthly and I don't understand. you're eating back more than your exercise- fine for people at maintenance but not for people trying to lose.

Anyways, congrats... it gets easier. I really need a selfies of shame folder though!I was 400 when I started, 25 lbs ago... can I be apart of the WOOOT Train?Yeah I did go to intense right from the startI am away at college and unable to go to the gym with my boyfriend currently. Otherwise, I am pretty useless in the weight room. I have no idea what I am doing there. Any tips on getting started?
Also, I can be pretty shy and the weight room is always filled with huge lifter guys and I get too embarrassed Me as well! Lost weight, gained it back after getting married and ended up my heaviest ever. Now i'm having to work on about 130lbs to lose. Started to work on losing again in February. I'm down 12.5lbs. It is slow going but I will get there!Nothing I do changes it, just lots of water and continuing to exercise. The exercise is crucial for me to stay positive about it because I can't help but be discourage by force of habit. The "woosh" of about 1-3 lbs is nice afterwards tho! Yup. Went from 210 down to 130 in less than a year from drastically under-eating and over-exercising. Met my boyfriend at 160 and within a couple years ended up at 220! Suffering from a back injury + spending a lot of time ordering pizzas and gaming with the bf really hit me hard.

Now I am down to 197 since January, and have to keep reminding myself that slow loss and small changes is the best way to do things, because the way I lost before was definitely not sustainable!

Some days the only "exercise" I do is 30 minutes of stretching because I am in a lot of pain, but that is still good to improve flexibility and helps with depression/anxiety, so every little thing is positive!Today I will log all my food in MFP and stay under my calorie goal.Thanks for posting, from someone with similar goal weight and a long way to go.I recently bought a scale so I will start weighing myself everyday. I have just been a little scared since I never like the number I seeUnfortunately, my school is not that advanced with equipment like that. I have taken pictures that I hope to share with you all once I lose some weight!I dropped about 50 lbs in 2002, gained 70 lbs and then some in 2007, lost 50 lbs in 2011, gained it back in 2013, and now I'm here. So, I guess this is round three for me.

I totally get what you mean about needing to feel like you're worth the effort of weight loss. People give the fat acceptance movement a really hard time, but I've found that I'm at my healthiest and most mindful of my eating when I'm hearing those stories of self-love and celebration. I know it is counterintuitive to some people, but the more I like my body, the more I want to care for it and treat it right.Out of curiosity, when did you start?Thanks for the tip! I know everyone is different but I love finding people my height/weight so I have something to losely gauge myself off of.
I thought about slowly decreasing calories, but the truth is, I was really hoping to shed the weight quickly (ie before summer) so I would rather just jump in. I am experiencing no "side effects" of eating less. In for answers, as I'm so interestedAgreed. 1/2 cup light frozen yogurt every night or a 100 cal bag of kettle corn! That definitely wasn't my intention, but if it came off that way I apologize. It was heat of the moment, I was very lethargic at the time, very sore, etc.

The doozy is, after pushing myself through my normal exercise routine I felt like a million bucks again, and still feel good today.Yes, there is, but there's also upvotes, down votes and people on every subreddit with differing opinions. A few people disagreeing with you is seriously not that big of deal, it's just fake Internet points.

Anyway, I disagree, I think marijuana is different for everyone. Some of us have some self control and are able to function high without downing 8 pizzas or wasting the day sitting on the couch. I'm not a weekend smoker either, but I still run or lift every day, go to school, teach a class, have a job, and have various research going on. There just seems to be less self control in this sub.I used a TDEE calculator I found on r/fitness. It gave me 1900 to maintain and 1603 as a 20% decrease (not absolutely positive on those numbers, but seems close). I recently used a new one I found and it gave me 1717 to maintain and between 1400-1100 to lose weight. Thanks for the tip, it is really hard to gauge where to begin.I think people were perhaps trying to support you, since your first sentence in that post was that what you were doing was not sustainable. Perhaps they were just agreeing.

I think you are looking for a fight. What was the caloric limit, if you don't mind my asking?
I'm very similar to you. I'll be 39 in May, and when I started limiting calories a month ago, I was around 425-435. That's an estimate, because my scale only goes up to 407.

I know that I've lost weight because my pants are already bunching up at the waist and I can't wear them without a belt.

I started using the Lose it app on the recommendation of a health coach, and when I entered in my information and goals ( 425 SW/240 GW) the app recommended 3500 calories per day. I changed that shit real quick to 1800 calories a day. I also do a cheat meal on Saturdays to maintain sanity.
Did your doc recommend a caloric goal near that?Hmmm you know, this may have happened to me, but I didn't think to link the two. I am one of those chronic plateau-ers - a week at the same weight then several days in a row I lose significant. The next time I'm hot during the night I'm going to see if it correlates.

Also - that article is interesting! I never thought to try to figure out why whooshes happen, but that totally makes sense.I have this same problem.. I do so well when I'm sober and when I'm high I could eat so much. My boyfriend is worse and can go through a party size bag of chips in a minute. I've found that the only thing I can do is drink water like it's my job and bring out the crunchy veggies (carrots, celery) or we'll undo all of our progress. Also, going for those stoned evening walks help to curb it as well. Good job on taking control, OP, and not letting the munchies get you.Awesome! Keep it up! Hi! I'm 5'5" and 132 right now. Your calorie goal of 1600 is a deficit but not a big one, only like a 200 calorie so it will take a little while. I use to be on the heavier-140, and MFP told me 1400 for my deficit so you can't be too far off. I would lower it, but not down to 1200, because you'll be hungry all of the time.

However, please note that you are also working out so weight loss will be lower if you are gaining muscle. Anyways, if you want to be friends on MFP since we have similar goals, my username is the same for my reddit username! Yes, I am using a food scale and using MFP. It was hard at first to track what i thought was the correct amount of food, but I have been using the scale for the past two weeks so i am sure the amount is pretty correct.I agree with the other commenters about change having to come from within.

If you think she eats too much when she is emotional or stressed, why not lend an ear to her once a week and let her vent or talk to you about what she's going through? Maybe venting can help lower her stress levels. Maybe you could casually ask her to join you doing some physical activity, but if she doesn't want to then don't push it. Just don't bring it up to her out of the blue. She most likely knows and that's probably adding on to her stress.im the other one!Congrats!! That's some great self control right there. But - this is your chance to up your food knowledge. Take a few minutes and just search for the calories of each of the main dishes - don't try to add in all of the extras, just get a good idea of the base of each dish. I am going to check out those fish options just so I know and can use it later.that gets a bit boring for me, like i mentioned, portioning isn't really appealing to me

but with fasting, i get to eat whatever i want the next day but still be in my tdee maintenance You own! Do you have MFP? It's so helpful for tracking calories :) my username is fastertori.I'm not a huge fish person so I don't know the calories of those from memory. If it were me I'd go with the chicken breast or the filet mignon - probably the filet mignon in this instance because it comes with a side of vegetables and you're less unsure of how they are going to saut that chicken.Are you trying to say your awesome progress with diet and gym has caused you to unintentionally lose the taste for unhealthy foods?  (Read that in Big Brother Australia's voice.)F, 171 cm/5'7". I know that's below BMI healthy range, but I'm still not at my best weight, I have a visible belly and quite a lot of extra fat on my thighs. That may be due to my small frame, my sister used to weigh 46 kg / 101 pounds, then she gained weight, and now weighs the same as me, has a visible gut and stretch marks. Even my personal trainer says that I should lose more.Thanks! It wasn't the best but glad I actually got out there and got it done!Rome wasn't built in a day! Although your calorie intake might be a little high, I'd try dropping it down 300-400 calories.  Keep your head up and keep on keeping on!Just keep telling yourself that its the end of the night and you dont need it. You will feel 100 times better the next morning and even more determined with the motivation of you not eating the night before!I smoke some really strong hash, after a couple of tokes im getting the munchies.


But ive come to realise that even a salad with some nice dressing is facking delicious.


Its wierd.I find when I want treats like that I have to log them well before I even eat them so I can see the impact they have on my daily calories. Does half of a cookie mean I can't eat anything the rest of the day? Then I'll pass. Does it fit in because I've had a really healthy lunch? Then I go for it! I definitely calculate things like this into my food choices.Says the person who doesn't think they are the problem. ;)

I gave you my thoughts.Wooooooooooo! Way to go buddy!I used to be really bad at it, ether ordering a big meal or sometimes a pizza to myself. But over the last few months I have really buckled down and kept telling myself that I need discipline, focus and determination to lose the weight.

Saying that, it doesnt mean I live a dry unfulling life of food now. You just need to pick your battles!I have the same concern, but I do a few things to combat it:

1) Pure self-control. I suck at this, but it's my first strategy. Just ignore the munchies.

2) Get distracted. It's super easy to forget I'm hungry if I distract myself with a video game, movie, reddit or some other passive activity. Just go start a YouTube binge session and forget about it.

3) Eat small things slowly. Apples, small amounts of cereal or a small half sandwich. Eating it slow satisfies the craving over a longer period of time, at least for me.

4) Account for it in my caloric budget for the day.

5) Don't keep food in your house or apartment. I do micro-shopping, only buying what I need for a meal that day, and otherwise keep healthy, low calorie items like fruits and vegetables around. Celery with hummus is super filling for not many calories, so that's a nice combo to keep around.

I'm still bad about it, and it's probably my main detractor for my weight loss now that I've great reduced my alcohol consumption (mmm beer) but so far, I'm still going down in weight so it seems to be mostly working. True. Dat scale. Everyone's mortal enemy! The scale doesn't bother me much fortunately because I know it's the long game.  I agree with what you're saying though. For some people water retention is wildly demotivating. But In reality I don't think it's avoidable. I wish I had a link but I read something from I believe it was patrick arnold about plataues, "squishy fat and swooshes" where he theorizes that the body will naturally hold water in place of fat in an effort to maintain homeostasis.Progress is progress. If you're only 5 pounds from goal, why worry about the stalls? Alternatively, tighten up the diet a little to grind out the last few pounds. You say 1300-1500, so get a little stricter and go a flat 1300 (assuming you're a small woman which I'm hoping you are with a goal of 110 lbs). Swordfish. It's frigging delicious and the dish looks like it comes with some great stuff. Check on the marinade. Chicken is also a great option (so much protein). I gain 4-5 lbs the week DURING my period, have no idea why/if it has anything to do with my BC. Nothing makes me happier than not only bleeding out of an orifice, but also gaining weight.

And now two of my posts in the past two days are about my period. I think that's a good idea - especially banking up calories *in advance* of something, so you are more likely to have a lower appetite / sense of fullness of less on the day. Better than after a rich meal when you're likely to feel the hunger that much more

I do also like using the weekly total as a reassurance to me.. even if I take allowance for something, I can still meet my weekly goal. Keeps some perspective.

Personally stay focused more on the individual day. The same as some people prefer to carry cash because they don't trust themselves with having thousands of dollars accessible on a credit card, I am that way with food. I'm fine with money, but I have a history of being quite bad managing caloric debt.

All that said, though, you still have to log everything you eat each day to "balance your checkbook". :-)Good job! I usually pretty bad when im drunk about eating right so that must take a good amount of will power!yea its tough. lost 50lbs of baby weight and kept it off for 3 years. went through divorce about 4 years ago, met my current boyfriend of 3 yrs,  and gained it all back. part of it was stress weight and part being in a happy relationship weight. its taken me about 3 yrs to put it all back on, but im at the point where im like "what the hell am I doing?" I saw myself in a picture and saw how big I got and was like "who the hell is this person" it wasn't me. Ive so far lost 21 lbs since mid November. its coming off slow but its ok. Im happy just knowing im doing something about it...again...and I will get to where I want to be. I want to feel comfortable in my clothes and with myself. Haha read my post from last night Just wait till you add bacon and onions...I really like what you said about the Oreos and chicken wings. That was definitely an eye-opening realization for me too, when I first started changing my eating habits. I think that I had initially assumed that I could never again eat any of my favorite foods, but then I realized that I actually *could* still eat whatever I wanted; I just had to do it in moderation.

Congratulations on your weight loss so far, and keep up the great work! :)Thats awesome! congrats and keep up the hard work!Well 100-200 calories per day *tops* could be a significant part of a deficit for some people. But, yes it's small. However, the water weight issue is more the problem and many people are scale addicts and can't just accept that if they are eating at a deficit they are losing weight, so water retention messing with heads is quite common and often attributable to high deficits.  How tall are you and female or male, I'm just wondering since your weight sounds pretty low already Either way we can all agree Satan is a pretty cool catThat is amazingly stupendously awesome! Congrats! You are on your way, keep it up!Definitely. Upper-body and floor stretches have given my poor back new life. Take it slow and remember to breathe. Drink water while watching TV to satisfy that oral fixation. Helps me a lotCongratulations.  This is a huge accomplishment.  You should be so proud and hold on to that feeling on days where you may get down.  There are so many here that are proud of you!

You can do this!I think bloating and weight gain happen because of water retention. I found that eating healthy (no sugar, caffeine, alcohol, salt, fatty food, and lots of water, vegetables, and fruit) plus exercise help to reduce it, but I haven't been able to get rid of it completely.&gt; I've tried eating 1800 calories, and I can't sustain that.

Yes you can. Just change up the types of food you eat. You cannot sustain on that because you eat crap like bread sticks and ramen. You eat too much junk and not enough healthy food. I think it's the sleeping pills which are a gift from Satan.Thank you for posting this! It's always helpful for me to be reminded that the scale isn't showing the complete picture of my progress, since fluctuations are to be expected.

What helps me to stay on track is focusing on the individual habits that I'm building that are better than what I used to do. So for instance, I'm getting better at portioning out my meals and logging all of them first thing in the morning, whereas I *never* used to do that. The way I see it, as long as I keep developing healthier habits and being consistent with them, the weight loss that I want to see on the scale will come, too --- just not necessarily all at once, and that's okay! :)I usually brew a strong herbal  tea.  When stoned  it tastes better  than any  soft drink.  When I hit slumps like this, which happens a fair amount, I like to set a timer for 8 minutes and do 8 minutes of whatever needs to get done. It's amazing what you can get done in 8 minutes and it takes the edge of that feeling of being unable to do anything.  Then I feel ok going back into my comfort zoneNo. Bad. Those are studies with faulty methodologies that are outnumbered by many studies showing they are incorrect.

Also Propylene Glycol is an ingredient in inhalers, and used to bu pumped into hospitals because it would help stop the spread of sickness. They stopped because some people can be allergic to it. (you can also get 100% VG or 100% PG juices if you have an issue with either ingredient.)

While there are no long term studies concerning vaping, it's always smart to pay attention to what you are intaking, but smart choices can make vaping pretty much as safe as breathing in air. Vaping is probably safer in rural areas than breathing in air in urban centers honestly...The only reason why I started getting munchies was cuz when I first started smoking, I got toooooo high a few times and would try to eat to get it to go away.. In the beginning it didn't work... But then, when I got more used to it, it did. I'm not smoking anymore tho so now my only munchies are from emotional eating or the "need" to eat while watching tv. Hopefully I can get those in check, lol.That's the kind of negativity I'm not wild about, "hrrrrng if u dun lik it then leev". That doesn't make a very good basis for community when negativity is being promoted. How about, if you don't like what I write, downvote it and move on with your life?Yep. I have this trouble too. Tight calf muscles mean your shins have to work too hard. I use a standing desk and often stand barefoot with my toes up on a piece of foam. It has helped quite  a bit.We need to be realistic though, that "down regulation" is fairly insignificant. We're talking 100-200 calories per day tops. Nothing drastic. I can't dig up any links right now, but I remember reading just how small the number is.If something so basic as someone not agreeing with you demotivated you so much, maybe you shouldn't be posting here.  These are all great suggestions. I'm not married to the beer, it just happens to be the most convenient go to. Most of my drinking occurs on the weekend while watching soccer matches and, like the food, it's part of an overall problem I have with compulsive indulgence. I'm fairly new to all this lifestyle change, and (as stupid as it sounds) I think I'm finally wrapping my head around what that phrase means. I don't know what happened in said past thread, but just a point of clarification that people miss regarding "starvation mode"

Sure starvation is not real unless you're technically starving but there are metabolic effects that are associated with undereating and overexercising that occur long before someone is "starved" that affect weight loss.  Too few calories and too much exercise is a recipe for metabolic downregulation (as with all deficits but more so with higher deficits compounded with lots of steady state cardio) such that x% calculated deficit is now less than that which frustrates people thinking that the body is a calculator and they aren't losing as predicted, as well as a lot of cortisol which causes water retention which masks fat loss and again frustrates people when the scale isn't moving because the water is masking the loss.  Not to mention that this situation often applies to people doing steady state cardio and not lifting such that muscle loss occurs with high deficits especially without strength training and further affects metabolism. High deficits and lots of activity in the long-run are counterproductive for most.

I agree with you, to each his/her own, don't criticize or judge and sorry you feel that you were treated that wayJust means you have a big ass (which is very in right now). I'm the same way, almost all of my "extra" weight goes to my waist. Even when pants start to loosen its usually in the waistband and not the hips which is annoying for fit. Just learn to embrace it, maybe learn to twerk. I've never smoked weed, though I probably got a second hand buzz once or twice.

But I HAVE heard that despite the munchies, weed helps with insulin, which can help with weightloss.

I'm no doctor, just going by an article I saw, lemme see i I can find it.

http://www.healthline.com/health-news/policy-marijuana-use-helps-with-blood-sugar-control-and-bmi-051613F**K YEAH!I remember having a salad bar as an option, but I guess it's just too expensive?  I don't know...Nice job. Two things that I think will be helpful are that the progress, however slow, is steady and predictable and that you won't have to spend the entire time at 400+ pounds. Just being 35 lbs lighter makes the whole process tolerable.MyFitnessPal is amazing - I would definitely recommend it.

A really good thing to do is find an exercise / workout that you love.  I know everyone always says that, but it really worked for me - I found a local HIIT fitness class last year that I loved, and as such I've been working out 2-3 times a week for over a year!  Keep trying things until you find something you enjoy.

Good luck!!  And remember not to be hard on yourself :-) /r/leaves

one of the best things I've ever done for myself (mentally, physically, weight and diet wise) is to quit the bud.Congrats brother, keep up the good work!Thank you :)  About how many days should be work out days and how many days should be rest days?  I currently do cardio about 5-6 times a week, is that too much for weights?Well done! I too am always tempted by the post-drinks takeaway - next time I will try to take inspiration from this post and resist the temptation.I just asked the same question on a different subreddit a few days ago, and it seems like the general response is "yes, about 5 pounds." Some ways that seem to help me with the bloating is drinking more water and limiting salt as much as possible for a few days before it started.

*clarificationI did my first 5k in April 2014 and the same 5k is next weekend. I was looking at pictures of myself at the event last year and I cannot wait to post comparison pictures. I was 260lbs in April 2014 and 188lbs today!Congratulations! Cut your cardio in half.  Too much cardio will slow down your weight loss.  He did a similar show in the UK and is credited with removing some of the unhealthier options from school canteens (chips/fries for one, and the infamous [Turkey Twizzlers](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-342395/The-truth-Turkey-Twizzlers.html)). My school took away the worst options and introduced a salad bar. Children hated Jamie Oliver for that! I'm not sure how much the changes have stuck or made a difference but it is definitely a long term pet project of his.Thanks for the positive nudges!I lost 100 pounds in 7 months in 2013. By January of this year I had gained back 70. I have since lost about 20 of that, but it is extremely frustrating. Knowing all the work I'm putting in now, I've already done before, and if I was still down 100 pounds down, I'd be hitting new goals, instead of having to reach the ones I've hit previously.

I agree with the others though, it is so much harder the second time. I agree! OP went too hard and now there's nowhere to go except a reset I never really noticed any body temperature change.  I lose weight in wooshes all the time.  My weight will stay the same for about 8-10 days and then over the next 3-4 days I will lose like 5-6 pounds.  The trick to avoiding the munchies's complete abstinence from food while under the influence.   Eating while stoned is like peeing after 4 beers, you are just setting yourself up for a downward slide.  Drink water instead.

That is awesome!  Your post has just encouraged me to get back in the gym. Congrats, keep up the good work. I myself am also 3 lbs from hitting the 300's.When I first started losing weight I was 190 and used Jenny Craig. When I couldn't afford it anymore I derailed and regained 15lbs back. Then I tried to use WW and a personal trainer and lost it again. That didn't stick either. Then I tried using a weight loss consultant and I paid money to be told to restrict calories and use MFP. It worked, but then I stopped logging. And here I am again...up 26lbs starting over. I know I can do it....but starting over is always the same. The first day is easy, the second and third I want to stop, but this time I'm trying to push through and remember I'm doing this for me! I saw that show and I love the fact, that he wants to improve school meals. Living in the Netherlands I'm used to bring my own lunch with me. But I think it's terrible that schools serve such unhealthy meals to the children. I think most parents trust the schools of their children.
At least you became aware of this and that's amazing! A diet vacation sounds good right about now lol, I usually eat between 1200/1400 everyday, I don't eat back the calories on workout days.

Well my TDEE is about 2100 an Bmr is 1800.I've solved this by only letting myself smoke during the week if I've gone to the gym. Then I don't feel so bad eating because I've compensated with cardio. Otherwise all is lost.

Weekends though, all bets are off. I have to work on not caving to my weekend Netflix/blunt/binge eating habits. Last year in January i lost 65 lbs from Jan - April, i stayed steady till around fall and i gained about 45 of it back.  I started again now and its all gone + more, i feel as if the second time around was easier because i knew the do's and dont's and in's and out's of everything i was doing.  At this point its just a mental game.Reddiwhip is seriously AMAZING!  :DLooks like you are on the right track.  Stay focused.  You are doing a great job.Congrats man. I know that feeling well. I was over 400lbs before graduating HS and never saw a 3 for a long time.  I got up to 578 and I am now at 388.  Keep going, I have been walking for a while now and I can now easily do 5 miles a day walking, probably a whole lot more, but don't want to mangle my feet.  If you use MFP please feel free to friend me, same username as here.

Keep it up!Haha that's great wordplay. Seriously though, as I ran and improved in this part of my life, I found that I was able to confront the other problems in my life head on. Running *into* them and through them, not away from them. Hi! I'm starting over again on my weight loss adventure. At my highest I was about 190 at my lowest I was about 145lbs. I'm currently at 171 and trying to get back to 140. In the past I've always had help losing weight (jenny craig, weight watchers, etc...), but this time I want to do it myself. I need to learn for myself how to eat right and live healthy. So here I am. Starting again. I do use a scale to weigh everything, I haven't been taking measurements thoughHe did a special in the States about trying to get schools to pick up healthier and fresher lunch options.  It was seriously eye opening and it's sad that it didn't go very far.  If anything, it made me aware of what my future kids will be eating and I definitely will want to go for more lunches from home because of it.Boojah!Right on. Your an inspiration. Keep up the good work. In my experience, and with everyone I've talked to about it, there's no avoiding it.  It's what our bodies do...and it freaking sucks!  I honestly just avoid the scale when I know I'm coming up on that time and keep pushing through workouts and watching what I eat.  I'm SUCH an emotional eater and at that time of the month I crave ***everything!***  I don't know that there's any way to stop it.  :-\  Just try not to get discouraged.  Keep pushing through.  You should be back to where you were in a week or so.Thanks!Holy crap!  That's incredible!  Way to go!!That's incredible!  Way to go and keep it up!!So you literally ran away from your problems.

That's pretty cool!This is awesome.  Thanks!That is such an awesome job you are doing!!  Congratulations and keep up the wonderful work!Thank you for the kind words!

I'm doing my best.

Almost 3.5 days so far. This!I agree. I have a hard time just taking one... When I get into serious diet mode, it's cold turkey on eliminating processed sugar for me (during the weekdays).Huh- I never noticed that!My diet actually has changed dramatically and is a huge reason for the weight loss. I've been cooking a lot more. I rarely eat out now (maybe 1-2 times a month). But the more I cook, the better I get at cooking, and I honestly don't feel like I'm missing out or forcing myself to eat "lesser" food because, to me, it tastes great! I don't find myself craving other food because I can make food that is filling, healthier, and cheaper (and according to my personal tastes and preferences). My go-to meal is some kind of meat (usually chicken breast since it is the cheapest at $1.99 or $2.99 a pound and also the healthiest) seasoned and sauteed or grilled, with a vegetable (such as broccoli, sauteed onions or peppers, or some salad greens), and a cup of soup (miso soup, broth, or canned soup). Very filling, very cheap, and very easy to make. I used to be so impatient with cooking but this is so easy and fast. Additionally, I listen to music or podcasts while cooking and cleaning and it calms me down and helps me stay patient. Plus, cooking is just an overall great skill to develop. Food brings people together and I can cook for my friends. I don't subscribe to any particular diet. For me it's all about being reasonable, applying self-control, and separating being hungry from being bored. Being satisfied with just being satisfied and not overeating for whatever reason (in the past, sometimes I would overeat just because I wanted to "finish" something" but it's better to eat half and save the rest or just to make more reasonable portion sizes in the first place). Sometimes it's good to stop eating for a moment and evaluate if you've had enough. I look at losing weight as a math game. Calories in vs. calories out. While I do not explicitly count my calories, that mindset has allowed me to realize that every thing that I forego eating (after I'm already satisfied and not hungry) is a gain for me. It all counts and it all adds up- not just the negatives but the positives. As far as macro-nutrients go, I've been eating a lot more protein which is filling, a lot less carbs, and somewhat more fat. I don't count carbs or protein or fat but I just feel that protein is the most filling and I get the most bang for my calorie. Plus, it means I get to eat a lot of meat!

As for running, I don't really have a set amount of time I run. I just go into each run planning on doing at least a mile and if I feel good enough after the mile, I do another, and if I feel good enough after 2, I do another. But getting the first mile is so important. It doesn't have to be a mile, just a certain amount that you can comfortably reach and, once you accomplish it, you can be satisfied in knowing you made some progress that day. For that reason, it is more important how many days I ran in the week as opposed to how many miles I ran in that day. After running for 3 months, I can easily reach a mile and afterwards I am able to think, "see? that wasn't so bad. I can do it again tomorrow". Running used to be "scary" and fill me with dread because I was too hard on myself. I ended up running 30-40 miles in January. I might have run 30-40 miles in the past 4 years combined. I didn't believe I could do it but I did and no one can take that away from me, not even me. Sometimes my brain tries to invalidate my accomplishments but not this time. By being consistent, I was able to accomplish this.

I use them for everything, freezer and refrigerator. I freeze soups, chili, veggies, fruits, etc. When freezing liquids, I sit it in the refrigerator for a day to let it thaw. Keep it up dude! Kiss those 400's goodbye forever!HannahGeneThat last pic put me into tears - you look so amazingly happy and accomplished.  Marvelous! Wonderful!   Thank you for sharing and motivating!!

That's it. /r/loseit   I can't take anymore this morning.  I'm emotionally spent.   It's too great!!!    Keep on kicking ass brother! Walking will get easier! Glad to hear that things are going well for you! Huge milestone!THAT'S TWO PEOPLE TODAY!  You are the 2nd person I've seen TODAY that have taken themselves from the clutches of the 400s!   WAY! TO! FREAKIN'! GO!!!!   Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WOOOT WOOOT WOOT!  Superb! Totally great! 1200 with cardio 5 days a week is too much.  Hopefully those cardio days are your 1400 days and the 1200 days are your rest days.

My idea (and it's just an idea) is to take a diet "vacation" but do it in a sensible way that preserves your weight loss.  Figure out your Sedentary TDEE at your present weight and eat at that level (or, if you're using MyFitnessPal or similar, set it to maintenance).  You'll get several hundred more calories.  Eat at that level for a week or two.  Because you're eating at maintenance, you won't gain or lose fat -- except if you're active and don't compensate and then you'll slightly lose.  Most of all, part of this "vacation" is not worrying about it.  Just log and enjoy.  This of this as putting your effort on "cruise control" -- it's not over but now is the time to coast for a while.  It's a mental break and if you did have a small metabolic adaptation, this will serve to buck it.

I heard this recommendation after I had been losing for 6 months, so obviously I didn't try it myself.  But recently I went to Key West and did this for the week.  I lost a pound that week (a lot of walking in Key West) and really didn't feel like I was over or under eating.  It had the feel of "sensible" eating.  More flexibility, less stress, in control.    When the vacation was over, I returned to a deficit of 1 lb. a week so the adjustment back was not a large one.  I have continued to lose since then.  Lift so you lose more fat than muslceI lost 80 pounds and then put 30 back on over the winter; I'm losing it again and then some this year.

The difference this time is that I remember distinctly how good I felt and looked with all of the weight off and it's inspiring me to keep at it. I'm also looking at next winter and what I can do to not put the weight back on again.

I don't see the weight loss as a single event in my life but as part of my life now so there's never going to be a "I'm all done now, I can resume eating garbage and partying hard on the weekend!" as it's not a sustainable lifestyle.There is no end goal, you will always want to do better. Just telling you that right nowI don't really have a set amount of time I run. I just go into each run planning on doing at least a mile and if I feel good enough after the mile, I do another, and if I feel good enough after 2, I do another. But getting the first mile is so important. It doesn't have to be a mile, just a certain amount that you can comfortably reach and, once you accomplish it, you can be satisfied in knowing you made *some* progress that day. After running for 3 months, I can easily reach a mile and afterwards I am able to think, "see? that wasn't so bad. I can do it again tomorrow". Running used to be "scary" and fill me with dread because I was too hard on myself. Food scale to weigh everything? Measurements? Have you improved your flexibility at all?Congrats!  What a great year!!  Keep going and keep posting.  Awesome.This made me giggle. Thank you for that.I love running. My Achilles isn't hurting after yesterday's run. I'm going to take it slow.  I also have a road bike in the garage with a kid carrier so I can bike once I get helmets for my kids. I really want to join a gym but I'm on eastern Long Island so they're all super expensive.About 5'6" ;)

Hi, I'm 23. My height is 5'6" although I like to round up and tell people I'm 5'7" haha. If your target rate is 6 lbs per month, then you're going to need to eat 700 calories per day below maintenance on average.

Currently, you seem to be averaging 400 to 500 calories per day below maintenance. That's a perfectly respectable deficit, and you could happily stay there until you lose all the weight you want to lose, but it's not going to achieve your target rate of 6 lbs per month.I think you're right, I really appreciate you guys helping me out  :) This is a huge problem for me. I love smoking and have no desire to stop. However I always get the worse case of the munchies and make terrible diet decision &gt; In addition to what /u/funchords has to say, don't worry about hitting your goal for the first few weeks, get used to logging everything (condiments, snacks, drinks) you eat each day.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Most people find that they are eating a lot more calories than they think, and simply by counting and being aware of what you're eating you will start to change your behaviour.

Can confirm.  Nice add.Keep up the good work!Oh yeah. 4'11 female here, went down from 140 to 115 two summers ago and felt amazing. Then I met my boyfriend and I got lazy and greedy. Starting again at 158... Nearly lost half a stone so that's something! I'm just panicking about ways to make this the rest of my life and not just a summer again.You don't need to do anything weird to lose weight; just east below maintenance every day until you reach your goal.Well done! Amazing? How did you do it?Pics and story??I'm going to be the party pooper here and tell you that just because you don't have hundreds to lose, it doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard on losing what you have to lose.

I started with 67 pounds to lose to go from obese to normal BMI. Sixty-seven pounds make the difference for me. Maybe you're taller and 60 pounds from your normal BMI don't make you obese, but overweight, but still. When one thinks 60 is not that much, those 60 can turn into 100 easily. That's how I went from "20 pounds is not so much, I'll control this eventually" to "holy crap, I'm obese".

So it seems to me that in a way you're being complacent with yourself: "At least is not like I have to lose hundreds".

You can do this. You're right. It's your brain, your self esteem, your habits. And the only way to change that is by doing things differently. Start logging to MFP every day, start logging your food, and work on your habits slowly if you must. But do something.I sometimes eat 2Hey, that's totally other level ;-)The two come wrappedCool, does it work for you, do you still lose weight?Well your view is aligned with my one so I will keep eating the KitKatOkay, you can Google Images of whatever challenge you want- squats, planks, etc. and pick one!  There are images for all the challenges.  It's fun!!measurements Its also funny that one can so unconscious to it. For me its anxiety about my job security and it causes me to focus only on work.Maybe next week...And then- dreaded vacation.  But I have a meal plan!!Hope it goes well for youDude CONTRAGUATIONS!

I just came here to post almost the same thing - I'm no longer 400 pounds. Can't express how stoked I was 15 minutes ago when I got on the scale, and I'm sure you're equally as thrilled.

Keep up the great work, brother!

My suggestion would be to live by My Fitness Pal. It's really helped me curb my eating and really cut the pounds pretty consistently the last few months. Hit me up if you want to partner up on MFP!Nice! Well done!  I love it too, feels like real life leveling up.This is not good advice IMO.

A good weight loss plan should be three things: healthy, sustainable and realistic.

* Eating "only salad" is extremely unlikely to provide you with a balanced diet, so this is not healthy
* Again, giving up all food other than salad and water is not sustainable over long periods
* "Don't sit down" is not realistic - especially when OP has classes 9-5, 5 days a week

While in moderation all this advice is quite good, I would say, in this case, the approach is too extreme.Great job I bet u burned at least 12 calories on that walk, maybe 15 if u were breathing hard in anticipation In addition to what /u/funchords has to say, don't worry about hitting your goal for the first few weeks, get used to logging **everything** (condiments, snacks, drinks) you eat each day.

Most people find that they are eating a lot more calories than they think, and simply by counting and being aware of what you're eating you will start to change your behaviour.

I've always overeaten and never dieted before, so I have gone for the lowest weight loss per week on MFP and found this works really well. It is *relatively* easy to hit my target and sustain the reduced intake, especially looking at weekly targets. Most of the time I can come in under my goal and I am actually losing weight quicker than MFP predicts. This may have something to do with my "overestimation policy" though!The votes show up after a day or so.  I don't know exactly when, the mod activity here is very light.  It's embarrassing for me to type this out, but I think you're right - it's something we really need to own up to and speak candidly about. We can help ourselves and eachother.


I was 222lbs at my highest weight. Got down to 189lbs and was thrilled. Was determined to never gain it back. Well, things happened and I spiralled out of control again. I gained back to 215 (even typing that makes me feel awful), and I'm currently down to 210.


As a few people above mentioned, it all feels very...stale. Like the first time I was thrilled to have a new, smaller measurement, or fit a new size of clothing. This time there's none of that. I'm just undoing the damage I did.


However, I'm doing it in a much healthier way (both mentally and physically this time), and trying to make actual changes for the sake of my quality of life, instead of quick fixes to lose a few pounds. Honestly?

You eat too much. I went through two weeks of your diary and found tour issues.

1 Your calorie goals are too high. Back that off to 1800.

2 You do not stick to your goal the majority of the time.

3 You still eat quite a bit of junk which is leaving you hungry.

4 you are overestimating your exercise gains. Stop adding exercise in to your daily calorie goals. I ran 160 miles in March, burned 20,000 calories and did not add them in. I just had a sensible cheat meal once a week.

6 slices of bread and 4 eggs? ramen? Pretzels? The white rice you are eating is out of this world.

Here are some suggestions for you in the food department.

Switch to uncle bens brown rice and shave your calories in half.

Get rid of the bread and replace it with fruits and vegetables. You will get more food for less calories. &gt;Doritos, Salsa, and McDoubles

Sounds like mixing those together would upgrade a McDouble... (A McDouble 2.0?) As long as you only eat one per year anyway!Well, they do say that fast food is just as addictive as drugs. So it's no surprise so many people fall off the wagon. I may have eaten very well over the past 200 days I've logged in MFP but that doesn't mean I'm not still craving junk (ish, I've never been into McDonald's).I blame Lycra. Clothes expand with you!

I can't remember how much weight I've gained/lost over the years. Now I've hit goal weight again, I *have* to keep it off, but I'm worried about starting to eat maintenance, to be honest.i just fucking caved and got mcdonalds fuck meLooking at your chart, this is the basically the first time that your diet has actually exceeded the preceding binge! Clearly you're onto something bigger and better in terms of sustainable lifestyle than you've ever come close to before. I look forward to seeing this chart again in a few months :)Sounds like March was the month of headwinds, between the vacation and stopping hiking.  Hiking does use a ton of calories, there's something about the uneven terrain I think that makes it burn more than walking on a flat surface.  My heart rate is often 20% higher on an easy trail hike than when I walk on a flat paved surface.

It looks from one of your comments that your calories are fixed.  Every time you lose a pound, you should drop 10 calories from your goal, otherwise you will slow down your rate of loss over time.  You can do this manually (say 50 calories less every 5 pounds or so) or MyFitnessPal will do this -- http://www.myfitnesspal.com/account/change_goals -- choose "guided" -- choose "Continue" -- choose "Update Profile" -- and every 10 pounds you lose, MFP will adjust you by about 100 calories.

This really isn't a race, it's a lifetime. The same stuff that gets us to goal is the same stuff that we'll use to maintain our goal weight.  So, thinking that way, when we get there doesn't matter.  In fact, it's better if we go slow -- our new smaller clothes will last longer before we need new smaller clothes, our skin will adjust better, we'll have more time to get to eat sensibly as we experience different eating challenges like potlucks and barbecues -- all basic training for our new healthy life.  So slow and steady is okay.  However slow is demotivating, especially for a newbie.

So, in summary, adjust your calories downward as you go to keep your loss rate up.  If you've stopped doing something that's a major calorie burner, adjust downward for that too.  But take a long view -- well past your goal -- and the goal date won't matter as much because the effort before and after goal is very much the same.

I'm losing about 7 lbs. a month now, even though I lost 44 lbs. in the first 60 days. My target rate is 1 lb. a week now, it was 2 lbs. a week when I started. +1 for doing an awesome job. Progress is progress, no matter how small, especially during difficult times (when even maintaining your current weight is a massive achievement). Keep going :)For the love of all that is holy, please orient your progress pics from left to right in terms of progress.

Lookin great dude, but pls.I don't use as often as I once did. Basically some Friday nights hardcore and small puffs when I've had a super stressful day (maybe once a week). But that being said, I plan for it. I decide what I'm going to eat and portion it out in advance. I always work extra cardio that day and then enjoy the bounty that I picked in advanced. Apples and peanut butter, pirate booty, hummus, or olives. One time I had ice cream. But either way, the food will bring me up to, at most, maintenance level calories and I'm okay with that for as little as I partake. Dang, you really earned it. You could have up sized the fries if you wanted. Don't be afraid to spoil yourself. You deserve it. Plus gotta stay away from the dreaded starvation mode. last year I lost about 20 pounds over 2 months and pretty much stopped trying to lose weight due to depression while slowly gaining it all back gradually over 13 months.  I'm back to my starting weight, but logging on MFP has been going tremendously well over the last 7 days, but I'm not gonna weigh in until at least a month has been logged.I lost 120 pounds 3 years ago and slowly gained 65 pounds back. Over the last 3 months I've slowly lost 15. I've got to get my ass in gear. For me personally, I don't get actually hungry. I just want some damn salty food and I want it right now. Carrots don't really do it when everything in my body is telling me I'm severely lacking in my nachos &amp; burger nutrition category. But to try to combat it, I started keeping SnapPea crisps and reduced fat Cheez-its around. That way if I do end up losing my control a little, I've got that salt and it doesn't totally wreck my system if I accidentally binge.I am getting a TDEE of 1581 (19, 5'5', 144, Sedentary, 33% BF). I would cut 250, down to 1331 and start lifting with your boyfriend. Instead of just losing the weight, you can start to build the body you'll want. WHERE TO START:

[MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/.) is a great tool for calorie counting. To start, commit to use it for a week -- every meal and snack, every condiment and drink -- a week's log complete in the foods and accurate in the measurements. This is not easy, it will take 15-20 minutes per meal and you'll still be vague on whether you're using it exactly right. Just do your best. It's a learning curve. The second week gets easier and more accurate. By the second month, it takes 5 minutes a day.

Print out your log from the website every week and review your meals. See which choices are putting you off of your goals. Visualize what you will do differently next time: less food in that portion, or cooked/prepared differently, or using a different food choice in that meal.

Keep using MFP and reviewing your logs for ideas and inspiration. You'll soon be regularly hitting your goals and the weight will be coming off at a decent rate (1-2 pounds a week on average).

GOOD FIT WEIGHT:

Whatever fits you.  Most people 5'11" are overweight when they're over 180 lbs. according to the charts.  Set 180 lbs. as a first goal and then decide when you get there how to adjust your goals --  go to 170, add some muscle, start a new active hobby.  My suggestion here is: get off the excess weight and as you're losing and keeping it off, explore new active hobbies and activities.

GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME TO DO IT IN:

Losing 1-2 lbs. a week is good, but this is a lifestyle change.  It's important to think of your "deadline" as no change at all -- you'll lose by controlling your food and you'll maintain in exactly the same way.  Don't think of it as a diet you'll do for a while.  Think of it as your new way of forever eating..

I think it's good for you to be aware of it. You'll have to make working out a priority in a different way, and it's harder! Now I wake up early every morning to run. I've tried eating 1800 calories, and I can't sustain that. I get headaches more often than not, and I think it's because it's a sharp cut down from my TDEE.

I'm comfortable around 2000, and I aim for 1900 a day. Thank you for your post - and congratulations on achieving your goals!What is your game plan? You realize that you are overweight because of you. You know it is not the job or the hours you work. Your unhealthy weight is due to your inability to control yourself and change your lifestyle.

Is it hard not to go get fast food? Yes. Fort me it is harder than not smoking. No joke. I quit smoking 8 months ago and miss junk food more than smoking. What is the point? What is the point in losing weight if you crave junk all the time?

All I can tell you is what works for me. I remember when I used to look in the mirror and go yuk. Disgusting. I used to hate running when it was hot because my short would stick to my body and you could see the outline of my fat body.

Now it is the exact opposite. I love my body and it feels good. Loving my weight loss has put me in a much better mental place.

You can still have an unhealthy meal every now and again. Get back on MFP. Set your goal for a sedentary lifestyle and start counting. Once you make it two weeks reward yourself with a treat. Cook enough healthy food for 3 people and take leftovers to work. Six chicken breasts , brown rice and veggies. You can live on that all week long. Thank you,
&gt; my weight goes up so my tv stops working. Now what? Can I do anything to earn it back?

That is one of the questions, we would like to ideas from the users. Basically, we could do all kinds of things that would help getting the device back. But do people really want that? After all, people want to lose weight. And if there was a some sort of "get out of jail FREE" - button. The whole device would lose its purpose. We have currently done it so that the "players" weight loss history earns him/her "get out of jail FREE" - points, which allow him/ her to temporarily cross to a certain degree the weight limits without a punishment. And his / her past weight loss success also makes "punishments" shorter. See, we are very carefully trying to balance between how do we provide maximal tolerance, but without watering down the motivative "game"-like element. And, as you know, in all games there must be a challenge i.e. a chance of not always winning.

&gt; And because sometimes starting a new work out increases weight temporarily
&gt; I still don't get tv even though I'm doing everything right. I'm just going to unplug it.

Well, our system currently calculates a 30 day trend weight, and if the turbo-button is not pressed, the system will just keep observing that the person's 30 day trend weight doesn't increase, so the system already allows females to have their periods and it allows a few days weight increases for stressful job situations. And it allows more tolerance it the persons weight loss history is good. Well, what more could people be asking - so that they would still play by the rules and not start unplugging it :)

If we would get the campaign through we would adjust the product's tolerance settings according to people's (surveyed) wishes. Why wouldn't we - the customers know better how much tolerance they want to be given.

Thanks, I didn't know about that Kickstarter product, well similarly that jar could also make people angry if they for example had their keys in it  and they really wanted the keys and felt they had deserved to have those keys. Fortunately, a hammer could be always be used in unplugging the keys from that jar too ;)Don't beat yourself up. You've acquired some healthy habits - that's not enough but it will come in handy. Everybody needs to start at some point, you have MFP installed so start using it today. Set yourself a reasonable goal and stay within your limits today. One day can't be a big deal right?

And don't worry too much about that one cookie. Bring some apples and carrots and the like and use that for snacks - if you eat reasonably you might well have enough calories left at the end of the day for a cookie. And then you get to enjoy that without even having to feel guilty. Wouldn't that be a great feeling?

And sometimes you get over your calorie budget. That's ok, it's not an attempt to be perfect or some punishment for enjoying sweets - if you are just a little over that doesn't matter, you can make it up the following days. You need to organize your food budget on a per day basis, but what matters is the weeks and months you stick to it.

Go for it, we are rooting for you.
It's like going through that series of pictures, I can see your bones and muscles going "ahhhhhh!" in relief.  You look less intense -- it -- just -- looks -- wonderful.  Way to go!!

On that race against your fork...

Most of the average person's daily burned calories - more than 80% - will be non-exercise calories. So trying to manage your weight mainly through exercise will turn into a race against your fork, a race that your fork will likely win because you will hunger for more food to fuel the added exercise.

Once you accept the fundamental rule that *weight control = food control*, then exercise will have its rightful place in your perspective. *Exercise is great and beneficial, but it is not co-equal with food in the weight-loss game.* Get the diet working so that you don't rely on exercise at all (meaning: if you were injured and could do no exercise, you would still lose weight). Then add exercise that meets your interests and that exercise can create some bonus weight loss.

Continue to exercise for all the great things that exercise does, but don't use exercise as a primary activity to manage your weight. Exercise is good at helping you lose weight, but it is not primary or co-equal with a working diet.

Commenting to find this again. Keep us updated. You and I are currently the same height and weightDon't give up.  It was hard for me at the start as well.  The trick is to find a diet that fills you up and yet is still low calorie.  I eat low sugar oatmeal a couple times throughout the day as low calorie snacks, which helps.

You also need to find an exercise you like that you can work into routine.  I like walking - I put on a custom playlist of high energy music and just go.  I do it every day before lunch not because OMG I HAVE TO WORK OUT NOW but because YAY IT'S ALMOST LUNCH TIME I GET TO WALK THEN EAT!Very well done! You look incredible! And you definitely do look healthier.

PPS - That is a sick Fantasia tattoo. I'm definitely 'mirin.I'm off base in saying I have never seen a bag of chicken say the nutritional info is for raw meat?  Oh, ok.  Good thing I never cook chicken breasts then, I guess.  OP could just use a *cooked chicken* listing in MFP.Everyone makes losing weight so complicated and hard. Keep your belly full of water so you won't be hungry and eat only salad for two weeks. keep moving and don't sit down. Watch the pounds melt away! I lost 60 lbs in under 5 months this way.Or in my case, the whole thing of hummus :SShe knows she's overweight, unless she approaches you I would not approach her. People change when they are ready. Peaches, watermelon, tomatoes, grapes, apples are all heavenly and guilt-free when high! Fuckin way she goesIf your goal is efficient muscle gain, you need a surplus. Many fear it and spend years wasting time. Use IIFYM.com Welcome to the party.

Travisgunter0 on MFP. Adds Ended up dislocating a bone in my foot (during the football season) and spraining my wrist (over and over) during the wrestling season so I wasn't able to work out during that time.

I thought I'd take the opportunity to hop on ICF 5x5, my maxes are
Bench: 275
Squat: 400
Deadlift: 435

Before injuries bench was 295, and deadlift was 455, squat was relatively the same.You've gotten to the reason it's so vague, it changes from person to person. A nutritionist, personal trainer etc could help you find the answer For your body.Thanks for the reply, am I correct to say it hasn't always been this way? Since the comment scores where visible at some point right? Or am I just crazy lolWhere...where are you getting that bf% from?!It's all from within. If she doesn't want to help herself, you certainly can't help her. Comment scores are hidden in this subreddit. I needed to lose 152 pounds.  I've lost 83 and I only have 69 left so I am over half way.  Why would I quit now?  It only took me 4 months to lose 83, I can be at my goal weight by my birthday in October and surprise my parents! (I HOPE!!).  Also, my resting heart rate has gone from 120 to 86. Reduce your intake more..?You start by eating less. And you finish there, too, because that's how this works. And I'm not being sarcastic or snarky.

Check the FAQ in the sidebar for more detail. Lost a few stone as a teen and since I've been in a long term relationship I've comfortably regained about 15-20lbs of it :(
Then I lost and regained 10lbs of that (over the last four months or so).
Now I'm working on losing the 15lb that I gained since I met my boyfriend. 5lb down as of this week though. In a couple of months I'll be right where I want to be...I hope...**hugs** you can do it! http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_IYdmIS_Ufds/TQavuS6pIBI/AAAAAAAAAFk/wzf7lPym_RM/s1600/ambien-walrus-and-the-cookies.gif You ought to change your time frame. The first of the year would be more reasonable. HmThis. I don't mind the 300 calories of vodka....it's the 1000 that follow from pizza, chips and cake. Oh and that food coma on top of my buzz that causes me to zonk out for the night with a full belly. Oh the shame..I love chocolate so I eat dark chocolate everyday after dinner but I measure it out and it's (usually) the only candy/sweet I have. I would love to be able to suggest, however i'd be guessing!

Maybe its a case of setting a goal that you'll either increase the lift to the next weight (if dumbell) or by 5kg.  Again, i'm not sure what's reasonable as i'm just starting out with the lifting.I did. Lost just short of 30kg three years ago. Gained it all back, plus some. Started recounting calories a month and half ago, losing ULTRA slowly now but still losingI'm just back from a session with a strength and conditioning coach learning how to deadlift!  Very useful to get the technique sorted.

I'm interested as to why you would stay away from anything labelled diet? Any specific reason?Make sure you keep the protein levels up :)Mate, I hear you. I quit in January, have been jumping on and off the wagon since, and have been thinking wistfully when I'm getting peckish for an afternoon snack, how a cigarette would do the job beautifully. Kind of defeats the whole 'getting healthy, putting years back on my life' thing though. Good luck with everything, I guess if you've lost the weight once before, you know you can do it again!I can't edit the sheet:

"There was a problem

Let me know how I can get access. I can use my weight entries from MFP to catch up to everyone. Me, I moved back to florida and lost almost 140 lbs. Moved back up to NY, gained it all back. I lost 40 lbs and i've never been happier.
One cheat day in my mind equates to 3 cheat meals.  I'd choose to have 3 cheat meals across the month :)  Maybe thats why i'm not at my goal ha!!You should try to brush your teeth before you smokeI've recently came into the 150's (not bragging) so i know exactly how you are feeling! You can both do it, so, so close! I'll be looking out for an update hopefully sooner rather than later with the SV!You trade smoke for Propylene glycol inhalation, and heavy metals which leech in from the manufacturing of the products.

http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/09/17/e-cigarette-second-hand-smoke-effect.aspxMostly lurking here, hoping to get my ass up again one day... At 5'11, at 23 I was at 240 pounds. Started running and just limited my eating (just basic no second helpings, no candy, cutting sugar from my coffee and diluting my orange juice with water and being generally reasonable, no calorie counting), and over 2 years got down to about 170 pounds. I then hovered around 175 for some months, while keeping a habit of running 3-4 miles 3 times a week.

It started when I was allowing myself one pack of M&amp;Ms. I was back from an exchange year, and generally being frustrated about my life and feeling alienated from myself at this point, partly because I didn't know how to handle the dating possibilIties that opened up (I literally ran away once when a girl was getting close. Well, I HAD gotten in the habit of running). I was looking for the comfort sugar offered, and thought I was sufficiently stable in my new habits that I could afford some M&amp;Ms. I couldn't. I distinctly remember this moment when I caved.

I didn't gain back all this weight at once. For a while I was stable and comfortable at 180, I still was running semi-regularly while not denying myself the occasional treat and figured what the heck. I moved in with a good friend, and we shared an apartment for 2 years. He was also overweight, and loved cooking with creme fraiche and bacon and preparing rich desserts. I tasted great. We got into the habit of munching king size bowls of tagliatelle carbonara while watching The Simpsons ... moving closer to 220. I quit weighing myself around this time.

I finished university, moved to another city. Working late hours, eating out lunch with the co-workers at midday, and grabbing some junk food when coming home late at night. Got the occasional bout of motivation around springtime and ran again a couple of kilometers on a weekend, but the joints started aching... after another two years, at the regular check-up at our job, our doc weighed me in at around 240, and warned me about my blood pressure. I had gained all the weight back from back then, and it was catching up with me. Little by little I had eroded my habits and standards to where I had been once before. This was a wake up call. I quit smoking (was never much, but still...), cut coffee, bought myself a bike and started biking to work every day. No more desserts, decaf without sugar again, no more chocolate bought late at night as an evening snack, took up running semi-regularly before switching to doing laps at the pool. I set limits at work, and took evening classes so I had to leave the office in the evenings and force myself out of the work mindset to get out of the stress cycle. Over three years, I got back to around 200 pounds, biking everyday 2x4 miles, eating reasoably and doing 3x2000 m laps every week. Things were getting better again, but I still wanted to get back to 180ish but I was not willing to give up the midday lunches at the restaurant, because of the social interaction with my co-worker-friends, nor the occasional comfort foods I allowed myself in a busy work schedule. I knew perfectly well what I had to change, but I had been there and knew what I didn't want to quit.

Then, I took up an assignment at work that had me move out in the country. I had grown tired of city life and also office life, and gladly jumped at the possibility to get my own house with a garden in a village while retaining job security and without a long commute. I figured, out in the country would be even better for biking and picking up some outdoor sports. Long story short, biking to work in the country means crazy motorists, mud roads and no public transport in the pouring rain. Pools need a 20 min drive to the next larger town and their opening hours are limited so because of work I missed them regularly. Restaurants (where I still went every lunch hour for the socializing with the co-workers) tend to be of the hearty and plenishing kind. Keeping i shape and losing weight were a lot harder than I had thought.

Long story short, after more than three years out in the country, and fifteen years after starting this journey I am back again at 240, struggling to keep my habit of going to the pool to do my laps and only yesterday I have bought chocolate again. I have now taken some months from work, and plan to travel by bike from here to where I come from and where my family lives, without any pressure but to get myself moving, in order to get my life on another track.

TL; DR: Slo-Mo Yo-YoNo problem! It's exactly why i posted it, too often I have some sort of vague goal that i forget about.  Not now, its written down!That's the story of my life. Lost a ton of weight my Jr. year of HS, (diet and exercise) kept it off a few years, then I started college and it came back. Then I was diagnosed with hypothyroid and dropped some weight after medication. Then life happened and I gained some back, but was hit with severe depression and lost quite a bit. Got medicated and met a bf whose diet and lifestyle was horrible, but was depressed and didn't care so back came the weight and it brought friends. Now, thanks to a combination of a weird, yet - undiagnosed gastro illness and a new job that is very physical, I'm down nearly 50lbs and anticipate losing much more. Hopefully this will be the end of the yo-yoing, but it probably won't be. wow i had no idea that was true.. i might need to have a talk with someone I know lol. Awesome! Can't wait to get me some blue flair.I've done that...three times. It sucks, but the one thing that doesn't suck about it is that I know *exactly* what I have to do to lose weight. It's pretty damned hard to make excuses after you have lost sixty pounds *three times* and know how to do it, what it takes, what works, doesn't work, etc. I KNOW how to do this and I know how I feel when I put that sixty pounds back on...and the extra twenty that always seems to come with it.

So this is round four...I wish it wasn't, but I'm now down forty-five pounds, getting married in a couple of months and feeling motivated to just keep on keeping on.Vape on the other hand...I've found running as one of the most rewarding fitness exercises.  Good luck for it, i'm sure you'll be running the full 5k in no time at all!
SW: 177.7, CW: 176, GW: 150 5' 8" female


Yep. Same.  I got down to 154 for my moms wedding, and gained it all back over the course of a couple years. I've dealt with a lot of depression and issues that I should have addressed forever ago, and I'm ready to do this again. I don't eat a lot of junk food necessarily, but I loooove craft beer and have been drinking far too much of it. Starting my first round of 21 day fix next week since portion sizes are by far my biggest issue. No booze, no treats, just making new habits. I am a lot more focused on my weekly goal than my daily... I try to bank up calories if I can predict a bad day (i.e. meeting friends for dinner) or try to claw a few calories back following a bad day.

For me this works really well. It gives me the flexibility to eat what I like and the motivation to keep trying even after a bad day or bad weekend. Nothing better than getting out of the 'red' on my weekly goal :)

I also know that even if I'm a little over at the end of the week, getting even close to my goal is a huge improvement on where I started and that even going over by about 1,000 or 1,500 I might be standing still (in terms of fat loss) but I'm still not going backwards!I was 238 lbs when I got married in 2009.
In 2011, I got down to 210 lbs.
My husband got me pregnant.
I didn't gain any weight in the pregnancy until 7 months in, then BAM ballooned to 265.
Got down to 238 in mid 2012.
Been somewhere between 240-260 ever since.

Yes, I wish I was back at 200 lbs again. No, I don't think I am unattractive, any less sexy/desirable. I am still me. I honestly think I can't lose the weight because I don't see any point in losing it. I am extremely healthy other than the fact that I am obese. All my bloodwork/medical stuff is normal range for someone my age. My husband never stops telling me how gorgeous I am and how much he likes my curves, and I can keep up with a crazy hyper 3 year old.
I am a SAHM, so I don't have to worry about super cute clothes for work. Meh. That being said, I do lose weight if I focus on it, but even one cheat day can mess up my progress and I will often see gains of 3+ lbs, fluctuating. I'd say it was my metabolism/hormones, but I've had it all checked out and it's good. So idk.Congrats on the great progress. Good luck moving forward!Get H2O to help with that 420 [4]Make sure to take care of your skin, many people use olive oil (which is really good for your skin) or firming lotions (I like the Jergens tinted and firming lotions). Drink a ton of water (helps with skin elasticity). Same boat. I've lost about 20, and my butt still measures the exact same size. It's frustrating, but it will shrink eventually. It's evolution at work. Women store fat there for healthy pregnancy, plus other reasons. So I like to look at it like if I was in the Sahara desert, I'd be a biological queen! Ma fat stores keep in' me alive!

Just started strong curves, so far I like it. Just keep at it, you'll find your best body one day!Starvation mode is an absolute fallacy. The only reason people regain weight after dieting is that they go back to eating their 'normal' crappy diet. Keep up your good eating habits, and your weight will remain stable.Yeah it's giving me a bit more freedom around people who aren't losing. I just have to keep telling myself that it's not a chest day and that I still have a calorie goal. Good job! Keep going! :)I mean, equate food addiction with a gambler's addiction. It's not chemical (like heroin) but it's definitely an addiction.

Try to find a way to work these things into your life but in moderate amounts. For example, the french fries: Only get them from one place occasionally--meaning limit them to where they're really good and limit your portion size. I don't really eat fast food anymore but you start to realize how crappy fries are at certain places.

I agree with you, food is something to savor and enjoy. I refuse to spend my life eating only bland food. I think our problem comes when we veg out on 10 servings of shitty potato chips that weren't even that good in the first place. And try to find alternatives... sweet potato fries (not the same, no, but may scratch the itch).

Good luck.Awesome. Remember that this battle is also about reducing caloric intake. There are many of us who have been through the same battle - so we can help there too. I just changed my flair too!! From 15 pounds to 20!

Keep up the good work everyone!!Definitely the least of your worries while smoking is weight.

Think of your lungs man lol.

In all seriousness, 90% of America does fine without the ganja. I think you'll make it like the rest of us and be able to run a 5k at 50, if you stop now. Sort of similar thing happened to me. I am trying to lose and today my flatmate told me he is picking up. I was feeling lazy all day but once I heard that i quickly went out for a long run keeping in order to justify my munch later. Ended up having only dark chocolate so it wasn't too bad!If you have all those snacks prepared in the fridge and get extra high, you'll find the lazier solution is to just eat the carrot sticks...Username does not check outI don't know how to copy and paste but your last sentence is BANG ON! Agree 100%; great advice. Yep, relate to this so much. But I'm doing it the healthy way this time. It's so hard trying to lose weight via healthy eating and exercise when you've had a long time of really bad habits, and losing weight in all the worst ways, but I'm focusing on eating well and not punishing myself if I overeat and absolutely not starving myself or undereating! Good luck to you too! You can do itttttt Yeah I smoke before I eat.. I need to portion better. Fun fact: did you know smoking immediately before eating helps with insulin production?  Was type 2 diabetic on meds and no longer. My doctor showed me the article. LolYea load up some yummy veggies and eat to your hearts content completely guilt free with tons of water. Piizzaaaaaaaa...in the morning. ..pizza in the evening...Smoke right before u eat or right after and drink tons of water to keep ur belly full. Apart from everything I mentioned, I read the very excellent "When Panic Attacks" by Dr. David Burns. It had a lot of useful exercises that basically walked me through what you are describing. I would identify the negative thoughts, see the distortions in those thoughts, and counter them with positive thoughts.

The doctor gave me some Xanax, but I never took it. I have an addictive personality, and I hear that stuff is hard to kick. With the book, a better diet, regular exercise, and quitting booze, caffeine, weed, and tobacco, I was back to normal in 2-3 months. I had my first attack in November. I haven't had an attack since mid December, and I haven't had much anxiety at all since January.

I'm tempted to try drinking again or smoking weed again, but I'm a little scared of that still. For a while after my attacks started, I would get really jittery if I ate a lot of sugar, especially early in the morning. I really like having french toast for breakfast, so that was a bummer, but I recently had a big syrup-soaked pancake breakfast without any unpleasant side-effects. I'm pretty excited about that.

I hope you're doing well. It's alright to be afraid. Just don't be afraid of being afraid.Stretch marks are scar tissue and do not "go away." They will fade with time and become a more normal skin tone and their shape/form may change, but they do not recover into normal skin once they are there. Skin does retract/shrink though, yes, although there is no real way to know what you will be left with after losing weight. You just do what you can and get what you get.Don't worry about the downvotes..I'm a regular user of weed and I agree..which is why I only smoke during the evening when I'm done with everything I need to do and right after I eat. I cannot smoke during the day and keep my life together so I stopped all together..now I can handle it responsibly so I smoke only when I'm able to. As for munchies...I just chug mad water and make sure I have ate already. Holy fuck, are you me? I got depressed just two days before you did and lost a similar amount of weight through calorie cutting.

Keep it up man. You can outrun your weight, and that can help solve your problemsNo tips from me sorry, it's not something that just goes away. If it's too bad you can always talk to a professional. This is what the NHS have to say on the matter though - http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/mentalhealth/pages/dealingwithlowself-esteem.aspxIt is funny, however it doesn't do it fast. So if you just weigh yourself then you'll know something is going on. For me that's going to be my early warning system because I sure didn't listen to my wife's subtle hints. To be honest, this is the reason I gave up smoking a few years ago: I just couldn't control what I ate. I also realised that I didn't enjoy it like I used to so it wasn't too hard to give up, luckilyive just always been under the assumption that if you dont eat your body will go into "starvation mode" and will hold onto all the fat once you begin eating again, but i havent looked into it myself thats just what ive always been toldwhy not just get healthy munchies?

I see people in the comments saying that this is why they quit, idk if theres anything wrong with getting stuff like your favorite fruit or maybe even veggies?I appreciated the quote :) Two NSVs:

1) This is the first week I have managed to not weigh myself. I have a problem with obsessively weighing myself multiple times a day (leading to very unhealthy eating habits), and last week I resolved to weigh myself only once a week. I've actually managed to stick to it and tomorrow is my weigh in day! I'm really really nervous to see the number, but thrilled that I have stuck it out.


and 2) Last night I did my usual running route. I normally run for 30 minutes, but I decided to do 40 last night, and kept running until the very last minute. I plan on doing another 40 mins tonight!

Great work everyone. Keep it up.  :)/r/leavesI went from 300 -&gt; 175 -&gt; 235 (nursing school, ugh) -&gt; 191, officially not obese (again) as of today! Hoping to get down to 155 or so by the end of the year!

I try not to be too hard on myself, the way I see it keeping 65 lbs off and catching it before it got worse is still a victory. I also learned a valuable lesson: maintaining a healthy weight will require life long diligence on my part. This time around I am much more conscious of sustainability and plan to continue daily weighing and calorie tracking indefinitely! I've struggled with being a major stoner and trying to lose weight this last year, it's honestly been the hardest part. When I read your title I understood exactly how dire that situation was, you did well. Proud of you.I never had a problem with the munchies but my best friend did. What helped her was either not smoking on a empty stomach or she would preemptively prepare health-ish snacks to binge on. Sure she would want a plate of nachos or a bag of gummy bears but when you don't have any at home and you're lazy, grapes and hummus will do. Whenever I got the munchies it was mostly because dry mouth made me crave something sweet, and sugar-free gum usually really hit the spot.How did you get the anxiety and panic attacks under control? Mine was to take a step back from the thoughts that were causing them, and question them. Are they true/false? That helped tremendously.Congratulations on your massive weight loss :) It's great that you're now back on track with areas that you felt out of control/lost with in the past. I've never lost 40 pounds (probably about 22), but I know what it feels like to deal with that dark cloud and climb out of it.

Focus on healing, focus on building connections with people you trust, focus on a handful of things you can do to get healthier so you don't get overwhelmed (so you'll know what to tweak if you plateau/get stuck), and the weight loss will continue to happen naturally.

You've done an amazing job.

Good luck.Wow that's some great progress. Keep it up. When you get your dieting down things are going to get a lot better which is crazy to say since you're ding really well.

I'll echo what other people say on here use myfitnesspal. It's been a godsend for me.Every time I do this. I treat it as a victory, good job! Yeah congrats! Nice one, OP!
Last night I got drunk and DIDNT binge eat everything in sight! I mean my friend offered me some chocolate biscuits and I had three instead of seventeen. Yes, none would have been better, but three is a huge, massive self-restraint for me! Yoo hoo! Discipline is like a muscle and the more you train the easier it gets. me :(Keep going, man. I know you can do this.

Ignore this part if you don't want any input: Are you seeing a therapist to address some issues that may have led to your highest weight? I don't know what kind of support you have or what your background is, but therapy plus Overeaters Anonymous or a similar group might help you, as well as a full physical from your doctor to determine if there's anything else like hypothyroidism, hormonal imbalance, or diabetes at play.

Best of luck! Please keep updating!Lost 45 pounds about a year ago. Gained it all back because I got lazy.
Trying again since January. I've lost 30 pounds so far and it's easier this time around.

If I think about going over my calories, I remind myself of how my clothes barely fit at my highest weight. It's not worth that coke or burger, etc.

I don't think about this much. I figure it took me a while to get so fat, so it'll take me a while to get thin.Done! Thanks everyone!I've been yo-yo-ing the same 30lbs since I was a teenager.  Dropped 10lbs since Christmas, then stopped smoking and put a couple back on, now I'm back on top of it again.

I was listening to Bill Burr's podcast a few weeks ago and he said the best thing to do is stop hiding from the scales.  Once you're at your goal weight, set a limit.  His limit was 180lbs.  He'd hit the scales at least once a month, and if his weight ever hit 180, he starts buckling down again.  That way you don't get these "and then before I knew it, I put on 50lbs" stories.

Seemed like a really manageable way to keep yourself in check once you hit your goal.what else was he supposed to use? lol We need more coworkers like that. Good-coworker award for that one.I had to be very drunk and very encouraged to try it. Now it's like a monkey on my backFrench fries, cheese curds (squeekier the better) and gravy.


It's a Canadian thing and it is absolutely a gift to us from Satan. It's just too good and delicious and I took a sleeping pill and really want some now.



*Hey Satan you hungry?*I don't know what poutine (is it fish?) is but it could totally mean vagina based on this conversation There's 2 other than wanting to lose weight more quickly.

1) It's easier to lose weight, then to do some type of weight training to gain back muscle. When you lose weight, not all of it is fat, you will usually lose some lean muscle as well.

2) 100 calorie deficit is really small to work with. A lot of people factor in the fact that sometimes the calorie counts are going to be a little off. I could see myself accidentally eating more than those 100 calories on accident. Being extremely slow is a big part of it. You could just eat at maintenance for your goal weight if you want to do it that way. If you have a lot of weight to lose it'll be fine at first, but as you get closer to your goal weight it's going to take you forever assuming 100% accuracy with calorie counting and 100% accurate tdee, which isn't going to happen.

Every 10lbs of fat loss generally takes away 30cals from your tdee on mfp. So let's say your gw is 150 and your current weight is 160. It's 3500cals for 1lb of weight loss. That means 35k deficit. 35000cal/30cal/day=1,166 days. It's actually even slower than that because you have to take into account that you're only at 30cal over gw maintenance tdee when you're at 160. You're &lt;30cal over when you hit 159, then even lower at 158, etc.

Then there's also the fact that calorie counting has a some estimates built into it like I said above. With something like 100cal deficit it's easy to screw it up with just a little bit of inaccuracy. Increase the deficit so you get some leeway with the inaccuracies.

There's no scientific reasoning behind it. Just those two reasons: accuracy and speed. If you want to practice eating at your goal weight you could do that too. Take a break in the middle of losing weight and spend a month or however long doing just that and then jumping back to your deficit. It'll still be faster than trying to lose it all by eating at your gw maintenance tdee. It's also a good idea if you want to get in some practice for maintenance. Yes!

CICO is both something horrible (when I noticed how many calories I was able to eat in one day because I wasn't aware of many I had eaten for lunch/snacks when I went and had junk food for dinner), and a blessing, because now I really, really can eat whatever I want as long as I stay under my caloric goal, which is stupidly high!

I craved a burger yesterday evening after training, so I went and bought one with a small side of fries... But not before checking that I still had 1200 calories to fill for the day. Sure, it was a guilty pleasure meal, but it fit under my caloric goal, so I enjoyed myself :)Very inspiring. Glad to know that things are going better. I wanted to know if you had altered your diet a all or the changes you saw came mainly from running? Also, how much do you typically try to run?

Thanks!Hey everyone, my name is Squatch. I am 26 years old, 6 foot 5 inches tall, and my starting weight was 305.9. I am on this journey once again, I seem to get started, drop about 25 pounds and then something comes up. I either lose the willpower or something "gets in the way" enough for me to just stop. I seem to never go over the 310 pound mark, but it is extremely hard to keep it off, even when I am on point. This marks try number 6 for me since high school, wish me luck this time around.

I guess I should post this thingy as well

SW: 305.9lbs CW: 300.6lbs GW: 220lbsThanks. That's a lot of raw veggie chewing!Had the same trouble for the longest time.  A few months back, I just went into a session with just a glass of squash, and about half an hour in my stomach was rumbling like crazy.  But I persevered.  Next time, it rumbles a little less.  By the end of the month (which is four smokes for me), there was no rumbling of any kind, no hunger and no discomfort.

Weed definitely increases your appetite.  No doubt.  But from my experience, if you're a habitual smoker, your munchies are more about breaking behavioural patterns that you yourself have created over time, having told yourself that it's all chemical.

So congrats on breaking the cycle - keep going :)Amen to this. 'Oh all I have to do is not have lunch, then I can have a Yorkie bar!' Then I end up having lunch anyway because chocolate isn't really filling, then boom, I'm 400 calories over my daily goal.

This isn't necessarily the case with all chocolate (hell, I treat myself occasionally), but keep within your daily goals. I was 208 and in 7 months I got to 154. 2 years later I'm 226 doing it all over again. It's sad looking at your old jeans. The fact I'm single and have been for a while, even though honestly I'd say I was pretty desirable objectively. It's incredibly frustrating. Going for abdominal definition to make myself more of a catch or however you want to describe it.It really is about making informed choices that work for you. I happen to enjoy having breakfast as it stops me snacking mid-morning, but it seems silly to eat if you don't want to.

Bear in mind, a lot of people give advice that's worked for them. That doesn't mean it would have the same effect on you, especially if you aren't working out and they are, for instance.

Well done on your flair! The first one doesn't seem like much perhaps, but just wait until you're closer to the next one down, then the sky's the limit! Well done you! :)Great progress man! You obviously have some serious motivation because the first steps are the hardest and you've hit the ground running. I found that for me, the best way to eat healthier was

1.  Focus on getting a balanced diet first, *then* cut your calories. Are you getting a good mix of fiber and healthy fats and protein and vitamins/minerals? At least in my own weight loss efforts, if I eat junk food, but less of it, I feel sick and deprived, but if I eat reasonable, satiating portions of nutrient dense foods I feel great.

2. Think of calories as a resource to manage. Its a lot less appealing to eat 500 empty calories when you stop to think of how much work that will take to burn off. It helps keep things in perspective.

3. Make small, sustainable changes to your diet and keep doing that til you find a healthy eating pattern you don't hate. No one gets to an unhealthy weight just by binge eating for a couple of days and no one gets healthy by torturing themselves for a week on a crash diet. Its the small choices made each day that really add up.

Sorry for the wall of text, I wish you the best and hope my words were helpful. If you are having trouble finding tasty and healthy recipes feel free to PM me and I'll happily send you some I've developed as a chef and some I've found that I like.Maaaaan, I'm stuck at 230. I can't break this plateau.For me?

Well, two things, mainly.

There is a girl, I'm in love with her, and while she does like me, she's very beautiful (ridiculously beautiful lol) and when we start dating I want to look my best for her, since she, to me at least, looks the best any woman ever can.

Then there is my dream. My dream is to join the US Air Force, and be a Special Investigations Officer.

My father was in the USAF, my brother is currently in the USAF, my grandfather and his 12 brothers were in the US Army, my cousin is in the US Army, and my other cousin is in the US Marines.

It is a military family, and my dream is to achieve the highest rank anyone in my family ever got to.

Not only that, but I just love everything about my dream job.

For a person of my height, I need to be at 185lbs, I am at 256. I plan to get to 170-175, so I can enlist.

I'd say that is what keeps me going, the uniform, and the girl.I hope you had pizza for breakfast then, otherwise that's just irresponsible All the veg I consume is raw except when I make a 6 egg scramble one night a week.  There I saute red onions, fresh garlic, broccoli, sweet corn and cherry tomatoes...For me it's MFP. I've really embraced making informed decisions about what goes in my mouth, and it's slowly helping me kick my old habits.

Funny how weight can sneak up on you, though.I work shift work, which gives me this same issue. What I've found is that planning my meals in advance automatically puts them on the same date (so if I'm logging for April 2nd it goes from when I wake up on April 2nd until whenever I happen to go to sleep on the 3rd).

When I first started I was changing dates at midnight, but then I would just wait to eat until midnight and ruin my whole next day before I even hit my bed.I got down to 128 from about 150 a couple of years back. I realised I was overweight, I decided to hit the gym after leaving a nasty relationship, and I lost it quickly and easily.

Except I was only out-running the fork. My overall habits didn't overly change, and I would still have a Mars bar or the BBQ ribs for dinner. I went back to uni in third year, suddenly the gym stopped. 'Oh I don't have time, I have to do my dissertation.' 'I'll go tomorrow, my kit is in the wash.' 'Eh, I'm 9 stone 2, I'm a healthy weight, I won't do the gym today.'

My starting weight was hovering around the 160 pound mark, and it's only this time I've adjusted my diet, and will introduce exercise once I've got my boredom/stress eating under control.

And, OP, *you* know you're the same person regardless of weight, and I know that. Have you seen how the world in general views the very overweight and obese? Hell, I'm guilty of it, big time, and the more weight I lose, the worse it gets.

The second time is hardest because I gave up the first time. I was after a quick way out to make an ex jealous - that's no reason to lose weight, and it's why I didn't keep it up. This time around I'm changing because my health could start to suffer, because I want kids in the future, because I don't deserve the chaffing, sweating and uncomfortable life being nearly obese got me.

(I'm female, 5 foot 1. CW 147 and gradually dropping.)NSV : I'm only six weeks into my [weightloss](https://trendweight.com/u/602b9c2fd1e14d/) but people are beginning to notice and I've had three compliments from female friends ("you look like you've lost weight", "you stand taller", "you seem fitter") in three days last week... It's a hell of an ego boost. Still, my family and very close friends haven't commented once about it - I believe they're thinking that it's not going to last...I count midnight to midnight. My first night shift tends to be a low calorie day since I'm not getting dinner. Subsequent shifts I'm logging/eating dinner and snacks, sleeping, then logging breakfast and more snacks. Works for me and works for MFP since they don't have a graveyard shift setting.I've got a few little goals for this month actually.

1) Break my plateau and get down to 135lbs.

2) Increase my weight training, most importantly starting to do chin ups and learn how to properly do deadlifts.

3) Get away from the processed, packaged food (soda is my main issue) and to stay away from anything labeled "diet".This is a day and night change. You look awesome, dude! Congrats! Man bro. Looking fucking awesome. Biggest thing for me was portion control and ignoring all these fad diets.  I tried everything from Atkins, keto, paleo, cabbage, shots, EVERYTHING! As soon as I realized, "Hey silly, stop eating so much" it clicked.  I've known a lot about nutrition, I have worked for a nutritionist for many years in hs and college I just never really took it upon myself to make a proper nutrition call for myself.  I also learned that you can't workout a bad diet.Right here. Lost 80 pounds, gained about 120, now I am down 100 again. This time slow and steady. Lesson learned is I have to be able to maintain while being social and sharing my life with someone. It's easy when you're alone and can 100% control everything, but it isn't realistic in the long run.Hi. I posted this over in the thread about gaining weight back but since I've just broken my lurker status I figure I should post here as well. I'm a single mom of three, about to start school and feeling terribly lazy.


Hey all.. long time lurker here and this'll probably get buried but I wanted to finally chime in on this one.

I lost about 75 lbs total. 40 lbs, then a happy plateau for a couple years, then 35 more and I felt fantastic! I've never had that kind of self-esteem, I never loved myself as much as I did then. I started working for weight watchers as a meeting leader teaching and inspiring hundreds of people every week. I did that for about 10 years and just loved it.

A couple years ago I had some significant stress, got through it ok, actually lost a few more pounds, but was living on adrenaline, cigarettes and booze... but it was ok, I was just getting through right now, I'd sort out my health and shit when I got through the stress. About a year and a half ago I lost my job- BUT- also had a chunk of cash so I could live comfortably, let the adrenaline die down and focus on raising my 3 kids.

I quit smoking. (Yeah?)

I have spent a year and a half on my ass, still a little stressed, overwhelmed, depressed about the crap we've been through. I've gained about 50? lbs. I have one pair of pyjamas, one pair of fat jeans and one sweatshirt that I live in. I'm too embarrassed to leave my house. I was helping hundreds of people every week and many of them live and work in my neighbourhood. I'm disgusted that I let myself get like this, and disgusted that I can't seem to get the motivation to change.. it just seems like such a huge uphill climb now.

*edit, I'm seriously considering going back to smoking just so I don't eat as much. I went 252 days but have been buying a pack here and there lately. So there's my awful story, lol! I guess I'm out of the closet on this sub now! Hi :)Anyone add me! lisalacy07Wow, thank you for your service! I know SF will be difficult but I'm very determined, thank you for your words, they only make me more motivated!Ah, yes, fish, so not vegetarian, but I get what you mean. Are you eating the veggies mostly raw?

I've always eaten huge amounts of vegetables, many grown in my garden for the past 15 years, and in my mother's garden when I was a kid, so I hear you on that.  I imagine the fish is helping a lot, too.I do that same shit and I'm learning my wallet thanks me almost as much as my heart when my eyes get stuck on the mirror.  Recently replaced my nightly Baconators with fruit smoothies and some huge dope spicy chicken tenders.  Definitely try this alright!?  Buy frozen fruit.  Whatever kind yah like.  I got a 6lb variety bag I just scoop a delicious mix out of from BJs for like $15.  Anyways fill half your cup with frozen fruit.  Then smash in half of a peeled banana.  Add some water or milk, just enough to keep things liquidy/flowing in the blender.  Blend or whatever.  Fucking enjoy that shit dude pouring it out of the blender is like porn, and then you taste it and its great.  bet you with that porn metaphor or analogy or whatever the fuck it is was going somewhere lmao ;)

seriously though please try that its fucking delicious im so proud.  Oh and even though you may not give a shit its like under 200 calories and its jam packed with shit thats good for you ^ username checks outI have only smoked about an eighth in the last year or so. For me that is a huge change. I've quit a few times but I love it so much that I use it as a reward to myself for doing well with not over eating. I'll smoke maybe once every 3 or 4 months to just enjoy life a bit more than usual.Me. I lost 75 lbs 2008-09, then slowly gained 25, lost 20, gained 45, lost 25 (up 25 from lowest weight, but up about 10 from reasonable maintenance weight for me). Then I got pregnant and gained 60+ lbs. Right after my daughter was born I was back at my starting weight (225) and have been there now for 9 months. I gotta get moving, but, man, is this discouraging. The first step is to not give a flying fuck what you started at, time to lose it. I weighed 286 lbs at my heaviest, I felt shitty about it, but sulking about it isn't going to get me to lose weight. Eventually you will get there, it might take more time but who the fuck cares? You'll get there!Yes, I began eating this way because of Lent -- **please note, I do eat fish** as edited above.  Yes, the described changes are due to this current diet.  *There really is something to moving HUGE amounts of fresh vegetables through one's digestive tract each day.*  The positive effects of the micronutrients and phytochemicals are something that those on fad diets will never experience, sad to say.

My diet is by no means a dainty vegan affair.  Here is tonight's dinner (April 01, 2015):  http://i.imgur.com/ZzD69OA.jpgAdd me! lisalacy07I eat a peanut butter and chocolate chip sandwich every day I have the calories for it. It's the best. High in protein too!This is a good habit it's exactly what I do.I experience this every time I manage to do the same, it feels like a great accomplishment!I didn't really know what I was doing the first time I lost the weight. I was unemployed and depressed, and I put on an old work shirt one day (that I used to wear quite often) and it was just hanging off of me. I lost close to 20lbs without noticing. I just wasn't eating as much as I used to, since I couldn't be bothered to. I lost the next 20 by going to the gym a bit more regularly and cutting out junk food. I got a job, started eating my feelings again, and bam, the weight came back on over a period of a year and a half. This time I am much more conscious of how weight loss happens. I joined MFP and started keeping track of what I eat, and I'm down 20 lbs in 2 months. I'm not sure if I'll be able to sustain it just yet, as my cooking skills are still pretty nil. I hope to get into better habits in the coming months.Thank you for your thoughtful and helpful comment. I appreciate it. I will work on focusing on the calorie intake and check out some of the guides. Yeah, I guess when I say tone up I mean more just lose a bit of weight so I have a flatter stomach.

Thanks! :)How have the last couple of days gone, OP?You look amazing! Great job!Hey all.. long time lurker here and this'll probably get buried but I wanted to finally chime in on this one.

So there's my awful story, lol! I guess I'm out of the closet on this sub now! Hi :)As long as you log it and don't go over your calories that day you are fine.Check your laws, and check closely. Even in places where pot use/possession isn't outright legal, it's generally decriminalized. For example, in Ohio (where I'm from) possession of less than a certain amount of pot is dealt with trough a civil fine, but there is no criminal adjudication or criminal record. That means we can't lose our CHL for it.  Your local laws may be different.

Happy early birthday!I bought this little pocket book for precisely that reason.

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Carbs-Pocket-Counter-Chris-Cheyette/dp/1908261072

The larger version of the book has 6 photos of each food with different serving sizes

http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/1908261064/ref=pd_aw_fbt__b_img_2?refRID=0NZ6DMCXT3VQ363G5N5M

I also play around with my scale to get a sense of how much different foods weigh. If you're going for a dinner party, casually ask a couple of days before what's on the menu and you can weigh some similar foods yourself to get an idea of a likely serving size.

If it's not something I've cooked myself, I track it the best I can by doing the above. Then I add 10 ml of oil to my guess as a buffer to make my estimate more realistic. Unless you're dieting, you're quite liberal with oil for frying, dressing etc.



One big realization for me was that every time I thought I was "comforting" myself with food after a bad day, I was really punishing myself for having had a bad day. It's like someone hurting you, and you saying, "well, I guess I deserved that, let me go and hurt myself a little more."  Why do that to yourself? Im glad to see I'm not one of just a few stoners in this sub struggling with this issue. HahahThis is awesome dude! Keep it up!

Can I ask how lung you run each day? Are you doing any other exercise? What's your diet like? I've noticed that when I eat better foods my energy and overall outlook are significantly better.

Anyways, amazing work. You look awesome!I found I get drunk on less after a few months of eating less but I still try to avoid it.

It's not the calories from beer I worry about, it's the calories from all the drunken eating that follows it!Adding a bunch of you :) thanksI knew a girl who lost like 50lbs by just switching her munchie food to veggies like carrot sticks and celery and fat free ranch.and hummus and stuff. I wish i had the self control when high to do that :(Im the opposite, being a student I don't have much time to make meals or go to the super convenient gymYou damn Canadians and your delicious combination of fries and cheese curds and gravy. This shouldn't be delicious but it is.1. Reassess your alcohol choices. 700 calories of *anything* is a lot of calories. If you're on 2000/day, that's over a third of your budget. I can get happily drunk as hell on way less than that, and I'm not what you'd call either an amateur drinker or a lightweight. The classic is vodka and soda with lime. If you're married to your beer, embrace lighter beers, whether that's MGD 64 or my personal fave, Guinness, which is 125cal and super tasty.

2. Reassess your frequency. Once every single week is a lot. I've had to cut dramatically back on my own drinking and honestly? I'm super happy I did. Not just for the number on the scale, either. There is a midpoint between "completely sober" and "binge-drinking." You can find it.

3. Learn the art of the weekly calorie budget. If you know you're going to want to get fucked up every Saturday, then borrow some calories ahead of time earlier in the week. It's way easier on your body and your emotional state than skipping a whole meal, likely to be more effective, and more sustainable. Thanks, your story is encouraging me...I've been in a similar boat and am trying to get out.Awesome job! You look great!Hit 55 kg by losing 2 kg (4.4 lb).

Track calories properly every single day with no fudging or excuses.

Follow my weights program (strong curves) religiously and make progress on my lifts. (Not sure how much progress to aim for in a month... Anyone help?)I'm on my 3rd "get fit". 6'1"M

At 23 I got up to 210.

At 25 I got down to 155.

At 30 up to 235.

At 36 down to 170.


At 37 I got up to 225.

At 38 (currently) at 185 with a lot more muscle than ever before.

I've struggled with alcohol though out most of my adult life. It has been directly and indirectly responsible for my weight gain. I'd put away 6-12 beers per day (or more) then eat burgers and pizza  and anything that sounded good. That really piles on the calories. Also I was always hung over so working out would constantly get put off. Terrible way to live.

I've got everything under control (currently alcohol free) and I plan on staying this way. I've realized that I just cannot control my drinking, so why do it at all.




Give orange and red a try!

Edit: I think OP would look nice in red.Ok, a couple of things. First that computerised voice in the video is grating and impersonal.
Secondly my weight goes up so my tv stops working. Now what? Can I do anything to earn it back? Because if I go to the gym and go buy healthy ingredients to make a balanced meal then come home and my tv is still off for 24hours I'm going to be pissed. Then the next day, because the weight doesn't vanish overnight maybe I don't get tv again. And because sometimes starting a new work out increases weight temporarily I still don't get tv even though I'm doing everything right. I'm just going to unplug it.
Basing it purely on weight just won't work, and long term punishment won't work. Theres a kickstarter running for a jar that will unlock if you do X, which is a similar idea but is more appealing because there something I can do. If I check in to the app at the gym, or take X steps I get my remote, if I don't then I don't. Wow!!!! You look fantastic!! Great job!The weight will only "stack back on" if you eat enough food to allow that to happen; we are what we eat, there is no magic to weight gain.

If you plan, measure, and control the food that you eat before, during, and after the surgery, you can control how much weight you will lose, and you can stop yourself from re-gaining it. It will be a lot more challenging due to the surgery, but it's no different in principle from any other kind of weight loss.Oh yeah, I definitely see this as a lifestyle change. I need to count my calories to get my lifestyle more where I want it to be. They totally go hand in hand. I didn't go into this thinking "I'm going to eat super clean, no carbs, no snacks," and I still don't live my life that way, but it has made me WAY more conscious of what I'm eating, and has for sure made a difference. You can do it! Don't hope it's different - make it different. You are the champion of your story and your future. You are in control of this, where you mightn't be all the time in regard to your depression, anxiety or panic. I keep trying to remind myself of the same thing. I can't predict yet or always deal that well with my bad days, but I'm trying to remind myself that I can choose what to eat and do with myself!How tall are you? Thanks in advance Good for you! I was dealing with bad anxiety and panic attacks a couple months ago. I quit drinking and smoking, went back to running and the gym, and started eating real healthy. It's incredible how much better I feel. I'm glad exercise has helped you too, and I wish you all the best!If you're not doing it already, start weighing your food. Double check portion sizes, etc etc. Also, drink at least two liters of water a day.

Do this with complete accuracy for about two weeks, then weigh again. If you haven't lost anything, either go down in calories, or fit in 3x/wk exercise.Preaching to the choir, bud!  I've been dealing with weight loss/gain since I was a teenager.

Was at my lowest when I graduated High School.  Slowly gained quite a bit the next three years of college.  Decided enough was enough the summer before my senior year and dropped 40lbs.  Was on track to drop quite a bit more, but I got in my first relationship in years, and just got too comfortable.  Gained just over half of it back in a year, and now am working to lose the rest of the weight I'd intended to lose in the first place.

I just hit my post-40lb loss weight today! But it felt way, way harder (even though it was just half the weight).  Now back on track to get to my GW!

It is definitely mentally harder the second time around.  My brain keeps beating itself up knowing that this effort I'm making to lose the weight could be bringing me to where I wanted to be a year ago, instead of just getting back to where I've already been!

Keep it up!Drink some water! Yup. Lots of h20 helps.Fighting off this same problem with rice cakes. Single serving size and then I'm off to bed!I weigh myself very frequently and find that I fluctuate about five pounds during the day, but over time the fluctuation range is getting lower. Weighing in more frequently lets you see that trend, and keeps you from getting discouraged when it spikes. Took about a month for me to see that there was a real downward trend happening.Make healthy choices where you can, and try to pay attention to portion sizes when you can't.  Give yourself a little bit of time to adjust here...lots going on, and you are human.

I am so very sorry about your Dad.i havent been ive been googling different calculators they widely vary. ill try the one you said ty
The good news is you are doing everything right!

The location of body fat removal is at the whim of fate/genetics/God whatever you want to call it. You can control *how much* weight you lose, using science and weighing and measuring and exercise and all the best practices that you seem to be following. But you cannot control where it comes from and where it doesn't.

Eventually, once you lose enough fat, you will have sculpted your body down to the natural shape that thin-you has. For women, this will include a decent amount of mandatory minimum fat in key areas that men don't have, and there is a risk you won't like how it's all laid out, but you will definitely look and feel a lot better and healthier at that level, no matter what the final distribution of fat is.

(You *can* control where you gain muscle mass, by exercising those muscles more than others. But it's unlikely this is your current problem, unless you are really, really, really focusing on leg/butt weightlifting.)Nice work!!!Same here oh god this is too funny.  Keep up the good work man, I'm loving it too.Good work keep it up!Yeah I'm cutting it back to just on weekends which has helped a ton.Strawberries and fat-free reddiwhip is my favorite "I'm sooo bad" good treat! A handful of strawberries and a cup(!) of whip=50 calories. If I really need, I double it. A bowl *completely full to the brim* for 100 calories. :DExcellent!  And happy birthday to puppy. :)Yep!
Female 5'6" - I lost about 15/20 pounds over 6 months last year and then gained back 25 between October - January. My worst months!

I'm back at it though and I've lost 2 pounds this week so... Woot!

Starting over and over is better than never starting at all. :)Drink more water :)I eat ~200 calories of junk per day. Just planning for it works for me.It's like the stock market. The trend's your friend. Expect and don't be worried by the daily up/down. It's the average change over time that tells the tale. I weigh in daily, but my "official" day I log my weight is Sundays. But, I don't log my Sunday weight, necessarily. I log my lowest weight of the week (oddly, Wednesdays most of the time). So long as my weekly lowest weight keeps going down, I'm good! :)Don't cry. life can get us down, but you get to choose your journey. Besides you beat everyone on the couch! :)Weigh it with a food scale and always go for raw weight (e.g. 1 oz of raw chicken breast is 31 calories)

Trying to measure calories with cooked meat is too fickle because you don't have precise control over the amount of water that is lost during the cooking process (well done meats = dryer = less water = less weight etc.).

So even though it weighs less after being cooked, that 1 oz raw chicken breast has the same calories after it turns into 0.5 oz cooked I've found that getting rid of fat is all about eating less food, rather than exercise. I mean, obviously exercise is very good for you, but if your goal is to remove excess fat from the body, controlling your food intake is vital. That means measuring what you do eat now, deciding how much less you want to eat going forward, measuring what you will eat to enforce your decision, and deciding when to return to normal based on how you look/feel/weigh.

If your wedding is at the beginning of September, you can realistically lose up to 20-40 lbs between now and then, if you focus, work hard, and stay the course. There are lots of guides over on the right of this subreddit.

One last thing worth mentioning: when people say they want to "tone up", that can be confusing because it doesn't really mean anything. You can remove fat from your whole body (which is done by keeping calories eaten below calories burned over a period of time) and you can add muscle to a specific part of your body (which is done by exercising the specific part of your body that you want to become larger and stronger). But you can't remove fat from a specific part of your body (without surgery). It's just not biologically possible. So that's an expectation you need to keep in mind as you progress.don't pay attention to the exercise numbers from MFP. Some day I hope to have this problem.  Can't mess with it currently, it's not legal and if I get caught I lose my conceal carry permit.  Planning on a trip to CO for my 40th next year though.  The hunger pangs will go away.  At 5'6" and 300+, I think micromanaging the process is the wrong way to go here.  Eat at a deficit and get a good amount of protein.  Reassess later when your need to lose isn't as urgent.Lol i want my stuff back...yes that his the nail on the head! *nods with mouth full of cheese*If you want to do it, do it.  If you don't, then don't.  Losing weight is work.  It requires you to be actively engaged with monitoring your food choices, eating at a caloric deficit, and doing exercise.  If that's too much for you, I understand, but don't complain when you don't get the results.  If you want the results, read the FAQ here, control your diet, do some exercise, and repeat that until you're done.

It's not complicated.  Either you want it or you don't, and for right now, it doesn't sound like you do.A couple of years ago, I lost around 60 pounds. Going from 263 to 198. It took just under a year I think to lose that much, and it was really just from eating healthier and exercising. It almost seems like a dream now, as that was the first time in my adult life and probably since I was 13 that I had seen anything under 200 pounds. Then I went back to college, got really involved in extra activities, and it was always "I'm too tired to exercise; too tired to cook a healthy dinner" and then I met my boyfriend and gained relationship comfort weight, and it just all added up. Sometimes I get so angry at myself...like "I was there! Under 200 pounds! How did I gain so much back?!" Once I got under 200, it was like...I tried less hard, I thought I had it all figured out, and vowed that I would never get over 200 again. I now weigh 241. Once I got back up to just under 250, it was such a huge wake up call and I refused to keep going and becoming even heavier than my previous heaviest weight. That was about a month and a half ago, and so far so good! I try to look at the fact that I know I *can* get under 200 as motivation, instead of being angry about gaining back. This time, I won't let stress, school, or complacency get in the way!the trick to snacking while elevated is to find the right snack.  Carrots are the best, but don't satisfy many of the cravings. I find soy nuts to be fairly effective personally. What has worked for myself and my partner is to prepare our dinner, step outside for our quick sesh, and go inside to enjoy our already prepared food. Having a large water (drink your water!) will help keep the munchies and cotton mouth at bay during the rest of your high.Your skinny friends drink and don't gain weight because they don't consume over maintenance.

And no, you're not resigned to live a life where you never drink, but if you want to get shitcanned at least once a week, and you drink enough booze to get a 255 lb person shitcanned, then that's what you want and you live with the consequences.  Make a choice and own it.This is hard. Unlike others who see no difference between "out there in the world" and at home - I do. I lived it. I am more OK when I'm alert, dressed up, and out there in the world busy with whatever concerns. It's at home when I'm tired or relaxing or bored or sitting in pajamas, or watching a netflix or playing video games that I am at risk of snacking or eating bad stuff that's in the house. It's very hard to keep your guard up full-time like that. Without a safe zone your risk is up.

I lived with others for a while that had bad eating habits. It affected my progress. I couldn't seem to get them to give me dedicated space in the pantry, or the fridge, or the freezer for myself. And the kitchen was usually cluttered so it made preparing food troublesome.

Ultimately I moved out, and it's been wonderful. In retrospect though, I could've given myself a better shot by being proactive:  buying a mini-fridge that only has "safe" foods, and setting aside a cabinet in my room as a small pantry.Your body will adapt to any kind of exercise regime; time-of-day might matter at first, in terms of making you drowsy at weird times or whatever, but any habits you form will eventually become strength. If you do X every day, you will become good at doing X every day, for any value of X (within reason; don't hurt yourself).

An elliptical machine primarily exercises your heart (not so much your legs or arms), which is very important for overall health. It also burns some fat in real-time, but that's a minor thing overall; you need to be a very serious athlete before real-time exercise calories burned will really have a big impact on your daily surplus/deficit. One minute of indiscretion in the kitchen can wipe out a one-hour workout, in terms of calories.

Building your heart muscle is not only good because it's healthy, but it's also good because it will increase the baseline calorie-consumption of your heart every day in the future (stronger muscles use more energy all the time). This is an investment that will burn extra calories 24 hours a day going forward.

The same is true of all your other muscles, if you choose to exercise them too. Unlike your heart, those other muscles are all exercised via weightlifting rather than running/ellipticalling. Doing this is a good idea, but certainly not mandatory. As you strengthen these muscles, they will grow and become heavier, so there may be some interference at the bathroom scale when you weigh yourself. This is just a measuring error and does not mean you are failing to lose fat.Go you!

This past weekend I went to my favorite donut shop to get my fianc and his daughter breakfast. The pride I felt for myself after tackling that hurdle was sweeter than the donuts would have been.

Kudos, fellow donut denier!Here's your tough love: you are paying Chick-Fil-A money to ruin your memories of your wedding.  You are literally giving them your hard earned pay and in return, they're going to make you look awful in your wedding dress and your wedding pictures, and those albums you're going to spend tons of money on are never going to come out of the drawer because you wanted fucking waffle fries more than dignity and happy memories.

Count me in. Just this Monday I started again and I've since lost 6 pounds. I weighed 360 pounds at my maximum and three years ago I got to my goal weight of 150 pounds! (Actually 148!) But then I started a new job (my first "real" job ever), and it was so stressful. I found I didn't have time to workout because I was working 12-14 hour days and was exhausted. I then gave up eating healthy and just ate whatever I could get. Three years later, and 200 pounds back... I'm now 350 again. Life was horrible and I couldn't take it any more. Who can gain back 200 pounds? I remember thinking, "I'll NEVER let that happen to me!" but it did. I let stress, health issues, and work get in the way to being happy. I threw it all away to eat some food, and then keep eating it.

This has been the most stressful week I've had this entire teaching year, but I have not given in to temptation at all this week, I have walked 4 miles every day and I have stayed within and below my calorie range. I'm NOT letting it get me again.I've got willpower. It's just how it gets spent throughout the rest of the day that leaves little to none for food.

Before I lost majority of my fat, I wasnt a very busy individual. Now I've got a lot on my plate (heh!) and I try to do all those other things well. Dragging my ass into the door after work and school and busting my balls in those leaves me spent. Same here! This post helped me feel less alone in that regard. Thanks, cheers, and happy new journey! idk im huge and these calculators seem off. it isnt possible i burned 1k cals in 2hrs of hiking is it?Heheh xDI gained 5 pounds back recently due to being lazy in college, hoping to keep it off this time if my plateau would end.Same yo. Stoned right now fighting every urge to eat everythingRight here. Gained about 80 back of my 120 loss. Nothing feels worse. Nothing. It's so much harder this time. I don't know about you, but it also made me lazy as balls. Paired with intense food cravings, it was really bad. I wasn't just a weekend stoner either, so I know how pronounced the effects can be.

edit: isn't there a single subreddit where  speaking truthfully about weed's negative effects doesn't get you downvoted? Haha yeah I wear a lot of black as well, but I'm trying to expand a bit..so far I now have black, blue, gray, and white..Hey wow, I can relate, thanks for posting :) I am around to talk most days, and I am rooting for you and me to get out of this slump!I can't wait to fill my closet with that blue/teal color (of his shirt) again. Too much black right now... X31. I hit the gym after a 12 night shift and it has never done me wrong, cup of coffee and you should be good to go.

2. Everyone should be lifting weights, you, me, women, our grandmothers, everyone.You know, soon you will have to carry around a stick. The beat the girls away with. Do you mind me asking what medication caused the weight gain?Oh man. Okay. I'm a 21 yr old girl, 5'4" for weight reference. In 12th grade, I was 190. I did herbal magic, got down to 155 and was loving the he'll out of my life. I maintained it, without pills, for the summer. Then came university. I ballooned up to 210 by the time I left at the end of my first year and boy was that the most depressing year of my life (I also dropped out.) that was April. In October I tried out keto until I got really sick in December, dropped to 180. Solid progress. Went to about 170 around April, then got gall stones. It was fucked up too - I was constantly sick, couldn't eat for days. I dropped to 155, losing most of the muscle I had before, and I was unhealthy as shit. Got gallbladder taken out in august, a week before I was starting college again. After eating like a normal person, I got back up to 185, unfortunately. Yeah, I'm healthy now, which is great. But I started working out, eating right, and putting a lot of effort into losing weight to get back to my happy healthy 155, and after a few months of trying I'm rewarded with gaining a pound. I'm not pleased.you need to eat back your exercise calories, MFP doesn't take exercise into account. Google the IIFYM TDEE calculator, calcuate TDEE-1000 cals. that's how many calories you should eat every day to lose 2 pounds per week. don't eat less than this number.Heyyyy. I promised myself if I get under the amount I was at my lightest I'll get a PS4. I'm getting that PS4 before Phantom Pain comes out, I promise me that.&gt; It's harder now than it was last time, and idk if I will be able to keep it up, mostly because I'm still heartbroken and just want to give everything up...

DON'T! This is how I went form 159 to 193. Literally, this. Having to re-lose it again sucks. I was depressed, ate food because I was already so unhappy, why restrict the foods I like too? Because eventually, I was happy again! And then I was also fat again, uuhhg!

I wish I had had someone to tell me to watch myself. To not let this sadness bring me down even further. Fight it. Become a better you, so that when you are happy again, you'll also be that much closer to a healthy weight, too! Find someone in your life who you trust, and ask them to bluntly not allow you to do this. Have them keep you in check, if you need. You can do it. Seriously. :)This is the first tme I've kept a New Year's resolution for more than just the month of January! :) I am seriously pumped at how far I've come and am enjoying being about halfway to my goal!you can totally do it! I'm 5'1'' and on the same journey, but do not expect to lose 70 pounds in just a few months and don't expect to lose weight every week. it doesn't work like that. aim for 2 pounds a week of weight loss at the very most, and do not eat under 1200 calories. read the FAQ, it has all the answers you need when it comes to the basics. Something like 80% of all cases of PF reported by doctors involve overweight individuals. Long distance runners are also prone to get it, so be careful on that 10k training. Just read that the other day. Have you been able to identify why you weren't able to maintain each time? Got a plan for maintenance this time? I can relate to this; I hadn't used my scale in a while, and was discouraged to learn I was actually 289 lbs instead of "around 270". But this was the push I needed to get back on the wagon.

So, the flip side of this is that it gives you an even stronger motivation to lose weight. And while your goal weight may be twice as far away in pounds (and probably weeks) than you thought, the effort required doesn't scale linearly. Once you've settled into a smooth weight-loss mode, keeping going is not nearly as hard as starting.
12 pounds is a lot to lose in a month, especially if you are packing on muscle as well. Set a goal of 6 pounds this month with weekly weighings.

Plan your meals so there isn't any contamination from outside food or don't carry cash around with you.

What gym rountine are you following, if you dont mind me asking?Ah yes. That story.

I went from 165ish to 140 in 2010 and maintained that till 2012, when I went further down to 135. I was looking and feeling great and was about 5lbs from my goal weight. THEN I went abroad to study in 2013. It was cold most of the year so I never really noticed I was gaining weight. I ran an hour everyday, so my weight gain for most of the year was probably 5-7lbs.

The last month, though, during my thesis, I was eating like a madwoman while crying and trying to finish my work and I thought I'd gain about 10lbs which I could lose easily once I got back. I ended up gaining almost 30lbs and found myself at my highest EVER weight of 172!!!! At 5'6"!!! I almost fell off my scale!!

I quickly lost 20 of those in about 3 months mainly through running and diet. A looooong plateau, and then I lost about 5 more lbs. Now I'm at 145ish and stuck for a bit because I'm always hangry :(

I hate that I was so close to my goal and instead of losing like 5lbs I gained 30!! Never again :/Fuck, now I want cheez-itsGo ahead and let yourself binge eat. Just be sure it's on veggies ;)I did. Last year I lost quite a bit of weight and even dropped below 200 for a while. Since then I've had some big changes in my life that threw me off and I've gained a considerable amount back.

I'm currently trying to find that level of willpower again but my brain grew accustomed to junk food again which is making it a bit harder!

Reading this thread I thought about a sentiment I've read a number of times on this sub in different formsthat it's not about how fast you lose but your ability to make changes that are sustainable for life.

In retrospect, yeah, it really sucks that I've probably gained 30lbs back by now. But, in the process I've learned that my Achilles heel is stress. I buckled and ran back to my old eating habits for comfort. Now that I'm aware that this is a problem for me I can stop it before it starts again in the future.

Im like this right now too. Its really hard for me to deal with the feelings of hunger when high. Im not sure what to do tbh. Once  i start thinking of food its like its pulling me in lolI dropped from 225 to 190lbs right before I got married (nothing to do with wedding as I didn't have one) from being really active with an active job, I had a gym in my apartment building and ate well. I've dropped that same 10-15lbs a number of times previously.

Then I got married and started eating how my husband eats - who is a thin yet bottomless pit. My work became inactive. Now have a car when I used to walk everywhere. Now live in a crappy neighborhood and not near anything to walk to. I started martial arts and lifting, but kept getting derailed by injuries in martial arts. Then I went on 2 cruises and packed back on to 217lbs 2 years later. Now I'm back here again.How did you come up with 1600 calories/day are your goal? Sorry to say that being 5'5, F, and 144lbs makes 1600 very close to the amount you'd need to *maintain* your current weight.

Calculate how many calories you need to lose weight, then subtract 500 calories from that each day to lose 1lb per week. ill pm youMe too. Weed was truly my gateway drug to stretch pants. Sober, I can resist Cheez-Its like they're the plague. Stoned, they're a necessity. Yes, it's normal to be hungry when you're at a more than 1000 calorie/day deficit. This is not a sprint to the finish line - these are lifelong changes you need to make to the way you eat so find a way that's *sustainable* above all else. If a 1300 calorie/day deficit is not sustainable (not many people at all would find it sustainable), then eat all the calories that MFP is telling you to. The hardest part is putting on your shoes. Put them on and you'll be out the door and back before you know it. Keep it up. But just a question, why every day? Take a couple of rest days in a week.Four-ish years ago, I was on an incredibly strong weight loss kick for about eight months. I was at 400 when I started and got down to 308. I was exercising every day, busting my ass on weights, and eating super healthy.

Three things happened in very rapid succession.

1. Easter. My well-meaning extended family, who were all thrilled about my progress, gave me candy. I was quite good about it, all things considered, but it reawakened my sweet tooth.

2. I started my first serious job. I never felt comfortable eating in the break room, and I had just gained a ton of disposable income, so I went out to eat. A lot. I was also under more pressure, so my stress eating kicked in and pushed me toward unhealthy food.

3. I helped my ex move. We'd broken up 1.5 years before after a long committed relationship because she realized that she wasn't attracted to me. (Turned out to be more complicated, and we're actually back together now, which is wonderful.) She mentioned that she was crushing on one of the other people helping, and I suddenly realized that my real underlying motivation for the weight loss was to try to get her back. And at the time, that seemed genuinely impossible. My will to keep trying took a severe hit.

In January, I was at 385. I'm now at 364. I'm going to make it stick this time.Dont. It's like cocaine, once you know how fucking amazing it is you will always want moreCongratulations keep up the good workStretching. Lots of articles and videos for good stretches on the net. Even if you aren't formally exercising it will still improve circulation and flexibility. Also stay hydrated. Your body wants water.Im pretty sure mfp already calculates what you need to lose two pounds per week, so going 300cal under that number is helpfull but not 100% necessary. Congrats!!! You can see it so much in your face, keep up the great work my friend!Yes indeed. Lost 40 lbs between my last year of high school and first year of university. Oddly enough, it wasn't the freshman 15 that got me. Second year I got into my first relationship, went on birth control (put on almost 10 lbs because of this alone), dad had stroke.  Lost a lot of time and motivation to stick to healthy eating and regular exercise, and it just kept getting worse. I said enough is enough when I was 10 lbs away from gaining everything back entirely and have stuck as closely as I ever have to counting calories with MFP. I've logged every day for the past month and got back into exercising at least 3 times a week (I put on an episode of Game of Thrones to review for the new season and go for an hour on the treadmill, it's an incredible distraction!) and am down 5 lbs. The guilt just kept welling up inside of me until I couldn't take it anymore. I feel so much better about myself already.AmbienYep. I don't really know how common it is, but in my area (Southern California) I saw it a lot. Went from 321 --&gt; 270 three years ago.

I was underemployed and went through some hard times, depression, anxiety and low self esteem go the better of me and for the last three years I've been going back and forth, never being able to stick to any one routine for more than 2-3 weeks.

On January 5 of this year I stepped on the scale at a whopping 329. Down to 285 as of this morning, and I can't wait to drop below 270 just to get over the feeling that I'm backtracking. What kind of pills I don't have any advice or words of wisdom but I felt sad that no one had commented giving you encouragement -
You're doing the right thing by attempting to take charge of your health! You owe it to yourself but even more so to your family so you can run around and enjoy your kids :)
Keep up the good work, I'd love to hear any progress you've made!
Quit eating at restaurants entirely.
Meal planning. Do it. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.
Precook your meals and portion them. (use a scale and measuring cups)
Weight training.
Way she goes, boys.
You're doing great. My start weight was 185. I'm down to 180 now. My goal weight is 150. What's your height? &gt; I guess I cannot afford to stop weighing myself

Bingo. I think this will be the key to successfully maintaining, for me.It's only three weeks. Think about how good that chicken will taste after you haven't had it for three weeks. That will be the best reward meal ever!

Ideally you want to change your habits for good, but this is a time crunch. For now, just keep the goal for three weeks.I have an excel chart that charts out almost every bit of weight-loss data I could think of (2 tiers of targeted weekly weight loss goals, current weight, projected weight based on goals, pant size, BMI, *everything*, lol!).

Anyways... On the "projected weights" column, I have certain weights highlighted in certain ways. For example, every time I'm in the next "10's" (ex. going from the 180's to the 170's, the 170's to the 160's, etc.). So, I also have highlighted goals I've met before, that I need to re-achieve. 183, my old highest weight. 159, my old lowest weight when I was in the middle of losing weight. 130, my lowest adult weight... I have *a lot* of mini goals, and I feel this way it's motivational. :)235 in 1996

211 now, working on it regularly now.  Which reminds me, it's getting late, time to hit the bike.You are quite a character haha! Congratulations on your progress!try doing extra cardio on days that you know you're gonna be drinking more that night, maybe? even if its just an extra 300 calories that makes the blow a lot less. and stick to clear alcohols/diet drinks if you can:D Thank you!This was just one of many reasons I stopped smoking weed.See, I'd like to say that if I had the munchies, I wouldn't care and I'd just munch out on a bag of carrots, but I know that's not gonna satisfy the cravings. lolHey, I'm 5 foot 4 and started at 143 pounds. I'm doing 1200 calories and am currently down 10 pounds.Sorry, but you're really off base on this.

Nutritional info on raw food is based off of the raw weights. Just because most people don't eat raw chicken doesn't mean that's not what the package intends.

However the food is packaged, that's what the calories are for. Unless it specifically says otherwise, because there's not way to tell what something will weigh post cooking (different water loss, different cooking methods, etc.).

If you cook an 8 ounce chicken breast and it's 5 ounces after cooking and you log it at 5 ounces based on the package nutritional info, you're not accounting for a full 3 ounces worth of calories.Love that smile! Keep going!Same with me. I know that the next time I reach my goal weight, I'll still need to log my TDEE calories. And keep weighing in periodically also.3am poutine time sounds amazing. From someone who's never even had poutine.Try lifting weights! Sometimes it can make a huge difference in physique and the effects are sometimes surprising. There are some awesome transformations for females that started lifting heavy weights (and no, you won't get bulky).

Also, are you sure that waist measurement is correct? I'm having a hard time imagining such a small female with that size (~a size 12 in female sizing?!) so maybe it's possible you have lost a little bit there.No I changed my wardrobe :) basic t-shirts and jeans now. I didn't think anyone would notice to be honest.Almost all information for calories and such is how the product is packaged, so in this case, raw. If it weighs 8 ounces, it's irrelevant what it weight after cooking. Weigh it raw and log it based off of that.Sadly I am in this boat, I also lost 40 lbs about 5 years ago and gained most of it back over the last 2 (more details here http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/30ya5q/i_have_a_shameful_confession_ive_backslid_a_lot/cpxgmg7)

I started seriously trying to lose the weight a month ago and on one hand it is good to know I was successful once so I can do it again. On the other hand, it is discouraging because it's less novel and exciting this time. Bah. But we will get there and we know what it takes to succeed!I was down 130, put 25 back on...knew I didn't want to be a ham again... 9lb back to my previous best and 20 from goal

Yeah. I work in a bar.. so it's usually fast food at the end of the night. Somewhere open 24 hours. No bueno. Or I'll go to a gas station and get munchies then eat them ALL. It's a problem.I can totally relate to this.

My dad is quickly losing the use of his limbs. He's in my city being tested for a clinical trial. If he doesn't get in, he'll be in a wheelchair in a matter of weeks. I haven't seen him in awhile, so seeing him use a walking and having to cut up his food last night at dinner has devastated me emotionally. I sobbed all day long.

BUT, I'm still going to the gym and I'm still following my diet. I can control my activity level and I can control what goes in my mouth.

So tomorrow I will get up again and do my best at the gym.

You do the same thing. And hang in there. This is making me so nervous for the future as a student with access to a super convenient gym.Interesting, so you're the classic lacto-ovo vegetarian.  Apart from a low-fat diet, I suppose you aren't also calorie counting or anything?

Edit: I looked back at some of your posts. Seems you're temporarily vegetarian because of Lent? Anyway, wondering if the effects you're talking about relate to this vegetarian diet or something else.They don't gain weight because they aren't doing it every day. They aren't destroying their TDEE every day. It's an occasional thing. That's how it works. You can drink over your calories once a week. One day won't destroy a week of progress.

700 over on MFP is 200 over TDEE or 300 under TDEE.  It's not the end of the world. I weight 232, my goal was 210 and was hoping for it by May 26th. I've accepted that I won't meet that goal so my new short time goal is to get into the 220's whenever possible I found the stairs! There's 6 floors!Cut the crap. Nobody else can motivate you. You have to want it. Quit the tomorrow stuff. Do it now. "I'm gonna eat CFA. I'll do better tomorrow". No. "No CFA tonight. "Yes, it can very hard to not think of it that way. Believe me when I say that I know exactly how you feel. If it's any consolation, just know that you are not the only one wrestling with this. You got a kindred spirit right here. Just because it's a bit harder climbing into the wagon this time doesn't mean we can't do it right?! We'll be back in there soon enough! Well, at least that's what I try to tell myself.http://sweetgreen.com/

Even if you don't live near one (and there are other places too - chopt I think is one?) the options that they have for salads are eye-opening. You could experiment with versions of theirs!

I fucking love salads. I always have. But I _really_ fucking love a fun salad, a not-just-lettuce-cucumbers-and-carrots salad, and it's so yummy to have a hearty, healthy, AH-MAZING salad for a meal.Just doing something every day, no matter how small really helped me. Getting that consistency is so key. Once you get going, it gives you the momentum to keep it up. Every day there is a victory to be had. Good job on yours today :)This was a worry my wife had, also while eating under 2000 calories I experience a lot of discomfort from hunger pains.

Maybe sticking to 2000 with discipline would be better in the long run? It's a struggle, man. A few weeks ago before I really started getting serious about losing, I made like two Ben and Jerrys runs at 2 AM. I finally acknowledged how ridiculous that isI've lost 17 lbs so far. I was 5'6, 220lbs and now 203 lbs and my face has cleared up alot. I stopped drinking mountain dew and now drink tons of water as well. I use to hate water. Now it's all I want. About once a week I treat myself to a mango sweet tea though. Oh and I count calories. I haven't started much exercise yet. Do you have any recommendations on what exercises to start with for someone out of shape and just starting out?I've been taking a lot better care of my health lately by going to the doctor a lot more frequently than in the past. Before, I avoided going to the doctor as much as possible because I felt it was too much of a hassle and I just didn't care about anything. But in the past couple months I've been feeling a lot more proactive and capable of getting things done. My knee is fully healed from the infection. I've been seeing a physical therapist for my back and neck and that's been slowly getting better too as I strengthen those problem areas. Thanks for asking :)Have you purchased new clothes?  Sometimes weight loss is less noticable if you're wearing the same clothes as it covers your body up.  Great job, by the way!I had just one today! I'm actually really confused about what a Kit Kat Mini is calorie-wise, so I entered double what I thought it was into MFP and said, "Hannah, you will have one and that will do it." And it did! It's hard but sometimes I can do it and I feel SO good when I do.Most nutrition information for meat is for the raw weight. Unless it specifically says cooked on the nutrition label.  I love youHow are you doing with the physical pain?Okay good. How long have you set yourself to reach your goal?True for me too, and I'm not sure that it's just the weight loss and better health so much as realising that, with hard work, something I never thought I could do is happening.I like Mason jars because they're cheaper than pyrex (and I too am weird about plastic nowadays), but do you just stack stuff on top of each other and then dump in out on your plate when you're ready to eat it?  Or do you just use them for soups?2,000 calories isn't some magical number under which you'll have muscle loss.  But 1,500 calories that does seem like a very small amount for someone who weighs in the 280s.  1500 was my calculated 1,000 calorie deficit once I got below 200.  When I weighed 280, I was eating over 2,000 a day and still losing 2 pounds a week.If you are exercising more you are likely sweating more and possibly need hydration? Fibre is great but water is key! I have never been an everyday #2 type of person until about 3 weeks ago when I started drinking 1.5 litres of water 3 times a day. Pasta isn't intended to be consumed as it's sold, but that's how you weigh it for nutritional information.Myfitnesspal I use it to track my caloriesI go before and after work. However, when I start my afternoon workout I'm usually drained. My second wind kicks right after I warm up. If I'm super drained, I try to take a pre-workout or an energy drink. Thank you for the reminder, I've been so frustrated with the scale lately, this is exactly what I needed to hear :)Dang girl good work! Q: where did you get the lacey crop top from its really prettyThanks!I learned to take it easy. My first month I did 3-6 miles/interval or straight run for seven days a week. I've injured myself and learned that rest is as important as consistency. I think cutting the calories will help.  1200 sounds more reasonable for your height/weight.  For reference, I'm your height and weigh 176 and eat around 1300 calories, plus eating back some (but not all) of my exercise calories.  I tend to lose about 0.5 to 1 pound a week.

Edit:  keep in mind, if you do 1200, you really should eat back the exercise on the days you aren't sedentary.  Also, dropping from 1600 to 1200 will be a jolt!  Consider dropping by 100 calories a week, or every two weeks, to get there and give you some time to adjust to fewer calories.What did he say?Lost 130 lbs, from 330 to 200. Moved two Alaska for two years. Gained 50 lbs back. Moved back to the lower 48 and am very slowly dropping it. Those Alaskan winters are harsh. Congratulations! Don't forget to take measurements and body fat, use all avenues to track and compare your progress! Especially when your not feeling motivated and that scale hasn't changed knowing your body fat is down or inches are down will give you that awesome boost!  You can do it! I literally went through the same thing last week. I just started getting serious about counting my macros and by the end of the week I was so constipated. I'm NEVER constipated so it really confused me. I figured it was from having oatmeal everyday. Could that be the same for you?THIS! don't get me wrong... my dietary choices aren't great right now anyway (lurker) but my real shame cones from what I eat when I'm high. I smoke to replace a few different meds and I smoke every night.  It really helps. But the food thing.... oh the food thing. You are exactly right...Work sucks; girlfriend left me but a coworker told me one thing : "With all the stress in your life, you could have drank or drugged your way into a bigger hole. Rather, you chose to cope with your stress with exercise and diet. Your appearance is noticeable and you're only paving your way to something better."

woah this post is pretty awesomeFascinating to hear that others are also reaping these benefits! Really cool! I also feel:

- A great deal more energy like others have mentioned.

- No more joint pain.  No inflammation.

- When I awake, my head is as clear as a bell.

- I concentrate easier and longer.

- I sleep very soundly.

- I haven't given a single moment's notice to irregularity, heartburn, upset stomachs or anything else along those lines since I began.

- It even seems like my hearing is more acute.Good job! Just some advice from a rabid overeater and lover of all junk food - be slow and deliberate with your changes. For me personally, trying to completely 180 my diet overnight is completely disastrous. The first thing I did was install MyFitnessPal and track my normal eating for a week. It really helped put things into perspective and made me realize how badly I needed to change. Then my diet changes were small. Double my water intake and reduce soda to 20oz a day. I could easily drink three times that much soda so 20oz was both a huge improvement and a bit of a challenge. Now, I hardly ever crave soda but don't deny myself some if I'm really in the mood. The next step was limiting my weekly fast food intake, since I generally ate it 1-2 times per day. I'm still working on my diet but even though it's not perfect yet, I'm losing weight and I both feel better and have more energy. You've totally got this. If you ever want someone to chat with, feel free to PM me. :)I'm doing intermittent fasting, havnt eaten since 7am today(warrior diet style) and my parents cooked pizza, cheesey garlic bread, and my dad made his famous lasagna also(OMG!) For supper And guess what? It was my decision not to cave. Its my choice to avoid it and live healthier. Its ultimately your choice to let it bother you. Show some back bone, sniff in the lovely smell of the food, appreciate it, and go for a run. You got this. So, I was a thin kid until puberty. Then BAM I was always probably 10 pounds over weight. Then during summer between junior and senior year of high school I decided I was done always being "a little fat". So I started eating smaller portions, walking 3 miles a day, and just making smarter choices. But that was when it was easy, no calorie counting or anything. I lost 20 lbs, and got down to 130.

So, I maintained for about 2 years without even trying. Then I met my college boyfriend. He exclusively ate out. Exclusively. So yeah, over the next 6 years of our relationship I gained 60 pounds. I started to lose that weight, lost 20 pounds... Then he cheated on me. It destroyed me. I had no appetite, and lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks (this with *forcing* myself to eat). I got really depressed, and losing weight that fast scared me. So I made myself eat really calorie-high stuff to try and counter-act it. And then I just kept eating that stuff to be happy. Got back up to my original highest weight.

Now I'm down 15 pounds from that.

The first time I lost weight, I gained back because I didn't keep weighing myself. I didn't keep things in check. The second time I lost and gained, I was depressed, and I'm not sure I could have done anything to have avoided gaining.

But now? I'm in a great place. I'm losing very consistently. I *know* what it's like to be 130, and I *know* I want to be there again (I'm actually aiming for 120, so my snug size 8 will be a comfortable size 8). I know I can do it. And I know that the key to keeping the weight off is to never stop weighing myself (personally).

I might only weigh myself once a month at that point, but I have a solid plan. This time, if I start gaining, I'll nip it in the bud before it goes over 5+ lbs. This time, I actually know what my TDEE will be, and will have an actual calorie goal to aim for. The reason I will never gain again is because I now know what it actually means to *maintain* your weight. It's not just "staying the same weight somehow", it's maintenance. It's a series of steps to ensure weight gain doesn't happen in excess again. :)I'm not so sure about vegetarian diets (since I'm not a vegetarian), but I hear all the time that peanuts are packed with protein. If I eat too many peanuts or too much peanut product, I get really bad heartburn.

You may want to talk to your general practitioner about this, see if they can recommend you to a nutritionist, especially one familiar with vegetarian and vegan diets.I've gained approx. 15-20 back from the 100 I lost after my Gastric Bypass surgery and am working on losing that (and more, since I am not quite at my ultimate goal). I started counting calories again since my portions have gotten much larger since the surgery... Thankfully I have much more tools in my arsenal and am not nearly as depressed and hopeless as I once was. Knowing you have it in you to do it at least once makes a huge difference, I think.I mean, how do you track what you are eating?
Late 2013 I started losing weight, ended up losing 50 pounds.  Broke up, got into a very stressful year of school, gained almost all of it back.  Life is ebb and flow, man.  I've been encouraged just knowing that I did it once and I can do it again.^FactChange up where you are getting your protein.

I get nearly all my protein from broccoli, kale, spinach, nuts etc.

Steam up some vegetables and go poop!

If that doesnt work drink a cup of coffee and do some full body stretches, that will release your bowels.I'm not saying you're wrong but, the pics don't tell us enough for you suggest that he's changed his wardrobe.

Pic 1: gray t-shirt w/ print

Pic 2: blue t-shirt Everything is fine until I have a binge or something, then I exhaust myself trying to lose all the water weight as fast as possible and end up physically and mentally wrecked. At that point I load up on food in order to get over the exhaustion and it just repeats over and over.Wow!!! Great job!As long as a lot of your calories are from protein, you shouldn't notice much muscle loss. Me! started in 2013 from 190 to 167 (23lbs) gained it all back plus 8.8lbs. Now I'm from 198.8 to 169.8 (29lbs)

I'm so glad I finally talked myself in starting over. Anyone that is thinking "now is not the time to start changing my lifestyle" it is always the time.Me :(

I'm 5'10

I went from 267 to 195

Then from 195 to 325 in 2.5 years.

I'm currently at 315 and just recently (3 days ago began again)
 I'm severely depressed, have lots of anxiety and panic disorder but I'm try everyday to lose weight, it's an all consuming thought.   I restart constantly but never last more than a few days.   I hope it's different this time, I really do.  I'll quote this post 3-6 months down the road to see where I am.

I feel different this time, I'm so sick of body pain, ugly clothes, sore feet, pooping so often, sweating far too much, feeling ashamed of myself and avoiding friends and family who haven't  seen me at this size.

How are you with dieting?**My Healthy Eating Plan:**

- A huge amount of green and other non-starch vegetables each day.  (My daily lunch "bean &amp; green" salad must weight about 3-4 pounds.)

- Some fruit and starchy vegetables on a daily basis.

- Legumes, eggs, tofu, peanuts, almonds, walnuts, cottage cheese and 1% milk for protein.

- Canned fish -- sardines, kippered herring and tuna.  **I forgot to include this originally.**

- Oatmeal, shredded wheat and quinoa for whole grains.Great fucking job!  you look like a completely different person.  Keep doing whatever you're doing get where you wanna be.Start lifting weights with your boyfriend. I havent seen your body but you probably need muscle definition more than weight loss.I drink a large amount after I pee.

The more I drink, the more I pee, the more I pee, the more I drink.

The gallon goes fast.
That would be me! I lost just over 60lbs and gained almost every pound back, started a biggest loser challenge and have lost 10lbs again, definitely not easy! The biggest thing for me is that I'm sick of being what I've always been you know? I decided it was time to make a change and that this is going to be the last time I start over. As far as intimidation at the gym? Trust me you'll see people in WAY worse shape than you, and for the most part everyone is just keeping they're heads down and doing they're thing you know?I workout with one of my football buddies but even then, I have NO problem with working out, but whenever I put on ANY water weight and my weight goes up higher than it was on the original weigh in day I just lose all motivation and start binging.

Then I go through the whole "I'll start the diet again on monday" clicheFist bump for you!  Rock on.I know it doesn't seem like it, but I consider this to be a more inspirational story than mine. If you can keep counting while having a bad time and only losing 2 lbs in 2 months, you have the tenacity to stick with it through everything. I say good job to you, you're doing amazing!I have the fitbit flex and it's a great motivator. I've lost weight with walking as my only exercise... love it. I keep my fitbit and my MFP separate though and manually enter in exercise time.You got any old football buddies you can hit the gym with?You should consider seeking the help of a professional, I am extremely over weight and never understood why I gained weight or couldn't loose it because I didn't eat much, it was because I wasn't eating enough especially of the good stuff, and I wasn't eating at the right times. You need to make sure your eating for your goals.  And if you want to tone up add weight training to your regimen.  I never had success until I sought the help of a pro.  I'm down 15lbs in two months.  You can do it! You just have to find the right plan for your body and goals.  Don't give up!  Men have very different metabolism so than women, try not to compare!  Good luck! I have two months and 10-15 lbs to lose before my 28th birthday.  I dilly dallied for the first few months but now it's time to get serious. Edit: Also, to not go over my allotted calories at ALL this month.Dude. You're amazing! Keep going! **You've got this!**You look so much like the Youtuber Hannah Hart[If you start, go all the way....](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2014/10/09/if-you-start-go-all-the-way/)God damn right RickyAgree with what everyone's said here. A treat is ok, as long as it's just a treat.

In my experience, I tend to go over the top if I eat a treat when I'm really hungry. Have something healthy like almonds (which help curb chocolate cravings) or fruit to eat as well, so you don't feel like the only options available are hunger or five kit kat bars.
**170lbs?!** Amazing. Congrats! From someone who just finished crying through a workout-- you're an inspiration! Thanks for the reply! All the best to you :) I lost 135 lbs 2x. worst time was the 1st because I had no idea what I was doing. Unfortunately about to jump back on that train again. I started working out during football season, had a bunch of questions that I looked up on google and it brought me to bodybuilding.com. Was inspired by the guys on that site (roids or not) and am aiming to compete in a bodybuilding competition someday.I mean, no one wants to admit they ate 3 cans of ravioliThis is really good advice.  I logged for a while on MFP and lost or maintained.  Then, I stopped, and gained a little back over a long period of time.  Now, I am back into logging, and I've joined T.O.P.S. to keep me accountable with weigh ins.  I am usually close to my calories, but I make sure to log everything.  I have a bad habit of midnight snacking, but right now, I'm not concerned with stopping myself, I just make sure I log the calories and hold myself accountable.  (I even have two snack lables on MFP, daytime snacks and midnight snacks).  I wake up in the middle of the night and am hungry and eat.  So I start each day with a calorie deficit from my midnight eats--but I still log.  Sometimes, I go over, often I don't.  One day I will reach my goal!Last summer I had a really emotional 2 months, I also gained 25lbs back that I had lost ( I hadn't started counting and using mfp yet).  I had an very similar situation happen these last two months, and while I went over, over the two month period I lost 2 lbs.  Not a huge success, but to me it was because I didn't gain.  I remind myself I don't have to be perfect I just have to keep trying.  Keep it up, you're doing great and thank you for sharing!Thank you for the reply! Yes, it's so easy to accidentally go over calories when not counting them, I can see why calorie-counting is arguably a necessity to weight loss.Our stories are pretty much the same. Did it before just with a change in habits and gained it all back when life got hard. I honestly didn't have the knowledge calorie counting has given me. I am currently doing exactly the same as you. Both things, taking care of myself in every aspect. It's day 50 for me, and I'm doing great. I know you will too.Thank you for the insightful reply! Very good point... I'm definitely seeing myself making better choices now that I'm more calorie-aware. I sort of feel like I can estimate calories in my head at this point because I eat largely the same things every day. However, I know that's a slippery slope, so maybe it would be best to stick with calorie counting, and keep good habits in mind at the same time.Same, and I think that's how I've lasted for six months. I really love the "no food is bad" approach (as long as you don't eat all of it at once).I was gonna say the same thing! I even started at the same weight. Thanks for posting, OP. I needed the reminder to keep my ass in gear.Congrats!I'm having a calorie-counting, habit-changing lifestyle-ectomy and changing pretty much everything about how I treat myself, what I do, my routines.  I feel the same as /u/audiojister in that these go hand in hand.  I'd previously lost 85 lbs without counting a single calorie or changing much, and when shit hit the fan as it inevitably will, I bolted.  Now I'm committed to taking a little action each day to take good care of myself physically, mentally and emotionally.  It's only a month so far, so ask me again in 6 months, please and thank you.Deal! Pact is made. We'll both be rocking beach bodies soon enough!It depends on what you're using sedentary to mean. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14715035 suggests a split like - Sedentary - &lt;5k steps
Low Active - 5k-7.5K steps
Somewhat Active 7.5K-10K
Active - 10K
Highly active - 12.5K

That's a categorization that's useful for researchers dividing people by activity level. It's not necessarily going to align with caloric needs calculators (and you have to be careful not to double-dip the exercise). It doesn't mean much about cardiovascular fitness either. Hello,

You can call me Nim, if you'd like. I used to be a size 9 at 5'6", 130 pounds. I had hips, so even though I didn't like declaring I was a size 9, I also didn't feel big by any means. However, about 1.5 years ago I started birth control (just stopped it!), and I gained about 25 pounds. I also bought a vehicle, so I lost the exercise that was day-to-day biking and walking. Today, I tried three scales and averaged about 151 lbs.

My goal is 125 pounds, but of course if I weigh more and still look slim, it's fine. I realize muscle weighs more and all that.

What I've done so far: I've started counting calories as of this week. I started myself at 1200 calories, but a few people told me I was shooting too low, so I'm presently at 1330 with an 'active' lifestyle due to walking around campus and working as a veterinary assistant  (on feet, lifting dogs, restraining dogs). I got the calorie count from My Fitness Pal. I joined a local gym two weeks ago and I've gone three times both weeks. Most of the time I was by myself, but I attended one hard class that was mostly cardio and have two more classes planned: a similar cardio class that is somewhat based on kickboxing and martial arts, and a cycling class.

My goal is 2 pounds a week, and I just need help knowing if that's feasible. I can't afford a personal trainer, and my partner isn't terribly interested in going to the gym, so I don't really have a decent support group. I can eat within my limits and work out, but I don't know if I'm doing it right.

I want to be healthy and make this a lifestyle, so I don't want the quick weight loss tricks if I can find something more stable and worthwhile. My biggest body issues are triceps (not yet gross, but wiggley underarms), and from hips to mid-thigh because all of that area is rather plump. So far, I've been moving around the weight machines like abductor/adductor, curls, presses, so forth, and today I added lunges and squats.

I looked at the Dareabee's Hero journey and while obviously I'd start with less reps, I was wondering if anyone was familiar with it or had a better recommendation. MFP username is also nimnimnimble, please feel free to add!

Thank you! Mine is to hit 10,000 steps everyday and stay within my calorie limit. Day 2 of calorie limit goal and day 5 of step goal.It doesn't go away, self image problems stay with you.

It's up to you if let it motivate you to success or as an excuse to quit.

I wear my obesity stretch marks like a warning sign, i see them, im disgusted, i am reminded why im torturing myself in the gym.

Why did you start losing weight to begjn with?Thanks for your post, lots of insightful stuff in there :) Keep up the good work :DThat's amazing!!! Keep it up!They are not mutually exclusive. Quite the contrary, they go hand in hand. Ideally you should do both. If you don't want or for mental/emotional reasons can't count calories, you could try just changing habits (although it's a less accurate method). In my humble opinion, calorie counting should never happen without a gradual change in habits, and in practice I see both happen at the same time naturally in most people. Calorie counting is not just about numbers. It makes you more aware of the nutritional value of healthy food and the crappy value and high cost of unhealthy food. That promotes a change in habits in a lot of people.Congrats!
Well I've had previous goes at losing weight.  Last year, I restricted myself to ~800 calories a day, sometimes less.  It was from this old Weight Watchers book.  You were supposed to have ~1000 with oils and stuff, but I didn't use my 3 fat exchanges.  I lost about 1.5 pounds a week on this diet for a few months (I'm a shorty!), but I didn't realize how much weight that was; I thought I was supposed to be losing ~4 pounds a week.  This attempt, I have been counting calories and eating ~1250 a day, with exercise.  I didn't think it would be possible to lose weight eating this many calories (hahaha this *many* calories), but it's been coming off ~1 pound a week, sometimes a little less due to bloating etc.  I now understand the relationship between calories in/calories out, and how much fuel my body needs in a day.  Also, taking AP Chemistry and Physics has helped me realize exactly what a calorie is ;)Coach Meggin on youtube has gotten me off my butt for the past week. She was a gymnastics coach and has beginner, intermediate, and advanced strength workouts for various areas of the body, rarely requiring any equipment.I've tried it all.  In *my* experience, you will not lose a significant amount of weight unless you count calories.  Increased physical activity helped, but eating habits were paramount.  I changed what I ate, and how much I ate.I have a similar issue with sleeping pills. Get all loopy and then next thing I know it's 3am poutine time with a side of 3 cans of ravioli


What helps me is remembering eating kills your buzz (yes this is true for weed too)Hi all, I am a 5' 11" male, clocking in at 205 pounds. I am looking to lose about 20 pounds through gradual lifestyle changes which include moderate activity, cutting down on drinking and watching my meal portions. i don't really drink or eat too much during the week, but weekends I can easily drink 6 or more beers Friday and Saturday night each, as well as gorge on buffet type Indian food. I am trying to reduce the frequency of this.

I am on MFP as blacknight7 - feel free to add me. Well technically yes, but it coincided with stopping sports, starting college (and drinking a lot) and going through bad depression, so I contribute my weight gain to my poor food choices and lack of inactivity! I'm losing weight at the recommended rate (1-2 lbs per week) so I can't blame the nexplanon too much haha. I know different women react differently though. If diet doesn't help you, consider switching bcYeah, I don't know what the issue could be :/Nope, my dairy intake has stayed the same - I don't eat much dairy at all.  Salads are amazing. 6oz chicken breast, 3 cups of spinach and spring mix, and 2tbsp of balsamic vinaigrette. Well said. That's made a notable difference for me as well. Record it all. I don't hate myself or shame myself when I don't eat how I know I should, but I also don't pretend it didn't happen. I've come to realize that whenever I don't log my failures that I make light of my successes. Without seeing the bad days alongside the good, my food log becomes a saccharine fairy tail - without the darkness of the bad days, the truly good days don't shine as bright. I was depriving myself of the pride of seeing those days where I had failed slide into the past.. and not because I had stopped logging the transgressions and was lying to myself, but because I was doing better. And I could see when I had eaten poorly how it related to my weight, mood, and quality of sleep. I wouldn't be stuck feeling "why isn't this working" - I'd have the history right in front of me. If I was slacking, I could improve that. If everything looked normal, I can work on exercise. I'm giving myself valuable data that I can use to improve my life.

I can't change other people's habits, but I can change my own.. and I started with being brutally honest to myself but at the same time loving myself enough to forgive (but not excuse) my failings and to want better for myself, and to know that I can do better for myself.

Namaste.I had to order a new wedding band. 11.5 down to a 9.25.Writing it all down, especially on days when you go over your allowed calories, has been the key for me. The other big one was when I learned that most weight is lost, not as bowel movements, but as exhalation. The carbon dioxide you breath out is far more important for weight loss than anything else. http://www.livescience.com/49157-how-fat-is-lost-body.html

I'm not sure why that's so important to me, since it doesn't really change how I behave. It might just be that I'm more comfortable with actually enacting an idea when I understand it.Yes! That is exactly how it is. I feel really upset at myself for letting all my hard work go, and like all of my goals are just echoes of another success. But I'm trying not to think of it that way, even though it can be hard :(Normally when people overdo protein or eat a lot more than usual, it causes assplosions, not constipation. That's weird. I think 1200 cal is too low. 1350-1550 is more reasonable with exercise. Try measuring  yourself and maybe getting a body fat measurement  as well. Take pictures. (Your school's kinesiology dept may offer this.) Use these things to also watch your progress. The scale is not the last word in your success. You are in a healthy weight range now so focus more on activity, muscle building and healthy eating. The habits you make will pay off keep at it!So frustrating! It could be water retention from the mild inflammation caused by starting exercise and/or from your monthly cycle. You might also want to weigh yourself daily. MyFitnessPal automatically graphs your weight so you can look for trends and patterns over time.  So then being sedentary has to do with steps taken? At how many steps does someone stop being "sedentary"? That is great, there are tons of salad combinations you can try.

Once you stop eating salt and sugar rich foods you will get your taste back. That's when the real fun begins, you will want to try every bit of fruit and vegetable you can get your hands on. I wish i could relive that adventure.I doubt it's the protein. I regularly have high protein intake (way more than I used to) with no problems with constipation or heartburn.

I think it probably has to do with whatever else you're ingesting along with the increased protein. Are you eating more dairy? That could be a source of problem maybe. Biggest thing is writing it all down. Logging my food let me realize how bad my snacking habits were. I wasn't eating bad foods, really, but I was not eating mindfully.

Also, thanks to MFP, realizing weight loss is simple -- eat fewer calories than you burn. It seems like a DUH type thing, but I was deluded into thinking I would never be able to commit to weight loss because I don't have time to hit the gym 6 times a week or join cross fit. Or because I don't want to do paleo.

All those fads the fitness industry hypes up are fine but they obscure the fact that weight loss doesn't have to be that hard.I like going if I'm already out. So, on the way to the store I'll go to the gym before or after. On the way home from work if it's not rush hour because I hate crowds. If I'm meeting friends then I'll work out first. I sincerely enjoy lifting, but for some reason I hate making the 5 minute drive for just the gym. It helps me to bundle it up with other errands.Welcome welcome! Agree with the other commenters - check out MyFitnessPal. I'm sleepyneko on there if you want another online friend to help keep you accountable! And don't try to do too much too fast - cutting out every food you enjoy and working out five hours a day is only going to make you want to give up. It's all about small steps! Weight loss is primarily about your diet: eat at a deficit and the rest will take care of itself. That being said, I exercise like a maniac so I totally recommend it - running, biking, even long walks (especially now that the weather is getting nicer!)

Hope to see you around this subreddit with some flair soon.Yep, down 50 two years ago, gained 20 back. Currently 10 down at 186. It's going way slower this time too...Are you using a food scale and accurately tracking your food using something like MFP?Well I've only been eating right for a couple weeks now, but lots of chicken and turkey, grape nuts or total for cereal, tons of fruit and vegetables. Smoothies with spinach and kale are surprisingly good. (like they shouldn't taste good at all, but somehow do)

Most days I've been eating around 1600 calories, eating 3 meals, and snacks (baby carrots or grapes) every day.  A lunch that fills way too much is like 400 calories. Ground turkey, brown rice, egg, some green onions, with some vegetable. corn, broccoli, etc.Take a 2 litre bottle around with you, take a sip whenever you have a minute. Its much easier to drink the water when its always with you.I am experiencing all of the same benefits, except the last one.  I also have so much energy, and my back pain from herniated discs has entirely resolved.Yep! I weigh myself twice a day because I find the fluctuations to be interesting. I'm keeping with the program pretty well, so I don't freak if it looks like I've gained a pound or two. I'm trending downward. I have noticed I've had trouble pooping since I started trying to lose weight (despite eating tons of fiber) so I'm trying to take care of that for more accurate daily measurements.Thank you Gene,
To tell you the truth. We already made a "motivating device", but without emphasizing its game like-nature. Our current prototype product keeps a track of the weights of past 30 days. And the trend calculating algorithm we already use can pretty much guarantee that the device will not cause unjust "punishments" - no mater how much you lift on tomorrow.

We thought that with our current device we had solved just about the biggest weight loss problem - the lack of permanent motivation. So, full of hope we started an indiegogo crowdfunding campaign https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/motivating-scale-weight-loss-without-yo-yo-effect to see if there would be real life customers demand for it. But to our surprise we are seeing very little customer interest towards our product offer, so I started to wonder if we should re-brand the product as a game; instead of our current product offer as a friendly and supportive weight-loss-motivating-device.

Thus, the thing what I am asking here today is weather people would understand AND like the product better, if we would change the devices (software) nature into being more game-like. And the answers, you friendly people, have been giving today indicate, that you might be a bit more willing to consider that product if it was a game. OK, you all have been concerned if that game would be a fair game with no unnecessary punishments - and the answer is yes. IF we decide to make a game version  it would be a fair game. I need to talk with my partners if we want to pursue that direction.

And once again thank you all for your answers and thoughts :)




Super cute!! i'll usually go when i get out of work at 5, if you feel tired, you take caffeine supplements, or a pre workout like i do. gives you the energy you need if you need it. Besides getting to go home and doing nothing after busting your ass in the gym a is a pretty good feelingI agree with this. When I stop weighing myself and stop writing things down, I delude myself into thinking "Oh, this one thing isn't that bad." And it all adds up. I'm there too. I gained a lot of weight my senior year of high school, got a job as a waitress the summer between freshmen and sophomore years of college, and lost about 60 pounds. Didn't even realize it because I was working so much I only ever wore the shapeless uniform until I went to get some new jeans for the next school year. I maintained that through college. I put on 20 pounds or so during grad school, then after I was out and working had a bad reaction to a switch of birth control pills and packed on 40 pounds in what felt like a week. The next 12 years I sort of slid into a downward spiral thanks to depression and anxiety and put on 60 more. Now I'm back to where I was in college. I had to get into a better place mentally before I could reverse the damage. During the main portion of my weight loss I was around 1400 for the day!! I have upped it to 1670 recently since I have been lifting 3-4 days a weeks.Thanks all! I've been using MFP, though I'm not great at tracking. If I miss a day or two of entering in calories I try to backtrack and add them in. I've been hovering around 1500 calories a day, with some exceptions- usually on the weekends when my schedule is less of a schedule.

This time hasn't been an all at once OMG ALL OF THE THINGS routine change. I started slow: week one was eating consistently ( I used to skip breakfast and sometimes lunch), next week I cut out soda (been without soda for almost 2 months now!), and I've slowly been cutting out dairy (I'm lactose intolerant anyways...but cheese man...mmmm). I've also been trying to cook more.

I was sporadically going to the gym but it wasn't until a couple of weeks ago I started to go more regularly and when I started to incorporate insanity.

I'm trying. I've just always been on this on again off again roller coaster. I went from 185 to 149 in three months when I was in high school. Now I'm about to graduate college and I was at 200. There are multiple times where I've dieted and lost between 5 and 20 or so lbs and got discouraged somehow and went straight back up. It sucks. I always feel like "what if this just turns into another one of those?"If it works more power to you!

I normally enjoy drinking water and found that I'm not too indulgent in sodas and juices but I still can't bring myself to drink that much water in a day.

Any tips you have to make it easier?Thanks for that.

Earlier today I was getting ready to add some dressing to some vegetables, and hesitated to count the calories/serving size.

I almost went 200+ calories above my limit for each day.


Very easy for people to overlook dressings/condiments/seasoningsDiggin' it.The people who laughed when they heard you would try are on the edge of their seat waiting for you to fail.  Don't give them the satisfaction.If you don't mind my asking, about how many calories were you eating in order to lose so much weight? Amazing job, btw!I'm not terribly knowledgeable about athletic matters, but just I've always liked lifting some weights. Your gym doesn't have a barbell? Because with that you could do some bench presses and deadlifts and heavier squats for 15 mins and that would do a lot. If the equipment is there, you could always try it. I just wanted to encourage that because it seems such a simple and quick approach.I cook throughout the week, preparing several meals at a time to keep in the fridge.  Sometimes I'll cook larger things like casseroles, and when they've cooled, portion into meals and freeze.  I just use the recipe function in MFP for this.  I use a lot of regular recipes but just adjust for my personal preferences which lean toward low carb, and of course lower calorie.  I also eat a lot of simple vegetables and meat meals, so I buy a lot of frozen vegetables.

I used to use a lot of Tupperware but I switched to all Pyrex because of concerns about microwaving the plastic when reheating meals.  Older plastic containers leach *more* plastic chemicals into food that's microwaved in it than newer ones, but they all leak chemicals.  I got all my Pyrex for around $60 at Big Lots, and I have A LOT of it, as my SO will attest.  I can judge when I need to prepare more meals by how much Pyrex is in the cupboard...If I'm not paying attention to the fridge.

For variety I surf around places like /r/recipes or /r/fitmeals or /r/eatcheapandhealthy or /r/ketorecipes

I enjoy cooking once I actually get my ass in the kitchen, and variety really is the spice of life!Stick with it for once.I did 35 min elliptical and 15 min weights. How was yours? Ah, to fill that I drink 1 gallon of water a day.

I literally look pregnant by the end of the day with a gallon of water in me, but it works because I am so full I don't want more portions.

Also, this may be weird, but, whenever I get a craving for more food, I will sometimes look up pictures of male models to curb me from eating. "That body could be mine. I don't need that 3 gallons of soda and 12 burgers."

This sounds really creepy but it works for me.:) &lt;3I got it at Aerie! They have a bunch of colors and similar styles. They are amazing to wear since I am not a fan of push-up or underwire &lt;3Thank you! :) Congrats on the NSV!!!  That's always an awesome feeling!Fuck yeah!! This is the only way I know how to respond to such gains in awesome.Haha it is Night on Bald Mountain from Disneys Fantasia. It is my favorite classical piece Thanks for your advice!

I actually tried that and found that it was far too easy for me to justify "just one more portion" of something that wasn't healthy.

My goal in eating healthier is that I'm still able to eat lots and fill me up while not overdoing it. I ate quite a lot of salad today but it still ended up being only like 400 calories worth.

This is much better than the 3-5 chicken patties I would normally be able to eat at a dining hall. hahaI see. Are there any specific workouts you can recommend to me? For me, climbing is pretty intense already, but I am willing to do other things beyond that. Preferably something I can do at home, as I cannot afford a second gym membership.Awww thanks, that's so motivating to hear I got it at Aerie! They have a bunch of different styles and colors and are super comfortable to wear. I'm glad to help! I was the same way and would spend so long looking through posts to find someone with my body type as well!Thank you! And yes it is :) I am so happy you picked that out &lt;3Right, yeah that makes sense, I kinda cut red-meat out a while ago, so perhaps that's what it is actually.I chew sugar-free gum for the munchies. So much saliva. Does taking a weed break also kill your appetite? I love it.You look amazing!! Great job!Hey, you know, technically speaking to lose weight all you really need is to establish a calorie deficit.

Obviously, having a new nutritious diet would result in you becoming healthy, but assuming you are very overweight, or just overweight, it might be easier for you to have a "smooth" transition, that is, eating food you like, but in reduced portions.

Right now, I am eating what I want, as long as I don't go over 1,000 calories a day.

Not saying what you're doing is wrong, just thought I'd give you a suggestion that most people don't hear about, because they are flooded by "eat this don't eat that" diets that discourage people who are obese, since they find it difficult to get away from their food they prefer.

Good luckI look forward to the challenge!I've had a problem with low self esteem since around the age of 10, any tips on how to fix the problem?Lost 25 pounds in over a year, then binge eating came and I gained 45 pounds in less than a year. Picking up the healthy habit again is hard. But 3 weeks ago, I started exercising and counting calories again. But this time, I won't restrict so much. Last time I ate less than 1200kcal (i'm 5 ft) and exercise almost everyday. Now, my net calories will be 1200, so I will eat back my exercise calorie since I do pretty intense workouts. It's better to lose it slowly than to snap back any binge eat every food you can find in the pantry and fridge because of the fear that you have to restrict again the next day.I'm going to work harder than I have, I NEED to lose this weightYou look fantastic! You also have some very nice ink.4/1/15: 141.0I'm an entire month late to this, but I wanted to tell you that your post stopped me from making bad choices tonight for dinner.

Was feeling reckless and going to order pizza or get fast food or something like that, and came on here in an attempt to find something that would drive me away from that decision. This post fucking did it.

Thank you so much.Good job.

I'm on a 1,000 calorie diet too, 256 goal is 175.

Hope you continue to improve yourself in your eyes!Yup. The only downside I've found is that I spend a lot more time on this "hobby" so my other hobbies are all but gone. Also, it causes a little strife in relationships when you're not available as often as people would like you to be.

All that said, I'll be at the gym...Ha, I have yet to learn that lesson. What kinds of things do you eat?Exactly this.The thing that isn't obvious about losing weight is how our own self image doesn't adapt. Unfortunately, if you have low self esteem and are self conscious about yourself, it doesn't disappear as the weight does. You really have to work on loving and appreciating yourself and what you don't like about yourself through the process. It's going to be an ongoing struggle, and it's going to be difficult, but you'll live a much more fulfilling life if you take care of yourself mentally while simultaneously taking care of yourself physically.

I lose my motivation often. Sometimes I don't think it comes off fast enough, other times I think it'll never come off. What keeps me motivated is the reminder that time is going to move forward whether I am eating right and exercising or not. A year from now I can be lighter or heavier, and if I am heavier a year from now I'm going to be disappointed in not taking advantage of the time I have now.Nut butter.

I have two jars in my car for hunger emergencies. One is Sunbutter, the other is coconut oil and peanut butter.
So hungry now....
I'll be in my carYep! I went from 180 to 167. Quit smoking and went up to 190. Dropped down to 177, got a wedding dress and now im back at 190. I HAVE to lose weight to fit in my dress but I'm having a very hard time not binge eating. I've never been a binger, but thia time around I'm struggling!this is a great idea!  Thanks!Lost 40 pounds, because depressed for unrelated reasons, gained 30 with meds, switched meds, lost 40 again and regained 20 recently because of another bout of depression.

I'm so tired but I'm starting again because I don't even care about "oh I want to look good naked!". I just want to be strong. I want to feel that strength in my body, like I can do anything. I had some kit kat minis today and I felt like it was more calories than worth it, but if I don't allow myself a snack, that is when I truly play with fire!Being fat isn't something you can change! People are born fat, that's just the way it is! You need to [get educated](https://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/blog/) on how to accept your body and recognize that your fat body can do amazing things and perform better than a thin body ever could!5'9 female.
I got down to 120 due to bulimia over 4 years.
Now I'm back to 200 I'm pretty unhappy.  I know I have to lose this the healthy way, but there's some days where I skip eating all together.
But I'm determined to eat more veggies and exercise more.
I always remember health teachers in school saying "when you lose weight with an eating disorder you gain it back, and then some." But I never believed them.
Sure, it took a year or two, but here I am.. again.  The same weight I was when I was 13. But I need to do this to feel better, inside and out.  Good luck...  you'll need it!  CAUSE I'M TOTALLY NOT GIVING AWAY GOLD EASILY!You aren't living in a place that doesn't care for the next few months.  You're living there for the rest of your life.  I'm not talking about your parents house.  I'm talking about the world.  KFC, McDonald, Apple Bees.  They don't care about your endeavor.  Your co-workers, your people on the street, lovers of food everywhere.  They may be sympathetic, but at the end of the day, they don't care either.  You will always be in the war zone as long as you view it as a war.  You have to move past that thinking.  Don't commit to them.  Commit to yourself.  Don't view bad choices as someone else tempting you.  View it as you allowing yourself to be tempted.  What you have now are a set of bad habits that are dictating your behaviors.  Bad habits become trends and can be hard to replace with good habits, but in no way impossible.  Once you establish a series of good habits, that will eventually become your behavior and then all the temptation in the world wont matter, because you wont be in a war zone anymore.  You'll just be you making the right choices most of the time and bad choices every now and then.

Good luck!  If you ever need someone to talk to about this, my inbox is always free.In 2012 I joined a gym that was specifically for people who were severely overweight. When I joined I was 320 pounds. They were running a contest, the person to lose the most weight in six months won $50,000. I worked out 6 days a week with a trainer and ate about 1200 calories a day. I lost 100 pounds and came in third place. Once the contest was over I managed to keep the weight off...the lowest I got to was 209. But then the gym closed and I lost my whole support system. I'm still kinda mad at them for just closing it down. We were like a family. I moved in with my boyfriend and stopped paying attention to my calorie intake even though I still worked out 4 to 6 days a week. I went back up to 250. I've managed to get back down to 235 but it so much harder this second time around. So, I'm new here after finding out about this subreddit a few days ago. I've been trying to lose weight for a while now, and made some decent headway until I moved to Houston with nothing and ended up relapsing in to destroying Taco Bell and entire pizzas solo. Lost two years of work real quick.

I'm a twenty-three year old male from good ol' Orlando, Florida, currently a resident of Houston, Texas. I gained a crapton of weight starting from my childhood days since food was the only source of happiness I could find among the long, horrible string of bullying that is really too long of a story to put here. Long story short, I put on a few hundred pounds and had a diet consisting of multiple two liters of Mountain Dew per day on top of constant eats. It was not a fun time, nor did it help me be a socially healthy person. I struggle with that to this day, but that's a story for another subreddit (if you know one for it, I'd love to know!).

I lost quite a bit, and I'm down to an estimated 250 lbs. I don't know what it's like to be skinny, I have no idea what I will look or feel like. I can't even comprehend the idea of being skinny. I suspect I'll have a lot of trouble adapting to not needing to give things such a wide berth. My target weight is 150 - 180 lbs, accounting for muscle weight. Muscles would be something new!

I have nothing to support me, though. No girlfriend, nobody I can talk to about it. Nothing but my own willpower and anger at the current state of things. That, and my desire for a healthy love life, social life, and work life. None of which I feel I can get as I am now, so I'm going to make myself better. Here's to hoping!I find weighing daily a bit better than weighing weekly because I can see and feel the fluctuations in my weight. Bingo. 4 years ago I lost 50 lbs. after getting out of an awful relationship. Kept it off for a little over a year, then BLAM. Moved across the country. Stress of an unfamiliar city/new relationship issues/having to get used to a new job all contributed to me putting most of the weight back on (40lbs.) I've been holding onto it for the past 3 years, and let me tell you, it's STUBBORN. I've been working on losing it since Thanksgiving, and I've only lost 12 lbs. Still, it's progress, but I'd be lying if I said I'm not disappointed to be doing this again. When I lost all that weight those years ago, I thought that was *finally* it for me, I'd figured it out, ya know? But food is my crutch, and I think I dumped too much on myself. Owell, onward!Yes! Today marked my 330-day MFP streak and I realised it's just something I do everyday instead of the chore it used to be. It takes 5 minutes out of my day and I'm going to just keep at it everyday for the rest of my life. Timely topic, I just went to the trail for the first time this year now that the weather is nice. My calves started cramping up and it hasn't happened before but mostly it was improper hydration. I just didn't drink enough water before I went. Try more water and see if that helps. I have that sometimes with cleaning or paperwork.  I don't want to do it, it never ends, what's the point? I feel so good when its out of the way however as it's one less thing on my list.  Try spending a few minutes doing one thing to tidy your room, like making the bed, or picking up clothes.  Reassess afterwards whether you can do one more thing and how it feels having completed the task.I'll give it a shot, and that would be 23.6 pounds for me. Hopefully this gets me out of my slumpHonestly, I learned how fucking hard it is to eat a ton of calories when you're not eating shit food. :/You look great! Thanks for posting this.Good luck with that 5K! It's hard to feel motivation when you're walking in a snow storm.  You can't see the end, all you see are obstetrical.  So what you need is a goal!  I'm about to give you one if you choose to accept.  A challenge to help motivate you.  I challenge you to lose %10 of your current weight.  I will also try do to the same.  I currently weigh 378.  That's 37.8lbs for me.  How much is it for you.  If you best me in this challenge I will buy you gold.  What do you say Candroids, are you ready to push further?I think I hurt something in my leg though. Cut my workout short today. Oh well, I'll know better for next time.&gt; Nothing is really new or exciting-- I already know what my body looks like at these new weights.

Goodness. I didn't realize just how present that idea was in my subconscious till I just read it. You're so right. There isn't that excitement the second time around. It doesn't feel like you're getting something new and awesome. It feels more like you're begging to have your stuff back from some one who just keeps putting of returning it to you. I want my stuff back!!! It really robs you of feeling like you're truly accomplishing anything. I went from 310lbs to 255lbs when I was 17. Gained it all back in 2 years + 25 pounds. Got down maybe 30lbs quick right after, but then ballooned to my peak at 390lbs. Not fun. Here I am 2.5 years after at 268lbs. Its a struggle, but I am 100% confident I will never gain my weight back. I have worked too damn hard and lost too many years of my youth sticking out like a sore thumb and feeling physically incapable of things to let it ever happen again.*Good for you!!* I am so proud of you both for taking this step. If you want to add me myfitnesspal, I'm the same username as here, and will cheer you in in your journey! :)I ate all my calories back with my UP with a hard limit of 2k, and 2.5k when I weighed 250+.
I am now sitting at 212 with a hard limit of 1.75k, it seems pretty accurate as I have lost about 10-15lbs every month since I started.

If I were you I would set a hard limit and not eat over that but still enjoy eating some back.Yep. I lost like 75 pounds a couple of years ago and am finally on my way back down. A whole lot of life changes redirected me from the gym (biggest issue) and I gained most of it back, but slowly it's coming off again. &gt; which I rode vigorously for two hours

Haha I got a kick out of this. What a much better decision, keep up the good work!Good work man! As someone dealing with depression/anxiety on a daily basis, what you are going through hits close to home. Thanks for posting, your success really motivates me to try harder and not let depression win. Ah gotcha my problem has always been taking the time to account for everything Both! The recipes will normally give you the weights when raw to cook with, but when you've cooked the meal and want to divide it up correctly you'll re-weigh it :)You look wonderful! Go you!After 2 pregnancies in 3 years I had gained 100lbs.  Three years later (about 10 years ago now) I did the south beach diet and lost it all, but it was very restrictive for me being mostly vegetarian. I got bored with the food and tired of counting grams of carbs in EVERYTHING and tracking down special ingredients, especially after the whole low carb phase died out. Between that and a divorce and a job in food service I gained it all back plus about 30 more. Now I'm trying again, lost the 30 but have been stuck for a while. I've been focusing mainly on portion control this time, but I need to up my activity level and I'm hoping with the nicer weather I can get outside and get back on track.In theory, it could be a good idea. In practice, too many factors make it "unfair," due to weight loss's nonlinearity. For instance, we're doing some construction at work and so we spent a solid two hours moving boxes of old files in an un-airconditioned trailer. There's a pretty solid chance  my weight's going to be up tomorrow morning due to the extra exercise and water retention, even if I'm at a larger deficit than usual.

It could also encourage unhealthy habits. If I knew tomorrow I was going to be "punished" for my weight being up, I may choose to remain dehydrated rather than drink something, knowing that water wouldn't be leaving my body any time soon.

Even ignoring that, once your weight loss slows, you end up getting punished fairly frequently even when you do everything right. There are weeks where my weigh-ins fall within 0.6 pounds on either side of my average every day. I'd lose three or four games a week, even if in the long run, I'd be trending downward.

Game-ifying things can be good, but not if the rules of the game are a bad way of thinking of the subject. Punishing yourself just because your weight goes up a bit one day is bad.But their heartrate is raised over resting rate for an extended period of time. And there is perspiration, just not extensive at once; rather minute over a long period of time. Hi. I'm fat, and I want to change that. For once, I don't really feel like typing out a long sobstory because this is my fault that I'm fat. I'm done with living with my mistakes. I want to lose 200 lbs. Let's go.

Just noticed that BWF becomes FWB when you read it backwards, yet another reason to go for BWF :)Challenge accepted. Beat up PTs and steal their stretchy bands. Nerds exists as a resource for harvest, much like how food stuffs conveniently stockpile at corner stores just waiting to be looted.You may be able to use it to do glute ham raises. Going *SPLAT* was only the second biggest slip up. The biggest one was dying my hair red. [Enjoy!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2sdz8zrgnw09g5j/SPLAT.mp4?dl=0) ;)
If one does the wrist warmup on your handstand guide before working on his HS and planche progressions, will this be enough to slowly condition the wrists and make them more flexible during time (ie. will the wrists advance together with the strength/balance advancements, without becoming an unsurpassable bottleneck and risking being damaged), or is a special wrist flexibility routine required?Oh Cheers dude!  I'll go down the bars now and give it a go :) I'll get back to y'all tonightThat's some fast progress, nice! Keep it up.Is the stretch series elements that vastly different than the foundation mobility exercises? &gt; Vertical pulling (**diamond pushups**)

I'm guessing that was a mistake? I assume you meant pull-ups. As for this:

&gt; I have no where to do rows, yes I looked everywhere.

You have a pull-up bar don't you? So hang a couple towels or lengths of rope or strapping or whatever from your pull-up bar. Row away. If your grip's too weak to hold on, tie a knot at the bottom of each towel/rope/whatever.

Otherwise your routine looks fine.I'd be willing to pay that amount to tap into the mind of a gymnastic coach with that much experience. Can anyone who has got the series comment on the type of stretches used? Dynamic? Isometric? No need to go into detail. Just a sneak preview  :) augh D: i've heard of so many people getting injured with one arm chin ups, it's not even funny. now i'm scared, hah.some general cheapo hall that sells brooms and shovels. super cheap, and you can just unscrew the functional end.

ie. any friggin' store that sells tools, building materials etc.Messed up my elbow tendon trying one arm chin ups for reps. Yes. It's intense stretching, as opposed to daily mobility stuff. It's also worth noting there are three Stretch courses, so that would still be three sessions each week, on top of Foundation/Handstand's mobility requirements.[The beginner routine](http://www.davidhorne-gripmaster.com/basics.html) over at /r/GripTraining is really good. It's two main purposes are to maximize through n00b gains, and to increase overall wrist strength. When I have time I actually do it 4 times a week, without any issue.You can't become a great player on YouTube, and it is hard to understand if you aren't a piano player at a decent level. Your comment is so true. Unfortunately people now think you can become a pro at everything just from the Internet. Which doesn't hold true in many things. Unbalanced workout, no mention of progressive overload. I rate it Mike Chang/10.Yeah it's almost freestanding, but whenever I'm about to loose balance, I touch the wall with the tip of my toes and bounce back to freestanding again. But I believe the arch is still bigger than the other HS variation. I'll start working on the arch once I get my balance to perfection.You make good points, but make one of the worst examples in the world I could possibly think of, and shows you obviously don't play piano, and if you haven't had a great teacher. I have played piano for 7 years and know the difference a great teacher can make. Recently I have had lessons with a concert pianist for 50 an hour, and he is elite, technically as proficient as Lang Lang, if not more. That is a bargain. Every single lesson changed my whole playing dramatically. Sometimes the cues he gave made a tricky section perfect the first time I played it. My technique improved rapidly, and the things I learned are close to impossible to teach yourself. This is why there are no virtuosos who haven't had lessons. One lesson can be expensive but can not be underestimated in its return if you have a good teacher. You say you won't learn 'that much special' but I cannot disagree more, and shows you have had no experience of this. Enough of my rant about piano and how you need lessons to be really good.
Hands on instruction is worth a lot on the end with anything. Internet can only do so much, I have friends who have learned some piano from YT and played as long as me, but haven't been as motivated without a teacher and honestly, have little knowledge and appalling technique.
You are absolutely right, knowledge and experience is worth money, and often a lot of it, and people sometimes feel entitled to everything for free. The new courses seem overpriced to say the least, I would say a fair price would be 50 or 60 dollars each. But you do know you will get a good course which has  support in the forums and it is an investment which may or may not be worth it depending on your wealth and also if you are savvy and knowledgeable enough to collect the info on the Web into a good program.
Basically, your piano example is flawed, but yes people spend money on a day out or a weekend or going to a restaurant which may not have much return on investment and is a better example. But you are on the money when you say 'it doesn't mean it isn't worth it' because it is. And it is often worth more than you realise. No doubt most people do bridges wrong.  I've seen so many people who think the goal is just to get their hands closer and closer to their feet.....  I'm like no, stack the shoulders and keep the stress on your upper back, not your lower back.Also back limbers are just fucking boss.Well but if everything is tight (which it is in most beginners) it stretches mostly lower back which is not ideal. Some wise man said (don't remember who) that bridges is the way how to display flexibility, not how to achieve it. I've seen people doing bad bridges consistently without getting their wrist, shoulder, thoracic spine or hip flexibilty any better. I think these things should be adressed separately first and once they are decent bridges will be more beneficial.Move your hands closer to the wall.  If you do a stomach to wall handstand right, it's basically a freestanding handstand.wait, once a week?He's paying for the leisure of not having to look it all up.

Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with the 85 dolla pricetag, but I'd say about 35-40 would be justified? It's a bit unfair to compare it with Kit, he's making them available at the lowest cost he can manage without losing money (i think?). Sommers is just cashing in on his "popularity", which honestly is fine. I just think such a pricetag is pushing it, unless he has a really expensive hookers &amp; coke habit. Can't blame a guy for that. Yeah I know that he didn't build it all through BW, I was just pointing out that he looks huge.

&gt;Stomach to wall handstands are better because they teach you good body line, whereas back to wall handstands tend to promote a much more arched handstand.

Yeah the arch is very noticeable during stomach facing away from wall HS, but I think I'll continue doing both coz i like the balance maintaining part during that kinda HS.Just found this few days ago on BWF. Hope it will help you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2OGpM6HBroFull-length antranik videos?[oh boy.](http://www.midwestsportsfans.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/carlton-dancing-gif.gif)3-4 days a weekBesides being great for what it is, it leads to front and back limbers, which add power to your back handspring, which is essential for tumbling.There's always a silver lining...Hey at least you're stronger than you thought you were....You don't want a flexible dislocate bar.  I've had to use one recently and it's not even the same exercise.

Get a broomstick and draw or cut some measuring lines into it.  That way you can measure increases in flexibility.Might be fun to watch someone try. Anything you do in addition to the beginner routine (or any program you do) should be done for a specific reason, not just "because it's there".  If you have specific weaknesses or imbalances which the machine can help with then by all means use it.  Leg extensions, for example, might be worthwhile if you have strong glutes and weak quads,  but for the majority of people the opposite is true.  In the instructions of my neti pot (you should buy one if you haven't), it's recommended bending over and blowing through the nose to make sure here's no water traped in the sinuses.
I'm using the neti pot a lot these days, and frequently have the same "surprise" as you doing handstand. So, to me, handstands work better than the recommended procedure to purge the water.First of all he didn't build that body doing bodyweight exercises.

This is why I hate guys who make videos like this.  It's just so incredibly deceptive.

I'm not saying you CAN'T build amazing bodies with bodyweight training.  just that the guy in that video is a fucking liar.

Stomach to wall handstands are better because they teach you good body line, whereas back to wall handstands tend to promote a much more arched handstand.Most bridge advice sucks. Emmet's video is gold. Thank you! I will check it out. I've seen a lot of terrible bridge videos on youtube. This one must have escaped me.The Master series by Kit Laughlin are probably much better organized and good value for money. $10 for Master Shoulders, $10 for Master Squat and Hip Mobility, etc. It's on Vimeo. Sommer is capitalizing on his success, which isn't to say he isn't being smart about it.Weight is mostly about your diet. When you were "watching what you ate" we're you doing it by feel or did you actually keep track?

Imo the most important thing you can do is to track specifically what you eat for a few days so you can see the actual number of calories you consume and then work from therehttp://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_i_usually_train_with_barbells.2Fdumbbells.2C_how_do_i_integrate_that_with_bodyweight_training.3FRule 1.&gt; In one hour of piano lessons how much do you really expect to take home?

That depends on the lesson, but it can teach you a *lot*, especially if you've been playing piano for a while already. There are a lot of things an experienced teacher sees and can correct, all of which you couldn't have done on your own and which might've been a massive roadblock.

So, yeah, I expect to take a lot home. I've been playing piano for over 10 years now, and on top of that I tutor kids in mathematics and the sciences, so I've experienced the effect a single lesson can have.I agree with this comment that his form was terrible, but he still looks huge(which's not my goal anyway).

But,...

&gt;If you want to do handstand push-ups, have your stomach to the wall.

why? I used to do em both the ways(2 sets each) and I observed stomach facing away from wall requires more balance than facing towards the wall.I bought the stretching series right away. The programming part is what I like about it. I have a lot of bookmarks of site with stretching guidelines and what not but somehow never end up at the desired goal. I also value my time more and don't wanna search through forums or google to find the correct stretches / time / rep schemes I have to do. For me it was an easy choice. There are also ppl who don't want to or can't spend that amount of money and I understand that. There is a solution for everyone out there be it the free stuff that was mentioned here or the GB stuff just take what fits you imo.damn. you have progressed really quickly.  good jobThey way I see it there should always be a certain level of 'play' in your workouts.  After all your main lifts are done, feel free to mess around seeing what else you can do.  It's fun!No, the chest is used for pushing while the back is used for pullingEmmet's video on the bridge is mostly all the info you need &gt;  They're not made by bodyweight athletes, they're made by gym dudes who think they know what they're talking about

Ya, this is the impression I got from these guys. Thanks for the thorough breakdown. Seems like most essentials are covered in the sidebar anyway, at my level of advancement there is little need for me to branch out from there.I don't mind paying for things as I've paid for both F1 and H1 so far.

However, he's asking for $85 for one stretch progression? That's more than I paid for F1, and in F1 I got 6 progressions for 7 exercises.

I'd go as close to classifying myself as a GB fanboy because I really like the Foundation and Handstand courses. But this? This is a joke.

Edit: Keep in mind that I'm probably biased because I am very flexible and unless the bridge course goes into limbers and such, it'd be almost useless to me. I'm sure that people who have gotten stuck on mobility elements in their foundation and handstand courses will find this invaluable and are more than willing to cash out $85 for one progression.Got bored and decided to watch the rest of it:

Ignore what he says about dips.  Leaning forward just makes them easier, and will NOT help you with your mobility.  Sure, it works chest more, but real bodyweight strength comes from the shoulders.

L sits are better done from the floor.  This teaches you proper scapula depression, which of rme is the whole point of the exercise.

Fuck the rest of those exercises.  Seriously, don't do this workout.

This probably goes for most home workpit videos you'll ever see.  They're not made by bodyweight athletes, they're made by gym dudes who think they know what they're talking about.  They don't.I've been pondering this lately as well. I would like to try and explain this physiologically but I must make it clear that I hold no formal education in exercise physiology and it's also been at least 10 years since I read up on this stuff. I would really like to if some of the more knowledgable users of this forum could chime in a confirm or deny what I'm about to type.

My understanding of physiology is that you cannot have a muscle fibre that is configured for maximal force production and also configured for maximum endurance capacity due to the following:

* The more contractile proteins in the muscle fibre the more force it can produce
* The more mitochondrial proteins in the muscle fibre the more fatigue resistant it is.
* There is more or less amount of room for these proteins and at maximal levels of both there will be a trade-off.

Note, however, that I said at the *maximal* level there will be a trade-off. My understanding is that an untrained or relatively lesser trained individual can increase the number of both contractile and mitochondrial proteins without there being a trade-off as they haven't yet reached the capacity of the muscle fibre. I would suspect that trade-offs would only be required at very high levels of performance in either aspect.

This is my understanding of what I have read [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20071020230727/http://home.hia.no/~stephens/exphys.htm). Check out the article titled "Training the Skeletal Muscle" and another titled "Strength Training and Endurance Perfomance". Infact, I really enjoyed reading the entire site back in the day, it gave a great insight into physiology but it is mostly cardio/endurance oriented.

There a number of other things to be considered here such as which muscles you are training for which fitness component, signalling pathways (AMPK and MTOR) and probably other things yet but these are beyond the scope of my current understanding.Go to home depot. Ask them where there are dowels. Dude if this was only your first time doing it, obviously it's going to take a while to do it cause you aren't sure what to do and you're having to get acquainted with the motions and be slow at it. But if you're used to it, it should only take you like, 20 minutes to go through that whole thing just once.  Besides, don't you feel fucking great afterwards?TLDR made a New Years resolution to do a pullup, walked straight into the gym and did 3 pullups.

That's gotta be the most efficient accomplishment of a New Years resolution I ever heard of.You put it very well in a succinct manner. I'll just add that PRESS Handstands also require both very hardcore wrist flexibility. PPPU's and Planches too, especially once you're able to lean quite deep. It may get to the point of parallettes/parallel bars becoming the go-to choice when training these.Thanks guys.

I gave the beginners routine a go today, awesome.

There is somethings that are easy for me and somethings that are way hard.

L-sit DAYUM thats not easy. As far as the push-up are concerned though Psuedo planche was new to me but I can do 8 reps easy.

Now when I was finished I was standing extremely straight, felt like everything was being pulled into the right spot which feels real nice. But this leads me to a question, should I go up in difficulty on squats and push-ups, even though my pull-ups are weak and my L-sit is terrible...

I guess what I'm asking is it fine to move up in difficulty on some techniques but not all? Will that affect posture and whatnot?

Anyhow this is probably the wrong place to ask this... Moderators plz be nice to a N00bzor!
Awesome! Now do two :)FINALLY!  Recognition for all my hard work :pOthers have given great suggestions already. I would just like to add that you could also join us for the [horse stance month](https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/2uj5z7/welcome_to_the_horse_stance_motivational_month/) over at /r/flexibility. The reason I'm working on mine is to help increase my straddle/middle split flexibility to make straddle levers and planches more accessible. The wider you could split your legs, the closer it bridges the gap from the advanced tuck.  I can already feel its improvements!  Also, this [blog post](http://antranik.org/splits-dreams/) I made a while ago might intrigue you. It were the reasons why I wanted to improve my front splits and pike compression.Take it slow. Start doing walks and increase them with every day. I can suggest that you buy a jumping rope and use that to train for awhile. After you've built up your stamina and vitallity start with body weight training. Try to do sets like this: first do one push up, rest, then do two push ups, rest, then 3 and then 2 again and 1. Like a pyramid. The next day try 1 2 3 4 3 2 1. Do a couple of those. Try http://7min.io/ . And don't push yourself too hard. Take your time.Ok, so first thing is first. I was 96 kilograms and after a few months I dropped down to 86 and I can't tell you how amazing and good it feels. This might seem impossible but what you need to do is start walking like I told you AND **stop eating everything sugar related and everything bread related** Just do that and I am completely sure that you are going to see results very soon. If you ever try to eat any junk food just ask yourself: "Why did I start on the first place?". Constantly remind yourself about what you are doing. Deep inside every human lies a beast and you just need to bring him out. Don't give up and contact me or /r/bodyweightfitness if you have any questions.Came to 150 which in happy to pay. Kit and KT material is great but having  programming is essential for me. I've spent years chasing my tail with flexibility and so far F1 and H1 have had the biggest impact on improving it.

I was doing weighted pull ups yesterday and when I was putting the plate away I decided I was going to curl the 10kg one for a bit.

I smashed it straight into my throat as I curled it up. Fortunately I managed to keep a hold of it while regaining my composure which my feet and floor thank me for. You are pretty hardcore imo.What exercises are best for wrist strength?Personally, and I am not Rippletoe, I think you should get to 3 x 12 reps and be able to do a max effort set of 15 before adding weight to your pull-ups to ensure you are ready for it. That'll take a while but it is worth it. When weighting them though I would suggest dropping to a 5 x 5 rep structure to start with.

3 x 8 represents the top end of the most used strength rep range (although I tend to do 5 x 5) and 3 x 12 the top end of the most used hypertrophy rep range. In my experience accessory exercises are usually done in higher rep ranges. Personally, I treat pull-ups as one of my big lifts and train it as such.

I can't speak for Rippletoe but that is my take on it! Thanks!Thanks, I'll have to look for a nearby store.Is it that hard to buy a fucking broom nowadays?I didn't even make it halfway, but here's my thoughts on the four exercises I saw.

Rear Foot Elevated Split Squats: they literally managed to completely miss the point of this exercise.  Working them as deep as you can will increase hip flexor mobility.  I've heard stories of people getting front splits from this one exercise alone - no stretching.  Doing them in a plyonetric fashion means you'll either hurt ourself or miss out on this most important reason to do them.

Rows: the range of motion here was terrible. Apart from that, it's a great exercise.

Plyo pushups:  these are probably the best exercise I saw them demonstrate.  My beef is that they suggested doing them for AMRAP, which is stupid, because if you fuck up you could break a chair, your arm or your face.  Not to mention how plyometric work is inherently rough on your soft tissues.  Don't do these AMRAP.

Handstand push-ups: again range of motion was terrible.  Form in general was shocking.  If you want to do handstand push-ups, have your stomach to the wall.

That's all I could take.  On the whole I would have to say I didn't like anything I saw in that video.This. It's just a fucking stick, they aren't that hard to come across.Lost focus at the bottom of a ring dip and spun out.  I'm lucky I didn't seriously hurt myself.I haven't purchased it, and I don't know if I will. But I don't get all this anti-paying sentiment or the implied "It's all free. Why don't you look it up? Are you lazy?".

I'm not replying to Antranik's post about Yoga, but it was the catalyst for this. His website is awesome. And I thank him from the bottom of my heart for all the free information that he has. I've used his L-sit progressions. I've used his foam rolling videos, etc. I've used phrakture's mobility page.

But speaking as someone who has less experience than even a novice, there is a huge amount of information out there. I'm gonna pick on doyogawithme.com. Look at the first page when you are selecting a routine.

Difficulty - easy enough to answer.
Length - less than an hour would be great.
Style - There are 17 styles listed. OK. So I've got to research them to figure out which one works best for me. I've heard of Vinyasa. Let's look that up. Well...according to Wikipedia Vinyasa is just another name for Ashtanga, but they are both listed in the drop down so what's different? And on Wikipedia it basically says that "Power yoga" (also a style listed) is a style based on Ashtanga. So which one?
Teacher - Wha? I don't know who is good or isn't. At least I can select any.

So I put in my choices (Beginner, 20-40 minutes, Vinyasa, and any teacher) - no results found.

Hm...let's click on that "Beginner Studio" up at the top. So now I'm presented with 8 pages each with 9 videos.

Maybe Programs? There we are. A PDF I can download called "Yoga for Absolute Beginners". But they want a credit card number even if you aren't going to donate. So do I give them $5 and take my chances? $5 for a 4 page PDF that may or may not be step by step?  Or is it literally just a PDF that contains links to videos? Sure $5 compared to $85 (or $225) is nothing.

So a huge amount of information, organized poorly, and downloadable PDFs that require a credit card even if you don't want to donate anything.

And that's just one site.

I'm supposed to be able to parse all this? Eventually I'd love to. But right now it is off putting. It's intimidating. Hell...even this subreddit is intimidating. I thank all the people that are on it and donating their time free of charge, but just looking at posts for a single day you can see conflicting information. And it is usually always ended with something like "Just try it and see what happens". I know at the end of the day it is on me. And I do have to "just try it".

Look. I'm a reasonably intelligent guy. I've written software professionally for the last 20 years. I can learn the basics of a programming language in about a day or 2 and be productive with it in about a week. Yeah. I'm bragging. I'm putting this out there because I can learn things quickly when it is in my wheelhouse. Fitness is not. So yeah...I don't mind paying money to GB for step by step stretching. I don't mind paying GMB for a strength program. I don't mind paying my dietician down the street (who still mocks my food journal) to help me get a sustainable diet. I'm incredibly lucky that I can do that.

But it seems really odd to see all this "shaming" people for spending money because they are (implied) "being lazy and not just using the free stuff".LOLLL at photo I use a 5 foot segment of 1/2 inch PVC piping from a hardware store. It's nice, cheap, and relatively flexible. Thanks for this. For some reason doing it gradually never clicked. I didn't mean it in a negative way. Hmmm.....how badly do I want a nice bridge? This is what I must ask myself.And yet many more to come! Pull ups are a great exercise, and make you feel really accomplished as well!I totally forgot to respond to people last Saturday, but this video gave me some great stress relief the first time I saw it and now, watching it again as I write the new thread.Go ahead and use it. Just set low weights for now, do 5x5 reps of the lat pull downs. It will help develop your back muscles. I find pull ups better but hey, it still works out your back, so why not. Its sad to say that I am 105 pounds, 5'4 and Im a boy.Just try it out. If it works for you, great. If it doesn't , try something else. People are forgetting to experiment with their bodies rather than stick to one fixed way of doing things. i've created my own workout plan (push+pull+legs/fat burn) and I've been seeing great progress, so I will continue. I've done the full body routine and I did not see as much progress so I tried something else. Just experiment. Try new things. You won't lose anything by experimenting. You will  gain experience.I would say straddle hollow holds are the most basic active straddle exercise you could do that would specifically target the glutes.Don't worry about the leg extensions.  But if you can set your feel up right, you could probably use it for assisted glute ham raises.Can't exactly weight one of those can you.I would say it's more about what a bridge represents: thoracic extension. Having that strong overhead ROM has a lot of carry-over to a good handstand line. It's also important for tumbling like macaco and back-handspring.Weighted dislocates.Thoracic extension and open shoulders help with handbalancing work and the flag, and it stretches your hip flexors and abs as well which helps keep you healthy.I would have started doing stick dislocates earlier.Well done! That is awesome :) Ha! Hey man,  whatever works! ankle dorsiflexion AND toe point.Is it worth strengthening the medial glutes as a beginner who lacks that strength? If so, is there anything I can do for the medial glutes without having the requisite strength for bent arm straddle planche?Why? The bridge seems like a great move to achieve someday, but what moves does it lead to / help with?I just use a towel or jump rope pulled taut.And wrist strength, both should be worked on simultaneously IMO.
The way I read this is that you have been literally unable to get out of a tuck planche for a year and need advice on how to escape from that position. Like, you're just walking around on your hands in a tuck planche. That's all. No advice.Middle Splits will help your progressions on pretty much every full extension exercise (Front lever, back lever, Planche, Human Flag)

Pike stretch helps with L-sits/V-sits.

Handstands/Planche requires decent wrist flexibility.Wrist mobility is huge.form is way off. You are pushing into the tuck rather than leaning, which is throwing your shoulder position completely out of line. Start working on planche leans and take a step backThe woods.You'd probably get more use out of a resistance/pull up band. Hardware store. The ones I have are replacement broom handles.5 Pushups and I will be exhausted for the rest of the day.Right on brother. The most important part is the 'beginning' and 'end' of the OAP - correct form means from 'unflexed dead hang' to chin OVER the bar.

To nail the first part you need to use your shoulder and lats; for part 2 you need to learn to bring your elbow to your hip - that will raise your chin high OVER the bar.

180lbs/6'1" - 7 OAC right arm/ 5 leftHow did I not see that coming?All this information is already out there - and even here on BWF!

Just check out the stretching content of BWF Mod Antranik - imho he is a stretching guru; and I'm not even exaggerating!Anatomy lesson!

For whatever stupid reason, the maxillary sinus drains into the nose **upwards**.

[Here's a nice picture from the original 1918 Gray's Anatomy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Gray159.png), which is now public domain, so you can print it out and show all your friends and even sell it!

It's a side view of the skull with the "cheekbone" invisible to show the sinus.

This is a big sinus which will fill up with snot.  It has a tiny hole at the **top** which can drain the snot into your nose.

So I'm not surprised that being upside down helps.  Now that you know the anatomy you can try to drain them without doing a handstand too!/u/amtrak

:\^)&gt;A lot of the people on here are as follows; If you can't, teach. Again, thank you.

That sentence means nothing.

I also don't see an arguement. Sure you can say that you don't think the mods are right but why?

[**Bearded Edit**](http://i.imgur.com/oDaLFSQ.jpg) How is this even about time? I'm staggered by the price because I can literally google "front split stretches" and do almost any of those routines found for the same amount of time as the GB front split stretches take, and end up very close. You're paying $85 for negligible extra efficiency.As I comment on the response below, there is also a leg extension at the bottom. Does that change anything?There is a leg extension at the bottom of the picture for clarification.

So Starting Strength recommends doing 3 sets of chinups until failure, working up to a maximum of 15 per set, and then starting to add weight.

15 seems frustratingly unobtainably high to me.  So I'm curious the reasoning behind suggesting 8-12?  And I'm curious about Riptoe's reasoning for suggesting 15 if anyone knows?

What about adding weight with lower reps, and then trying to increase reps with no weight?  Is this a bad idea?  Or is it just not suggested because this is the bodyweight fitness sub?


Frenchies and grease the groove are the two I can vouch for. After being stuck at about a max of 8, just about 3 weeks ago I stopped doing sets of pull ups and started doing gtg with frenchies added here and there almost everyday. Typically, I don't do much on weekdays since I get home in time for bed after work and school but I still try to hit a couple of sets before hitting the bed. On weekends I try to gtg all day. Now my max set is up to 12. Excited to see where I'll be in a month or two. Besides the ones you've mentioned, I would say bridge is also pretty important.Any lever or planche move will be made easier to progress from adv. tuck to straddle if you stretch your middle splits and start doing medial glute strengthening (bent arm straddle planche work is good for this once you gain a bit of strength in tuck planche)Two things:

1. Well then I guess steven low, coach sommer's athlete's and the mods of this board are all "weak." In the prillepin tables, SSC, and the routines on the FAQ, constantly maxing out on static holds, especially planche and BL, is highly recommended against. I've achieved a straddle planche, but I was over training and ended up injuring my elbows for a little while. Now I've had to back up to adv. tuck. Don't make my stupid mistakes.

2. You're white. We know you're white.  Have you tried turning the rings out? If my hands are in a neutral grip with the rings pointing forwards I'll scrape myself up so bad it can draw blood. If I turn the rings out (externally rotate shoulder, supinated grip) I get completely off the straps through the transition and no scraping occurs. Yoga was the first thing that came to my mind. You could probably get 6 months of hands on yoga instruction for the same price as this. That's what floors me.Feels like magic, right? I use eat lift sleep(the app is called that) My best advice would be to purchase a resistance band. I bought a medium band and a light band a little while ago (they're around 25$ each). Best investment for maintaining good pull up form and actually getting over the bar! All you need is a medium strength one. I was in the exact same situation as you before I got them--was so close to reaching my chin over the bar but could only get to the point where I was still a head under the bar. Whipped on a medium strength band, and that extra 40 or so pounds it took off my weight (185lbs) made me about 15 explosive full range pull ups. Hardly ever use the light one--only if I'm really dying I'll combine the two seeing as now I can push myself without the light band (only takes off like 20lbs).

After getting used to these bands for about a month, I am able to do 8 full pull ups! I would say the issue resides in your lats. Obviously pull ups incorporate biceps, shoulders, back, and you need a good grip, but if your lats are seriously lacking then you will have trouble really squeezing your triceps closer to your sides and pulling your elbows down.

Resistance bands are relatively cheap, lightweight, you can take them anywhere and are extremely versatile for many other exercises! Just don't get slapped in the face from the bands! This makes more sense to me. I can't imagine pre-emptively knocking out 100 pushups every time I want to pop up into a handstand. But I also understand that I need to master all of the elements before this point. Won't take that long anyway.Yeah, I love Ido's mobility routines for the same reason. I feel so ready to do something when I'm finished. Feels good :)I would really recommend against training to failure for static positions, way to taxing on the CNS and CT if you do it often. Congratulations!  Next goal, 10 pull-ups!! Spend much much much more time on planche leans, read Dillon zirkes article on gymnastic bodies on proper scapula positioning too. Your hips are not level with your shoulders because you lack this lean. Good luck!I believe I remember Coach Sommer saying that once you've mastered all the progressions, you can just keep each one as a single set of 10 reps for maintenance at the start of your workout. A technique I read about somewhere which helps me is if I want to learn a particular skill, like a handstand, you practice getting better at entering the skill from different angles, all with control, looking to build up control from all ways of getting into it. Now while doing this you continue to do the original training as normal. And I have found tremendous carry over from what I once considered theoretically to have no carryover at all.

Tldr: explore and play in the range of motions surrounding the particular skill you want to get better at. I feel you bro, i just did my first full unassisted pistol squats this week,  after 4 months trying.  Feels great. One love Thanks mate! I might try it out as a light/rest day active recovery option, my whole body feels pretty fantastic right now. Similar to after yoga or tai chi. And before workouts maybe just do one or two segments time permitting.Yes, it does. According to the GB forum thread, it recommends completing all the stretches, in order, once per week for each course.Also masturbatingI've done this one a lot over the last year. I prefer to do it in place of another workout, usually on off days when I might otherwise do sprints or whathaveyou. It's a good measuring stick to use for whole body mobility, but it shouldn't replace strength work. Just try work it in once a week for now, if that's possible, or shorten it by focussing on one element per session, i.e. QDR one session, au the next, etc.

Oh, haha. I saw the title and assumed it was a different one. I'll actually click the link next time ;)

I think you'd be better off using that stuff as a warmup for whichever body part/s you'll be using the most that day. Doing all of that every time seems excessive. You can also pick a few to practice sporadically throughout the day. Oh, I didn't mean the floreio movements themselves. I'm talking about the routine of mobility work in the link above - squat clinics, shoulder work with resistance band, etc. No QDR or au or anything else from floreio. Antranik's breakdown makes it look like every workout should start with the whole mobility routine, which seems... daunting to me.&gt;As far as overlap, GB course basically has everything Kit's has except you do not need a partner for the stretches.

That's too bad, cause partner stretches are the money. There's definitely some things (I'm looking at you hip flexors; google  "kit laughlin wall quadriceps YouTube") that become tremendously easier to open with a partner. Kit knows what's up. And $225 if you want all 3.

Shameless plug

*  We are currently holding a [horse stance month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXWtk3NLESk&amp;feature=youtu.be) on /r/flexibility (check the sticky) to help increase active flexibility in your middle/straddle splits.

* For the previous splits challenges, I created a [splits routine](http://antranik.org/antraniks-splits-routine/) that covers both front and middle splits...

And oh yeah, it's free.

Also, if the single follow along video is a selling point i'd like to remind people that there are hundreds of *quality* follow along full length yoga classes online with different anatomical focuses of your choice that will teach you aplenty **for free.** (Look up [Esther Ekhart's channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogatic/playlists), [yoga with Adrienne](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene), www.doyogawithme.com and so on).

FWIW, I plan to get out of my comfort zone dramatically this year by making full length follow along yoga/stretching videos on my YouTube channel. I've been doing yoga for 7 years now so I feel like I'm ready to do it already. Should be fun. About 45 minutes on the days that I bike.Just because an answer is simple doesn't mean it's not still the answer.i see people do them on the subway train sometimes hahahttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ru8DMW-grYI'm going to assume your problem is that you're not practicing lifting your hips up and getting into a proper planche position and training that instead of just the tuck planche. The tuck planche is only going to train the tuck planche. You need to progress your extension of the legs now. The way you are kipping and attempting to extend your legs, you need to start practicing that from now on. And  practice it by extending to failure. Don't extend your legs back and then bring them back in. Extend and keep them there and fall. Try to extend as long as you can and focus on bringing hips in line with the rest of your body. You're going to want pillows and such in front of you because you're going to be falling every time you try. And be careful on your shoulders. The more you start extending your legs the more you are going to put strain on your shoulders. The tuck planche really only works your upper back; The strength and muscles needed to do a full planche are much more than just your back. Many other exercises other than just trying the planche/tucked planche will help you as well. You should be able to find information easy on youtube and suchIt is quite a bit more in depth and also includes shoulder extension/flexion work like what is found in H1.How is this bridge different from whats developed as the mobility part of the front lever?Yes -great advice - 'fight the bar' right after your set! Hang on as long as you can, feet off the ground!

For psychological stamina, I imagine there are alligators below me - or lava - angry or ex-girlfriends! (Works for me...)Great article with excellent insight/advice. Thank you!

Agree re Frenchies - many beginners/experts have has brilliant success with Frenchie variations - as a stand alone exercise, even.

Whenever I go for a set of pull ups to failure I usually do a Frenchie hold at the end as long as I can....

(Turn you pullup palindrome upside down!:  dnllnd

or upside down and back-to-front! bnllnb)

;)Its a bold move, lets see if it pays off.Challenge accepted.  My plan is to skip learning handstand altogether, and just jump straight in at press handstand.Back lever maybe?  IDK your question hurts my brain...Hi Josh - I hear you, man!

Everyone's so strong and fast; until they meet a plaster-cast!

"8 years of that would have made me a beast and I'd still have it all!"  Yes - young guys have to understand that they CAN have it all; so long as they are cautious and patient and respect/listen to their body (joints/tendons/ligaments/muscles, even!) Hopefully comments from experienced guys like you can inform them of best-practice/best results outcomes!

Good on you for your injury-free journey; you have the mindset to take injury out of the equation, so the world is yours forever.... ;)

By the sounds of it - you will be 10 times stronger in 4 years - !!!

(Also- I don't want to sound like an old fuddy-duddy, but when I see guys loading ridiculous weights for absurd/wacky 'exercise' and also that hi-speed, hi-impact parkour jumping [crashing] onto concrete over and over... freaks me out!) LOLZ

Best cheers bro.Yeah I don't see a problem with it.  Maybe just don't go nuts on grip work.like tree branches, like ladders, using only arms... stairs in stairwell, climbing them down or up... fun times.

also doing pulls and chins from whatever bar hangs from anything. i was a bit embarrassed because i had an urge to do some off a bus-stop the other day with people around there hahaThe solution is to eat more though, they aren't really giving advice on how to accomplish it but that is the solution. My personal way was to gradually increase. I've seen so many people just decide "today im gonna start to gain" and then try to stuff down 1k more calories than they usually do the next day. I increased my calories by about 200 more than I started with every week until I hit my goal.I love how "eat more" is such generic advice that can apply to so many people in this subreddit. I've personally had trouble eating a lot of food, 2500-3000 calories a day, eventually it just looks unappetizing. It's a fantastic feeling when you can lift yourself entirely with your upper body, isn't it?  I've had the urge to climb things a lot. I personally find if I don't hit the same movements at least twice a week I stagnate.  I've tried 4 day splits like that, and they just don't work for me.The lat pulldown part of it could be useful for building up the muscles associated with pullups if you used it in the hypertrophy range (3-4 sets of 8-12 reps or so), and will continue to remain useful for that until you get to doing that type of volume in unweighted pullups.

The bench press part of it isn't great.  You've got harder progressions on pushups still ahead of you, and even when you exhaust those, using the bench still won't be great since it is on a fixed path of motion.Now this is fucking cool. Those monks are like trap cards. Also thank you for updating the op about back pain and going to the doctor. That's dope thanks! How many days a week should I do that? May the lift be with youAh yeah, good shout, I guess it makes it a bit harder, but better than gashed tricepsThanks, and yeah, badass dismount!
Like chiropracty?

Don't get me wrong there are some amazing ones out there, but from what I've been told it's and incredibly unregulated field and everyone recommends completely different treatments for the same conditions.

Net result is going to see a chiropractor is just rolling the dice.I gotta agree with you. But you have to understand that most redditors are too young to understand first hand that time is valuable on both ends.

Breaking it down to dollars per stretch is overly facile. It's more about how much value it brings you in your life.If she is using the beginner routine she can just make push ups harder, and start doing dips and stuff like that. Same goes for pull ups, for making strength and hypertrophy gains the bodyweight stuff is optimple.It's raining AF where I am (cat 1 cyclone I believe) in still going to go outside and get my training done.Really good work.  Well done.  We all need these milestones however seemingly insignificant to spur is on to greater things.  Soon you will be banging those pullups out like no ones business.Yeah but I've met people with real back problems.  They HATE everyone whinging about their lil back aches whilst they're over there popping Vicodin twice a day just so they can function....Well, admittedly, I could probably phrase it better than, "have you tried having more muscles?"Both are redundant, BUT...depending on your goals, it could supplement what you want to do. Most bodyweight exercises have a built in maximum weight to them, for obvious reasons. If you find your pushups are no longer challenging you, you can use the machine bench to keep upping your weight. I'd stick with the negative pullups over the lat pulldown.

Also, it looks like there  may be a leg extension. It's at the bottom of your picture, so it's hard to see. That one may be more useful, as it's harder to replicate with bodyweight.

Most importantly, if you don't know how to use the equipment, ask someone (like whoever's equipment it is...). At the very least, watch video tutorials on youtube.How much time do you spend on a bike daily? so there are no chest pull exercises whatsoever?Oh wow,  that's great!  Thank you. I'll have a look now :)Im not entirely sure to be honest. I've just started doing chest to bar pull ups. I'll have a look on YouTube to see if I can find anything.  Thanks :)[This thread is a good place to start.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2abwrf/technique_thursday_muscle_ups/) There are Technique Thursday threads on a whole load of exercises. are you doing "explosive" pull ups, where you pull yourself slightly away from the bar to get over? also you need to allow your wrists to rotate to allow for your body to get over the bar, and pull slightly differently. look at some of the tutorials on muscle ups off youtube, they'll say the same.Thanks.tyYou could go for a narrower grip (shoulder width), it should be easier and possibly help you get rid of remaining traces of chicken winging. Then you should start to eliminate your dependence on momentum. What helped me a lot were isometric holds and high pull ups.Both my knees are shit and hurt. I put on twenty pounds in this sedentary job so I want to walk but then my back tightens up in combo with the knees. I end up walking ten minutes then I stop. Plus it's 10 degrees where I am!
But no excuses. I'm gonna walks as far as I can tonight.It's different that's for sure, but it's not "absolutely ridiculous" because how much do you really expect to learn in 1 hour of piano lessons? My point is things in life cost money and people spend money on things that give you much less in return for your dollar. In one hour of piano lessons how much do you really expect to take home? You can be trained by Arthur Rubinstein in one hour and you still won't learn that much special because it takes time to develop things regardless of how hard you try or how talented the teacher is. Michael Jordan can't give you a 40 inch vertical in one workout. So my point is that people will spend top dollars for instruction in real life yet the returns they get can easily be seen as not "worth it" in the same sense people are labeling this series not worth it.ywUpper and lower split for the win.&gt; People pay 30$ an hour for some yoga class or piano class and you can learn all that online for free

This comparison is absolutely ridiculous. You're paying 30 bucks for hands-on guidance. It's a lot different from learning shit online because a good teacher will adapt his teaching style to the student, and this allows for greatly accelerated learning. An experienced I can spot weak spots and correct them as soon as they become noticable, before they are a problem.It is a combination of a machine bench press and a lat pull down. Both are redundant, your push ups and pull ups cover the same muscles. Also machines generally aren't recommended over bodyweight or free weights because of the fixed plane of machine, they don't work the stabilization muscles. Cheers.I stand corrected. Ignore me.OK well I have done the follow along video for the bridge and it is miles ahead of Kit's so far. Don't get me wrong, Kit's is good and for some people maybe it's sufficient, but for others like myself I feel I need more guidance. It gives you 20+ stretches/exercises to do in order. All of them were pretty much way more intense than I anticipated. I'm sweating and light headed right now as I type this and I have to admit I couldn't do some of the exercises to the prescribed times/reps. It's hard stuff that's for sure.

People will complain about costs and I think if that's an issue, then don't buy it obviously. If it's not and you are already following GB courses and enjoy them then go ahead and buy them. When talking about value you can't put value on something by dividing the amount of stretches by dollars like some other guy did, that is just redundant. People pay 30$ an hour for some yoga class or piano class and you can learn all that online for free. It doesn't mean it isn't worth it.

As far as overlap, GB course basically has everything Kit's has except you do not need a partner for the stretches. /u/Antranik writes about it nicely [here.](http://antranik.org/how-to-implement-a-steady-state-training-cycle/)Hello friend, yes there are. Those are pretty hard and I am sure that you will eventually get all of them. However, what is your point?Haha yes! But in reality I am both! *Weak Manlet* would be a more appropriate flair... The routine in the side bar is a full body routine. OP is describing a split routine. Did you just upgrade from weak to manlet? :DThis should help you http://i.imgur.com/zuING.pngYea, having such a high level performer sharing his time would be incredible.I don't, but I can make a video and show you. It will be a little while.Thanks man.

I think the hardest part of all this is for everyone who is still young and relatively uninjured, because it's pretty hard to understand just how much further you can go when you stop rushing ahead full-steam... I was one of the many who just chased the weights for years without getting hurt, got strong as hell, and then problems started because I wasn't respecting the long-term aspects of physical exercise. Even a highly damage-resistant body gets worn down eventually, but none of us seems to believe that until we're the one starting to feel it hahaha!

When you're older and have already been through a few rounds of rehab work, and can look back and say "man, I wish I had been more methodical... 8 years of that would have made me a beast and I'd still have it all!"

I can honestly say that I'm on track to be stronger in about 4 years than I was at 24, in most if not all ways. I'll be 37 then, and if that even comes close to being true it will be awesome, but what's even better is that now I don't get hurt. It is nice to finally be getting stronger AND staying pain free, instead of riding the old merry-go-round I used to be stuck on.
You may want to try SSC Cycles.it might be you just need to practice more and get stronger. i used to have the straps scrape against my tricep area too when i did dips (had huge red marks after dip workout), but eventually i got stronger and more comfortable with them and i was able to push the rings further away from my arm as i dipped down. tighten up your core so you dont lose balance when youre dipping down and separating the rings

edit: push enough just to not scrape my arm. i dont leave a huge gap between my arms and the straps lolI sincerely hope for the same, otherwise I guess it wouldn't add much to the "market" of flexibility programs.How is that even possible? Isn't the muscles in her shoulders tearing apart from that rotation?

Edit: I just rewatched the clip and noticed the wheel things her hands on her that she turns through the movement. Fucking hell still. It includes a follow along routine for all of the stretches.I watched an interview with him, I don't know how long it would take to find that again but he actually seemed like a pretty chill guy that had his head on pretty straight when it comes to working out. Don't know about anything else.Thank you Antranik! :)Do you mean a 4-day split?  I don't think it would be bad, but your frequency would be pretty low (a lot of movements are being trained only slightly more than once per week), which might hinder developing the 'skill' part of the movements.  If you don't like a push/pull splityou could do a horizontal/vertical split  (still 4 days a week though) , with pushing and pulling in the appropriate plane on the same day.Another great write up!You could also exercise based on the Sigittal, Coronal and Transverse planes.Just take it slowly. From what I understand you should really start walking more at first, then do some bodyweight fitness. My guess is that if you can keep a fast / semi fast pace of walking for half an hour 40 minutes you should start training. Just don't give up my friend. Can you try doing push ups and tell me the result?Chest exercises are inherently pushes. You use your back/lats to pullBrah, Talk to me man. I get light headed walking up subway steps. Doctor gave me a stress test and said my heart is good to go but I'm weak and wind easily.Nice! Keep at it, before you know it you'll be knocking out sets of 10. Not hating at all, that was the most controlled and intentional "drop straight onto your face" I've ever seen. Cool as hell, but I'd never have the stones to try it.As I recall, this is from an exhibition of some sort, so he can afford to  fuck around.Cool, thanks.[here](https://instagram.com/p/zVlTSyguaF/?modal=true) is my tuck planche as of nowDoes it include suggested programming? That's about the only thing I can think of where this, compared to Kit's or TK's stuff, could possibly be more beneficial to those people who are unable or unwilling to program their own stretching.

The price point is definitely ridiculous though! Especially considering the already well established competition! Kurz's *Flexibility Express* is a bit pricy at 90$ but includes both splits, squats and back bridge (and squeaky hi-tops!) and Kit's *Mastery series* includes almost anything you could possibly wish for mere 40$. However, both leave you a bit hanging with actual "programming", for plausible reasons though..

Great to hear! Here's to many more. fat fucking chanceso 225/25+26 = $4.5 per stretch?
I'm quite shocked by how much he's charging. I think I'll stick to Kit Laughlin.I have Kit's squat, pancake, shoulder, pike and bridge and I have purchased this. I will comment when I get access to the course and time to look it over. Well to be fair the benefit you are getting you could easily argue it's worth it. Lifetime guidance and future flexibility into old age. Of course you could perhaps have gotten it for free on your own but that doesn't mean it wasn't "worth" the price.

People these days are even too cheap to pay for books when people have spent their lives learning that material and giving it to you in it's most distilled form. They spend months or even years after their lives of learning to make sure the book is written as eloquently as possible, then they have professional editors edit it yet people don't think a book would be worth $10-20.

 It's all just relative. Even making $10 an hour it's just 3 days of work. I would gladly spend the money and I already have. All great information!  The BIGGEST thing you can do to improve your number of pull ups is NOT CHEAT! 2 or 3 strict form pull ups is going to benefit you much more than flailing around doing half reps. I see guys at the gym do this all the time,  and they aren't fooling anyone.  Everyone can see they aren't real pull ups.


Also,  something I like to do is after I'm exhausted from my set of pull ups, fight for another 10 seconds pulling as hard as you can.  Even if you are just staying still or even going down,  it will help tremendously. I usually do a flexed arm hang at the end of every setMeh, money spent on fitness is relative. There are people who spend that much in only a few months for a gym membership. If you are wondering it's 24 stretches for front split and bridge and 26 stretches for middle splits, plus a routine video that shows Sommer going through the entire routine with a few people. Beast mode On!Yeah, I think I paid $10 each for a couple of Kit's Master series, which are quite comprehensive.Short story time: So my father used to be a rock and mountain climber when he was younger and they need such strength in their arms and fingers that they spent a lot of time on isometric exercises, mostly dead hangs on the tips of their finger. I am refering to him as them because he had a lot of friends. There was one specific guy who could **Place a coin between three of his fingers and bend it using those three fingers only**Mind as well hold up a gun!

Kit laughlin charges only $5!!! per position
You... paid for that?And it's fucking $85 for **one** position (front split, middle split, or bridge). No thanks.Don't we allRemember, in this world there are plenty of those who would doubt you and throw shade...so why make their job easier? Put your work in for yourself and I promise good things will come of itlots of ideas came from [here](http://functionallymad.com/journal-your-training-dont-log-it.html)

i don't just log sets and reps but also things like logging pre-workout conditions, rate of perceived exertion, thoughts about form and technique, things to improve, cues from my body and my mind etc.

i write down brief notes in a paper journal then post-workout i will make a full post in my journaling app  I like my system a lot.  I have a google sheets document that i can pull up on my phone or computer anywhere.  Every time i finish a lift,  after every set i record the weight and reps.

Also i record my weight before and after every workout.  This helps not only show weight over time,  but also how intense your workouts were (by amount of lost water weight). It's not a perfect system,  but it works.

I also include a comment section for each workout so i can put things like how i felt,  what hurt,  etc etc.

I have a section for what i eat every day,  but i haven't been good at tracking that... :/

That's what i do and it works for me.  Hope that helps! You'll be fine, I used to do the same thing.  I would do 3 miles to work and back as fast as I possibly could, before construction came and I had to take an alternate route upping it to 6 miles each way. I would also work out and never noticed  negative effect.  Also, depending on how hard you push yourself you are gonna have legs like a boss. Could someone who has and also owns Kit Laughlin's stretch series comment on overlap?There are a lot of isometric exercises that are goals for people in this sub (me included). Planche, Iron Cross, Front Lever, Back Lever, Human Flag, V-Sit and  Manna are all really hard isometric exercises that a lot of people are are working slowly towards.Oh wow I had no idea. They just seemed like some warmup excercises or something. I never heard of them before but they seem really interesting.Damn was hoping it was free[Start here](https://fitloop.co/tracks/bodyweight-fitness) you shouldn't need any equipment to start. Eventually you will want to find *something* that you can do pullups from, but that can be as simple as a tree or ledge, a pullup bar or rings can also be had for only $30, and that is all the equipment you would need.

The Fitloop routine has stuff to start with no matter your fitness level. Even if you can't do a single pushup.What do you personally track?Monk isometrics are not stretches. They used to lock up shaolin monks in a cell with bars on the windows and they had to get out by bending the bars using isometric exercises to become strong enough to do it. Isometric exercises can provide you with a lot more strength than any fitness routine ever will and they are to be done with extreme care (Can be dangerous if not done properly)T-bar row machine if you have them. If not, stick a barbell to a corner, put weight on the edge and make a makeshift tbar row. Feels amazing tbh.http://youtu.be/JMV-3CkWGAI

Practice high pull ups like this guy is doing. I guess some people call that type of muscle up a pendulum pass...it's like if your arms were levers and could just move your entire body around the whole bar in a full circle. But were only doing half circle to get to the top. That guys form on that muscle up though is seriously fucking insane. The applause from the crowd is so warranted haha. It's a whole lot different than just doing the straight up and down muscle up motion on the rings. Notice how his hands are in front of him the whole time. And I loved the dismount Fair enough, thanks for your response.What can you do? What is your level at the moment? Can you do push ups?Trying my best friend!It's cool, I want to split my routine like that too ( different strengthwork tho) Like it, and splits are good if u progress further since u can focus on musclegroups during those days.Here is a fun story. A few days back it was -10 degrees outside but me and my friend still went to the bars. It started snowing, but we still stayed there untill we finished our training. I am not saying it's a smart thing to do but if you set your mind to something you will do it.

P.S:(No, I do not recommend staying out when it's cold)These are NOT stretches. That's an extremely hard (if done properly) training which is a lot more intense than your average workout. You need to read the instructions properly and follow them strictly however. Isometrics are something great and it's proven that they can make you a LOT stronger than going to the fitness. Please take a look at this. http://www.leanfunctionalmuscle.com/isometricsmyths.htmlNo, I would not suggest that. Those isometric exercises are extremely hard if they are to be done properly. Don't look at them as something to do inbetween trainings. They are a lot harder than your average training. Please, take a look at this: http://www.leanfunctionalmuscle.com/isometricsmyths.html Do you know why they are called "Monk's"? Because they used to lock up shaolin monks in a cell with bars on the windows and they had to get out by bending the bars using isometric exercises to become strong enough to do it. Crazy stuffNice post.  I can launch from the bottom easily, and can get my chin on the bar, but have never been able to get any higher than that.  I can do 3x5. Cardio will make your body use oxygen more efficiently. As others have stated, just be sure to make up the calories burned.Do it, please.Calisthenics: is there anything it can't do?Keep going.here's another video with Puccio, and Shauna Coxsey, and Juliane Wurm and Mina Leslie-Wujastyk before the bouldering world cup.

https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=548415825279913Holy shit it does exist!

Edit: As usually there are a bunch of exercises in here that I would have never guessed for each progression. Yes, in fact the [beginner routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) (find it in the sidebar) recommends it. It's a popular split in general, and it makes sense due to different muscle groups doing different things, such as they do.Pullup progressions, handstand progressions and dips are a good place to start. Press handstands are a good way to really build up the trapezius, but that would require a good bit of strength as is (30 second handstand) to start training anwyays.aren't ring flys a pull? i added them cause i was lacking a chest pull :$Or take a tiny tiny spoonful of wasabi.Yeah, it is possible to do too much. I'd suggest backing off for a week and seeing if your numbers go back up after a deload.

I only starting writing pull-up because my autocorrect changes it to that when I try to put it as one word. I was too lazy to change it or add a space. Never noticed to palindrome :)Damn! Ok, guess thats a new goal.The dismount is pure class! Also possibly an intimidation tactic...I'm looking to broaden my shoulders rather than strengthen... so the one that does that?When the program calls for something else it is important to follow the program. Shorter rest periods do have their place, usually to drive hypertrophic response. They are a killer for me to when I do them! Thanks dolomiten. I started Armstrong advanced and find that 1 minute rest between sets is a killer. But it's a different modality so I'll try that for a little while. It's interesting that the benchmark uses 2-3 minutes.Im curious about this too
Patients hate himMoronic Monday question on a Friday here: Is it possible to overtrain your pullups? I have a nice place to do pullups at work, so I constantly bang out a set or two on breaks throughout the day. Then if I complete a full workout at home, including pullups, is that too much? I've found my pullup numbers to be dropping off, lately... I wonder if it's due to overtraining or to all the cheeseburgers and beer.

Edit: Completely off-topic, but does anyone else prefer the spelling "pullup" to "pull-up"? To me, the absence of that hyphen creates a nice, pretty palindrome. :) Also, pullup and pushup are such common terms (or they ought to be), I don't believe they need the clarifying hyphens.Fair enough, the way I read it seemed to imply any schmuck can do it.Could you be more specific than "shoulder"? The shoulders are comprised of a number of muscles, ligaments and joints.Not at all.  Just that people don't realize that PT is just exercise that is tailored to your injury.

I'll leave this here, [Study: Arthroscopic Knee Surgery No Better Than Physical Therapy](http://www.apta.org/Media/Releases/Consumer/2008/9/11/)

And speaking from experience, PT has done miracles for my shoulder.Between 2 and 3 minutes is a good place to be for most people.

[See /u/eshlow's comment here and check out the thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2w4t5r/am_i_doing_myself_a_disservice_by_doing_60/coo6wo2)upper body strength is where bodyweight training shines. None of the push/pull exercises in the routine can be performed without shoulders. So yes, your shoulders will get stronger.Thanks for the post, lots of different variations to get unstuck. For the 3x8-12 what is rest time between sets?$140/hr for someone who is hopefully an expert. Or are you suggesting PT is a waste of time?Should be fine, bike commuting is great cardio because you can easily keep it in the fat burning range as long as you're not racing cars/trucks.Check out the beginner routine in the sidebar, it contains all the info you need to know to get started!I am working on pullups with 5 sets.  Adding at least one rep to each set every few sessions.  It all adds up quickly.

I have previously done a few weeks of the Armstrong programme before injury made me drop out.  But I can say that it works damn well.  i had the worst knee pain forever. couldn't kneel down without needing help getting back up. started doing body weight squats. zero pain ever since.I want to learn to do everything like this guy.

Edit: except his dismount. What.Age: 31
Weight: about 175
Height: 6ft

Tuck planche push-ups. Looks like my hips were dipping on a few reps. This is set 2 of 4. I'll do 5 of these then immediately do 8 slow ring push-ups.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MylzCvsxAgQI'm no chiropractor, but this cracks me up.Yeah I know this since I follow someone who shares a lot of the programs details in his log. But it's still pretty impressive in my opinion if You're able to do this as a warmup :)&gt; Everyone there could do 3 or more (not really a lot, right?). I was really ashamed.
&gt; Now, almost 30yo, i surpassed everyone.

So you can do 4 pushups now? ;)Went for a 3 mile walk around NYC on Tuesday morning, would not recommend. I would avoid training the l-sit every day

I would also do at least 1 pulling motion on saturday that isn't deadliftsQuite a few factors to consider, right?Nice. I like the hanging knee and leg raises from a specificity point of view. It still has people hanging from a bar and is a great way to strengthen their abs, which as I'm sure you know, get worked pretty hard during pull ups.

I like rows too, don't get me wrong. I just decided for the purpose of this I would have every progression hanging from a bar. It has served me pretty well.Eat more to make up for the calories burned.I wanted to second what /u/berrible said. Another tip that helps me is to really concentrate on keeping your torso in a hollow hold, as if you were doing a plank. Try to avoid letting your stomach or chest sag, and to focus the movement in your shoulders and arms. I also recommend keeping your head still. When I move my head, it fools me into thinking that I am achieving a greater range of motion than I actually am.Not much you can do unless you want to learn to do them like this guy; http://youtu.be/2q8KMnWUsvg
In terms of progression, this is very true with push-ups. Your numbers will rise very quickly, plateau for a while then rise again I've found that after roughly two months of doing the routine, my shoulders probably progressed the quickest (in terms of hypertrophy). There's no exercise in there that specifically targets the shoulders (although... L-sits?), but then again, none of the exercises target specific muscles. Pushups, pullups, dips, all the exercises work a ton of muscles.

You shouldn't think in terms of muscles anyway. Think in terms of movements. Horizontal/vertical pushing/pulling. You can be sure that the 6 exercises in the beginner routine work practically all muscles, definitely including your shoulders! :)Congratulations on your hard work! It's pretty cool to be able to lift your bodyweight.

Can I share a funny story about my first pull up? I made it a new years resolution one year to be able to do a single pull up. I'm female, and I'd always heard pull ups were hard for women so I set that goal and figured I'd go from there. So the backstory is that I was rock climbing regularly at the time--I was a good technical climber, but not so great on faces that required a lot of upper body strength.

So I go to the gym that first week of January and walk over to the pull up bar. Rather than starting with weight assistance, I thought I'd just go for it and get a baseline of where I was at. Well, it turns out that all that rock climbing had paid off. I knocked out that one pull up on my first try and then did two more. I was super proud, but I felt kind of silly.

Keep up the good work. You'll be rocking out sets in no time.Can you do the isometric excercises every day including rest days? Or is that ill advised?They actually have their own sub now /r/startbodyweightDon't read too much into this. There are 8 progressions for each of the 4 wrist pushup variations in H1 and they all start with pretty much the easiest imaginable step: hands against the wall. So plenty of time to get used to the volume.  No(yes).congrats! wonderful feeling right there! enjoy and keep it up! I remember your post! Well done! It's amazing how easy it can get, I was too weak to do more than a couple of terrible form push ups at first. Before long I was managing 5 no problem. And before I knew it, it was a set of 15 every time I was at a long loading screen or before an unhealthy treat or whatever.You're so right. I've always been a weakling with almost no muscle but with simple body weight exercises has changed this so much. I had lower back pain, at the age of 18, whenever laying down and bending over but now it's all gone and I can stretch, move, and lift myself easily.

I haven't started using weights yet but I plan to soon, I bought some dumbbells to practice with. Exercise is fantastic, it makes me feel so good.So what are the monk isometrics you posted about? Does doing those stretches or whatever really help?Already mentioned in this thread but [here's](http://www.startbodyweight.com/) and [this](https://fitloop.co/). I started with fitloop body weight beginner program but the other one looks really great too.excellent, well written advice!!That's probably because back injuries are so diverse and complex that lumping them into any general category is ridiculous. And infuriating for those frantically searching for answers.


Source: fit U.S. Marine with 2 herniated discs in lower back, along with facet disease.Chiropractors HATE him for this one WEIRD trick! You'd be surprised how something as simple as exercise can cure most things....I write everything in a journal. There was a great post in this sub about journaling and it changed the way I think about tracking my workouts. Welllll, this'll be very different from my previous posts but at first I used to track em in a lot of ways(Hrpg,many some counting apps,automatic rep increasing apps,finally pen paper) but now I've stopped, idk why but i just feel they're unecessary. I got so used to working out that I just remember my previous reps/sets/exercises and know what to do next.

I still track weather I've done the workout or not, i know that's unnecessary too coz I've stuck with my plan for close to 40 days without deviating at all, even the time(start workout between 5:20 to 5:40) but I still do it coz i just like looking at the streak.I've been doing the PLP challenge, which has you do pull-ups, lunges, and push-ups every day, increasing with one per day. This has brought me from 5x5 to 6x8 over a month.

TL;DR do more pull-ups indeed ;)As mentioned in this thread, just try pushups and dips and use the basic routine from http://startbodyweight.com/ for beginning. I've started with the book of mark lauren und his DVDs. Especially the DVDs are good, because he shows the correct exercise form. But the main thing is, that you start! Begin with pushups and after a few weeks you can see that you've gotten stronger! With this feeling, you can try several routines until you find your perfect fitting routine. Just give everything a try.Good on you op! Keep busting thru the barriers! Summers on its way and it will be worth it !If someone has back pain and does not exercise, they should start, whatever is feasible for their condition. Of course there are situations where exercise won't help.Rule 1.The volume is high because the goal is conditioning the tissue, not maximal muscle strengthJust to report in, i did around 10 sets of 5-8 reps, previously warming up with some explosive pullups, lsit pullups and regural chins.

I started with 5kgs, and slowly went up to 15kgs. Did 5 clean reps on my last weighted set with 15's. Needless to say my back is smashed, so thank to all of you!


Man, I miss walking!! I would go on 10 miles walks on Saturday and Sunday around NYC but its been too damn cold for that, stupid winterSuper helpful.  Thank you!my back always feels a little achy unless it's on the days i do deadlifts. then it feels fucking amazing for the rest of the day.I like circuit training for maintaining skills that I already have down, but I don't try to progress, so the intensity is not maximal. It's time efficient, which is good for that purpose, but it's not a tool to get strong with.You motivated me to start but I don't have access to a gym / bar / rope at all. What do you recommend and which exercises should I start with?Feel free to PM me if you need help with stuff. I did martial arts for many years and have done strength training for quite a while too. Inverted bodyweight rows like this: [pic](http://centennialfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/0910-inverted-row-200x200.jpg)

You can elevate your feet to increase the difficulty, then progress from there to front lever work. Check out the horizontal pulling section of the exercise wiki in the sidebar.I think your elbow positioning is fine, they stay fairly close to your sides.

Looks like you're letting your middle sag a little though. Try to keep your glutes engaged and your back flat, just stay a bit more rigid through your bodyline. The last couple reps you were kind of bobbing your head and extending your spine.

Those look pretty good though. It definitely gets harder to stay straight as you elevate your feet, and your feet are really elevated. You might consider progressing to one-armed or pseudo-planche push-ups at this point.I do pistol squats :) what are rows? handstands make me dizzy so haven't been successful so farBalance out my body, have strong glutes and quads and so look a bit bottom heavy :)I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2v73pq/pull_ups_guide_part_1_getting_your_first_pullup/) a couple of weeks back to help people get their first pull-up. Nothing original, just a collation of stuff around. I have two questions which more or less address the main differences between the posts:

* Why do you use hanging knee and leg raises as a step towards pull-ups?

* Why don't you recommend doing rows to build pulling power for people who can't yet do pull-ups?

Other than that, I like the use of mixed grip hangs. It is something I hadn't thought of to make the movement easier. Rows, handstands, squats?Wow, doctors must hate you!Age: 18. Weight: 67kg / 147 lbs. Height: 172 cm / 5'8".

Attempting 6 reps of Foot-Elevated Diamond Pushups.

Current best is 3x6, although I feel I can increase to 3x8 without issue. I pair these with Foot-Elevated Inverse Rows (3x8) at roughly 66% of this height (they also feel easy)



http://youtu.be/qi4pe2p0vkU



I am concerned about elbow positioning and whether I am loading weight correctly for this movement.
Wow, pull ups are a lot more intricate than I took them for.I don't track my diet very closely and pay zero attention to body measurements, but I record all my workouts and runs on a regular wall calendar.

Works great for me. I like having a clear record of my diligence or laziness staring me in the face. Every MWF should show a detailed workout, every TuThSa should have a total time and my mile splits, every Sunday is rest and weigh-in day. So at the end of the month there should be no blank days. Of course there usually are a few, but it's really satisfying to have a good full page at the end of the month, and it's a good wake-up call if there are a lot of empty spaces. Just visually really helpful.Hey guys,

unfortunately I'm unable to post a video of me doing the workout,
but maybe you can help me if I just explain my question/problem.

I'm using the basic routine from startbodyweight.com.

In terms of leg raises (hanging bent V), I tend to swing back a little on my pull-up bar and touch the wall (to which it is mounted to).
Is that a big problem? From what I can see on the pictures on startbodyweight is that he's also tilting back a little.
Current rep is 877

My second question: Tuck knees front lever rows. Here I tend to swing and I feel that
I have my feet to high up in the air (45 maybe). Did anyone experience similiar problems?
How do I keep myself from swinging?

Current rep is 655, but i feel my form is really lousy.
Okay, before you do sports specific strength or power training a solid base of general preparation is a good place to start. You will want to be following a strength program like the one listed in the FAQ here.

Here are some solid targets for you if you are planning to primarily use bodyweight as your tool:

* 15 pull-ups, while that is pushing into the endurance range for a fighter that is a good number to aim at and maintain. Once you can do that then add in archer pull-ups or weighted pull-ups

* One armed rows or a 3 x 5-8 tucked lever rows. This is important to be able to pull people in to you. Sometimes Judo rounds are won on the first pull. In competition try to give the other person whiplash on the first pull of their gi.

* One armed push ups. This denotes pretty solid pushing power which is also handy for a lot of throws.

* Solid handstand and/or full ROM handstand push-ups. At least get the latter movement. Also doing shrugs in a wall supported handstand is great for bullet proofing your shoulders.

* Pistol squats and shrimp squats. Once you can do those think seriously about getting into the gym and doing front squats.

* If you can get hold of a kettlebell then swings will do wonders for your power generation and cardiovascular endurance. Consider doing deadlifts.

Once you can nail those targets worry about how you can tailor your strength into power. Build the foundation first! For speed head over to /r/Sprinting.I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR COMMON SENSE BACKED BY DEMONSTRATION AND SCIENCES!!That's not true, he/she has posted a lot of quality stuff here in the past, particularly a long piece about the hip flexors if I recall correctly. It's not against the rules to disagree with the mods.

As for recommending GB's H1, maybe it's a little out of place in this thread but people recommend those GB programs all the time, they're pretty well regarded programs. It's not like he recommended Mike Chang's six pack baloney.When I was younger I did Tai-kwon-do but now I'm going to a mma gym that teaches a variety of styles. I'm currently learning BJJ and Judo.kinda like traction i would imagine.Hey can you link me to some of the stuff you used? I'm ready to change who I amHey man. What is it you're trying to achieve?What martial arts do you do? Age: 16
Weight: 137lbs (62.3kg)
Height: 5'8 (173cm)

Muscle-Up: Struggled with "chicken-wing" form and transition the past couple months until recently I got it down.

Usually do 3 sets of 2-3 reps.

I would appreciate critique on arm width on the bar as I feel it affects my pushing strength on the dipping portion.

Cheersit's typical for a weightlifter to poo poo this kind of training method without any real expertise. don't listen to your friend, he's just talking out of his ass. i switched from regular weight lifting to bwf and never looked as balanced and muscular as i do now. Well simply a personal goal of becoming as fast as I can. But mainly for running and martial arts, yes.I thino all you'll get here is anecdotal. Deadlifting helped mine, for instance.It tends to imply no upper or lower bound. I imagine 5 sets of AMRAP pullups as exceeding 15 or more reps eventually. Choosing an actual rep range gives you clear indications of when to progress your exercise.This is something I hadn't considered. Thanks for your input. I don't doubt that they're good exercises, just that the volume seems a little high.It sounds like you are suggesting that it is as simple as exercising to cure any back pain full stop... I'll sell you 30 pills for only ~~$39.99~~ $29.99! That's 25% in savings, $0.99 per day! INCREDIBLE VALUE!!I didn't see this post before. Your method isn't flawed. In fact, it'll get a mention in my expanded version of this post. It's cool. I noticed this trend of people blindly spouting other people's recommendations without any real knowledge of said information.Thank you for subscribing to Fun Cat Facts! Here is a fun fact about cats:

&gt;A kitten with green fur was discovered in Denmark in 1995. Originally thought to be a genetic mutation, scientists later determined it was due to high copper levels in the water supply.
The wiki format and loads of seperate vids for the begginer routine is a pain.  I'm embarrassed every time i click cat-camels in the warm up (that guy... not a good look).  If one of our users could do the whole routine in 3 seperate videos it would be very handy.

My favourite part is Antranik's bodyline drills because he talks you through them, shows you what good form and bad form look like, and i don't need to click for each individual drill... he also doesn't look like a sex offenderWhat are you trying to increase speed for? Track and field? Sports? Martial art?
Just curious, why is AMRAP not a good idea for strength goals? What fitness component is it best used to train?honestly, i just memorise the reps i've done. weight and diet is taken care of on mfp.

i know i couldn't do more than 5 push ups a couple weeks back. i did a 3x11 last workout, so that's enough for me. don't have to patience to write it all down, hah.I somehow ended up in this sub and found this comment. Thanks for this, gives me a good way to keep my hands fresh...Okay so either stop doing so many God damn pushups, or put a weight vest on and keep doing so many God damn pushups.  Imagine if you could do that many with twice as much weight....

Eat more?I don't think you would need to remove any bars from it.  Sure, maybe to do swings or pullovers or something but basic lever work and muscle ups it would be just fine the way it is.Of course you are not gaining strength if you are doing +50 push ups, do harder variations like pseudo planche push-up etc. to keep them in rep ranges of 1-5. Best thing would be to do a beginner routine from here http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routineYou will be surprised how quick you can progress once your body gets into a routine and you start building a bit of muscleThank you friend. I was actually directed to that website when I first started and it really helped me!Haha I doubt that but only time will tell.Wow, good job friend. Thank you for your time. I will try to stick to normal push upsEh, everyone likes getting their routine rated.

You can continue to benefit from full body training all the way through to competitive gymnast with iron crosses and shit if you want to.  I'm not saying full body doesn't work, just that you couldn't make that kind of inference based of what little information you had available.

apologies if I offended or anything.  I've just seen a lot of people recently parroting back advice that they heard from other people but don't really understand.  So sorry if I took it out on you.One day you won't even remember how weak you are now.  You literally won't understand how you couldn't do things that you take for granted.

It happened to me, and it will happen to you.Yeah I don't know what's up with this guy.  He picked a fight with one of the mods earlier over shoulder mobility, and his name even says he has terrible shoulder mobility....

So PSA: don't listen to that dude people.  He's either trollin or stupid.  I'm not sure which is worse.Any rapid, major diet change will have negative effects at the start. The human body is very much a creature of habit. Shit, that got me thinking dude. 100 push ups as a warm up in a quick manner would destroy me and make my workout suffer really bad. Not to mention that I can't do any of the variations in the program (i don't do F1 or any other GB program). I really need to up my work capacity. Thanks bro, because this question keep in my mind like how many days and thinking I am too stiff if exercise without weights. Thanks because is been several months I do weighted calisthenics and if I do muscular endurance training like 5 muscle up 5 sets with a friend battling each other taking turn. I easily getting tired doing that and form was terrible.

I only do dips and pull ups weighted for now but never made me stiff cause im foam rolling and stretching. You can still be big and flexible at the same time if that was your question.Do you have a pill I can take that will make me listen to your advice? Yeah, it took me several months to work up to them, but now I can do ten or so in a row. My next goal is to get a four clapper (so I have a party trick trump card). I should post a progression some time, because I think I stumbled upon a pretty effective way to build up to them.Congratulations.  This is only the start believe me.  This time next year you will be doing 50plus with ease! Keep up the great workYou can continue making progress when you're intermediate even with full body. Stuff like DUP is great for that. To be fair you can implement DUP in splits too and stuff like that may become necessary as you move into advanced. I also assumed he's still a beginner/early intermediate due to the question asked.Check r/keto and r/ketogainsI remember when i was a kid in shool, 5th grade i believe and the teacher told us to do pushups to see how everyone was. I did one and collapsed into the floor. Everyone there could do 3 or more (not really a lot, right?). I was really ashamed.

Now, almost 30yo, i surpassed everyone. What to say about pullups. Not one of my friends can do at least one!

Keep going and don't rush things. I'm seeing people recommending a lot of stuff to you right now, but hold back a little.
Keep doing the beginner routine to have a solid base. Forget diamond pushups until you can do at least 3x8 regular pushups, go slow or you can injury yourself.You should definitely check http://startbodyweight.com 's basic routine. Did wonders for me.   In my experience weighted calisthenics don't make me stiff. Weighted calisthenics + no mobility or flexibility work makes me stiff.

Circuit training is good if you want to get a sweat on. Probably good if you want to build muscular endurance in the movements you are practicing or prepping for a Tough Mudder or something like that. I don't think they are good for building strength.

Some styles of circuits may have some really solid effects. Dan John puts exercises together and calls them complexes. For example, do 8 front squats then run 400m. Wash and repeat. These are specifically tailored for an outcome (in this case, explosiveness off the mark).

If you do circuits as your primary source of training you will likely progress a little, then stall and not get anywhere. If you enjoy them and want some workouts with low intensity movements and get your heart rate up then they are good fun. It really all depends on how much you care.  I've only ever looked back through all my old workouts once or twice, and I always cringe at the stupid shit I used to do back then.

The way I see it, I'm always the strongest I've ever been, and the only workout that matters is the next one.  Not much point in dwelling on the past.Absollutely. It doesn't matter if you are tall, short, fat, skinny, or whatever. You just need to tell yourself I can do it and just do it. Never give up!Glamox, I started in the same position as you. Couldn't do one single push up, felt like a complete whale after binging at University becoming the biggest I've ever been. A year and a half later I'd lost 60lbs and was doing MMA training. It's a long road but keep up the good work.

To go from Zero push ups to what you have done means anyone can do it if they set their mind to it.Yeah, just putting an ear to the ground and see if others have better ideas than I.

There are all sorts of websites and stuff for keeping track of goals and so on, there were some in Tim Ferris' book but I never really used them.Bro you can triple clap Pushup?I always wanted to make a graph of all my various exercises and my performance in them over time, but I have better things to do with my life.

Write down every workout and some notes about how you felt about that workout.  Keep them forever.  Add bodyweight next to the date.  That's probably all anyone can reasonably be expected to do.Take the Tuesdays and Sundays from the higdon, except from week 3 thru 7 add 0.5 to each Tuesday run, then in week 8 drop the Tuesday run back to like 3 miles so you're fresh for race day. It could be muscle imbalance. If you have only been exercising one particular muscle group (only pushing muscles like triceps, chest or only pulling muscles like biceps, back)  then you should start exercising both muscles groups. Legs go separate. Best of luck to you. I actually have always used notebooks. The Rite in the Rain ones will take lots of damage and sweat and all that.

I really only use them for inspiration. Flip back a few pages if I feel a plateau or something. Very encouraging.

http://www.amazon.com/Rite-Rain-Green-Tactical-Weather/dp/B000ZZTUEMYeah, I really hadn't used a spreadsheet until fairly recently, but I've found it very helpful in staying on track with goals as well as making sure I'm always improving.Yeah, trying to find middle ground between keeping track and going into too much detail.Thanks for sharing, good luck with your goals.

I will make some sort of spreadsheet myself but am unsure of its form as yet.I write down my workouts in the notepad ap on my phone.  I pretty much only do this so I can do more next time.

I barely even track what I weigh, let alone calories, body fat %, macros, the size of my biceps or any of that shit.  I dont even count *reps* sometimes....I have quite a few goals that I set for myself at the beginning of the year, and I'm tracking progress on those. A screenshot would be pretty indecipherable; since I abbreviate everything it looks like a table of jumbled letters and numbers, but here's an abbreviated version of what I have:



 |  Exercise| Week 1| Week 2
---|---|----|----
S| Overhead Press | Wt| Wt
S| Handstand Pushups| No.| No.
C| Triple Clap Pushups| No.| No.
C| Chest Press| Wt| Wt
Ba| Chinups| No.| No.
Ba| something| xx| xx
And| so| on| ...

I keep track of what I can do each time I do an exercise or lift, and try to make sure I'm not neglecting anything (which is easier to notice if I can see everything I did each week). TrueHa! That's great that it helped so much so soon; everybody wins!!!

Brilliant! Go for it and with time, you will become the ultimate push up master of the universe - you can and you will! "I have a girder running through my house that I use for pulls up. Kinda sucks because its hard to grip."

No it doesn't suck - that's awesome! Extra grip training as a free bonus! Yes!

Rule 2.Wow, the breathing part actually helps out A LOT! Thank you very much my friend.http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_answers_to_my_questions_about_diet.3Fhttp://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_is_my_routine_good.3Fyou may find that the nature of these exercises changes as you begin to improve your form and build better tissues.

all I know is that I find when I improve my alignment elsewhere sometimes I would practice my wrist push-up variations and they would take on a new character. In particular when my lower traps and other external rotators got a lot better I realized greater single joint control of the wrist and first knuckle, which drastically increased the strain in these joints, bringing me off my knees where I had been practicing these exercises well before I ever read H1, and onto the wall.


But as the others said if you are a wrist push-up master you now own an awesome warm-up technique. coolGo see a doctor.  Something isn't right.What are the areas you keep track of if you don't mind me asking?

Or if you aren't averse to sharing a screen shot?Great work glamox- keep on the push ups! There's great 'perfect push  up' article win Men;s Health - I learned so much from it! Please check it out bro!

http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/10-secrets-perfect-pushup I just use Excel to track my performance in different exercises. As long as I'm making gains, I know I'm on the right track, but if I stall out (or regress) I know something (diet, sleep, even whether I'm stretching enough) is not right. Granted, this works well for me partially because I have a pretty decent idea of what I should be doing.I think your 'reverse scorpion' might be an exercise I've seen called 'swimmers' on some military pt website.  As far as I can tell its like an arch body hold but much easier.

Sit ups are bad for you, they don't make you strong or give you abs and are altogether one of the worst exercises ever created.  sub them out for something that actually leads somewhere.Hey cheers that's really helpful. You think it's mainly a mobility problem then, not that I'm places my wrists in an incorrect position somehow? Well like I said I only found this today. So I definitely will give the beginner routine a try. So I just thought I would see what people thought about what I have been up to.

The reverse scorpion, I kind of named it myself. Basically, I lie flat on my front with my arms straight above my head, then lift my body up and pull my elbows downward and behind my back.

Why should I stop doing sit-ups? Please enlighten me!

I will however, definitely try your approach to hands stands.Hello friend. Can you direct me to some learning sources? I have no idea what a handstand 1 is and there are so many links...

Edit: This actually is an advertisement. No thank you.I read some of your older posts when I got the notion of suggesting handstand 1 from gymnasitcbodies to you, and I think it would be great for you. The type of postural training those monk exercises suggest are great and totally required in order to feel the real benefits from H1. The wrist push-up variations and neck work really is awesome for stimulating postural improvement.Never give up, never surrender. Beast mode!this is perfectly normal. your wrists and hands need to be trained and stretched. do this every day for a couple of weeks and you pain will most likely be gone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjEProbably.  Dead hangs are an amazing stretch for the lower back, you just need to find something tall enough to do them off.Kit covers individual finger flexibility (from the first knuckle like you mention) in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmMfW2kCkeE).that's fucking cool of him to do that.  your handstands look great as well-- I'm hoping to get there someday soon.Maybe I judged prematurely then-- I'd just never seen any of Hannibal's videos deal with good progressions or programming advice. I'll take another look.I think some variations of the back pain can even be fixed with a bit of dead hang and some walking!&gt; I had back pain and now it's gone

This.  A million times this.  I'm so sick of hearing people bitch about their backs when they do ZERO exercise.  I try to tell them there's a super simple solution, but no-one wants to hear it....Eccentric pullups focus on the negative aspect - basically lowering only.  I think you just mean pullups, which is standard nomenclature to differentiate a pronated grip (palms facing away) from a supinated grip (palms facing you) which we call a chinup.

Also by scorpion sit-up things are you referring to locust pose?

So if you want to solve the girder problem, sling a towel over it and hold on to that while you do chinups.  It's much better for grip strength and forearm development.

Turn your wall handstands around so your stomach faces the wall.  This will let you get better body line practice.  Walk your hands in as close as you possibly can - ideally, until your feet start coming off the wall.

Stop doing sit-ups.

You can do a lot of pushups!  How about you keep one or two sets of 50 reps in your routine as a warmup and work on harder variations, like a one arm Pushup?

I have to ask: if everything you've read says you're doing it all wrong, why haven't you changed things?Welcome to the subreddit! I'm glad you're pumped about BWF.

Eccentric pullups is just another term for negative pullups - where you start at the top and then slowly lower yourself down. I don't think that's what you mean here - if you mean pullups where your palms are facing away from you (as opposed to a chinup where they're facing towards you), then you can just call those pullups - the hand position is implied.

As for your routine itself, have you had a chance to read the FAQ? It has a lot of good information about programming that you might find useful.

To be specific, you are doing far too many different exercises and too many reps of each exercise if your goal is to become stronger. For example, you would be much better served by doing a harder pushup variation, like diamond pushups or pseudo planche pushups (which are described in the beginner routine), for lower reps, rather than doing 50 reps of normal pushups.

I hope this is helpful!I would say it's ok to eat more. From the pictures, you don't have that much fat to lose. Putting on muscle should be your priority.I didn't find it that hard to follow as I've started following the program, although to be fair I've been lurking a few months and have started reading the concept and technique weekly threads.  That being said, it is definitely a living document, as seen by the revision history of the page.

The first sticking point I've had with the routine is not quite being able to do the wall extensions that well yet, although there are some great discussions searchable on the sub that discuss increasing mobility for the movement.

The second is that while I understood the description of 10x0, I didn't know what the components meant themselves, as I mixed it semantically with "ten by zero".  Only recently did I read a comment on the sub that explained tempo terminology to relate to "one second down, zero bottom, explode up, zero top".  So it's possible that a link to the [tempo Concept Wednesday](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2lcv89/concept_wednesday_tempo/) may help this issue with future users, although it may also just overload them with information that they don't need quite yet.

The only other suggestion that I've considered would be a link on the hollow body to a "progression" for it (For example [the one done by Ryan from GMB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlDNef_Ztsc)), but that's only because I personally couldn't hold the full hollow body, and didn't see how I could keep my lower back on the ground.  Again, I'm not sure if this is just a weak point for myself, and would lead to information overload for the average person looking at the routine.

Although I thought it would be apparent from the layout that all three pairs should be done, I can see that a listing under the FAQ to do all of them might help if it is a common problem.  I mean, it is the FAQ, right?  Do you have any suggestions of how the page could be worded to be made more clear?

ETA: To be fair, rewatching Antranik's bodyline video, he does explain the variations.  I should have just watched his video again.sometimes a pinched nerve can have a huge effect of strength and doesn't even cause any pain.I think he said he had been on the diet for 2 weeks so thats closer to 2-2.5lbs/week which is a lot, but reasonable.  Also, as following_eyes said - water weight.Eat some spaghetti and try again the next day. I don't know what kind of diet he has got you on but if it's to lose weight, still eat your carbs if your planning on exercising.

Good luck my friend the military can be an awarding experience if you make it that way. Excellent comments/advice by Josh.

The key points in his post which should inform ALL your training (especially weighted chins after injury{!}):

 (Paraphrasing) - 'scale slowly' 'proper warm up' 'take your time' 'don't rush' 'wait' 'avoid' 'proper warm up' 'don't aggravate'  - all this stuff is pure gold for training and progress.Ah. Of course.I hope so, CTS in both wristsI've never considered that. I'll try it in the near future. Thank you!If you approach this gradually it should actually also help your wrists strengthen and heal.Strange but after hitting a deadlift pr recently I tried lifting heavy again and a weight that's relatively light for me felt harder than the last pr. It could just be you pushed yourself too hard although it's weird you just can't do anymore. How's your sleep, food, etc? Could be a lot of factors why you just have no more strength at the moment.When Yuval was going for his [40 set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1D9cr5O11Y) I got inspired and decided to try [my own noobish quasi-rendition of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jJPybjm7K8). I sent it to Yuval not expecting him to even look at it, but he did! He even commented on my video and gave me some great advice. If he would be willing to give some completely unsolicited advice to a random kid on YouTube then I'm sure he would be willing to grace us with an AMA. VariationsVars?&gt; one of the most common movement patterns

Exactly.  People don't need to train it specifically, they'll just get better at it as they train other pushing movements.  Pretty sure if I double my weighted dips my bench will go up.

Only reason they say to train all these different movements is to keep the shoulders balanced and healthy.  Since most people are overdeveloped in a horizontal-pushing kinda fashion, adding more is not really a great idea.

Some people say you should do at least as much overhead pressing as horizontal pressing.  I say, why bother doing horizontal pressing?

Source: doubled my max rep one arm pushups without training horizontal pushing at all.Are you serious? A horizontal push is one of the most common movement patterns you can have. There's a reason why bench press is a good measure of overall pressing strength and why it's a staple in almost any barbell strength routine.Third option: stay the weight you are right now and just get stronger.Its just 100 pushups dude.

Source: finished all the pushup varsI'm pretty sure I did nothing right the first few times I did the beginner routine. I do appreciate the work that went into creating it, but it does read like it was written for someone who already knows what they're doing.thanks
Well to be honest, I am up and ready to give this program a shot, but my friend is super sceptical about it, and things that it won't give him the same body as regular weight lifting will. So I am trying to tell him that this is about equal in muscle gains, but this gives more balance and coordination than just lifting.We all have those moments haha, just glad it works out Good point. I'll stick with it. I know I'm no snowflake :PYeah spending a couple decades watching adults fuck themselves up failing to do things little kids don't even notice will do that.

There's a lot of time spent drilling the basics, because they seriously work.  Even when you get to a very advanced level you can still benefit from them.  I personally don't follow Foundation, but that's more ADD than not liking the program.

But you want to keep training that wrist prep.  There's a difference between being able to perform an exercise and not getting any benefit from it.Can't believe I didn't think of this...Definitely works the back more! Just to make sure: what does training overhead flexibility have to do with training behind the back flexibility?I only just got my clean skin the cat.  Previously I could do ugly ones with kipping and bent arms, but yeah, we're talking probably 3 years at this point?I just thought I'd have a better chance of an honest answer here. The forum seems to have a lot of "just follow the program" sort of answers, but the programming seems a little conservative, in my humble opinion.Try putting your fists horizontal, so your thumb faces inward. Put them wider then your shoulder. It might not be like a normal push up or a close one, but I just tried it and it seems I can get my wrist to minimal movement there.

How's that work?Nah.  Dips and handstand push-ups are a balanced amount of pushing, no horizontal push is necessary.

Deadlift is a pretty boss isometric horizontal pull, so no worries there.Or, you know, don't horizontal push.  That's probably the least necessary movement pattern to train.Possibly... I'll have to try some outYou should probably ask this in the GB forums, but keep doing them.  Eventually you'll just be doing a quick circuit of all of them with no rest between sets, which shouldn't take too long.Not in the same forward facing positionYesPush through your fingers, not the heel of your hand.You learn with time, and as long as you don't do anything stupid and injure yourself, you'll be fine. There are small details that you learn with time, for example with pushups, tightening your body, rotating your hands slightly inward (at least for me), keeping your back straight, not flaring your elbows and all that stuff, but you'll still do good progress as a beginner without those tips.Do you think you'd be able to grip some parallettes and do pushups? Actually, if you rotate the order of pairs, and even the exercises in the pairs, it's slightly better. Or, if you are focusing on improving something, doing it at the start can help.

I used to rotate them, but I don't anymore because I'm a lazy ass.Are fist push ups feasible for you?Never asked for medical advice. Telling my situation and asking for targeted movements to increase strength in that area.

Perhaps maybe someone who has walked these shoes would be more qualified to answer me.

Also, I've been seen for the last 9 months by all sorts of medical professionals, and was recently released to full duty. Part of that was instructions to maintain physical activity, especially in regards to that area. Alright cheers! Shadow boxing? Rowing? Jump Rope?I'm also new to this program too and have only been doing it for a little over a month so I could be completely wrong but I started having that same issue around my second week of doing the program. I would have a lot of pain in my lower and outer palm when doing handstand skillwork and sometimes pushups. I started really making a point to spend time on the wrist mobility portion of the warmup and the pain went away over a few days. I also read somewhere that you made need to rest an extra day since the ligaments in your wrist may not be used to the additional stress you've been putting on them lately.

Hopefully that helps!It sounds like a diet issue. When I did keto there were times when my 3rd workout in a week would be me failing at every lift I tried. Then I started cycling my carb intake so I would be depleting my muscles all week and then on Friday I would lift my whole body. I would do each workout to failure, and then I would eat a ton of carbs afterword.  The Friday workout(when my muscles were basically storing no glycogen) would be pretty pitiful.  But after doing the carb load, I would come back really strongly after a day of rest. Instructions unclear now missing an arm :(I know and I feel you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMV-3CkWGAI
I just feel like this is a lot of resistance. And he does this all day everyday. And if you've never seen this guy this video is crazy lol&gt; LOTS of water

This. If you think you're drinking enough, you're wrong. Force water. You'll still be pissing yellow, I guarantee it.Very cool, Thanks!!Depends on his goals. This routine will cover all pushing and pulling musculature sufficiently. You simply cannot go from 20 pushups to zero without being injured, sick, or it all being in your head.  Quit now, quit forever. Maybe you're not ready yet. Follow the advice as stated already, diet , REST, and see a doc. Hell, maybe your blood count is low.Are you... eating anything else? All I see is white meat, protein shakes (gainer shakes, or protein shakes? Mixing with water or a milk?), and a banana. Your dinner is a big question mark.

That said, it doesn't just sound like you need more protein (this could be true), but you need more calories. In the form of fats, carbs, whatever. You just need more to eat. It would be very helpful to track exactly what you're eating for diagnostic purposes.Do you know of an online tutorial for something like this?  I'm having a hard time picturing what you describe.I am blind. I thought I saw weighted push-ups in there.
No matter. Lean forward for some chest dip sets and he's golden. Or, throw in some weighted push-ups/bench. :)How's your stretching?BothI think there does need to be a bit more explanation on the beginner routine. I am a noob my self and read all of these posts as I am still not convinced that I'm doing it right (just because of the vague/technical nature of the wording)Sweet, I'll give this a try. Thanks!
Needs some horizontal push/pull too.I can't see any horizontal push in there.

Handstand pushups are vertical up, dips are vertical down. Where's the horizontal push?I know this. But the stuff he's doing IS a lot of resistance. Either way maybe I could see steroid use as well. Where did you guys hear this?Yes but it takes great discipline dont think i didnt work hard for thisA question for the mods:  How often does this beginner question come up?  Just curious.  Maybe we should put in the recommended routine something like, "Do all strength exercises, all pairs per workout." Maybe it'll help a lot.  What do you think?

Edit:  Grammar.lol you can still make comments even after the thread has been deleted??https://instagram.com/p/xGGxc2EdkP/You got it. One big benefit of taking your dips lower is it will help you with the muscle upah ok. i shouldve searched first instead of posting, there have been a few discussions on this. pretty much take it slow and if hurts dont go lower and work your way to lower your form. I would probably pay money to have Yuval do an AMA.Me either, google searches had me discouraged. Then I went to the store, just to see what they had, and most of it was expensive. Then I randomly ran into the steel garage door pulleys, with ball bearings, for a few bucks. That was that :)Oh wow.  I had no idea they were so cheap.Home depot has garage pulleys for less than 10 bucks, that's where I got mine.Do L-Pull ups work the back much more then normal pull ups or do they just work the back while also working the core?If it doesn't hurt you are not hurt. Take a full week rest, make sure to eat a lot of protein and get a lot of sleep. You should be back on top after that.

To add on this for those who still don't get it, levers shift your center of mass and applies more force on your upper body because of torque . So the comparison between 100% and 140% is wrong and meaningless. Also, FL improves you to do more advanced work isometric and bent arm so its a better progression if you won't to progress further, not minding the actual load of the FL against
 OA row which i would say even harder in FL.

http://youtu.be/6ORpP8K05k0?t=2m19sbecause its a classic approach to full mobility in the girdles and spine. How he is gonna achieve full mobility is up to him, and as mentioned, you could replace bridge and pike with other goals (superman hold, downward dog/handstand) or even a kettle bell approach to mobility (or whatever works, lots of stuff works.) Just what I wanted to recommend, but I think I like downward dog with the sun salutation thingy better personally, but its not the traditional combo

what doesnt work is german hangYes you're right about the flexion term (shoulder flexion=arms overhead)... and the shoulder goes into hyperextension as the body goes toward the german hang... but what does that have anything to do with a bridge or pike?Yes it does, here is my thought.

-Never ever do this exercise unless your shoulder has full ROM and is healthy. Just don't everywhere you read it says this and slizzardman has great videos on it

-I have no formal education but you begin full flexion in a dead hang (I'm right about this term?) and as you move the torso and legs hinging on the shoulder you effectively bring the shoulder into hyperextension? This is why I recommended bridge and a pike exercise, easily could of said downward dog (and this is nice because it brings in scapular elevation and shoulder flexion into the mix too, but good luck having a nice pike without those.)

But really the level of detail in the post, combined with the fact that he is attempting an exercise which requires superb shoulder health (adults + BL problems extends to this exercise) while very clearly explaining his shoulders don't like it and he feels weak in it... yeah I like my response but perhaps I should of mentioned more about the hazards of what he is doing at the moment. You can't force your way into mobility.Take the time to stretch each finger individually and as dolomiten says, take your time. I see pulley and rope setups recommended quite often for things like this and one arm pullup training.  Do people really just have these things lying around at their house?It will improve over time, and it's important that you train it.  First knuckle work has a significant impact on the amount of wrist strain you feel doing handstand work.It is certainly something that will improve over time. But take it easy on your hands, don't push things too much. Progress will likely be slow. As for the necessity, that will depend largely on why you are conditioning your wrists. Do all three pairs. Keep the exercises paired together (e.g. pushups+rows) but feel free to change the sequence of the pairs according to your priority. The progressions that you want to advance in higher priority should be performed earlier (energy and fatigue management.)Only time I would eat vegetables would be for dinner, which I haven't eaten any in the past couple days.This sounds completely related to diet.  having a big loss of energy is a pretty common result of either protein diet or a major reduction in calories.  5 lbs of weight loss a week is just too fast.  That is nearly a lb a day.

Keep in mind, that when you "work out", you are breaking muscle which needs calories, protein and rest to repair.  If you lack in any one of those areas, working out makes you weaker.  You either need to find the right balance between burning fat and having enough of the others to make some progress, or just focus on shedding the weight fast and accept that you will have no progress until you can start eating normally again.I'm not there yet, but I'm making a lot of progress since I started doing [stability ball hamstring curls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAYtwM95-ug) more often.You're awesome man, thanks for sharing your knowledge and experience. I didnt actually know who you were, but damn did those videos amaze me. Thanks. thank you so much! I'm helping him with the counting (I have c counted before) and was surprised at how low his number was. He's integrating nuts and other things slowly, and I am taking him through my old high school workouts (jog warmup, stretches+calethetics, short run, and then basic BWF) Do you eat vegetables?Thank you! The links are great :)Don't know, I don't do them right now. My elbows are still on the mend, had tendinopathy from a mechanical bull from almost a year ago in the left and poor piano technique in the right... it's annoying.

I can do 10 regular pull ups right now, and 5-6 with 45 lbs but I don't do those because it's too easy to aggravate the elbows right now.

I am speaking from a world of experience my friend, if you check my youtube channel you'll see some older videos but a lot of my best stuff is from the past. Everything I have now is leftovers from about 10 years ago.

Old injuries have a way of rearing their ugly heads when you don't want them to, regardless of how careful you are. That is why I try and encourage people to take it slow with progress, you'll be happy you did down the line.

As we used to say, slow is smooth and smooth is fast. Your best gains come from not hitting bumps in the road, and that is what I try to help people accomplish.

That's why I'm not doing dips with 100+ lbs right now, even though I probably could. I'll give it 9 months and let it come back slowly but without injury.

I'm already back up to powerful 12 rep sets with my bodyweight on cable rows and barbell bent over rows, as they do not bother my elbow flexors.

At my best I could do 32 strict dead hang pull ups without coming off the bar, the first 27 of which were constant motion, and 5 sets of 12 reps with 120 extra pounds, and I was and am still 6'1" and 220-225. I could also do 92 dips in a row without stopping. Real dips, not head-bobbing bullshit. My weighted dips were ridiculous: 120 extra pounds for 50 reps. I don't know how or why, I just always did lots of dips and every so often added an extra 5 lbs. That's where I ended up.

I'll tell you this much, we all are on our own journeys and the older you get the more careful you have to be. Taking good care of your body and being patient will make that journey more fun, easier to stick with, and will allow you to go much further.

TO make sure I don't get ahead of myself I set strict limits on what I do in the gym, no matter how I feel. I always have permission to do less if it's an off day, but never to do more no matter how good I feel. That is what keeps me healthy these days, and would have let me get a lot stronger when I was younger, even though I was pretty ungodly strong as it was.

I could maybe just warm up with 5lbs since that is really light, and start counting from 10lbs. Maybe ill just stick with that on the first workout.

Thanks!Sure. If I were doing an upper/lower split like that, I would vary the intensity of the second lift and rotate them. So maybe 5x5 squat + 3x10 deadlift on one day, 3x5 deadlift + 3x10 squat the next.You could do L to V hanging leg raises.  They're pretty much harder than normal hanging leg raises anyway.http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_what_kind_of_results_can_i_expect_from_bodyweight_training.3FTrack your calories, you are on a huge deficitRule 2.&gt; you'd make more progress if you did it full body

That is a massive overgeneralisation.  Yes, beginners often do.  But most people eventually move onto some kind of split as they become intermediate/advanced.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_RatioSee the guys in the top bar for examples of what you can achieve w/ bodyweight training.

Caveat, you won't need a weight room, but I use stall bars and gymnastics rings and a high bar for my workouts. Squatting and deadlifting in the same workout can be pretty intense.  I would say it spends on the specifics of OP's pull ie where it hits them most (legs or back).

But yeah I would put deadlifts and squats at the start of these workouts.Definitely talk to your recruiter. Believe it or not, dinner right now does matter (really diet in general does). If you're trying to gain muscle mass, eat. If you're looking to lose fat, still eat but work more. In the marines I can tell you this: LOTS of water. Like, numerous 1L canteens a day. There's gonna be a fuckload of cardio and lots of heavy, repetitive exercises (think weighted burpees on meth). Did I mention cardio? Because cardio.scary. i took my third pics today. i'm on a cut, so obviously my gains'll be lesser, but my lats've spread some at least. frontside still nothing.LPS is really just eccentric training, and it works just as well as stretching and recent research suggests it may be better, since you are building strength in the ROM as well as the access to the ROM.

This in turn makes your body more comfortable with continuing to give you access to more range of motion over time, at least in my experience.

You may find that setting up pads under your legs to let you rest in a comfortable 9-10" elevation in the front split for longer periods of time (several minutes, perhaps up to 10-30) will make the difference.

You may also find that you make good progress by lowering yourself for reps with a self-spot into the front split while resisting using your leg muscles while standing on shirts or sliders or using some sort of other low-friction environment that makes you put forth effort to resist the sliding.

Gently get out of the stretch WITHOUT using your muscles to come up again, and repeat the eccentric. This is very different than what you are doing with a Jefferson curl, but may be what you need.

It is important to ease into this slowly, doing just a few reps. You CAN do too much of this and get injured, so I'd start off 2x per week for a while and just do 3-5 reps per side, perhaps holding at the bottom on the last rep as your isometric for each side. Only one set.

Every week you can probably add 1-2 reps, and eventually start adding a second set. I believe that a slow, steady approach to this is essential for safety, but this can generate rapid improvements when approached correctly.Why? He's a juiced up thug-life dude who can do some intermediate level skills with, in all likelyhood, no planned out progression scheme for achieving those skills.Cranky feet under the edge of a cArThis was awesome man, thanks for taking the time to write this.

Well, i laid low for a while until the pain was gone, i started training again yesterday. Maybe you are right, but i feel like my body is ready to train again. However, i might lay low from muscle ups for some time, i am not chicken-winging them, but i still felt some pain in my elbows last time i tried them.

But, i feel no pain while doing dips, pullups, chinups, bench press, curls, or whatever. I wouldnt have came back to training if i wasnt sure about my injury, but thanks for your words anyway.

Also, this program looks really nice. I will be surely trying it out and giving my response in an approrpiate thread in a month or so.

How many explosive BW pullups can you do right now? personal experience disclaimer. i started a routine, daily small workouts, for 3 weeks. then i had to take a break as my schedule was being shuffled around. after that week i was able to almost double my counts, when before i had to struggle just to finish what i set as a goal.

maybe take a week off. focus on other parts of the body.Sorry but a bridge has absolutely nothing to do with skin the cat exercise.  Bridge requires shoulder flexion and open hip flexors.  Skin the cat requires shoulder extension.  I don't see why a pike stretch is necessary either as it could be done in a tucked position just fine. He was simply going deeper than necessary and was advised not to do that anymore until he has the strength in the range to pull out of it. Telling someone not to do the skin the cat exercise until they have a full bridge or full pike doesn't make sense. Sorry.Sorry, let me clarify a bit more to help. I plan to join the Marines and workout with other people who are doing the same and my recruiter put my on a protein diet which I have been doing for 2 weeks now, I eat oatmeal and banana along with a protein shake for breakfast everyday and some white meat for lunch with another protein shake. My dinners don't normally matter what I eat according to him as long as it isn't any fast food or something real greasy. As for my weight I was 223 at the start of last week now i'm down to 218 as of this morning.The answer is both yes and no. It depends on how you define things.  Your observations are very common.


From a basic science approach, muscle has a tensile strength that is proportionate to how thick it is. This is a passive value and cannot be changed. Thicker bands require more force to lengthen, and muscle is no exception. There are passive components to muscle, and also spinal reflexes that generate resting tension. The thicker your muscles are, the higher both of these values become, making it harder to become flexible the stronger you get in the sense that it does take more work.


Additionally, stiffer tissues also transmit forces more effectively, but stiffer tissues are less flexible by definition. There is an optimum balance for each desired performance.

Does being strong prohibit you from being flexible? No, but it does mean it will be more difficult to become more flexible and also that it will take more practice to maintain your flexibility while you are strength training at a high level.

For pretty much all of our purposes, the answer is that as long as you are willing to put the extra time in to gain and maintain your flexibility, being big and strong will not prevent you from being flexible, but you must be aware that getting bigger and stronger DOES require you to do a bit more maintenance for your flexibility and mobility.See a doctor if you get or feel injured - not saying you are just a friendly reminder.

How are you eating? If you're not eating enough it might be you stressed a muscle and it didn't heal right. Conversely, if you gained a lot of weight from over-eating it might be hard for you to do things.

Just take it easy on yourself and keep an eye on your diet. Good luck.Go 5x8 weighted pull-ups, adding 5lbs (2.27kg?) until you don't manage to land a 5x8.

So one workout completion may look like 5x8 (5lbs). The next would be 5x8(10lbs). If you can't manage a total 5x8 on 10lbs (say you get 7/5/4/4), then you can try 5x5, then 5x6, then 5x7, then 5x8.

Then repeat the cycle.To elaborate, do not mix and match the workouts in a pair, keep the same pairs, but the order in which you perform them is subjective.Fucking amazing. He's actually pretty methodical, and suggests spending ~6 months on each progression. It's a smart approach.

I also second [Yuval Ayalon](http://yuvalonhands.com/) for AMA. "... I was injured and stuff, nevermind about that, I want to pick up the slack. ..."

Forgive me for being direct: Wake up man, you're acting a fool by allowing thoughts like that to actually stick in your mind. What you're really saying is "yea, I was hurt, but I want to push my body super hard anyways."

That's like saying "Yea, I know my engine is cracked, but lets go drag race a few times a week."

Disaster awaits.


My recommendation to everyone when coming off of injuries is to start off with a vilume approach, easing into the weights (constant weight for all sets), and after developing a 3-6 month base in volume weighted work start SLOWLY changing over to intensity, taking 3-4 months to make the switch, and then run an 8-10 week intensity cycle.

Why this approach, right?

Well, comparing this to what you are asking for, this program allows your body to finish healing. It also allows you to scale the weights slowly, which is important when you are trying to avoid reinjury. A lot of people don't realize that injuries aren't gone when they stop hurting... full healing takes 6 months at the minimum, and that's in a relatively small injury.

For something chronic, or where there may be extensive damage or connective tissue issues, it can take over a year. The majority of that healing time will have no symptoms, but the tissue will not have regained its initial quality and will be more susceptible to injury, which is why I suggest you take your time easing in.

I would never add more than 5 lbs per workout, I would stay in the 8-15 rep range, and I would not add weights per work set. I would DEFINITELY do a proper warm up, but I would do it like this:

BW pull ups 4 reps, add 5 lbs, 3 reps, add 5 lbs, 2 reps, add 5 lbs, 1 reps all the way to working weight. The only rest should be adding weight on.

This allows you to adapt to the heavier loads, heat up the working tissues, and also not waste a ton of energy.

It is also extremely time-efficient. You really shouldn't even be particularly tired.

I do this with weighted dips, too. First I do 4-5 bodyweight dips, then I usually start out with + 20 lbs (work sets are just +55 lbs for 12-15 reps), do 2-3 reps, add 5 lbs, do 1 rep, and so on until I am wearing 55 lbs. No injuries, and I am getting stronger every workout to the point where I have to remind myself to wait a month to add 5 lbs because I want to avoid costochondritis (inflaming the cartilage that holds the ribs to the sternum) in my chest.



Is true, but I find it tends to become more plyo push practice than leg curl work.  Taking my two month picture this sunday, cant wait to see the difference Personally I recommend a pulley and rope with a dumbbell or plate stack, and then attach a band to the rope.

That way you get accomodating resistance in the beginning but never more than, say, 40 lbs, which was my old set up when I used to do these at home. You can do this with a cable stack at the gym, and it is unbelievably helpful compared to self-spotting (which is second best) or just using a fixed band (which as others have said just gives too much help at the bottom).You could have slept on it wrong, you may have dome more with it the last time you climbed than you think (new route, more passes, new technique, who knows) you may have a small injury that your body is protecting you from making worse, lots of thing could have happened.

/u/derekc999 also makes a good point. Bony impingement is pretty unusual, but it is not unusual for muscles to tighten and put some mild extra pressure on the nerves. In those cases, a combination of SMR and gentle spinal mobilization and nerve glides are generally considered safe for you to do on your own, but you should check with your doctor or therapist to be safe.

Gentle spinal mobilizations would include cat cows, gentle side to side bends in the cat cow position, and gentle "back openers" done on a bench or a foam roller, or a "peanut" which is just two balls taped together tightly so that they don't come apart. You put the spinous process (pointy bit of the spine bones) between the two balls.

SMR is Self Myofascial Release, and you can learn a lot from Google searches.

Finally, nerve glides are a more advanced thing that often needs to be taught in a clinical setting first, THEN you can do them at home. The concept is mostly useful for nerves in the arms and legs, but presumably any nerve can 'glide.' What happens is that nerves are flexible but strong, and are generally a fixed length. They are designed to be able to move around within their given pathways, which is just where they go. Sometimes they can get temporarily 'stuck' in the tissue, and gliding them regularly helps to reduce the tension on them and restore function. Again, this is primarily used for brachial plexus nerves which control the shoulder and arm.


You may also simply need to get some soft tissue work done. As much as we all hate to admit it (or maybe that's just me!), sometimes we need someone else.
Thanks for posting this. I have been wanting to incorporate hamstring exercises into my routine.Horizontal Push: check (Push-ups, Dips)

Vertical Push: check (Handstand Pushups)

Horizontal/Vertical Pull: check (Pull-ups)

Quad Dominant: check (Squats)

Hip Dominant: check (Deadlifts)

Elbow Extension: check (Dips)

Elbow Flexion: probably check (Chin-ups)


Looks good to me. I have a few ideas to improve the routine, though:

*Less AMRAP, more 4-8 repping (for everything but toes-to-bar). Increase weight instead of chasing an intangible rep goal. Makes progress clearer.

*Squats/deadlifts first. Always do the most taxing compound exercises first.
I guess i didnt explain myself right, i thought 20kg to be the maximum weight. Id start with 5-7kgs and go up from there.One-armed chin-ups and weighted chin-ups!

Bodyweight training is all about abusing gravity to get stronger. You can do this by adding weight (weighted chin-ups), or you can remove a limb (one-armed chin ups).

I don't follow the Beginner Routine here, but it uses the same principles I use for a workout. It uses the 5-8 rep range, it uses Squats+Deadlifts if you have barbell access (but gives you options if you don't), and it focuses on dips/push-ups/pull-ups.

That stuff will make you large and efficient. Such is the nature of any big compound lift! Whether weights or bodyweight, stick to that 4-5 sets of 5-8 reps range with adequate intensity and you'll see strength+muscle growth.All of them, order is not important.I would suggest starting with 5kg for now then increase it overtime, starting with 20kg will have a higher chance for an injuryI'm just making a general point, the wiki is very good. But looking for credentials of authors is in general a prudent thing to do.I have been meaning to ask how in the world you came up with your username? (It's been a while since I checked the wiki, so if it's no longer accurate feel free to correct me.)

Most of the information there is very easy to independently verify, and some of it is sourced. It spends more time talking about injury and how to avoid it than any other fitness guide I've read. On top of that, a lot of it is pretty basic and low impact stuff: pushups, pullups, bodyweight squats, etc.because then the spine should be nice and limber and the shoulders be at least somewhat ready for a greater stretch into extension.

its really easy to just slap around your soft tissues on these hangs and not actually change the way the shoulder organizes.

Que this guy saying he is in pain while doing it, doesn't have enough strength to pull into the hang, something something not enough strength to something. Lacking proper bodily organization to skin the cat.Anabolics aren't magic drugs that make you look huge. You still have to put in the training and bodyweight training isn't enough resistance to put you in the "I can barely fit through doors" size that you're thinking of.

Lance Armstrong took anabolics and he isn't huge by any means. I see your point.

Since i havent done weighted pullups, ill try to max out tomorrow and see how much i can hit for atleast 3 reps. My guess is arround 20kgs. Ill try to set up a little bit of programming from there.

Thanks again.I mean that if you train back on mon, wed and friday and if you fail to get 5 reps each of this days then its time for a deload if you started doing weighted pull ups. If you are thinking about starting then just add 1.25kg every other workout session so on Monday you do +1.25kg and then on Friday +2.5kg then Wednesday +3.75kg etc.What? No he doesn't and there's no way he does steroids. He would be much larger. He jut happens to have an awesome physique. And let's be real, this guy obviously comes from a background where you gotta be 'hood' and a real nigga etc. etc. His advice does suck and that's because he just got out there and started doing it. He was probably raised in an environment where you basically had to be buff. And I doubt he ever bothered looking up anything fitness related until the whole calisthenics thing started to become a thing. And this dude looks and acts like he either drinks a lot of smokes copious amounts of weed. The big giveaways being that in some videos he's very friendly and eager to share/talk and others where you can tell he has a get the fuck away from me attitude. And I would bet those mood swings are due to him using alcohol and/or weed. I bet he struggles with it, staying sober for a few and then falling back into it. But if he did have an AMA it would only be cool if he would answer honest questions like that because lik everyone else says he gives pretty stupid advice. With all that being said he was my main inspiration to get into bwf and have a physique like that and I highly respect him though I would probably never want to talk to him in real lifeOhhh thank you! I guess I'm doing more of a GHR then. Can be done either way on a ball though.It's a good point you're making, but a lot of exercise comes with the potential for injury. It's good to know that the advice you are following won't lead to any short or long-term physical setbacks before you start making a habit of it.Thanks. I am not doing any routines, i lift weights but i also do bodyweight training. (i can do muscle ups for more reps, l-sit holds, still a newbie tho)

Also, what do you mean by "three workouts in a row"? Three different days in the gym? Im affraid that i couldnt really do that because i hit back like 3-4 times a week, 1 time in the gym, 3 times on the bars. That is a little bit too much intensity.

Thats why i was thinking that i should do more sets, 5 reps, but slower progression on the weights. What do you think?In a back extension machine your legs are normally straight while you pivot around your back to focus on the lower back extending.  In a GHR machine your back is normally straight while your legs curl to focus on the glutes and hamstringsI believe the best method for weighted pull ups and chin ups is 5x5, do it like that and when you start failing to get reps after 3 workouts in a row then deload by 10% e.g. I am doing 20kg right now and I fail on 4th rep 3 workouts in a row then I need to deload by 10% (18kg). If I dont fail to get those reps back then its fine just keep doing it. However if I fail again then its time to do 3x5 and if same story happen on that then 3x3. You should be adding 1.25kg every other workout session assuming you are doing beginner routine.Ok, thanks.  Totally not the same guy as [Hannibal King](http://justicebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/blade-trinity-2004-99-g.jpg)
Or Hannibal Lecter.I'd go with something fairly light as you can just anchor the band further away for more assistance.

&gt; You can see the band in the last one and I like that a lot more than using my hands for a push up assist. The band really lets me control the descent more, whereas I would just kind of up bombing down onto my hands.

And miss out on free plyo push up practice?!I wedge my toes underneath the end of a really heavy sleeper sofa, kneel, cross my arms at my sternum, engage the glutes and try to keep my body ~~arched~~ ~~hollow~~ while not bending at the hips on the way down. I'm weak, so I can only do 8-6 reps of 3s negatives and I fail at about the halfway point so I have to catch myself as I fall. Try as I might, I can't lift myself up yet, so I push and end up with about one second of time under tension on the way up.

After three sets of that, my hammie's are destroyed in the best way. And slowly, over the weeks, I'm starting to notice that my fail point is getting lower.

Edit: apparently I can't decide if my body is hollow or arched or neither. Whatevs.#####&amp;#009;

Okay. I'm gonna pass along the same advice and links that pushed me over the edge to stop thinking about getting in shape and actually do it... since you two seem to already be motivated, all the better.

Exercise is important in getting the results you want in changing your body, but all your exercise is wasted if your diet is not supporting it first. In essence, your diet sets up the resources your body has to work with, and your activities shape what your body does with those resources.

With that in mind [Plan It](http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/), [Weigh It](http://smile.amazon.com/Ozeri-Digital-Kitchen-Capacity-Stylish/dp/B003E7AZQA), and [Track It](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/).

In my own experience, I found I really had no idea how much I was eating when I started. Taking actual measurements of your nutrition is your best bet for getting a handle on your diet, especially if you have never measured before.cool but how do I train for it?Hannibal for king on youtubeAnd there's this from [StartBodyweight](http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/leg-raises-progression.html)Do you do stomach to wall drills or come into handstand from a pike off the wall?  That really helped me with body line.  Also think of your hips being over your shoulders/head and tucked forward and less about balancing your legs.  If I concentrate on where my hips are in relation to my shoulders/head I notice that my leg placement is a lot less likely to unbalance me. People can hold a handstand and move their legs in all crazy directions while holding it so it's not really about the legs. Have you tried a tuck handstand?  That helps me concentrate on aligning the lower body without having to worry about my legs sending me one way or the other and helps (me, personally, at least) find better body alignment in the hips.

ETA:  You really need to push into the ground and get into your shoulder blades, drawing them back and together. As soon as you went upside down you sank into your shoulders. Pushing away from the ground also helps you engage your core.I second that! You might find this useful: http://www.dragondoor.com/articles/developing-the-hanging-leg-lift/It's not bad, but a few points:

* AMRAP is not a good idea if you have strength goals. Set a specific rep range and shoot for QUALITY reps. 5-8 is pretty normal for bodyweight strength work. I personally use 5-10 because math.
* These two days back to back have a lot of overlap. If you want them back to back, you should do squats/deadlifts/toes-to-bar on A, and dips/pullups/hspu on B
* I would personally deadlift before weighted pullupsNope, it takes weeks/months!  But once you can do it, it's something that you will probably do for every workout as a warm up, so it will be super easy for sure!If you mean anabolic steroids then yeah. He has an obvious case of gyno. Not sure if he does recreational drugs though. Could someone clarify which Hannibal is being referred to?I do back extensions on a physio ball. Just shove it between your knees, brace your feet against a wall for balance, and go for it. Added benefit of adductor work because you're squeezing the ball so it doesn't fly out from under you.

Edit: idk if this helps, I still haven't figured out the difference between back extensions and GHRs.I thought I was in great shape and have been doing Frank Medrano's intermediate program... I'm almost done with Week 3 and it's still very challenging - I'm progressing (I'm also on a cut), but I still use resistance bands for some of the pullups variations. TL;DR Frank's workouts are awesome, but maybe start with his beginner routine would've been smarter. &gt;Any good pictures, videos or resources?

I've always called these things Russian Leg Curls.  You may find more info if you search for that term if you didn't get enough from the text above.

&gt;What is your experience with this exercise?

Whatever you want to call them, there is a big difference in difficulty between a GHR and RCL.  I can bang out weighted GHRs for reps but still can't do one RCL without any assistance.  RCLs really highlight the knee flexion mentioned in the OP.  You may even tap into the knee flexion role of the gastroc.  I've had way too many calf cramps doing these. :P  Due to the area these present DOMS in, I've always assumed they are a great exercise for maintaining knee health and stability, but I may be reading too much into that.

&gt;What progression got you there?

I don't think I'm 'there' yet, but I started out by lowering myself down into a push up and then pushing myself back up through that end of ROM.  Slowly but surely I could control myself lower and lower, and pull myself back up from lower as well.  I think I started out 2x8 and have worked up to 4x10ish.  I can get almost parallel going down but coming back up is still an issue.

&gt;Things to avoid?

I tried to do these in a regular back extension apparatus at the very beginning, not knowing what I was in for.  That was a near-death experience.

&gt;What's your home-made hamstring curl set up?

In the gym I've MacGuyvered two different set ups.  One in the [squat rack](http://i.imgur.com/Ku23K.jpg) and one in the[ Smith machine](http://i.imgur.com/VJpsT8X.jpg).  You can see the band in the last one and I like that a lot more than using my hands for a push up assist.  The band really lets me control the descent more, whereas I would just kind of up bombing down onto my hands.
Ah got it, ok thanks! Hopefully I'll be able to do full Skin the Cat soon. Seems like most people can do it right off the bat since I didn't see many resources for folks who couldn't do it.Sorry I mean "Go only as deep as you could go while still being able to pull yourself up*!"  So don't worry about going down as far as I do. Even if your butt is far up in the air, the range will improve with time.  And yes it's normal to feel the stretch, but again, increase the range only if you're capable of pulling yourself out of it, so you're strengthening at the same time.I think knees-to-elbows is a fun core exercise that's better than nothing. Now, with that said, I think there's more important exercises that will help you get prepared for the front lever than just hanging leg raises. Note the exercises he uses before ever getting into the tuck FL in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3EwjmqsPnw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=54s).Thanks for this site.  Looks like they have some really interesting contentI'm curious how people do GHR at home.  My gym had a GHR machine and it's one thing I miss about it.  Especially cause nobody ever seemed to use it so it felt like it belonged to me hahahaThat's a good idea, I'll give that a try if I can find a pullup bar that isn't too high. Right now I'm using rings in a park that hang from a pullup bar but I'm scared to do it on the pullup bar because it's so high. The rings hang off the pullup bar so it's lower.Thanks Antranik. What do you mean by "go only as deep as you could pull yourself down"? At a certain point (0:16 in your video), I just drop, I can't control it yet.


Also, is it normal when just starting to learn the Skin the Cat for me to feel like my shoulders are being reeeaaaally stretched in the bottom oposition?Well, 1500 kcals would be concerning to me. At both your ages that will barely (if even) cover your basal metabolic rate (The amount of energy your body will spend even if you just laid still in bed all day). Whether he wants to put on more weight or not, he really needs to focus on expanding his daily intake so his body has the nutrients it needs to function.



I would generally consider 2,000 - 2,500 to be fair, depending on activity levels. But if he's struggling at 1,500, consistency is the key here. Don't stuff your face of 2,500 kcals one day if you're going to be miserable and eat nothing for the next two days. Start with baby steps, like 1,750, or even 1,600 if you have to. Hold that for a week or two, and then add a couple hundred more kcals. The body will adapt, and he'll learn to eat more, but only if the stimulus is consistent.



Going back to his training - If we're truly starting at zero, I would be in base development mode. Throw him on a treadmill for 15 minutes or so to warm up. Unless he has someone there to spot/coach him, I would stay away from free weights for resistance training. Instead go with some machines that focus on big body movements like a chest press, horizontal row or lat pulldown, and a big lower body movement like a leg press. 2 - 3 sets, for likely 8 - 12 reps a set. Throw in some accessory work like arms or core if you really want, but not if it takes away from those three big movements. End with some stretching.



Work on that for about three weeks, see where we are on eating and adjust as needed going into the future.




edit: It occurred to me that this is BWF, and not r/Fit, so suggesting machines might be frowned upon. There are progressions to big movements like the squat, lunge, push up, and pull up that your boyfriend could do. But I'd still rather be able to view and critique form. Since I obviously can't in this case, I point towards machines which are built with the intent of being hard to fuck up. I'd see how you get on next pull session. Maybe don't do a pull the day after climbing just to allow for maximum recovery.

Certainly, I don't do a pull session the day before I go climbing as I want to properly enjoy my climbing session. :)it *might* be cool...

From what I've seen he's pretty much just a buff dude with mediocre training advice.

The best AMAs have come and gone: Sommer, Kit, and Yuri are the real experts.  In my opinion, a cool one to do next would be [Yuval Ayalon](http://yuvalonhands.com/).I love this one. Great carry-over to sprinting, easy to scale difficulty as high as you want it to go, and easy on the knees. I built up to them doing fast negatives and assisted concentric (just pushing myself up). I kept it difficult enough to stay less than 7 reps each session. Didn't take that long. You really have to pad the space under your knees though. I use a camping mat folded two or three times back on itself.that is literally all i ever use smith machines forhttp://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faqThere are better ways to go about this. First off you should probably do weighted pullups on squat day instead of deadlift day. Doing HSPU after dips can make you HSPUs shitty. Probably switch weighted dips and pullups. Toes to bar are kind of easy and hit a dead end pretty soon if you don't weigh them. Any reason you couldn't do all of this on the same day? You'd make more progress if you did it full body. Also going AMRAP on every set is generally a bad idea.
Pulling with the arms will progress you to FL yes. That's how you gotta do them. And the pulling part is what I'm speaking of. Use no pull and only core to lift your legs. You'll really feel it! But I will say for any lifting of the legs above the l-sit stance, like feet to bar, you're probably going to have to pull with your arms and use your lats some. Unless someone is an extremely flexible gymnast they're prob not going to be able to do a feet to bar without activating the lats. But both these ways are working your core and as long as you're pushing yourself you'll be fine with whichever way you chooseGood advice Antranik.  Sounds worthwhile.  I will add it to my "to-do" list :DDo you really require credentials and proof, or are you just looking for more reasons to procrastinate your fitness journey?Also...I am able to do leg raises so that the toes go to the bar.  However I use a detachable pullup bar that does not allow me a full hang as it is a doorway.  I have to bend the legs until they are out at 45 degrees and then straighten.

Would you think that knee raises with a full ROM up to the chest would be a good substitute and path towards the tuck front lever?* Definitely. It will develop the shoulder/scapular strength to push your shoulders down the back, which is very helpful for numerous exercises (including posture).

* I don't know what routine you are following, but it is part of [our routine in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine).

* Do not be discouraged if you find the L-sit very difficult. That's totally normal as it is not an easy move, but the benefits of it are really great. You could follow my L-sit progressions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUZJoSP66HI). Brah, what if your make a mistake? What if your grip slips and you aren't prepared, brah?

Don't be a dumbass when somebody's recovering from surgery. Thanks for the tips Antranik.  Tbh I haven't attempted the L-Sit yet.  Would you recommend I do if I am able to do the Hang?

Honestly, I couldn't tell exactly what feels weaker, just that the exercise feels much harder than it used to.I thought it might be a pinched nerve, but I still have full ROM with no pain.Right, my push workout and pull workout alternate on my non-climbing days. noes.....Why?Do not go down all the way! Go only as deep as you could go while still being able to pull yourself up*! This is both a stretch and strengthening exercise, so you have to take your time with increasing the range.* Just to clarify, when you're hanging off a bar in the L position, it's usually called an "L-Hang".  But if you're sitting on the floor and pressing your butt up, then it's called the L-sit (or sometimes, L-seat).  So, how is your floor L-sit coming along?  If you could do that, L-hangs are childs play!

* As far as suggestions go, dynamic hanging leg raises (working toward toes to bar, preferably) are a great core exercise as they improve grip strength at the same time as well.  Other than that, L-Pull Ups are the bees-knees!Just tried a Tuck Front Lever after a bit of research.  I can get into position (boy does it work the core) and hold for a short period.  Looks like this is the next step once I am 100% happy with 3x45sec on the L-hang.what is this bs, i've heard teens gain easily, but this is ludicrous. great job m8, what. that looks like the progress for over six months or something, hah.Just noticed your "flutter kicks" suggestion...wow that sounds evil (and I love flutter kicks!)
Gonna give that a try thanks!I think I already do them like that.
I have also noticed that I am starting to be able to pull a lot more with my arms on the bar and this is allowing me to raise the legs above horizontal.  I assume this is the route to progressing towards the front lever.I will see about the tucked front levers....but as for the L hang muscle ups??? Not in that sort of shape yet.... maybe when I build the bars outside this summerThank you i will take a look at those.L hang muscle ups! if you can hold an L hang for 45 seconds i would start trying tucked front levers :)
Leg raises is a good progression.Insanity is a conditioning/plyo program, not a strength program.I can't load the video on my phone but maybe you could start on a pull up bar with a grip close enough so that when you go backwards your arms will be touching your sides/lats and provide resistance. That was how I started practicing back levers and could apply the same principle to dropping into a skin the catGreat tip! That made all the difference when I figured it out. Feels great to finally do nearly effortless pushups with your body stiff as a board. There's a progression for this in Convict Conditioning (for reps not time) I'll see if I can find the graphic.

EDIT: I can't find it because it's part of the "Beyond..." section.If you're not already doing them like this than this will really help; completely dead hang. Drop your scapulae and completely disengage your upper back. Then really focus on only using your core to lift your legs up.. This way is super intense. Also do flutter kicks while hanging l-sit. And like others said front lever is a great goal to work towards. What do you mean by dynamic leg extensions/knee lifts?Take a look at the beginner routine. It has squats and deadlifts and is much more complete than this. You have no horizontal work. Pushing or pulling. Sweet! If you have issues then maybe doing neutral grip pull-ups, if you have a suitable bar, would be a good option. Sounds like ROM. You've probably been bicep dominating your pulls, do some scapular retraction work and Scap wall slides(strict, cheating makes it useless)Thanks! Yea that's the plan. Once the soreness after LPS lessens I'll try adding a set or two of isometric front splits and guage from there. Oh nice, thanks for the tip.  I had a hard time keeping good form, so I'll remember that next time. Oh okay, that makes sense. You're right, that will increase the difficulty.

A good cue that should help you keep your elbows tucked in is to orient your hands so that your index fingers are pointing straight forward. One of the mods here gave me that tip once and it's really helped. It's kind of impossible when you're doing diamond push-ups, but whenever I'm doing shoulder-width push-ups, that's how I set my hands on the floor.You shouldn't start GH/Skin the cat progressions until you're overall stronger. It puts a lot of strain on the elbow tendons.If you could specify which muscle you feel has been weakened that'd really help a chiro if you choose to see one.
Lats, posterior deltoid, rhomboids, and possibly biceps are all candidates. One could also argue your weakness is originating from your forearm flexors. But impingement of your brachial plexus or one of its distal branches would be my guess.How is your top position of the hanging leg lift? I felt that simply holding there helped me move onto the Russian leg lift later on Helps a lot thank you. I'll be sure to drop my reps a little.
My elbow were at 45 degrees for the normal pushups, the new exercise calls for my elbows to remain sure close to my sides.  So from 45 degrees to 10 or so. Nice progress!  Front lever should be a goal soon.It's not uncommon, you'll get those reps back. However, when you move on to a harder progression, you should expect to drop to a lower rep range. So you were at 3 x 8, moved on to a harder variation (I guess, more on that later), and then it looks like you tried to do 3 x 8 again but didn't make it. Instead, try dropping to 3 x 6 of your new progression for one workout, and build back up from there.

As for your actual progression I'm a little confused. Your elbows should stay near your sides when doing any kind of push-up. So it sounds like you're doing them correctly now, but I'm not sure what your previous progression looked like. In any case, going forward, make sure not to fall back into a poor movement pattern. Your elbows should never stray more than 45 degrees outward from your sides.

Hope that helps.Gave my elbows a test run this morning. Ended up doing my first half dead hang pull up. 12 hours later still no soreness or pain. Thanks for the advice. Will be a lot more cautious here on out.I had this once but didn't hang onto it for very long.

There's an amusing chapter on exercises you can do for the girth and strength of your erection.

Convict Conditioning is a much better bet or anything by Ross Enamait.  Having said that there's such a wealth of info on this sub that you don't really need to spend any money on books or courses.Twice a week should be fine.

However, I would start with more traditional running shoes and only progress to the Fivefingers once your form is solid. Fivefingers are great for people that have already dropped the heel strike and have a reasonably smooth gait. For people just learning these, they can be a little injury-prone as you have none of the extra cushion for a missed step.

Part of the appeal of Fivefingers is they expose weaknesses in your form rather drastically. As a relative noob, you're going to have plenty, and the Fivefingers will be too harsh a teacher to just start with.

I'd start with a normal running shoes, and run only one mile for your first workout. Then foam roll like a motherfucker the next day. Like any other good exercise, build your distance slowly. Once you've built up to a solid 3 or 4 miles with no loss of form (say, a month later), add the Fivefingers and see how they feel.

Remember, if you're doing this as a lower-leg bodyweight workout *form over everything*.i think the reason you generally see less talk about bodyweight fitness being viable for actual strength and hypertrophy is that most people aren't very educated on it, and keep thinking of it as something of a "do 100 push ups for basic training" or whatever people do. a lot of those inane rep range p90x kinda things around.

resistance is resistance, so it'll work your muscles all the same, as long as you challenge yourself hard enough.When this happened to me it was a pinched nerve. Chiro was the way to go.probably?  Do it and see if it puts you in a compromised position (tension in the knees or something).
Kit Laughlin has a [similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOiLJnuuKMM) stretch sequence too, so I think you are fine.I've had tendon injuries in my fingers from climbing where I just cannot generate any power. It's a very odd feeling. You look at the crimp you are on and you try to pull, but nothing. Usually there isn't pain associated immediately. But if I keep pushing it, or mess with it in the right way it will hurt.

So, in my experience, if there is significant weakness but not much pain, it is less muscle damage rather than tendon/ligament damage. Rest up... it will take you longer to heal than it would if you take a couple days off to recover.It's probably time to cut it offOvercoming Gravity is more comprehensive. It's deeper into gymnastics specifically. Free+ Style is more in the context of teaching cross fitters the bare minimum. I would recommend Building The Gymnastics Body tbh haha I didn't care for Overcoming Gravity very much. It's kind of anal, but with BTGB you can really jump right in. OG has a lot more context and inferences and some of it was kind of fishy to me but BTGB is just like "here's 7 strength holds and everything you can rep out on your body have fun"


An example of the fishiness in Overcoming Gravity. He says that what everyone has to learn to be well balanced is the handstand and manna, but that's not really related because a manna's fulcrum is the hips and the handstand is the shoulders on the Y axis. They have very little to do with one another. A more accurate judgement would be to say a Straddle L and Manna. Things like that, that he says like they're fact but are really just inference can be harmful.Toes to bar is a good idea also.  Not sure why i didn't consider itI haven't tried working towards front lever work yet but tbh that would be where i would like to go.
Weighted would be challenging for sure at the minute.  I will progress to 3x1min then work towards front lever.  Thanks for the advice!I've heard there's more than one way to do this.You could try to do them weighted. Toes to bar (v-sit) might also be good. Have you started and front lever work? For static stuff like this, I think going to 3x1 minute holds is probably the most you might consider. After that it's probably more endurance that you are training, which would probably be better gained by adding some weight.

I'm just a lowly beginner, but I thought I would throw out some ideas, since no one else has said anything yet.Just a quick follow up.  I DONT recommend ab wheel rollouts and dragon flags.  For the sake of transparency, I have no experience with either.

I dislike them because the ab wheel rollout has too much of a gap between kneeling and standing variations and dragon flags are almost never implemented correctly.

There are far more variations of core exercises that train multiple weaknesses at the same time.  Only do rollouts if you are literally only deficient in core strength, and all your other muscles are too overworked to let you do something else. Consider changing other exercises so you can do something better instead.

Dragon flags are a branch of front lever training that doesn't really address shoulder strength.  Presumably if you are doing heavy pulling otherwise and need more specific core strength for the front lever, you might have a use for them.  But it still won't be as effective as doing more targeted exercises that work shoulders, back and core as a single cohesive unit.The sheer magnitude of the look of surprise on that guy's face was probably completely worth it, though.First off I should say what *didn't* work for me.  Thst would be sit-ups and planks.

Okay sure, some time was spent perfecting one arm planks with a weight vest on, but that was more about stabilising the shoulder and elbow prep than core strength.  (BTW, that's terrible elbow prep). And sit-up variations are a road that leads nowhere.

For those of you that are new to this, advanced calisthenics involves a hell of a lot of core strength.  So I've built a lot of strength doing 'non-core' moves like one arm pushups, pullups and handstand work.  That being said, I've done a lot of core-specific work because it was a weakness of mine preventing me from doing other exercises.

So I've spent a lot of time doing hollow/arch holds, hanging leg lifts, seated leg lifts, hyper extensions and knees to elbows.  I knew from the beginning that a strong core was one of the most important things for bodyweight strength, so I always made sure I spent a decent proportion of my training time working it.

L sits didn't work for me in the beginning, but I'm enjoying them a lot now.  I have to, because a good L sit is specific prep for where I want to go next.  Similarly, skin the cats and headstand leg lifts make up a decent part of my training.

The trick to a strong core, I feel, is to work towards a press to handstand and a front lever.  Once you can do those, human flags are extremely vital for....  Well okay, erector spinae more than anything else but still.

Skin the cats are excellent.  L sits are excellent.  Headstand leg lifts are....  Not so good but until I have enough shoulder strength they'll have to do.

And see, by prioritising my core I already have that strength in reserve for when my shoulders are a little stronger.

It''s an intricate system of checks and balances.

TLDR: I got good at everything, and just picked the hardest stuff I could that was closest to things I couldn't do yet.Or try this! Works like a charm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbozu0DPcYIYou say that like it would be unique to him. I'd like you to meet some things called torque, levers and moment arms.

The absolute weight being moved isn't the sole determinant of how difficult an exercise is, the load a muscle experiences, or the hypertrophy response to that stimulus. For instance, if you're doing a tuck FL, adv tuck FL, straddle FL or full FL, you're holding the same amount of weight, but each requires a greater activation of the upper back musculature than the last; how can you explain that if the actual load is the only thing that changes difficulty?

If you're about to argue that's just skill (fuck you) then what about something simple like pull ups. Shoulder width grip vs wide grip; both are 100% of your bodyweight, but one is harder. Why? The magic of angles. L-sit pullup vs regular arch backed pullups; both are pulling along the angles with the upper body, the only thing that has changed is leverage, yet the L-sit pullup is harder. Why?No he rode an elephant through some mountains to kill the guyHe ate his liver with some green beans and malt liquor?I have a pair of fivefinger shoes that I could use for barefoot running.

Do reps of skin the cat in a pike position (straight legs) with the objective of touching the floor each time with your feet.

The progression is (drum roll) setting the rings higher.

Crushing the rings in your hand might help to get better tension/control. I feel it helps me with the "omg my elbows are going to snap" feeling.Bad idea. A census taker tried to test him once.  It went poorly.Could have been an awkward move when you were last climbing. Climbing, unlike gym work, isn't symmetrical in its training unless you only do campus work and no routes.

I did all the stretching in the world, but it wasnt until I actually started squatting, as in resting in the bottom position for longers periods, that I got more flexible.Rule 1.I have an internet presence too, but it's restricted to Reddit and various obscure gaming forums. :PRule 1."Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam."

You'd notice overtraining as it'd lead to changes in your appetite and sleep most likely. You may be overreaching slightly and just need to take a step back for a week. Try cutting your training volume or intensity in half and after that see how you do.The muscles in your arm are controlled by the nerves coming out of your neck. They  form a little bundle that travels between the muscles and bones of the shoulder girdle on the way to your arm. Impingement at either of these places could lead to decreased muscle strength.

Planks and plank variations were very important. Remember to not over do it, and take it one day at a time. Listen to your body, i went overboard on rehab and ended up giving myself tendonitis which only set me back further. You could always buy a 5 dollar bag of cement from the store (can get 80+ lbs) and just do logs of front squats with that.skip this activity until you have a full bridge and full pike stretch.

FTFY.  Insanity is some pretty good cardio, but it's hardly gonna let someone bench 3 plates or squat on one leg.

I swear to god, if you matter in the Punic Wars you are only allowed to be named Scipio, Hamilcar, Hannibal, or Cato. this is the progression that i have been doing:


[paoli's skin the cat progression](http://gymnasticswod.com/content/skin-cat-progression-pt1)Just do squats while holding something heavy. And do the same with pistol squats. And all your other leg exercises.
It should give you a good stretch but if you cannot do it, try to gradually build up to it instead of doing the movement quickly. If you cant get into that position, simply look for easier exercises. Also i would recommend these stretching routines called Agile 8 or Limber 11 on Youtube, i used to do powerlifting and these helped a lot with hip flexor, hamstring, and quad stretching. Good Luck! It's not necessarily too much BUT the problem is that if you don't make [good] progress you don't know if it's the loaded progressive or isometric that may be holding you back or you don't know if it's just too much.

It's better to start with one or the other and see how you respond, and then add more later if you're not progressing well. This applies not just for stretching but for training in general. Too little and then add is better than start off with a lot.[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal) guy?German hangs.  Just hang out in that bottom position.  You'll probably want to do it with your feet supported at first in order to stop your elbows and shoulders from exploding.

As far as progressions go, I found knees to elbows to build my ability to pull into a skin the cat and headstand leg lifts built my ability to pull out of it.I never felt a burn as good as doing slow calf raises on the stairs. I can do a lot regular but when you do a very slow eccentric decline on the step it makes you do less because you get such a good burn but it feels sooo damn good. Those couple of degrees really help and you can't get that while doing them just standing. So is strength ;)

For reasons unknown to me it seems he has stepped back from training and is not in top form...So you're looking for upper-body work primarily to complement the lower-body stuff your PT is prescribing?

You should be fine with most of the standards, but I'd be wary of pull-ups handstands, or anything where you're hanging and may have to drop down unexpectedly onto your leg. Most everything else should be pretty much safe.

There's some good starting points in the FAQ routine. Exactly. If you feel sick, that's a different story from just "not feeling up to it" or something. I switched to that when I get to Tucked L-sits because I found it was easier that way to lift my legs up (gave it a try after seeing it in couple of youtube videos), thought it would somehow help me to focus on leg lifted form. I'll be doing it with barehands from now on.

I'll also move L-sits to beginning then to increase attention on it. Thank you for the review.&gt; your readiness for training has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with how you feel"

Haha! Great post - So true! "Feelings" have got nothing to do with it!

Don't get sucked in, low-balled, scammed, framed and ripped off by your 'feelings'!

Not talking about 'injury' or pain warning or genuine fatigue or illness - just general 'feelings', nothing more than 'feelings'....
... I didn't think about that. Haha. I just assumed they lifted to be better at gymnastics.1

-REALLY push through your arms while elevation the shoulders (just like an offensive line man trying to OHP a barbell or push away a tackle.) The balls of the hands and finger tips should be the main pushing contact not where the wrist comes down, this will really fire off your triceps and other extensors helping with ...

-When coming up the tension is lacking in your neck/scap elevators and this is obvious as your torso doesn't hinge pretty on the shoulders (during your kick-up) like a person generating tension there, like you see in a press handstand

2

-when you're legs try to come off the fall we can see the butt fall. You need to keep the hips posteriorly tilted, and what I see as stopping you from doing this is pretty much the same paradigm from the shoulders. You need to have the legs pushing up into the sky and this will "pull" your spine into alignment... as long as point (1) is pulling in the opposite direction..

Basically you need to pretend your body is an icepick and try to stab god in the eye. You can work on relaxing in the handstand later

edit: don't get down and set yourself when kicking up, keep your arms in front of you and just DO IT. Stab that fucking eye in the ceiling. trust me mang you're not gonna find that extra tension thinkingJust running with proper technique is great for the calves. Your feet should hit the ground flat and only stay there very shortly (focus on quickly pushing the ground with your calves), and your center of gravity should be slightly in front of your hips. Work your way up to 5km and you'll definitely see the gains. Don't forget to _really_ stretch your calves to avoid the tightness on the following day.Best response here I think. Running is one of the most natural bodyweight exercise for legs there. Once you start running correctly, with this barefoot form, your calves will start taking a lot more of your landing force with each step. That being said, just like any other exercise, you must slowly ease into it because your calves are not used to this yet. As your calves start to catch up and you get used to running like this, you will be able to run further/longer/faster/ etc. with less effort. Once those start to happen, your legs will grow in size. I cant think of a better way to train legs with pure body weight other than using them what they were meant for, running.I disagree, this movement will do nothing to help you improve it by just practicing it overtime.

something like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdwEWchSjrI can get you started as many things other than the favorite suspects of pecs and lats can be involved in this, although they most probably are. Neck (this one is huge for wall extensions,) t-spine (naturally) and hips (along with eveyrthing that affects them) are all gonna bung up this movement as it only really begins to work the scaps properly once the spine is properly active.

Since you have already practiced this movement though, you can use it as a baseline to test your prehab. These wall extensions came together for me once my high bridge and handstand form began progressing nicely. Good luck.http://idoportal.blogspot.ca/2009/08/explosive-leg-workout.html  ....you're kidding, right?

Have you honestly never watched professional gymnastics?You betcha!For calves, try doing "barefoot" running. Basically, instead of heel striking when you run, land only on the ball of your foot. Make your calf absorb and then release the force from your foot strike. Bound a little bit as you go, lengthening your stride.

Run like this for one mile and I *promise* you DOMS like your first squat. You'll also see some serious bulking and gained definition this way.This is a really good one. I can confirm that they do work. You have my name! Give it back!Thanks.The problem with asking flexibility questions in a forum full of people who have just purchased a flexibility course is that none of them are going to give you very good answers. Having answered hundreds of emails from people using FF, I can tell you that you're much better off getting your questions answered by one of the coaches we pay to answer email questions.

The videos are short, yes. But there's also a guy in this thread who refunded Elements because the videos were too long... As much as I'd love to please everyone with the perfect video length, we have to strike a balance, and that's why the videos are accompanied by textual explanation.

As for where you feel the stretch, we can't show you that in a video, because it'll be different for a lot of people. That's why you do the assessment.

But, as you said, you are making progress.

And I'm very proud to hear that. If you need any help at all, please remember that, as we note in every single email we send out, we are always available for you.

* Editing just to add that I've had a long day, so if any of this comes off dickish, it's totally not my intention. I really do appreciate the feedback. God lord you've got some arms! That's all from body weight only?! I've never seen biceps that big from body weight only!One of the most tiring I had to do during soccer training but helped achieve the most gain in my legs was giving each other piggy back rides up this hill by the park we trained at.
Trust me, find some one roughly your weight, sprint up and down a decent sized hill while carrying them, with ~30 sec rest (or just take turns) and do that for about 10-15 min. You'll feel the burn, and more importantly the gains, in no time.

It's  a bodyweight exercise, just not your body Of course the intro videos explain things a lot - they are intro videos for a beginner-level program.

Sorry we bored you, man, but thanks for giving the first week a look.

I'm sure you'll find something that hits the spot, so good luck. OK, well I'll be careful then. If you feel the stretch in your hip flexor in the front split, then you're targeting it effectively. The ROM with full PPT is not huge, and even tiny changes make huge changes to your front splits and overall mobility.

Dynamic leg extensions/knee lifts in the splits can also improve hip extension. I believe so. I do couch stretch, lunge stretches, and kit's various stuff. All both weighted and unweighted, and while I feel incredibly loose after, I don't really notice any ROM gained unless I arch my lumbar. I get that you have to do it because there is a limit for leg extension(I think that's the term?) as far as I know.

I'm not only focussing on hamstrings, but doing Jefferson curls for help with l sits and other compressions. I also do the compression work from Overcoming Gravity so I don't just rely on passive.

Is that what you meant by focusing? Just actually focusing on stretching them or is there something within the split to focus on them besides ppt and leaning back?Glute ham raises are good.  I feel weighted headstand leg lifts hit my hankies and glutes pretty hard as well.

For calves, I've heard nothing beats skipping on one leg.  Calves a weird tho, they just don't grow for some people and I've heard a million secret techniques for making them grow.  You're gonna have to experiment.He's been dead for thousands of years.30 minutes to do 12 exercises means you get just over two minutes each with no warm up and no cool down. So you better do each of them as quickly as you can with as little rest in between as possible and just hope that you progress (even though you are unlikely to) and that you don't pull something because you didn't warm up or practice your form. GL

Why are you opposed to the beginner routine, which should be an hour long and has progression built in? Or go running or something more productive than cramming some arbitrary exercises together as quickly as possible.
https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routineI do loaded dynamic stretching and isometric stretching (plus a bunch of sporadic static stretching every day) 3x a week, alternating from day to day. It's working out great for me (caveat: for me). I'm getting real bendy.Thanks dude. I surely meant nothing malicious by it. I just think it was a poor example and like you said I never made comments on my own goals or ability. Physqiue is the last thing I'm worried about with my training. I think it was a little bit of misinterpretation - like I was saying it's hard to know what someone's tone of voice is on the internet since so much of communication is nonverbal. But I do definitely believe that flexibility with strength it very possible - this just seemed like a poor example.It would be coolProbably not, but it depends on you. I'd say try it, and see how you feel.

Side note: I don't know about you specifically, but most people need to focus on their hip flexors in front splits. Do you know how to do this?OP, google 'antranik' 'phrakture' 'steven low' (username is eshlow). Those are the 3 mods that I know that have an internet presence. Not that they are better or worse than the other mods, but they have information online that you can google.legs are somewhat difficult with pure bodyweight, because they are so strong and needed for balance.  People will recommend Pistols, but I don't like them.  Pistols are a great exercise, but require good mobility and there is a balance component to them.

My favorite leg exercises...

Sissy Squat.  Murders your quads.

Glute Ham Raise.  Murders your posterior chain.  Biggest problem is they are very hard to do, so you'll be spending a lot of time doing partial range of motion.

Weighted Cossack Squat.  Not pure bodyweight, but all you need is  to throw a bag of sand(or anything) over your shoulder.  Its essentially a pistol, without the balance or mobility challenge, and you get some work from the abductors as well.  My favorite leg exercise.

Calves are always tricky.  They are used to carrying around your body all day, and as such, respond to high volume.  Since they can pretty easily handle your weight even on one leg, the best thing to do is to either get some resistance, or apply more force.  that is to say, jump.  Jumping rope is superb for calves, especially when you concentrate on them, and it takes care of cardio as well.  &gt;I switched from barehands to my hexagonal dumbells as my L-sit platform when I hit to my first Tucked L-sit.

Why did you switch? Doing it on barehands makes your shoulders stronger.

&gt;I do my L-sits after my pullup/dip pair, so my first assumption is that maybe I'm working my arms too much before my L-sits, however I don't understand why, because I'm getting better at everything except my L-sits.

Move L-sits toward the beginning.  You're best at whatever you do first.I'm on fl/se1. Can do 360 pulls fine.bridges will be good for your lower back, and also for your hamstrings and glutes. Check out the sidebar routine. You can replace sine of your push up sets with varying exercises.It's been a routine that's 2 years in the making thanks to the mods and veterans of this sub putting their heads together. It's a routine that is actually useful for building strength rather than all the other bull shit neila-rey or other frivolous routines that just make you sweat in a circuit-style but don't actually make you stronger.I've tried Hindu Squats before, but they usually require very high reps to feel an effect on me, and I think they actually give me definition, rather than mass.How are your skin the cats?Personally, high rep (sets of 100) hindu squats with a very controlled tempo blow my legs up, particularly my VMO.

I don't have huge calves, but I dont have chicken legs either. I run 'barefoot' and do single leg calf raises on a step. again, super slow and controlled tempo to near failure.

These are some park friendly options.

turns out, i'm sick as fuck. good call. Just do barbell/dumbell/cable rows at the gym. If you really want to do bodyweight rows, you might be able to use a Smith machine.What is your goal? How did you pick those exercises?

If your goal is just to break a sweat why not just go for a run or do as many as you can as fast as you can in a row then go to the next exercise?Cool idea. I backed your Kickstarter. Good luck!I bought it and then asked for my money back. Overall I like what GMB is doing but it's like they took something really simple and made it feel really complicated. Most of the videos are about 75% too long and don't really say much. If you've never done any kind of movement before it might be useful but otherwise it's pretty boring IMO and hard to watch/navigate...I'm going to be that ass and point out that isn't a full split...his left knee should be touching the floor (i.e., not sideways). But nonetheless impressive!Its getting to the front lever negative part :/Yep, like I said, just a fancy name for something we pretty much all do. The longer you train, the more you start to do it automatically and the more important it becomes.I just write these as my workout.&gt; One of the biggest things to remember with autoregulation (the thing that gets left out most of the time) is that your readiness for training has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with how you feel.

While I think using your warm up and early sets (or even using power variations of the moves you're going to practice; jumping before squats, ball throws before pushing, etc) to gauge where you're at is the most powerful indicator you have, and often autoregulation programming is based on the performance in those.

But I'd be careful saying it had *nothing* to do with how you perform. People are very individual, and that's why I suggest you track as much as possible to find what really affects *you*.http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2v5smy/the_shoulder_dislocate_a_must_read_for_all/

I disagree slightly with their suggestions though.  Work up to just slightly wider than shoulder width, or basically where your arms hang naturally.  Do them with an over and under grip, and work up to 20kg.Yep, fluff piece next week sounds like a great idea.Well, if it helps... I approve this workout!

(but really, it's a community effort. When you get a bunch of great bodyweight athlete minds together, you get a pretty good program)
Work that first bit of the move for reps before you move on to the full front lever negatives.Just skip it dude. You need to heal!What's a weighted dislocate?  Sorry pretty new to working out besides bjj! You might want to do them on the same days.  Rest days are important, it gives you time to grow.

As long as you feel like you've recovered well enough and your joints don't hurt too bad, do whatever you want.  Extra conditioning should make BJJ feel like less of a workout over time.

Oh, and hit those weighted dislocates.  Seriously one of the best exercises for BJJ athletes.Lat amnesia.  People who don't/haven't used their back muscles forget how to activate them.  Chinups are only easier until you get good at pullups, then the numbers tend to even ou my because you learn how to pull with your back as opposed to your arms.It's generally fairly common, yeah.  Mostly because people who train flexibility as their focus (yoga, contortionists ect) don't focus much on bodybuilding, and most bodybuilders don't care much about flexibility.

It's definitely  *possible*  to be both, but I think it does exist on some sort of spectrum.  I wouldn't reasonable expect someone like Kali muscle to be able to do a shoulder width dislocate, for example.I'm on your side bro.  The question was specifically about flexibility, and you addressed the quality of the guys splits.  You didn't even mention that you could do better until specifically requested to prove you could.

Moreover, anyone who says you're 'jealous' of his accomplishments is making shit up, because you didn't and still haven't even mentioned that you're interested in that level of physique development.

Not trying to feed the fire, just saying, you did nothing wrong and I feel like people need to be reminded of that sometimes.Fuck deck of cards workouts.They appear to me to be based mostly on 'Overcoming Gravity'. The author cites his sources and works mostly with the science. It's about as close to an evidence based routine as you're going to get.Group effort.  It was written by the community, and updates every so often when we find something better.If you are at the gym, could you do dumbbell rows?I don't know the specifics of his height of weight, but 1500 strikes me as an extreme outlier for a proper bulking diet.   To put that in perspective, I'm 5'10" on a conservative cut eating 1900 kcal/day. Last bulk I did I was targeting 2300.


How stringent is he being with his tracking? Does he weigh everything out our is there a lot of eyeballing involved?&gt; but it's worth pointing out that increasing flexibility does tend to decrease strength

I'm not sure this is always the case. SOMETIMES it is, certainly. But I would argue that this usually happens because of a reliance on the stretch reflex in various positions.

Take the bottom of a squat for instance. Plenty of lifters bounce out of the hole against the stretch reflex. If this lifter were to become massively more flexible overnight, their squat would suffer. If this same lifter instead trained paused squats, which do not rely on the stretch reflex, they would not have the same results.
That does mean that flexibility and strength are not inversely related (since a reasonable portion of strength is in tissue),  but it's worth pointing out that increasing flexibility does tend to decrease strength. My understanding is that the reason for this is that a) you've inhibited the stretch reflex and b) you've spent a bunch of time stretching and doing mobility work that you could have spend on regular strength exercises.

Edit: for the viewers, not you.awesome thanks. what would you recommend for sets/reps with these? normally i do low reps/ high sets You really need to do rows and pull ups cause with only those excercises you will get big muscular imbalances.Source? That is, I strongly believe you are wrong but am open to being proved incorrect.Any Smith machines open? You could use one of those for rows.You could do columns
. Thank youHow about throwing two towels around bar?it's quite easy to do rows that wayThanks, em. My regular progression is to add one rep per set per day. A rowing machine or barbell rows would be fine. Once you have a base of strength consider throwing in some tuck FL practice and moving on to FL rows.30-40 minutes of core an abs doesnt seem loke a bit too much. I feel like 15-20 minutes is plenty.What about a beginner that pushes on too hard (vs couching)?

This week I managed to injure myself by being too stubborn when doing wall handstands, holding the position for too long so I couldn't get out of it safely and fell on my knee - which now hurts when pressure is put on it and sports a pretty blue-black bruise :(

Tomorrow is session 2 of the 3 sessions per week according to the beginner program - should I autoregulate to skip components that include putting pressure on the knees or just push on since it's just a short period of time? (E.g. Squats)DW auto regulation is something you just sorta start doing the longer you train for.  When the time comes, you'll know what's up.

But I'm also cool with next weeks thread being [how to take your shirt off](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PTUW77ie8sE)Girlfriend and I work out together all the time. I'm no beast but I have definitely gained while she has just lost and toned up a lot. All comes down to what you're putting in outside the gym. Personally, I love it.Thanks for the advice!Generally I try to hit at least 4, although I have extra rest days when my body tells me I need it.Thanks! This is a great response, and truly helpful. We have been running together for a week now, but he can barely eat more than 1500 calories a day (including tricks like adding nuts, oils, and frequent snacks) so I can see why running would not be beneficial for him. I know how to work out from years of cross country and track but he is starting at 0.
*changed a wordOk, I'll add compression work to my routine, turns out I've been missing them.

Also, thanks for the link. It was very informative and I'm going to implement that to isometrics right away.

Rest a week. If the pain is still there rest more or see a medical professional. Take it easy on the pull-ups. Find a low bar and do slow negatives. Then when they feel comfy and slow check out loads of videos on form and go for it. You need to get a feel for the movement and be strong throughout a pretty large range of motion. Negative MUs, dynamic high pull-ups (get your chest to the bar fast), weighted pull-ups, rows and deep horizontal bar dips will all help. I would suggest following the Beginner's Routine.I'm in a similar situation. I make a lot of soups. Mostly rice, frozen veggies, and I like egg dumplings so I also make those. Comes out to maybe $0.60 a bowl.

No more than a bag of veg, quarter of a small box of rice, and 2 cups of flour and two eggs. Add some beans and it will up the calorie count for you.

Good luck. ah gotcha - what's your schedule - do you do 2 or 4 workouts per week?I would guess that if you consider a mouth and a dick to be equal in terms of sensitivity, which they are probably relatively close, then it makes sense that the active action (sucking dick) overpowers the passive action (getting your dick sucked).

So yeah, probably is trueJust in case you missed it the comment by /u/zombieagain below may benefit from a response. Thanks Andy! The faq actually has something to say about how to incorporate barbell squats and deadlifts in the routine.
(They replace the bw squats, bb squats on the first and third day, DL on the second, warmup sets as needed, then 3x5)A good progression for "pull" days would be front levers. &gt; Additionally, during sleep or under general anesthesia, people gain full range.

Also when they get knocked out. I have seen a man land in near perfect front splits after getting knocked out during a football collision. I'm sure he did some damage, though, as lack of flexibility is usually a protective effect.Thanks!No that's good. That means your muscles are fatigued, which means you're doing fine. Sounds interesting, I'll look into that!I have neither so no.Chinups IMO are actually really good for pullup progression. It's a lot easier to load the bicep than the brachialis (I think that's the dominant elbow flexor in pullups, could be wrong) and since the lats get about the same amount of work, it's a great way to build up back strength. Doing chest-bar chins when I could only do basic chin-bar pullups helped me develop chest-bar pullups because I was able to load my back with more volume.Have you tried bars or those perfect pushup things? I never felt sore, got the perfect pushup,  and had to focus more on what I was doing because I learned my form was ever so slightly off. Then I started to feel it...the next day.As long as you're eating enough that all sounds fineThe kipping is for easier reps/endurence. once you get further in the program or you do the strength mode, it will switch to strict exercises, you should not kip with these. it will instruct you when to switch. not 100% sure they use strict pull ups, personally when it says to do pullups, i just do them strict, even though it instructs you to kip. I would do the same workout, but at different intensities. Make yours more circuit based, and add a cardiovascular element. Maintaining an elevated heart rate over a workout can create higher levels of energy expenditure.


While your boyfriend I'd make a more strength/hypertrophy focus to really exhaust all the glycogen storages primarily in his muscle, while he'll hopefully be eating like a horse at home to replenish them. Fewer reps, more rest, and possibly more advanced forms of the exercises to maintain a high intensity. Depends on his present ability.Far enough that I should be better than this, but I've been skipping a  lot of practice sessions lately due to various time constraints Woah this is dope

Thanks man Thanks. We like using it because it puts some kind of criteria on "mastery" that you can use without having to get a coach to look at your performance.

Glad it's worked for you!Yeah, that could be a bunch of different things, but something is tweaking a nerve, probably in your hip or lower back. If this is the first time you've had it, and there hasn't been an injury or anything, you'll probably be fine - just a kink that needs working out.

But if it's persistent or turns painful, you should talk to a physical therapist or someone who can give you more specific advice (usually, it'll just be some exercises to do). I disagree. [link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2372082). If you remove all other factors except the muscle fiber, pulling on it once is enough to stretch it to it's maximum length; then it will go back to it's previous length. Muscles are not taffy, you won't make structural changes by stretching (unless it's an injury).

Additionally, during sleep or under general anesthesia, people gain full range.
Are you doing compression work like described in L-Sit progressions cause if not you should start doing it and also check prilepin tables http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2012/05/prilepin-tables-for-bodyweight-strength-isometric-and-eccentric-exercises/Compound movements do have a limiting muscle group, but they usually fatigue many muscle groups at once, making them much more efficient than isolation exercises for strength. Also compound movements are typically much more taxing on the CNS, which has a huge impact on strength.

&gt;but does it specifically target any muscle? not really. is it worth the time you'd put into it in terms of muscle growth and physique enhancement? nope.

Defend that. The front lever heavily targets the lats, posterior delts, and core. In fact, lats are typically the limiting muscle group for people training the front lever, so yes, I would say it definitely does help you build a more impressive physique.

&gt;is it a good way to progress rows to make them work your back harder? no way

The front lever row is harder than the one arm row by several orders of magnitude, so also yes it does make "your back work harder" than one arm rows.Nice piece!

I actually found that the rpe/rpe combo worked quite well for guidance when doing P1. I think it may be especially useful when navigating uncharted territory (such as parallette training for me) since it forces you to really asses each workout in standardized and somewhat less subjective manner.
 I never intended to "call him out". I do think it's a very poor example of the commenter's point because that's not really a split and has form issues due to torso and leg rotation and lack of hamstring flexibility. I think it was a poor example and doesn't really prove that strength/size and good levels of flexibility are possible, even though I believe it is.

If you chose to read my comment in a tone that comes across as diminishing to his accomplishments that is out of my control.

And your example of "nice splits, poor pec development" is not a good example because you are taking a part of the discussion not involved and bringing it up for the sake of either being diminishing or suggesting improvement if my goals were physique based. That would be like me saying "that dude is muscular but his tan looks awful". Never said my splits were anywhere near perfect either.

Basically, it's hard to interpret tone of voice or intentions of what people mean while reading it on the internet, so it just seems like we were both on different pages.I'm not sure how to describe it.  I have not felt it in the last 24 hours but I'm worried it will come back again.  As I recall, it felt like some kind of nerve irritation, with shocking pulses sent down from my leg from glute to ankle when in certain positions, such as leaning forward towards my toes, bringing my left knee up to my chest (made putting on underwear painful), and doing cat-camel bends.

Right now I can do unweighted squats/lunges, but my concern is that I'll wake up tomorrow and it'll come back.No his form certainly isn't good, but it's better than 98% of this subreddit.

More to the point: it feels like you're doing the thing where you diminish someone because you are jealous of their accomplishments. There is zero reason to call him out. It was a picture used to demonstrate that strength and flexibility are not mutually exclusive.

I mean, I could look at your picture and say "Nice splits, but you have terrible pec development". But that's not nice or even useful to anyoneI can do one-arm push-ups fairly easily. I can't do more than 16 normal push-ups. Strength and endurance have very little in common.I can do ~12 pushups, tops(can't verify now, I exercised today), yet I can do 10 diamond pushups.

I built up to 3 sets of 10 normal pushups, instead of going to failure. Keeping good form also makes pushups easier, for example, remember to tighten your core and butt. Have you seen the Beginner's routine in the sidebar yet? it's under 'Bodyweight Training Info'. Really, the Beginner's routine is probably better than any routines you have tried in the past.

FORGET about feeling the burn, or being sore as an indicator. It sucks. "But shouldn't I feel..." NO. Just forget it. As a beginner, with good diet, progress each training session compared to the last one, is your best indicator.

I'm 5'10 and weight 194lbs, because I gained a lot of fat the past 6 months, stopped training and watching my diet. Make sure you're keeping good form through the pushup, if you break form at some point, that's a point at which your strength gains are going to diminish. Good form pushups should definitely provide enough improvement to move swiftly to diamond pushups.Logging to me has been essential.  Seeing your numbers improve, no matter how slowly, is a huge motivator.  Last time I did 30 second support hold and today I did 35?  Hell ya.Here are 2 pictures of splits I practice. http://imgur.com/a/5byd8

Also seriously, you guys think his form is good on splits? Rotating the back leg out like that is awful form and not a true split whether its "accepted" in some gymnastics/cheerleading or not. Soreness and burn are not an indication of progress. Progress is.

We can't really tell you why. Muscle soreness is actually very poorly understood.What kind of discomfort? Does it depend on the load?

Can you work unweighted squats or a lunge variation?Not wanting to toot my horn but "toot, toot". I used to use a plain deck of cards for a prison-style workout but it just got old. I loved the randomness of the cards though. So, I created a deck. www.workoutdecks.com/kickstarter

Hope that helps.
-DougOne of the biggest things to remember with autoregulation (the thing that gets left out most of the time) is that your readiness for training has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with how you feel.

We've all had days where we felt like shit, did a warm-up, and went on to one of our best training sessions.

Instead of relying on your feelings (which are prone to wussification), always autoregulate based on your performance: how well you can hold your handstand, how smoothly you rise out of the squat, etc.

Yes, it's still subjective, but it's not emotionally distorted.

Also, here's an article we wrote about autoregulation a while back that further explains the ratings of exertion (RPE) and technique (RPT): http://gmb.io/workout-autoregulation/Cool! Just send us an email if you have any questions. We're always available to help out. Do negatives and till you can do 8-10 start doing normal ones, that should be good enough.At the moment, I can only do 2 full ROM pullups with my knees bent. Should I just do a lot of sets of low rep pull ups?&gt; [The reviewers concluded that stretching increases flexibility (i.e. joint ROM) by altering the sensation of stretching such that stretch tolerance or the onset of pain occur at greater joint angles.](http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2013/11/18/stretching/)

Altering sensation is a nervous system response.On anything past 10 i'm usually pretty shaky on the way back up, not exactly exploding. If I'm going really slow on the way up should I not bother with it?Short answer you're probably doing them fine, but if muscle fatigue isn't the limiting factor maybe not. How quickly are you doing them? It should be a slow move down then an explode up, not a speed runIn my daily workout I do 5x4 (wipes me out) then some squats and stuff, then another 5x4, which is incredibly hard. Do you recommend something else?Are you doing sets of pushup or 15 total per day? Try 10x10.according to Kurz flexibility follows strength.At 135 and 140lbs they have a long way to go before one becomes fat as hell.Want it to hurt again? Take 2 weeks off.

I don't get sore anymore after working out (despite my lifts increasing). Took two weeks off got back to it and owww.

Just echoing what everyone else is saying pain &lt;&gt; gain. Keep going :)Yes I am progressing (6 weeks ago I couldn't do one, now I'm doing 40 a day) I'm just curious why I can feel the burn for other exercises and never this one. Thanks for the clarification, this is great to know!Then don't do l-sits or handstands. If it's just temporary follow the beginner routine without the skill work and replace l-sits with hanging leg raises.Being tired or sore is irrelevant. Are you progressing. That means more reps, or total volume, or intensity or less rest periods from set to set. That is all that matters. I'm just making a comparison, I know people that can do 30 no problem, and I'm saying I'm not there yet.

 I don't feel like I'm improving my muscles at all, just getting exhausted, like out of breath. No soreness or anything. Am I doing something wrong, or should I just keep pushing forward?[Here's how](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/caloric?s=t)Why do more than ten? The goal is to do them to failure, then rest and do a new set. Doing lots at once isn't really necessary. I went from 3x8 diamonds to Archer pushups as my OAPU progression.   It went pretty well but the first week was rough, an intermediate step might have been worthwhile.  .Is it true that it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked?I have tried doing a diamond pushup, but I can't even get close to the ground without collapsing. I'm 6ft tall 180lbs and have about 20 pounds of fat, not good shape at all. Max amount of pushups I can do nonstop without collapsing is 10, so I feel like I should have a little burn at least. Thanks for the response! Cool story broYou keep on putting out these fantastic pieces. I am really intrigued to know your background. You lift right? Guess you've been doing it for quite some time. I really love Concept Wednesday. I feel even as a stand alone it is enough to really stretch people's knowledge base. But then I wouldn't be pairing them with the pushups unless I do those at home as well. I'm trying to stay at the gym. There's more room and nothing distracting me. Also I don't want to associate home with working out until I've gotten into the habit. So I was more looking for alternatives to complete the whole routine at the gym. I just wanted to be sure that I can basically use any back exercise that wouldn't be too different than the inverted rows16 year old myself and I am having a lot of sucess about 2 months into the beginner routine. Believe me, it will **certainly** not be to easy.Agree 100%lol no, I can't do it with weight, and my form isn't exactly great.

But as said below, being sore just feels... rewarding. I don't know. Extreme soreness is not something I like, but waking up feeling kinda sore all over is great I think.Read the rulesSoreness is a very hit or miss indicator.  Depending on what shape you're in right now you could already be at the upper limit of strength gains for that type of pushup, in which case it's normal not to be stressing the muscle the same way.

Have you tried progressing to a different type of pushup, such as diamond?I liked being able to stuff my face in the DFAC two times a day (breakfast + dinner), with an entire MRE for lunch. I went from 130 to 160, it was great. http://exrx.net/Lists/ExList/BackWt.html#anchor1913634With the [beginner routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine). Maybe you can advance quickly, but just because you do other sports doesn't mean it's a good idea to skip steps.if you're doing a lot of high intensity cardio or anything like that, he should probably sit that out. otherwise yeah, you're good.Rows are the easiest pull to find a place for. Go home and do them on the edge of a desk or table. I do rows at work sometimes. Who knew.... I autoregulate already... Huh

Thanks for a very concise articleHow are you gauging flexibility in your arms? If you're meaning shoulder mobility, it's common to have sligjtly better mobility in the non-dominant arm due to the scapula being the less protracted of the two. The dominant side scap is almost always affected by tighter pectorals, simply because it gets used more.i'm doing half reps because i'm not strong enough, so when i go ATG, i just DROP down and BOUNCE back up, haha. not very controlled. + my left knee hurts a little.

want that barbell finally augh.It would be the same program, just different stages of progress. If they do happen to progress at the same rate than great! But if he can do diamond pushups while she does normal pushups, they can still do them together. this is great. thanks dudeDon't go too crazy with the calorie deficit, maybe at first but you'll need to nourish your body.  Also, men naturally build more muscle than women, you dont have to worry about getting too bigYes, now I realized I can use a rope and pullup bar to do assisted pistol squats. I did 3x3 (unassisted half pistols) on sunday and I'm still kinda sore today, I guess assisted will be a better progression.http://youtu.be/fbjE8KI-j3M

Edit: wow, while I don't think I deserve gold for this, thanks! generally you stop being very sore after you've gotten "used" to an exercise though. the first time i did squats, i could barely walk for the next five days. after a couple workouts, there was barely soreness, but i still got stronger.

i'd like to be sore tho, lol, it's "fun".Her doctor or PT will be the best source of info.Even weighted? You da manI wish I had muscle soreness after pistol squats, but alas... I only get the occasional soreness in my pecs.&gt; I thought that the L sit was a advanced move

The earlier progressions are not.Flexibility is mostly neurological.Post your splitsI would just add that if you're doing ridiculous amounts of cardio, it may be harder for him to gain weight because he will have to eat even more to compensate for the calorie burn. Oversplits requires a ton of extra time investment. These people have other priorities.I believe palm towards you/neutral is more bicep focused and easier for some (probably due to more bicep involvement). Either way is fine although I train palm out just in case I need to climb walls.I enjoyed it immensely. It is contradictory in places and batshit nuts in others, but it inspired me more than any other book on fitness I ever read. Unless your physiological systems are symbiotically linked I'm pretty sure this is possible.Shockingly poor programme imo... But then, Bronson isn't exactly a fitness expert.Pics or it never happened.Pretend the wall is glass. Don't break the glass with your heels. Cus mama would be upset if you did. Keep it soft.thanks for clearing that up!Well they only have so many bars and most of the time someone is using them but I will just use whatever is available at the time.  Thanks!

Btw I have one more question that maybe you can help with.  For the pullups I do them on the machine (without any weight assistance don't worry).  For the grip, they don't have just a straight bar to use. They have wide grips, neutral chin up grips, and a slightly angled grip that I'm assuming is supposed to be a more natural grip for your wrists. Which one should I start out on?  I did the wide grip yesterday but if it's more advanced than what I should be using then I want to change that before I screw something up.  And I am starting in the negatives progression Damn, these are getting heavy. I mean, I'm learning a huge amount (who would have thought lifting wasn't just...well, lifting?), but can we have something light next week? Maybe Concept Wednesday: Looking Totally Swole, Ripping Your Shirt Open And Making The Ladies Say 'Ooooh' On The Beach?KA-lore-ICKka-LOHR-ikThis sounds like an excellent question to ask maybe her doctor or a physical therapistSomething I've been wondering recently but is totally off topic...

That's the one thing about the whole thing that confounds me the most.She's had the fracture since high school. I'm not sure if there can be any more recovery at this point. Fork put-downs.

Affected me for roughly 2 months.Buy some rings to bring with you.  They're cheap and can be used anywhere.Anything is better than nothing. Use the machines. Do bent over rows with dumbbells. Do they have regular bars available? Do bent over barbell rows.

Just cause it is BWF, does not mean you have to constrain yourself to that box.Why? They can do BWF together. They just will be doing different parts of the progression. While he's doing diamond PU she might be doing regular or knee push-ups and they will both be getting what they need. First post.

**Stats:** Male, 30, 5"10", 114.8kg/253lbs

**Goal:** Be a healthy lean ~85kg/187lbs by Jan 1st, 2016.

**Routine:** I'm currently following startbodweight.com's beginner routine. Working out every other day. My current routine is:

- Bulgarian split squats 3x5
- Eccentric pull ups 3x5
- Decline pike diamond push ups 3x4
- Flat straight leg raises 3x16
- Diamond push ups 3x4
- One elevated leg, straight leg dips 3x8 (alternate day)
- Vertical pulls with a towel 3x16
- Plank 40s

**Diet:** I've been calorie counting, not strictly though. I use myfitnasspal to track my stats. I was eating 3000-3500 before this, now I'm aiming at half of that so around 1400-1800. I'm eating healthy, no soda, no sugar. So far I've dropped 8.8kg/19lbs since January 1, 2014.

**Injury:** I think I put too much stress on my elbows once I started the eccentric pull ups. My elbows burned with soreness after my last full routine workout. There's been no pain, but just feels like I ran 10km on my elbows. I've decided to take a break on the elbows and doing less intense exercises. Today is day 9 of the elbow soreness break. I plan to fully resume after day 10.

**Question:** With my elbow issue, do I just let it rest for a week or two and go back into normal routine and see how that goes? If the soreness comes back what do I do? Or should I put off pullups all-together till I shed a few more pounds?

so the other will be morbidly underweight and the other fat as hell? sweet. dat race.I have nothing to add to the thread but in middle school I used to be able to pull my leg up from behind and place my toes inside my rib cage and let go and it would stay there. I can also suck my own dick. Come at me Bros What an insightful and explanatory comment!

I believe that this has rendered the question answered, and all other comments irrelevant.

I feel like the FL is far more in my shoulders and core whereas the HS is in my arms and back (although maybe an indication that I'm doing it wrong). I simply can't hold the HS for too long. I think yesterday I hit a record but it wasn't much longer than 5 sec.Yes I eat a lot. I've measured my daily calorie output at between 5000-6000. I guess not entirely exact but I measured it for a week with a heart rate monitor. Also probably not sleeping enough...about 5-6 hrs/night.
I try to do the circuit mentioned without any breaks, followed by a one-minute break at the end. It's really tough. Honestly when I'm by myself I might catch myself breathing between reps but not for very long.Yes exactly. Well I guess to go from plank to planche is that case isn't so far off.everything is possible but would be really stupid, why make an average training for both instead of a more focused training for each?

if you want to share time together just go running/biking or something like thatTHANK YOU!!!!Thanks for your reply!Lift your hips as much as you can. I know it probably feels like an abysmal amount right now, but even if it's a little bit, it will improve with time.it's kinda hard to compare here anyway due to woman and man going into opposite directions, too, though.What do u mean by advanced move? It has progressions to help you get there so it won't be so far-fetched anymore.I don't disagree with your point at all, but that guy has pretty bad form on the splits. My legs won't straighten out without the aid of the floor (and standing of course), is this something that'll come?I read it for a laugh once, it has a lot of silly shit in it. Honestly I wouldn't recommend it as a workout plan.Never read it but maybe these previous threads will be of some help:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2f0x61/has_anyone_read_solitary_fitness/As most comments point out, yes. I noticed in Army Basic training that overweight guys slimmed down while us, who were skin and bones, gained weight. I went from 135 to 150 in three months. (Must be Army food!)Well you certainly could, yeah. Depends on your goals. If you're satisfied at 3x10 and feel confident that your form is clean, then go ahead and move on.

I personally did diamonds with my feet elevated before moving on to OAPU. You might not need that intermediary step, but I like to progress really slowly. Once I got clean diamonds with my feet up two stair steps (about 14 inches) I started doing inclined OAPU.Even when i do them on the floor i cant seem to get my elbows and wrist to touch the floor without my back lifting :/For the same problem, I even do them lying on my back with thighs at 90 degrees. With this I can do them with correct form and back in the right position. I have made a lot of progress and plan to move into a wall sit position and then uprightYeah, I don't really have the energy for that, just a thought that amused me.

Of course I don't plan on posting my videos elsewhere for them either.So if i can do 3x10 diamonds with the last rep on the last set being 1 rep from failure, would you suggest i begin my OAPU progressions?From my personal experience, people who take the most pictures tend to change the least. MWod's T-spine videos are good. The main thing is to not just roll back and forth, but to let the roller break you into extension and really get some of that work going.Thanks, enjoyed listening to this! Also Yuri did one of the best [AMAs in this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2jbpfh/yuri_marmerstein_acrobat_and_teacher_ama/) for those who haven't seen it.I'd say that logging the numbers of one's performance is even more important.&gt; T-spine foam rolling done properly helps

Any pointers as to what "done properly" means? Just avoid the lumbar and cervical areas? So many videos on youtube it's hard to know who to listen to. Very helpful, thanks.nope..enlighten me pls!!?
I have the same issue with my arms. No explanation though. I'm right-handed, so my right is definitely my stronger arm, but my left arm and shoulder is way more flexible. I can reach my left hand behind my back and slide it all the way up between my shoulder blades, but I struggle to get my right hand higher than my lumbar area.

When I'm in the shower I always wash my back with my left hand. I've wondered if that's how this happened, but then maybe it's the other way around. Is my left more flexible because I wash my back with it, or do I wash with my left because it's more flexible?

Obviously I've spent too much time thinking about this.!!!

It's so hard to spot progress when you see yourself in the mirror every day. The only way to spot it, is to have before pictures.

Also, log! When you don't see the progress visually, your logs will literally quantify your progress for you. Check out the exercise wiki to find suitable progressions for your strength level, here's a link:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/basic_exercises

So for example in the horizontal push category, I would guess diamond push-ups are too easy for you. So your primary choices for progression would be one-armed push-ups or pseudo-planche push-ups. If OAPU are also below your level, PPPU are the way to go, because they can be progressed quite a ways just by increasing your lean and/or elevating your feet.

Unless you can do full planche push-ups, you have plenty of room to progress.

Same idea for each movement category (horizontal push, horizontal pull, vertical push, vertical pull). Add in handstand, L-sit, and leg work and you have yourself a routine.Don't make it a competition, if one shapes up faster than the other don't fight itI just imagined you guys plating your food up and then you leaving half for him haha.

Don't do that. It would be weird.Remember the before picsRule 2. RemovedHe will need to up his food intake to a level that doesn't feel comfortable for a little while. Thank youDo you actually not see a problem with this?I'd like to point out I've never seen someone that big do over splits...It's intermediate, like stomach to wall headstand pushups or rope climbs.  Most people probably can't do it when they're starting out, but you don't automatically count as strong just because you can do it.I've never tried those, but it seems like you could apply the same logic as other exercises and do negatives?

Start in an inverted hang and lower your hips into the end of a toes to bar leg raise?

Maybe somebody else has some experience with that though.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M8NHO7tb1I

with weightsHi - great question - yes - lots of push ups of all angles/hand placements - and single leg squats and squats with my wife on my shoulders(!) - but not specifically for Front Lever training.

Although in my case, I guarantee that having 'current' push up strength/endurance helps A LOT with all pull ups/rope climb etc

I recommend trying other peoples workouts. aka hit a buddy up and try out his routine, see what you like and adapt PB is about 100 cals per tbsp - so your talking approximately 1400 calories in PB alone. Considering your dimensions though - I don't know if that is altogether a bad thing.Leg assisted weighted pullups?Don't you do any pushing exercises?kind of.. As of now i can neither do hspu nor 3x8 pullups. In the hspu progressions i am in the leg elevated pike push ups.i can do 3x5 pullups .So was planning to do Weighted pullups with leg assisted.[No, people can get crazy muscular and remain extremely flexible if they do stretching and mobility work alongside their other training](http://i.imgur.com/lqnPIoP.jpg)a full L-sit is more advanced. i wouldn't call it an advanced move, but its not really a beginner move. the early progressions of it are not advanced though.Any idea why the beginner routines includes L-sit progressions? I thought that the L sit was a advanced move Plank press to handstand? Like this http://youtu.be/YDC_6h1Ur7k?t=11s but starting from the plank, not planche?Exactly, it's all about the diet here. Calorie surplus/deficit, plus adequate protein intake (for both of you).Yes and no.  When it comes to bodyweight exercises a lot of it is progression based and unless you have similar strength exercises it is unlikely that you will both make progress off the exact same workouts.  You will need to alter the progressions you are both on in order to stay at a similar level of intensity.

Fun fact: as you get lighter things will get easier and as he gets heavier things will get harder.  YMMV whether this closes or widens the gap between strength levels.Gymnasticbodies foundation program.

Can you do 5x5 sets of wide grip pullups in an l sit? Or climb a rope w/out feet? Or perform a hollow back press?There is a point at which adding additional muscle mass will cause you to become less flexible. But you can get very strong without putting on a lot of muscle mass, i.e. like gymnasts would. YesHi bob!

The 'best' push ups are the ones you actually will do a lot of, all the time.

Experiment and find your 'favourite' push up style (hand placement) and go to town on those. They will make you strong and give you endurance and stamina and ability and power for your wonderful future push up journey.

Once you are a beast at those - or when you feel you are ready - try as many push up variations as possible. My theory is that by changing your push up 'hand position' you will hit and cross-weave many more muscle fibres, tendons and ligaments in different ways.

There are many push up styles - wide hand position, close (diamond), asymmetrical (one hand high, one low) planche-style - (both hands low as possible), hands high, feet elevated etc etc

See what work best for you - you will find it and your push ups will prosper!

Cheers bro!When I finally get around to getting some rings I think your programs will be the direction I fly. I am very much used to doing 5 x 5 strength based stuff and I am getting stronger but I am not really a mover and shaker. GMB is exactly what I need to round me off. I will make that plunge eventually! GymnastsI suck for missing this, but daaaaaamn, you came through with the post! Your transformation is pretty incredible and I'm glad to see the PVC bars are doing you well! YepNo worries. I forget sometimes unless I double check. Okay, thanks for that. So does the order in which I have my exercises seem logical, then? assuming I replace crunches with planks or something?Well for that, I'd avoid putting push pull together if you can, otherwise it doesn't matter too much.Awesome job! Did you up your calories a lot? Neigher, really. I just want a relatively light workout I can do when I get off work or something - just a casual set of exercises I can do. I have read a few articles that suggest it's better to alternate between upper and lower body, to give those muscles an 'active rest' while you work on an entirely different set of muscles, but I'm not sure why I should put a push and pull upper body exercise back to back, unless it's because legs are far more important, so the idea is to maximize the amount of abuse I can put my legs through by putting them two exercises apart? I'm just looking for efficiency here, and I believe that however miniscule, there must be a 'best' way.Depends on your goals. If you're trying to get stronger or more muscular, it isn't and neither is the circuit you're describing.ohhh i see. i didnt really understand the progressions part. i thought you had to do the progressions all at once. The beginner routine is a *template*, you choose *progressions* from the exercises mentioned that are appropriate to your level.In that sense, is harder a good thing? Or does it make more sense to alternate between upper body and lower body? One person I've talked to said I should do legs, pull, push, legs, abs/core, and his reasoning seemed to be that I want to put as much space between legs as possible - and also that pushups and pullups compliment each other in a way (I forget why) - and then to end it with a full-body core exercise. I may look into switching out crunches for planks or something, but does the rest of that make sense?Can u stand against the wall for 60 seconds? Based on what I see I don't think you can yet...
Try practicing to get 3x 60 seconds... Once u r here.. Ull be able to do a HS :) good luck!yeah, both of you should be doing the appropriate exercise in the progressions for your strength levels and eating carefully
https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routineIt most certainly is possible to achieve your goals while working out together. Your diets will be the great determinant of how you accomplish them though. So as long as you maintain your caloric deficit and he maintains a caloric surplus, with progressive overload in your routines, you both should see results. Be consistent and good luck to you two! Keep us posted on the Sunday Show Off threads with your progress!I like the imagery of the top of the palm being the center of a teeter totter, and you rock back and forth over that ridge.Avocado my friend. Just jam on those bad boys constantly. Agreed that it's not bad. Your legs and hips are floppy though. Lock all that shit out - I like to think about reaching for the ceiling with my toes.Joe, what is your favorite obstacle? Which do you dread the most?Agreed. Much better insight than in r/fitness, where the only advice they give is "FAQ" Are you really planning to do all your sets of bench, then a bunch of weighted pullups, then do handstand push-ups?  Why not group pushing and pulling together instead?Good listen. Thanks!Also, you'll probably find that putting similar actions back to back will be harder (two pulling exercises for instance, or even two upper body exercises).

In the long run, you'll likely find that avoiding a circuit will be better for your goals (along with avoiding crunches!)What mean mod meant to say it, the order of your exercises will be determined by your goals. Which do you want to improve the fastest? Put that first. If you don't have a preference, spend a few weeks with one in the front, then rotate it out. Happy training!I know this is quite a bit late, but could you elaborate on elbow management? Where can I go for more information?
I'm antsy to get better at climbing so I'm working pull ups every day. Is it not similar to doing, say, squats every day?;)&gt; Work on w/e you want to make the most progress in, first." Surely there are more things to consider when deciding the order of one's workout?

Nah, that's about it!clickbait!You're absolutely right; I'm sorry. Yes! That's it, that's the word I saw I just couldnt remember.Yeah this is absolutely not BS no wayEat more protein! No offence mate, but guys like Lee, Solo etc have a fair amount of muscle.
Get stronger by increasing load and eating more protein with good recovery. And don't skip leg day! Squat! lolwhat's unfortunate is that you can easily get your license without it.I think one important thing to remember with ideas like this is that the science of fascia really doesn't matter to the average person training to get stronger. We don't fully know how it works yet, so it can get confusing.

Can fascia be one factor to optimize for the best results? Maybe.

Is it more important than doing hard/smart training? Probably not, unless you have inefficiencies or injuries that are preventing you from progressing by doing work.

Most people can probably safely ignore fascia, but trainers should be cautious about dismissing it, since we still don't know very much about how it functions. So, how do I "actually simulate internal motor acitivities"? I admit I didn't get most of the first paragraph. With the planche for example I pretty much know what muscles to use, they are just not strong enough yet (let's say advanced tuck planche). What about flexibility stuff (less complex positions, pike for example). If you could design a new study, what would you let people do to see if it works?5'3"-5'4" male. Guarantee my wife is hotter than yours.Yeah, I was going to point out how simplistic his logic about stretching is... essentially: "I can't see any reason why it would work, therefore it's bullshit nobody should ever do it."Yup, it's all about dat feel. Some people got it with minimal training. And some people will never get it, unfortunately.Just for clarification on I was referring to the section of the handstand push up progression. I think what Antranik is saying, that the painscience site takes the popular name of something and then comes up with all these reason why that so and so thing is not believable. Its annoying because it is beyond obvious and provable that physical manipulations of muscle tissues do something that lead to faster recovery from soreness type injury. This entire article just craps on the name "myofascial release" but doesn't give any hints as to whats really going on.Thank you!Honestly the article that annoyed me the most was the [stretching](https://www.painscience.com/articles/stretching.php) one.

The HEADLINE of the thing is "Stretching science shows that a stretching habit isnt doing much of what people hope"

Which right off the bat is hilarious to me, cause physical therapy often involves a combination of flexibility and strength training.

But what's really annoying is that he just keeps going on and on in this tone of voice about how "science" says stretching isn't good for anything, really, like, it's cause he keeps asking the "wrong" questions...

For example: He says people stretch to warm up, prevent injury, prevent muscle soreness and increase flexibility.

Then he says how static stretching isn't a good warm up and doens't consider dynamic joint mobility drills to be stretching. Okay? Fine, moving on.

Then he says how static stretching isn't an effective warm up. Okay, thats fine, but... Again, why not include other kinds of dynamic stretching again?

Stretching doesn't prevent DOMS... okay, fine, it doesn't. I dont do it to prevent DOMS either...

"Stretching research shows that stretching does not prevent injury" which again, only tackles on static stretching and doesn't really tackle the idea of one having both strength and flexibility in a fuller range.

"Yes, stretching will make you more flexible  but so what?" What do you mean so what... WHAT THE FUCK.

Honestly that's only partway into the article and it only gets worse from there in my book that it's fucking annoying as fuck.  It actually pisses me off cause I've read this article twice before and I can't believe he ends it with

&gt; There is no known benefit to greater flexibility, except for:
&gt;
&gt;     bragging rights
&gt;     dominating Twister tournaments
&gt;     making full use of Indian love manuals
&gt;
&gt; In short, stretching appears to be good for  more stretching. Oh, and of course:
&gt;
&gt;     yes, stretching does feel pleasant
&gt;

gee, thanks for confusing fuckloads of people.For me, it just feels amazing. A couple of points (I have published peer-reviewed research on motor imagery):

Kinesthetic/motor imagery is not visualization.  Visual imagery often accompanies motor imagery, and it might help facilitate it, but they do not have to go together.  Imagery in general refers a pseudo-perceptual experience that occurs in absence of actual external stimuli--so you engage in a kind of mental simulation that is functionally similar to the actual perceptual experience.  Vision and kinesthesis are separate modalities (with the caveat that it is questionable weather the perceptual modalities are totally separate), so the simulations would be different.

Some things follow from this for the idea of using motor imagery to practice a skill.  First, merely engaging visual imagery of yourself in something like a planche position won't cut it; you would need to actually simulate the internal motor activities (in your muscular system, CNS, etc) involved in the planche.  This also suggests that you couldn't fully engage motor imagery for an action you have never performed, and you will be better able to simulate an action after you have already acquired the skill (so you can't motor-imagine your way into a planche from nothing).  Also, the more complex the action, the more difficult it will be to simulate (engaging planche imagery will be way harder than engaging wrist-flexion imagery).

EDIT:  For those interested in doing further investigation into motor imagery, a go-to source would be ch. 2 of the book *Motor Cognition* by Marc Jeannerod.Also I should say: the placebo effect is astounding and should never be discounted. It's literally mind over matter.

Bothers me when people say 'Meh that's just the placebo effect, you're a sucker.'

Not implying that's what you meant, but clarifying my other comment about feeling gullible. What sucks is when reading studies kills your placebo effect. That's always a bummer.Adhesions are a medical thing. Surgeons have to deal with them.
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)

ART and SMR share some practices, which results in more confusion. The medical response to a true adhesion is surgery, but the pseudo-scientific community has certainly started to create a new business model around the concept...This might be as good a time/place as any to mention this: I use the routine on your website, and I've noticed that some of the examples* on your pushing progressions could use some updating to reflect the 'elbows in' suggestion. Dan Jeong has a good video tutorial for handstand push ups https://youtu.be/4WvU9IgORh0I think it's important to remember that there is a limit to evidenced based science.  Lack of evidence (inconclusive or not enough study) is not the same as saying something is useless.  It's too easy to equate the 2. I can tell you my experience, but of course YMMV. I got into TRX about a year ago. Took many classes a week at YMCA, and had a lot of fun. I then bought my own TRX and followed their 12 weeks program. At the end it got really boring, and that's when I stumbled into this reddit and bodyweight training. I started doing plank progressions and body holds and I discovered really quickly that my core was extremely weak... so much for 6 months of TRX "working the core all the time". I guess it does work the core constantly but not intensely. In my opinion it really depends where you're at. If you're present form of training is something like zumba, then TRX is a step up in core work. But in my experience a well designed bodyweight routine is all another level. I wish I knew that before I spent all that money and time on TRX... well, it was fun for a while and I still use it for some exercises until I have the time and patience to install rings in my garage. The great thing about TRX is that you can hook it up very very easily in many places...Unrelated:

I saw that you were wearing Vibram shoes in the video. Which model would you say is the best for good anatomical posture, comfort, etc.?
massage therapist here with some non-scientific input:

therapists actually able to manipulate fascia have good and sensible hands. which makes them good therapists. which yields good therapeutic results in the end.

if you've had many different massage therapists you know that there is a huge gap in skill.
SMR stands for self myofascial release.

Look up the Golgi tendon organ, and you will get a better idea of why SMR is effective.This is my first experience with this painscience guy. Wasn't aware of his work. Are there problems with his methodology or sources?

I would also like to point out that there's a big difference between

&gt; science doesn't know jack shit enough yet

and

&gt; multiple studies have shown that 'myofascial release' is clinically trivial at bestThat's semantics, but I don't disagree. Once people have developed their basic unsupported movement that is a great video to move on to for learning a much cleaner form.

It is better to approach it the way I have, I think, because it is very hard to misunderstand anything. Ideally you're completely piked the whole time, but most people don't have that flexibility.

I do agree that Michael really shows the cleanest form. I don't have the space, or the flexibility, to do that much compression hahaha! Like many other things in gymnastics, the more flexible you are the shorter your learning curve will be :)This is why I always get annoyed when I read articles from painscience site. It's always like "Well, I've compiled all the science... and turns out, science doesn't know jack shit enough yet."Yes exactly. I've been rolling away like a motherfucker, on PVC and lacrosse balls and whatnot, telling myself 'all this pain will be worth it when I get that fascia released. Kit and Starrett and everybody told me so.'

Now I'm feeling pretty gullible. And wondering what the benefits really are.Wow, thank you!I would say no, you need to maintain pressure through the chest, serratus, and shoulders. You are simply allowing your body to sink down, that's all.

I found that all I needed was five sets of 30s German hangs. Obviously I built up to that slowly, and I did them 3x per week. It took about 6 months to really get deep, and it just happened one day.

No particular effort on my part, my body was just like "Hey, why don't you just really go down far now? I'll allow it."

That was after months of consistently being "stuck" at the same place and not trying to push past it, just going with what felt right.Greatest advantage: Can be a luchador. Buy a mask. Workout only in the mask.

If anyone looks at you sideways, go full Lucha Libre.

http://i.imgur.com/HK0qWOq.gifUnless otherwise specified, you generally want to be able to breathe  fairly freely :)Thanks, just trying to help out :)Ah shite, alright, thanks boss. It's a general positional thing, but yes body segment differences will affect the lean. We could say 30-45 degrees as a more general range, or wrists under the belly button with fingers pointing out to the sides.

I want to impress upon people that you really want to make sure you have good elbow conditioning before you start doing anything that involves moving through back lever positions unassisted, even if they are quite tucked up.I really appreciate that your approach to knowledge is so scientific. So often it's hard to know what is true and what isn't, and a lot of people have a hard time acknowledging what works or doesn't work and what we know or don't know.

Now the question is, if the whole "mayofacial release" thing isn't what's happening, then what is happening when people foam roll? I personally have never gotten much out of it, but many people seem to. Placebo? What /u/mtruelove said about temporary ROM improvement that becomes permanent as you work it? Something else?

yes, you should send me a private message. No one can see that.the fencing response is always so uncomfortable to watch.Rule 2. Also rule 1 in regards to diet.She just gave me her wtf face and lectured me about reading too much pseudoscience.

I guess I could sum up her thoughts like this:

&gt; Why are you trying to release your fascia? Your fascia is fine. Please get off Reddit and focus on getting more work, you're fucking broke.

And then I was like:

&gt; Oh I'll show you little miss doctor. Wait...I guess not.In my case, I work out during lunch rather than going out to eat.  This ends up helping me control my intake.  I also find that certain exercises affect my appetite, such as inducing protein cravings or curbing hunger.  For example, I don't feel like eating anything for some time after running.  Conversely,  whenever I have a layoff for some reason, I find myself eating more.

However, your mileage may vary.He calls it an adhesion, not sure if that's a significant distinction.

I've wondered if the mobility gained from SMR are temporary but by then working in the new ROM it becomes permanent. Might be that it's all placebo.    I know right? It's hard to imagine. Whatever though, I'll try anything. I spend enough time day dreaming at work, why not day dream about gains?Time to imagine myself doing a pike every moment of every day.No no not at all.

The question is, if 'myofascial release' cannot be shown to be clinically significant, why is foam rolling so helpful to so many people?And we are MEAN because we're closer to hell! Yeah!I've watched that video a few times. I thought it was amazing and still do, because I like and trust Kit Laughlin.

*However* it appears that 'myofascial release' may not be a real thing.

So, the question is, why does that thing that Kit does work so well? What is actually happening there?

Should we maybe stop calling it 'myofascial release'?

Did you read the article I linked?I'm curious to hear what your GF thought.  From my recollection, I was taught fascia was connective tissue that sheaths muscles.  Nothing fancy, just something you dissect.   Would this mean there is no point to foam rolling?not sure what the downvotes are for; he was completely unclear and his sentence had 0 context.I've been able to perform this fascia release by [Kit](https://youtu.be/zLewsx9rL_8?t=1m) on myself which had an immediate effect. I've also done some trigger point stuff and some foam rolling (incorrectly called SMR?)

I'm unsure about the science behind fascia but I've done a lot of stuff that Kit recommends (stick stuff for calf and shoulders) and it *seems* to help.Does any1 here have experience doing this exercise having a shoulder dislocation in the past??When I was 5'6" 145 I used to bench meatheads in the gym.My girlfriend said she'd date him.As I said in the Concept Wednesday thread, I recently became a bit skeptical about all this talk of 'myofascial release.'

I had been taking it for granted as a useful and important aspect of mobility and flexibility, but then I kind of embarrassed myself when I tried to tell my girlfriend about it -- she's a surgeon, and while orthopedics is not her field, she still obviously knows a hell of a lot more about the human body than I do.

So I went off to Google to show her how smart I was...let's just say it didn't work out that way.

I think this article is really well presented and I'm curious what you all think after reading it. I'd be particularly appreciative if the more knowledgeable folks would chime in.

Please tell me if this author is a known jackass or anything like that. I'll be happy to remove the post if that's the case. Just wanted to see some quality discussion.speaking of which, i like doing push ups with a weighted backpack. very little weight needed to make the move MUCH harder.I agree with you on this. Loading takes a lot more than say Beverley Nutrition suggests on their label.  I loaded up for over a month a few years ago and now take exactly what you suggest. I do not take any nitrite oxide. My biceps are 17.5" and any "pump" comes and says longer because of the way I work my muscles. When I was competing my diet was designed by Keith Kline of the Institute of Eating Management in Houston. It was both challenging and fun competing for a time.      Would my business email address if I sent it on this be open for the world to see?Great tutorial, never seen anything quite so in depth for this skill! I love these posts josh, really looking forward to your new material this year too.


Can I ask why you use the angle of the arms in the planche lean instead of where the arms are relative to the body (saying hands under the hips for example). Wouldn't a 45 deg planche lean require one with long arms to lean much farther forward relative to their own body? Do you recommend the 45 deg PL lean so that there is the same kind of stress placed on the elbows, regardless of body proportions?  Just one thing to add, the risk of tendonitis is greater with weighted muscle ups, so you have to take it very slow if you do.I received my TRX certification last year and while there's a ton of different exercises that you can do with this tool, I'd still point you in direction of cheaper alternatives.  Only time I have used them are when they are already provided in a gym and even then you can get an equivalent core workout with just body weight exercises or an ab wheel.

They're incredibly useful but there are ways to achieve your goals otherwise.maybe people are simply prejudiced against 6' pheasants?The good news is that it can be trained.Something like this helped greatly with my lower back and hamstrings a few years ago.

I could barely put my hands on my knees comfortably. Someone I was working with at the time had me visualize moving *far* beyond normal range of motion throughout the day. After repeating that a few times I could put my hands on my shins. A week later I had my palms on the floor.

It was mind boggling the moment I realized how much of that inflexibility was psychological. I was imagining limitations, and my body was responding by basically refusing to move any farther than it was used to.But now you can fight guys bigger than you :)This is just one of many videos out there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtEq2EVlM_wBailing is a big no no, does happen unfortunately I've seen guys fall on their heads.

A good idea if someone is working on this alone is using a pool, I did that for a time when I was working on my own backflip. The issue becomes the edge of the pool, but once you can deal with that its a lot of fun.Can someone elaborate on "mental training" for me? Is that really just as simple as visualizing yourself doing the relevant exercises? If so, this is really baffling news.The first time to do a backflip is extremely trippy to say the least. Many people attempt to bail and fall on their necks, so even if it looks easy, you realize halfway through how ridiculous it feels."Enough room" depends on how big the place is and how much other stuff you have.

The tower will fit.  It make take up more space than it deserves.  It might require more open space around it than good fung-shui would allow.  It might be ugly as sin and ruin the vibe you are going for in the room.

If you can sell it for enough to buy door pull up bar, rings and parallettes, it might be a good trade in terms of space efficiency.

i wonder if the gains drop off after a certain period of time without physical stimulation. it seems a little too good to be true without some major caveats. i also wonder if the main source of gained strength isn't neurological like with gtg or noob gains.Pseudo planche pushups.  With so many emotions being thrown around, I read this as "dead hug."Well you're basically average height. Who are you comparing yourself to? Can you dunk a basketball? There's a reason so many NBA players are over 7 feet tall. You're close to the size of [Kohei Uchimura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJxVTwtr3U), best all around gymnast of all time.Alright will do =)
We don't talk about fight club? More like low five You build strength for weighted muscle-ups the same way you build strength for everything else: progressive overload. Work weighted pull-ups and weighted dips, slowly increasing the load over time.

I personally prefer lower rep ranges for pull-ups and dips (rather than the 3x8 recommended in the FAQ), and stay in the range of 3x3 to 3x5.

You may also want to practice sets of the transition (top of the pull-up to bottom of the dip), slow and controlled and with no kip, if that's a sticking point for you. But that's definitely accessory work; weighted pull-ups and dips are what will get you the bulk of the strength necessary.I do not follow football. The games are fun to watch, but I can't do the team allegiance thing. It doesn't fit with my personality.

GO BEARSI think the problem is most people haven't read Thomas Myers book completely and just look at pictures. If you read the book he states you can construct "fascial meridians" where ever you want if you follow the rules he puts forward. He then uses the rules to construct the fascial lines we're used to seeing but he never states its exhaustive or backed up. Its meant to be taken as a concept to help guide treatment planning.

Also If you scroll down on this page you can see a video of a normal sliding surface versus one where the surface is adhered.

http://www.doctorschierling.com/fascia.html

The quality of the above site is to called into question, might be fine might not but I just wanted the video.

The main problem is fascia has been on the low level of research and has been sucked into the wishy washy alternative therapy world as the great boogeyman. In another 10-15 years we'll have a much clearer idea of what goes on in the body from the fascia point of view and can dismiss the quakery outright.

"Check out my edit, sorry, I misinterpreted the article.

And yes this is definitely super cool. 24% is amazing.Yes. But 24 is way better than none. That is what is cool (especially if you are in a cast for two months because you tore your Achilles, like me. Perfect timing on this. Time to imagine some gains!)'Fantastic' haha. Guess you're not a Pats fan. That hit nearly made me cry.

I don't follow college football so I guess we'll never know...What's the next logical progression after diamond pushups if your end goal is planche pushups?Hey I am same height as you high five lolz That was fantastic, but not the one I was remembering - it was a bowl game (rose bowl? Orange bowl?) From like 3-4 years ago. I distinctly remember the dude running from right to left, tooThis is really fascinating stuff.

I'm a little confused about this though:

&gt; Physical strength was increased by 24% through mental practice

&gt; Strength was also increased through physical training, by 28%

&gt; The strength gain was greatest among the football players given mental training

...isn't 28&gt;24 ?

Edit: never mind, disregard that, I can't read apparently.

&gt; Thirty male university athletes, including football, basketball and rugby players

&gt; The strength gain was greatest among the football players given mental training

So out of all the sub-groups, the football players given mental training had the greatest gains. But on average across all groups, strength training was more effective than mental training.RTO ring pushups is far down the line of progression in terms of strength. You can't compare it to diamonds.

Compared to the equivalent progression, rings will require less raw strength because you're further off the ground (though I suppose if you do it with elevated feet, that's offset).

Feet grounded RTO ring pushup's movement is the equivalent of a pseudo planche push up. Simply because you are higher off the ground, you have to lift less weight with your arms; thereby developing less strength over time. However, you learn to keep balanced over the rings; core and balance training is what's adding most difficulty there.

Keep in mind I don't mean that it's a neat, proportional line graph (i.e. not 1x strength and 0.5x core increase vice versa). Life's not a neat rpg.Exlocate is what I'm going for first, I should have specified that. I am going to a gymnastics facility soon so I'll ask if the trainer knows how to coach the element.It seems that it also applies to flexibility. [article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20077278).Right? I'm not even a troll. Never gotten close to this many down votes before.

Edit: I guess body weight fitness can only make you physically strong... not emotionally. I, on the other hand, can do 10 x one arm emotional pull ups from a dead hang.^ Yeah, that was it, sorry if I was unclearreally? try RTO ring push upsThe position of your hands and elbows activates different muscles for sure. Elbows perpendicular to the body is a good technique, but extreme elbow tuck is not necessary in any pushup version if it does not feel natural, in my opinion. Same with extreme flaring of elbows, which can be hard on the shoulders. I think both extremes can be bad. I do what is comfortable for my body, for the most part.The ones I saw - landing on head, head stuck in foam cubes while body finishes the rotation, hyperflexion of neck causing strain. Nothing serious, but in general it is better to avoid headplant.Wow much appreciated! I would drop the negatives and try to add volume with added sets or ladders/pyramids.  For example, with adequate rest, you should be able to handle 3 ladders of 1-3 right now.  Do that and you've added six reps to your workout.  Build from that consistently by add a fourth ladder with just 1 rep, then next workout go 1,2 in your fourth ladder and so on.We *all* have exuses :D[Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArzTY8Rx2z1DdDZlaUVxa1NISlQ0RVpMYVlRaklJelE#gid=0) a spreadsheet with the progressions from over coming gravity. [Source](http://eatmoveimprove.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=69).

You should still buy coming gravity anyway its a fantastic resource, right up there with Starting Strength.well, satirical, but yeah.Never talk about the fight club?Interesting. How did those injuries occur ?we're not bitter! you're just imagining things.

behold my magnificence of EIGHT push ups! being tall is my excuse for all shortcomings in life.Saving this to try when I get rings.Yes - I know the Irish have excellent and abundant quality sweets! Cheeers!Strengths whatever you work at. Weakness whatever you dont work at. I am 5'4 and push pull weight similar to most bigger guys in my gym. Somehow [this Nature.com article on myopia](http://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120) found it's way on my newsfeed a couple days ago (incidentally I think Coach Sommer actually posted it). As it seems lack of bright outside light seems to be a leading cause in developing myopia. Interestingly sun gazing is one of the methods proposed by Bates. Although starring directly into the sun for prolonged periods of time is probably the worst of his ideas, still it seems he was at least somewhat heading in the right direction. Makes me wonder if this could be somehow used to lessen myopia and not just prevent?

By the way, blurry vision (along with reddening of the eyes and twitching) can be caused by trigger points in the SCM. I found that to be true in my case, for what it's worth.I made pretty great gains counting pushups to get to sleep at night.  I did 100 every morning as soon as I woke up and 100 every night right before I went to bed.  I would literally drift off imagining the exact sensations of doing pushups.  Like how when you go swimming you can feel it lying in bed that night.

I have no idea how much of my gains were from practice and how much were from visualisation, but I'm pretty convinced it helped.Guessing less muscle mass potential = less potential strength. Yeah you just go through a piked front and back lever.  You still need to transition between those points regardless of body shape.  That's why some people do them completely straight and call them 360 pulls.

I actually find piked skin-the-cats easier.Rule 1.Rule 1.Protracting the scapula will help protect the shoulders.  I don't know if you should eventually learn to retract them, but to begin with you should definitely keep them protracted.Thank you all!I think he's remembering Stevan Ridley getting concussed by Bernard Pollard in the 2012 AFC Championship.

Heartbreaking for sure.I bet I know which hit you're talking about.

http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000128926/Ridley-fumbles-after-big-hitSorry about the lack of helpful information, but I was just excited to see another 5'4 130 pound person in this world!From what I know, the eye muscles actually contract to see stuff close to you (accomodation), and relax to see things far away from you. If you could strengthen the relevant muscles it would be no use for myopia since that's troubles with near-sightedness.Cheers![here](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/how-to-avoid-wrist-pain-in-yoga.jpg?9d1806)hiThanks nattyman. You're a champ.You should come to Ireland we have both Milky Way bars and Mars bars. It is truly the land of milk and honey.

Though one shouldn't ingest them as they are not paleo unlike a snickers or carrot cake.Here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/basic_exerciseswhen i did my first skin the cat, the "blacklever" part was really hard and with big blood rush to my head, and i couldnt really just hang there. i looked like a tomato.

for me, it helped to breath out when you go in blacklever hang. then i have much more freedom with my shoulders and my head dont explode. couldnt read it in the article, but i think its importend how you breath...
*is breath the right word? too lazy to look it up :/I love it, clear progressions with a "do this, now this" approach. The forum is an excellent resource where Coach Sommer is available to answer questions and assess form check videos.

Some people find they get stuck on a progression, normally due to mobility, which can be frustrating but so long as I'm making progress  I don't mind - I think I've been on Coassack squats for a year but I'm finally hitting good form. Shaking a lot and yes, struggling super hard, as you say. Right now it doesn't really hurt -- just feels sore. I'll look at those, thanks!Wow those videos show a really weird form. I keep my elbows in, I feel it directly in my shoulders.
When flaring out I feel more pressure in my elbow joints. Kept me from having bad form I guess.jiu jitsu was made for the small man. check out rickson gracie plowing through people twice his sizeRule 2.I am 177cm and 87kg at about ~20% BF, so yeah, you're probably pretty skinny. Obviously a photo would be the best way to judge that.

Being skinny already means you are in a good position to start adding muscle straight away. Eat about +500 kcal above your tdee  with plenty protein and avoid junk as much as you can and work through the progressions and you should see some good progress.

Odd that your landlord controls what you buy? And is around enough to stop you doing something which causes no damage to the property? If you have the space/money (or have the time to look through craigslist/gumtree) you could opt for a freestanding tower setup. Or even something a little more ghetoo, like a bit of scaffolding, or a painter's platform [like this](http://www.ladders4sale.co.uk/5-Way-Scaffold-Platform-Ladder-258.asp?gclid=COi404Ol18QCFYnMtAodQE0AMw)

I went from 78 to 74 kg in a year of regular CC workout (3+ times a week).
Work hard and you will loose weight (fat).Rule 1.Yes, as opposed to the tuck version of skin the cat.I'm gonna hijack this, because my doorway pull-up bar just broke and I'm looking to get an upgrade.

* the power towers I looked at all have some kind of back support for, like, captain's chair leg raises. Can that be removed to do lever type stuff and skin-the-cats?

* the dip bars on most of the power towers I've seen have these vertical handles. Would it be possible to remove those to do russian dips?
* might I be better off building my own power tower with supplies from the hardware store? Basically all I want is a straight bar and parallel bars with a base that's as slim as possible and as sturdy as necessary

(edit for formatting)Well... Emmet, actually, we have Snickers in Australia and I love them.... before 'protein bars' were a thing, it was as close as you could get to a 'protein bar' in the 80s.... (because of the nut content)

And fun fact: We have Milky Way bars, but we call them 'Mars Bars'! They are pretty good, too![Hands as feet and how it relates to balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3v69_AFzZ8),,, one of emmets best videosYes keep them in. :) (And sadly, a lot of videos show this exercise with elbows flaring out excessively like crazy, which is inappropriate in my book.)&gt;What kinds of skills do being able to do a lot of diamond pushups help with?

In our routine, it's recommended you begin the dips/dipping progression after you master diamond push ups, so, at last you got that going for you. (Same for rows and pull ups) thanks for the reply. and I saw Henry Rollins speak a few years ago -- love the guy.He's thinking that rather than progressing to ring pushups, he can move to weighted pushups instead. The average American woman (90 %) has disqualified you from their gene pool. Sucks. I prefer using snickers and voluntary amputation. You probably don't have snicker in Australia as they would be a menace similar to rabbits so you can settle for cans of tenants and shrimp off the barbie&gt;So Im a begginer

How are your pull ups and dips? You could fuck your elbows up if you keep trying to do a muscle up without actually having explosive, full range, pulling and dipping strength, cause then it's not a technique issue, but a strength issue.

Watch this video for the technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKg5hfbj6Jg

If you can't do it even if you follow those 3 things, then you just need to get stronger, focus on the basics (false grip pull ups and deep dips) and you will.weighted push ups, duh.Not always true, I have seen people injure their neck landing in foam pit. It is quite safe, but it is not water. I have also sprained my ankle in foam pit once. Mats are much better once you ar able to land on your feet.I know it's april fools but this'll come up in the search one day, and people will be like holy shit, wtf.I don't know about the fascial part, it might be that it's still not slow enough to promote the change you want. However, I do the same and I feel like I need to keep this (and piriformis/glute stretching) up as a countermeasure to all the hip abduction (side split/wide squat) training I've been doing. I definitely can tell the difference in my hips and sometimes even lower back, if I slack here.

The "myo" (muscle) part seems much clearer to me. I've had some astonishing results with trigger point self-massage, not so much in terms of gaining flexibility or range of motion, but in getting rid of semi-chronic, frequently reoccurring pain and other much more diffuse symptoms (e.g. blurry vision, I've written about it very briefly [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/2z6wn6/longterm_chronic_neck_pain_sollution/cpgjzl6)). Trigger Points in the glutes and piriformis are some of the usual culprits in referring pain to the hips and lower back.

I've had good success relieving some TrPs only doing self-massage, but the most promising course of action seems to be to add stretching as well. Also combining both at the same time: massaging or applying pressure to a muscle under a light stretch works good for TrPs in my experience and seems to have a fascial dimension too (quite easy to do for the piriformis btw, just add a light stretch while sitting on your ball), at least that's what [Spineo seems to suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPU524tode8). (I don't know how legit he is though, some of his stuff seems interesting, but I absolutely hate his weird neologisms "F.A.P., F.R., F.R.C." etc., just reeks of snake oil! Also who in his right mind would call his technique deliberately "fap"?! Although this would redeem him somewhat in my book, if actually done on purpose!).

Science about the whole myofascial complex seems still fuzzy from what I understand, but I think people like Schleip with his fascia research and Travell &amp; Simons with their trigger point research are at the very least on to something. Explanations for what is actually going on in the tissue itself might not be 100% on point yet, but just speaking from my own experience with their methods so far it works quite well and I'm getting pretty much exactly the results they are promising. Also most of these methods are very safe to do and for free, so what's the worst that can happen besides [wasting precious time](http://i.imgur.com/aLLpYMA.jpg)?While being in the german hang, should you completely relax and with that retract your scapula?
Also you are saying this is for shoulder mobility. What would be a good way to get that mobility, as in sets and reps. I usually do 4 sets of 3-4 skin the cats afterwards a 30 second german hang.&gt;But in the "real" skin the cat you do not go through FL and BL; that is a completely different movement

What do you mean by the "real" one? You mean piked with straight legs?
At what point did you stop reading the OP post?Disadvantages: well, you're gonna stay short, I guess?

Advantages: fucking everything else. Being short is awesome for bodyweight fitness and gymnastics.Can we see pics if your arms that are each capable of curling 70lb-100lbs? That's pretty hardcore! Also, to answer your question: bent arm strength doesn't translate to straight arm strength. You conditioned the muscles but not the joints and went ham on the joints without them being ready. Weren't you at least doing planche leans or tuck planches or *something* before?As a gymnast, I can say that this is quite an amazing tutorial. Really in-depth and precise. Should be great for a beginner or the more advanced.

It is, like he says, a great exercise. Highly recommend it.[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G45tb0g2KqY) really helped meHoly moly. So many downvotes for a joke. why lower raw weight numbers? smaller bones /tendons?They would be higher relative to size because it is entirely dependent on strength:weight.

Generally, better at moving themself, worse at moving other things.Hard to say if you were just sore or if you actually hurt yourself a little bit. But you can do for a couple weeks some easier dip progression and see if it hurts the same:
http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/dip-progression.html

How did it feel for you doing the dips? Were you shaking a lot, losing form, having to struggle super hard? It could be a sign that you should start with an easier exercise. 3. Weight and Rings are two different progression paths.

Weight primarily builds arm strength and possibly size
Rings primarily build core because you need more control and balance.

You can do both if you'd like, but it probably wouldn't be helpful to do both on the same day. This is one of those things that I did as a kid that I never lost the ability to do. I used to do them in doorways back in high school because I was a show-off (even though I could barely manage 5 pull-ups at the time).TLDR: Higher relative strength, lower absolute strength&gt; lower jump height if you are doing something like basketball or parkour, lower sprint speed, etc.

Would these be lower relative to size as well or would they be the same/bigger like how strength:weight is?* Peasants bro. It shows.If you have a good amount of experience with this movement, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxQlqTlVYAU) demonstrates bad form first, then good form at 2:09. He also explains how to apply good technique. It will probably be easier to see the movement in its entirety in this video since the frame captures most of his body. I don't think his skin the cat can get much better except for more pike compression and less momentum. You can ignore this comment if you're not concerned with practicing the more final version of this movement.

Edit: Not trying to nitpick, but I think that the terms front lever (FL), and back lever (BL) may be used a little loosely in Josh's video. If you are doing the tuck version of the skin the cat, then yes you do go through tuck-FL and tuck-BL. But in the "real" skin the cat you do not go through FL and BL; that is a completely different movement. I think it would be more accurate to change the title to "Tuck (or Beginner) Skin the Cat Tutorial."Pull-ups and dips will be easier If you want to gain insights in that, this is probably not the best place to ask. Of course most, if not all, people here are going to tell you they prefer bodyweight exercises. This is the bodyweightfitness sub after all.

Having said that, a lot of people talk about integrating both (usually by adding squats and deadlifts), so it might be interesting to see how many exactly.You should do the recommended routine that can be found in the sidebar.Just a fancy name for what we're already recommending here. The gymnastic/hollow plank just adds a very strong protraction of the shoulders into the mix as well.But we know they work. What's up for contention is if they actually work *better* and *how* they work. Just like most sports science research that doesn't get funded, it's based on what already works and is already in practice. Sometimes by investigating you find that's it's coincidence that it works, or there are slightly better options.Cool - the screen will highlight functional weaknesses (which you already know about) and then you can be given very specific exercises, stretches and releases to treat the areas in question. Hope it works out!You should be able to do the vertical pulls anywhere?It's *better*Knuckles.You should do planche curls first. That is where you curl a person doing a planche (perhaps with a friend on his back).Well, I guess you can trust one of two things: the YMCA model, or natural body physiology.

It is physiologically impossible for the body to become stronger without at least forming stronger neuro-muscular connections, or adapting to the stress by muscular hypertrophy. It is even more insane for the body to get stronger yet LOSE muscle at the same time. Hell, we've heard of people maintaining muscle yet gaining strength. But losing muscle while gaining strength? That has never been recorded.

The calculations/measurements/predictions are wrong. Keep training, and let your body composition sort itself out.taller handstands


..ya, I got nothin'.Rule 2.Rule 2.Rule 3.That's why it's territory. I'm not about to have a bunch of noobs give advice to OP.Video is now up for me. It needs some annotations, but I have other things to do until tomorrow evening.I'm certainly interested. What are some advantages taller people over short people in BWF? Or in weightlifting in general?I'm 5'4 also and i wish i was 130 pounds...Thanks. All good points and well take.  Perhaps now that we have jousted on the lists and broken our spears off and still remain on our horses, so to euphorically speak, perhaps I will open up the science of what we are involved with, but not on this social media network. What say you?  I am a defense contractor on the side of other energy endeavors and own my own company. I love disruptive  technologies. I bet on people not companies as does my Swiss partner.   Cheers man. Appreciate it!Assuming he has examined you properly, I actually agree with your doctor on this one. Doing major surgery for something that does not bother you in everyday activities would be ridiculous and risky.

Try starting with very easy exercises like wall pushups and the like and progress very slowly. I have something like that in my bedroom. It is in the space that the previous owner had her giant wardrobe. So yeah, I don't have a wardrobe, and have to keep my clothes on a bookshelf or hanging in the airing cupboard, but that's fine by me.

I suspect your wife just doesn't want to have to look at something unsightly, which is fair enough. If I had to have  mine one out in my living room I'd have 2nd thoughts too. But at the end of the day I'm pleased not to spend the money on a gym.

You can be a bit creative about clothes or book storage (keep then in your son's toom. He's two, he won't notice) and ditch some shelves or wardrobe for the space.Fat as well as muscle though You're confusing focusing on one goal with not being 'functional'.  Gaining the ability to do a 90 degree Pushup will give you a pretty decent bench.  Getting up to 225 on barbell rows will get you a high rep max on chinups.

I am 100% about functional training, but you have to always ask, "functional for what?"  I train to get better at things so I can train harder.  Sure I could add bench press into my routine, but it would come at the cost of something else and it wouldn't lead anywhere except a bigger bench press.

My plan is to master a certain selection of bodyweight progressions, and then I'll worry about adding external weight.  Adding it in right now will just slow down progress and I don't see any reason to do that.&gt; He claims to know a fellow coach who performed 160 consecutive reps of full range (hands to shoulder), freestanding handstand pushups on parallettes over the course of 30 mins without coming down from handstand, for example.

I've heard some crazy stories, but I have a hard time believing that one. The craziest thing I know is true is a guy who could hold a handstand for 10 minutes.

Don't be intimidated by stuff like that. I am someone who can do almost every strength skill in the book and I don't do anything insane like that. My reps never go passed 3 sets of 10. Whenever I hold a position I rarely go over 1 minute. People who are at a high level tend to be elitists. Ignore anything they say that discourages you.

Feel free to ask me questions whenever you feel like it. Depress harder. You need to lift of the ground for it to be an L-sit. Good compression though.What's the consensus on regular planks compared to the Pavel's RKC plank? Is it as good as he says? I haven't been able to find much discussion or criticism of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TKktamzq4oThey are pretty different, because the recruitment pattern is completely different.

The joint range of motion issimilar, but the way you actually move through that ROM is powered by completely different contraction patterns with the load in different directions.

It's not too much to train together by any means. They are pretty complimentary.As a person with several large scars, the closest a dermatologist has ever gotten to something like this is recommending those stick-on silicone patches. She said "they probably don't work, but it wouldn't hurt to try".I got in touch with an FMS1/2 person will see how ti goes. Wikipedia says it's just "a screen", but we'll see how it goes.Thinking about the positioning of the shoulders, arms, etc, the German hang is more or less the opposite of a weighted dislocate, with a little overlap, right?

Do these relate to/overlap with each other to a high degree? Would it be too much to train both at the same time? Or are they two different ways to get to the same place?F'n awesome response. Harder to shoot.You'll bulk up quicker than taller guys. At least in my experience.Here's my notes from Overcoming Gravity on closed/open/semi chain exercises.

Open and Closed Chain Exercises:

 Closed Chain Exercises (CKC): Exercises where the limbs are not free to move. Most barbell and bodyweight exercises where the limbs are fixed to the group or implement are CKC.
Barbell examples: Squat, Deadlift, Olympic lifts. Bodyweight examples: Sprinting, pistols, dips, pull-ups, handstand push ups.

 Open Kinetic Chain (OKC): Exercises where the limbs are free to move through space. Typically isolation exercises like biceps curls and triceps extensions.

 Semi-Open Kinetic Chain: Exercises in between  OKC and CKC. Example: Bench Press, Overhead press.
		//If I don't have rings, is throwing on a backpack with weights in it an acceptable alternative?//

given that rings aren't used to weigh you down while you walk around, I'm not sure what you could be thinking.Never go full retard!&gt; It seems a little weird to me - like rubbing a scar on your skin can make it go away.

That's also a [relatively common claim](http://www.integrativehealthcare.org/mt/archives/2007/07/six_massage_tec.html).It's not an either/or. First you figure out whether there actually is an effect, then *if there is*, you start looking for the mechanism. Trying to figure out why homeopathy or acupuncture work, for example, isn't interesting or important, it's a waste of time. Of course, the stuff we're talking about here (adding muscle contraction and/or load making stretching more effective) are infinitely more plausible than either of those; my point was just that, from what I've seen, the evidence that any of the popular modes of stretching are any better for increasing ROM than just plain static stretching is very mixed.Yeah, he's definitely in the right place for his body shape.I kinda agree in theory.  In practice I think you are much more likely to spin your wheels.  Everything depends on the details.  If you are goal focused, and treat bodyweight and weights as tools and work using each of their strengths, then I agree.  But from the sound of your OP, it seems more like you are treating them as ends rather than the means.

have you seen a physio or doc who specializes in sports medicine to determine what the source of the pain is? (if it's not obvious they can at least refer you to the right people, and might be better than a standard GP)The biggest thing is the scapular stabilization. It's really just SA activation, spreading the shoulders wide using the armpit muscles (in cue talk).

I'm sorry, I had to.Rule 2. Removed.What is your goal? Bodyweight provides almost endless progression for upper body, but is limited for lower body. I do Barbell Squats and Deadlifts, with some bodybuilding upper body. However upper body is primarily bodyweight. If you are planning on going the military route you should place a ton of importance on cardio and endurance.  go see a different doctor&gt; shedding toxins and free radicals

Yeah but now you've set the radicals free. Months from now they'll turn into free terrorists *and their gains are on your hands*!Pretty sure he taped the hat to his junk.....thanks a lot. I appreciate such detail.O ok. Got u. I disagree though. I believe limiting yourself to one method is close minded and not that beneficial. At the end of the day, Weight is weight. Depending on your goals, certain methods are more convenient but ultimately it's how you utilize the methods. In all, it depends on one's goals. If your goal is to master bodyweight movements then ideally bodyweight is the most convenient but not necessarily  the only way you should/ could train. I'm all about functional training. Training for everyday life and be an all around athlete since my sports are combat (boxing, mma, fighting), baseball, and basketball. Also, I plan om joining the military sometime soon and I just like to be in shape for survival reasons. You never know when you've gotta scrap it out and being human, yiu should always be in functional,  surviving shape in case you need to defend your self. Using weights for strength, bodyWeight for endurance and vice versa is good, and perfect for constantly keep your muscles on their toes while keeping your training different and fun constantly. That's just me though.Is planche a bicep exercise?I didn't say those things were problematic.A few thing that could be helpful, some of which is already covered in the video:

It's good to learn some "lead up" skills if you have never done any sort of gymnastic training. I started doing backflips when I was a kid, and a lot of that happened when I was messing around on a little diving board my grandparents had in their pool. A pool is safer than a trampoline, but there are still dangers involved, especially when you no not use proper form. I'll get into that in a second.

If you have never really experienced the feeling of being inverted, you might want to start very simple by doing some backward rolls. You can start standing or sitting. Essentially, you want to roll backwards past your shoulders and then onto your feet. When you get to your head, you're going to have to use your arms to take the majority of the weight to push yourself around the complete the rotation. This drill is used to get your body used to the feeling of being inverted, which is why you will see children doing things like this at a "tumbling" class.

I would second what many of the others here have already said and recommend that you have someone to spot you when you're trying your backflips for the first time. Get a crash mat of some kind to cushion your landing (when I was a kid, this meant an old mattress). The person spotting you will be there to help accelerate your rotation by placing their hand on your lower back during the flip to push you around to your feet.

The first key to a proper back flip, which is covered in the video, is head placement at takeoff. Most beginners want to throw their head, and sometime their entire upper bodies, backwards. This only leads to pain and possibly serious injury. Also, most people who hit their heads on diving boards the sides of pools will employ this method. If you jump and keep proper head placement, you should never be in danger and hitting the board or ledge because you will have completed the flip before even getting near the obstacle.

The second key to performing a good backflip is understanding the physics of the rotation. You are generating your rotational energy from your lower body, not your shoulders. By standing up straight and taking off with your hands thrown above your head, you are creating the necessary force to lift your body off the ground. Then, the next step is the quickly tuck your feet up into your chest. The smaller the tuck, the faster the spin. Some people prefer to keep their knees together in their tuck, and most likely you will too when you are first starting out. There are those who believe that a split tuck--one performed with your knees spread apart--will help accelerate the rotation by creating a tighter tuck. This really isn't necessary for a single flip, and usually only applies to multiple flips, but it's good to be aware there is an option. Watch a few videos of divers and gymnasts as their perform skills that require multiple rotations. I guarantee you will see them using a split tuck the vast majority of the time.

The final element that will bring it all together is the "spot". The video explains this, but only briefly. This element can be unintuitive, but it is an important skill that will let you land perfect backflips anytime. Notice in the video that the performer looks back partway through the somersault to look for the ground. It's not the worst I've ever seen, but I think he's looking back a little early in anticipation for his spot. The idea is, when you've rotated 3/4 of a the way in a backflip, your face should be facing the ground. At this point, when you can see the ground you should lock your eyes on a spot and kick your legs down to that point. The idea is to burst out of the tuck not only so that you land on your feet, but also to stop the rotation as fast as possible.

Think about it for a second. When you start the trick, you are standing up tall and should have your arms over your head when you leave the ground. All of your energy is distributed (roughly) across your body. When you pull your legs up, that energy in pulled inward around a focal point (your hips). When you come out of the tuck, that energy is thrown out from the focal point and back into your toes and shoulders, which will decrease the speed in the rotation. This is the same principal that figure skaters use to increase the speed of their spins. If used properly, the tuck and the kick out will give you a tremendous amount of control over your rotational speed, which is important because you will want to stop spinning at some point after you've gotten the whole mess started.

My coach once explained this to me by making me think about what would happen in space if I simply was the curl up into a ball. If the force of my legs coming up to my chest was equal to the force of my chest moving towards my knees, I would stay stagnant and never start a rotation. If, however, the force  of my knees pulling put to my chest was not counteracted by any other force, I would begin to rotate. This would continue indefinitely until I were to negate the rotational force by releasing my tuck. The quicker and more forcefully I release my tuck, the more immediately I will stop rotating.

I have one last piece of advice that I think every experienced gymnast or diver will agree with. Listen! Yes, listen while you are in your tuck for changes in sound. After a while, you will be able to hear and feel your position in the air relative to the ground based on the sounds that you hear. This, along with spotting is the key to locating yourself in the air. If you want to land perfect backflips every time, or want to move up to front flips, this is the skill you will need the most.

Sorry if this was more than you needed. Videos will only go so far, so I thought I would help with a detailed explanation.

P.S. Front flips are more difficult to land because you have a "blind" landing. Your face will be facing the sky when you are nearing the end of your flip, so this type of rotation requires a greater sense of spacial awareness to land the flip properly.bottom line in weightlifting that leverage is strength. That's achieved with size. However, you're basically doing basic gymnastics which if you haven't noticed is dominated by shorter than average individuals.

But who really cares cos this information literally changes nothing about what your routine should look like or how hard you need to work.actually IIRC strength ratios are more to do w ratio of limbs to body. Short people should have pretty similar likelihood of taller people for disproportionate limbsI'm 5'4" and have no problem hanging by one arm off a 2" dowel rod for 30 seconds or lifting a 135 lbs vbar.If you like brother, are you in a rush to get jacked that can't wait an extra day?Oops, wrote a response and forgot to hit go. Sorry.

Anyways, it was really clunky, completely ignored the back button (a central part of the android experience), and didn't follow design guidelines at all.

It really seemed like a crappy port of an iPhone or web app and made it really hard for me to get into it. The back button not working was the most egregious thing though. Go to another doctor and this time you insist that it is serious enoughThen I guess he'll need to go through his foot stand progressions...At a gym, some benches and such may not adjust for your height. I see some females and males about your height that don't seem to fit comfortably into some of the benches and such. That's literally more effort than I put in on a set.  If you wanted to up the volume and beat yourself into the ground I would suggest lowering the intensity of each set.Because of the principle of specificity.  Doing a thing is generally the best way to get good at that thing.

The other half of it is that getting good at something will generally lead to better results than not getting good at something.  Whether you devote all our time to bodyweight and master a bunch of advanced progressions or devote your time to powerlifting and join the 1000 club isn't important.  What's important is that doing either one of those is going to be more beneficial than trying to do both and going nowhere.What day was it for his post.They're the same in that its all general terms for things we don't understand and don't have fully accepted definitions.

&gt; [Practitioners do not agree on what constitutes a trigger point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofascial_trigger_point)As someone 5'5, 135 pounds, the biggest weakness I can think of is the small palm and short fingers meaning less balance and weaker grip on certain surfaces and equipment. When I do pull-ups on a 1.5" bar, my grip isn't always complete and there is a lot of strain on the last two finger joints.Cool. The only problem is that on an elevated surface, I feel like it is tough to balance doing the full range of calf raises without support.

I think i'll just stick to doing 50 sets of calf raises on flat ground without support - that seems a bit more feasible. I've heard many people gets intense DOMS when they start at a very high volume with calf raises. Should I not start at the full 50 and maybe do 25 first in a row to see how that feels?You know this thought never crossed my mind for some reason. Thanks for pointing to the obvious best answer. Like usually ill do my 3x4 pullups. The first 2 sets 4 pullups isnt a max effort, but on the last set i really have to squeeze that last rep out. After that i go right into slowest possible negatives i can giving mself 20-25 seconds rest between each negative. Should i do this until i cant even hold myself up on the bar anymore or is that too much.Doesn't explain why it's bad to you. How is it, what about it is unproductive and inefficient? I'm not implying anything. I have done no analysis of the eye muscles and don't care to. The opinion of experts in this arena is that there are absolutely no vision exercises that will correct myopia.Listen to your body, you know it better than we do. Try out some of the stuff and see if it irritates your neck. See if you can work around that if it does. Though I doubt it will (still want to cover my bases though).

TRX is as safe to do as any other type of exercise. Do it right, listen to your body, and don't jump the gun.

You'll need to eat around maintenance calories to do recomp (or at least average it over the week, some people like eat in a deficit on rest days, and eat at a surplus on workout days). TRX is just a way to workout though, in terms of recomposition diet will be the more important factor, the working out will just help direct that in the way you want.Did you even read the rest of my post?  It's unprodictive and inefficient.Yes, that is what I have been doing. Thanks! I read you did a heavy bench session beforehand?1. Yes.

2. Not much actually.

3. It's definitely an option, but your time might be better spent working on more advanced progressions.I was hoping you'd respond!

Do you think my German Hangs are deep enough?

After my GH hang work post-session, I generally replicate the motion with my feet on the ground, just trying to get the awareness of how the shoulders work. Build up to doing them with no support! It's good for you. That may be using support until you don't need to, or it might be working off the ground.

Yes, it is sets of 50 or so from memory, and also on the flat ground (so it's easy to do). He mentions doing them while doing the dishes, so unless you set up a step in front of your sink...Why is it terrible to u?Doing anything is better than nothing. Do what you can.

Working harder (doing more taxing BWF stuff) will burn more calories than not. But you could eat one or two cookies and completely negate the effects. Diet is the important factor in weight loss. Working out just makes that weight more likely to be fat instead of muscle.

Working out should not make your body less hungry. What it might do is distract you from cravings and keep you from turning to food around the workout times. And you also MIGHT be less hungry just after working out (this is different for everyone though, some people become instantly ravenous after working out, others might experience a lull).For sure, you could do a plank, but even weighting just below your shoulders can dramatically increase the amount of torque through the shoulder joint, even if it does improve your position. It's not just the up/down component for load like it is in a plank, but the rotational component.I think that's a pretty terrible idea.  It really depends what you're trying to accomplish, but twice as much focussed work on one thing will get you there twice as fast as half as much work.Are you pushing the limits of your strength every set?  Because total volume should be fine if that's the case.  You're *supposed* to recover well from the beginner routine.

Personally I do a back workout with maybe 25 sets total of pulling work, but I built up the capacity to work at this level of volume over several years.Also true, but still preferable to landing on one's head.It's more load but at an advantages leverage position.  Pretty sure I could do a plank with my bodyweight on my shoulders and I'm nowhere near planche.So wait.  That being the case, how much credence do you give to the idea that reading close or in low light or whatever will ruin your vision?  Assuming there are eye muscles that you can strengthen or atrophy those theories make sense, but you seem to be implying that eye muscles can't be strengthened?I do martial arts and have often wished I was a smaller guy. Sure size and strength are great, but the martial arts were created by small lean people to maximize their advantage. Try out some martial arts some time, kung fu, karate, something traditional. You might be surprised how well you can perform the techniques.You realize the guy is standing lolThe original ultimate backflip tutorial:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ8CRrFXzH4I had some nylon cord and about a foot of 1.5 inch oak dowel that I turned in to "rings".  Even buying that stuff would probably be cheaper than suspension trainers.
whoooooooshIt can actually make it easier (in terms of position of leverage) if it's superior to your hand placement, because anything weighted there can shift your COG further forward. I wouldn't necessarily call it easier overall, as it's still more load.Are "fascial adhesions" the same thing as trigger points?
My PT was telling me that trigger points are pockets of acetylcholine, that could be broken up by massage and needling.Yeah i'm from Washington state By wide, i meant **wide**.  As in elbows out to almost full extension.  Harder on the chest than handstands and unweighted dips.I'm never sure what to believe on that forum. The coach who runs it is legit, but so much of what he says seems to be purely for the sake of 'wow'-ing people into buying his products. He claims to know a fellow coach who performed 160 consecutive reps of full range (hands to shoulder), freestanding handstand pushups on parallettes over the course of 30 mins without coming down from handstand, for example. Which seems absurd to me but as I have no point of reference when it comes to high level gymnastics, I just give him the benefit of the doubt.

Cheers for the training insight by the way! I hope I can get good enough to be considering that stuff someday.&gt; Once you are bearing the whole weight of your body in or on you hands (e.g dips and pullups) you can't add any more load unless you double the load by using one hand.&gt; sic

Incorrect - You can easily micro-load pull ups- by using 3/2/1 fingers on one hand &amp; full grip on the other hand- thus you can instantly micro load the full grip hand/arm/delt/lat. Or you can use a towel/rope over the bar for one hand to grip hi/low or brace your hand at various levels against a wall/pole/post. The micro-loading options are practically infinite - you just need to implement some creative versatility.

You can also micro load push ups - using strategic hand / height placement.

20 second cross? Hell no haha. I wouldn't say there are set standards and whatnot. I learned an Azarian after learning a backward roll maltese. The hardest part of an Azarian is the backward roll (for me), which uses different muscles. If you watch people do Azarians, some of them actually go through a maltese position then just lower into a cross. They'll get deductions for that, but that's just a progression.

In my experience, the entries are separate from the strength skill. For example, kip to cross. First you learn a kip, then a cross, then you put it together. Or front lever pull to maltese. Get a front lever, then a maltese, then put it together. If you are struggling with the skill, you figure out which part is messing you up. If you're working an Azarian, but you can't quite hit the cross position you need to work the backward roll part more. Or if you're doing kip cross, but fall once you hit the cross you need to work your cross some more.

Honestly it varies from person to person. I can do a backward roll maltese which is worth an F (+0.6) better than simply lowering into one which is worth a D (+0.4). My teammate does a beautiful kip cross, but can't do a back uprise cross even though there're worth the same. Depending on your size back flips are simple. It's just the idea of going over your head blind that gets people nervous. The keys to a back flip are simple as well. Being doing gymnastics and breakdancing etc for 10 years easily.
1. Jump high, slightly backwards at first.
2. Pull your knees to your chest.
3. The momentum from your legs rising slightly after the jump will get you spinning.
4. Pull your arms in and wrap them around your shins/knee.
5. Look up with your head during the  movement to find the ground.
6. Straighten your legs to a slight bend and land.
I learned a back flip in about a week. To where it was to the point that I wasn't worried about landing on my head etc.
Then progress to wall flips, tree flips, gainers etc. After you get the back flip down it should be cake from there. I learned wall flips on my second try. Gainers in about ten minutes. It helps to have safety equipment around but I learned on grass. Good luck.I taught myself with the help of a friend. So a few things you really really need to know before attempting this

1. Safety is key. Seriously. You can easily injure yourself extensively and at that point regret is too late. Please be careful to anyone attempting this.

2. Your best bet would be to find a place to teach you. Gymnastics gym, parkour class, anywhere a professional is located.

3. Be honest with yourself. Can you do a backflip? Are you at a point in your life where you're fit enough to jump high enough and have strong enough abs/back muscles to pull yourself over? If not go train and try later.

4. Watch a ton of different tutorials. Some might work for you better than others.

5. A mattress is your best friend

6. The move itself is fairly simple and understandable. The problem is overcoming fear. The best way to get over it is through slow progressions. Don't be stupid and rush into it and hurt yourself.

That's the advice I can give you. If you want advice on the move feel free to ask but this is just how to not injure yourself.


1.5. Wear shoes on handsActually it cant. Only if the weight is in front of your shoulders will the planche be easier. So unless someone hangs off of your neck, the planche will still be harder than just BW.

What about the more higher rated entries into the skills like azarian cross or maltese? Do you train them? Someone mentioned on the Gymnastic Bodies forum that the standard prerequisite for azarian cross training was a 20s+ long Iron Cross?? Is this accurate in your experience? Well, it doesn't make much sense to put a lot of effort into explaining *why* something works before you've shown convincingly that it *does* work.I've never seen any reputable source say that foam rolling actually removes scar tissue. It seems a little weird to me - like rubbing a scar on your skin can make it go away. That said, I know nothing about intramuscular scar tissue, so /shrug.

Much like what phi said - I consider foam rolling to just be "self massage". Massage has all sorts of benefits. But also, like phi said, I don't believe it has any important chronic effects that you can't get from any other type of mobility work.Wasn't there some research done about the income level of men across varying heights?

The why however, is a very interesting question.The longest I've held a maltese is 8 seconds and 12 seconds for a straight body planche. In my opinion, 5 seconds is a good number. You're only required to hold each skill for 2 seconds, but you have to be strong enough to do the skill in the middle or end of your routine.Still April 1st for another 6 hours on the west coast of the United States.Thanks man! Silly me.&gt;However, I'm fairly convinced that the mechanism that gets the muscles to relax is not myofascial release, but rather something neurological. Just like stretching.

Massage has been shown to reduce the Hoffman reflex, which is basically this.

I wasn't thinking of myself in particular. I just don't know that much about foam rolling other than 'it feels good and I'm going to keep doing it.'What sort of scar tissue do you think you have?It's pretty good actually.  As OP said it can be a little slow so check your ego at the door, but it's the best program out there bar none.Is the proposed "myofascial adhesion release" the same or different from "breaking up scar tissue?" I understand that there isn't enough evidence to support that deep tissue massages actually achieve "myofascial release," but if the two are different, is foam rolling at least scientifically proven to break up scar tissues?Aren't you a bit late?I know your trollin as hard as you can, but I'd like to point out a planche with someone on your back can actually be a lot easier than a planche in general.&gt; Golgi apparatus

Golgi Tendon Organ. You don't want overload your cells' golgi apparatus, they wouldn't be able to package proteins!That's the very basic idea, yeah. What you really want to do is jump as high as you can (basically vertical) then try and drive your hips up and over your shoulders while bringing your legs up. The problem with telling people "chin to chest" in my experience is that they try to accomplish that by bringing their chest down instead of their knees and hips up. This kills your momentum and makes you land flat on your back.If you're not set on doing just bodyweight stuff. You should checkout /r/Fitness there's some good starting points there.

Care to expound on this?

I feel like I should point out, I didn't blink or anything.Search "manipulation under anesthesia."  [Here's a television feature on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxSF2u33R8g)This is commonly reported by proponents of the Bates method and is usually attributed to chance lensing effects from eye lubricant. I read something suggesting it happens pretty regularly but when people begin to really focus on vision correction woo, they become more aware of it.

I spent a lot of time reading up on the Bates method a few years ago, because it went against everything I understood about the eye. It really depends on the definition of the progress. Coach Sommers wants many aspects to progress at the same time, strength, mobility, endurance, connective tissue adaptation, etc... and he wants to be sure that no imbalances and weaknesses are overlooked. In that sense, I believe progress can be massive.
If you just want one of this aspects, like if you care about mainly strength, than yes, you can go faster in another way.I started on knees.

Seriously though, listening to your body takes time and experience. You have to guide yourself into it.

Learning to auto-regulate in the gym is a great way to avoid doing too much, which is a big part of not getting hurt in the first place.

Most of your work sets should feel like a 7-8 out of 10 on an effort scale. Hard, but not too hard to control. When they start feeling like a 9 you should probably stop for the day.

Explaining this further would take a while, and I'm not prepared to go there hahaha... but seriously, taking the time to pay attention to things like that, and to sometimes adhere to an "unnecessarily slow" rate of progression for problem exercises will pay off a lot.I'm not saying this is the best video,there are many others, out on YouTube but it's an example on pushup variations.

https://youtu.be/tccdbY5xcf4&gt; vision focus as a muscle you can train

Personally I've had several moments in my life where things have become blurry and out of focus, and then with a perceived act of effort I forced my vision to be clear again.

And no, I'm not talking about my eyes going out of focus with eachother, this was an actual contraction that I felt inside the eyes themselves.  The focal point of my vision didn't change, things simply went from fuzzy to distinct.You are going to want to spend time going through the handstand progression. Without being able to do a proper handstand you'll never progress to moves like this. :)&gt; Strength is strength; its the same muscles in the same range of motion, so why wouldn't it carry over ?

It would.From other comments you may have a strength issue. If so, weighted split squats are a great way to build the strength you need.

Another strategy is to use a counterweight. You may find that you have trouble with the dorsiflexion and resulting issues with center of gravity staying over the foot, and a simple 10-15 lb plate held out in front of your body may be all that you need to do perfect pistols.Important note: Do NOT do these the day after you do a heavy chest workout. You need to be loose. If your chest or shoulders feel tight from strength work, do not try an inlocate or exlocate that day... you will hurt yourself.

Source: Myself. It was really dumb to not see that coming on my part.Funny thread. But could we have a serious discussion (in another concept Wednesday) about the relative pro's and con's of using weight training to support BWF fitness goals.

For example, atm I'm working on my handstands, with the eventual long term goal of handstand pushups. I'm doing overhead presses, and so far I've reached 0.48 BW. Strength is strength; its the same muscles in the same range of motion, so why wouldn't it carry over ?There is no such thing as a free lunch. Juice is not a complete lunch. Two negatives cancel out. Juice is free.I've done this.

Deep german hangs are really a prerequisite for this. I really just did these for a while and then just learned how to activate my serratus and did a slow inlocate. It really wasn't very hard, but I had very strong internal rotators as well as the ability to do a very controlled exlocate/dislocate.

This is really as much of a strength and control goal as it is a mobility goal, keep that in mind.

The H1 stuff can help, but it's nowhere near as specific. The help comes mostly from learning how to control your shoulders, but it isn't enough on its own. You need the deep German Hangs.

My suggestion is to take your time with that, I always went to where I was comfortable. Then at one of the seminars I just felt like I could go all the way into a dislocate, so I did and that was that. IIRC it promotes simply two exercises - the one arm one leg Pushup and the pistol squat.

The book is almost total garbage, but some of his other works are actually moderately good.I think there's also a role to explore on true nerve tightness/shortness/entrapment. Google nerve flossing for more details.I thought it was due to pressure induced overload of the Golgi apparatus, which eventually fatigue, leading to reduction of neural input and thus relaxation.

But I'm on mobile, and that's off the top of my head. Could be wrong.Your bodyfat percentage calculations are probably inaccurate. Also, if you're losing fat faster than LBM you'll still get stronger. CNS can also still progress on a cut.Good lord I forgot the date Bigger bodies allow for more on the top end due their larger frames.[Dude you went full retard.](http://imgur.com/MUzeBGU)Is it really free
weight if you pay for the juice?
I think not. Haiku.Do me a favour and define closed chain exercise.Indeed. Eat one snickers bar today, two tomorrow, and so on :)Plus foam pits. Foam pits make landing on your head funny, not crippling.
LOL :P

Happy April :)&gt; lower lift numbers relative to bigger people

Surely because they have to move the weight less distance they should be able to lift more weight?  Besides, isn't that more determined by lever arms like femur length, shin length, torso length ect?

Also, we ARE in the bodyweight subreddit.  If OP only ever does bodyweight exercises this won't ever be a problem.Repeat until you've done all sets.

I must have missed this part. Thank you kind sir!Thank you!It is an excellent thing for BWF, your strength/power to weight ratio is going to be much, much, better than taller people. Front/Back/Side leavers will be much easier, as will anything on the rings; basically you are built for BWF.

Downsides: Lower raw weight lifting numbers (amount of plates on the bar), so talk relative to your body weight, ie I bench X my body weight.Started on a pool deck/diving board, once I accomplished a real back flip moved on to a trampoline once I accomplished that moved on to a crash mat (like a high jump mat that can be found at any outdoor track).. If you can successfully land a backflip on one of these thick mats then you can definitely land one on grass. After this I moved on to a hard/thinner mat about 6 inches thick but hard spongey material. Landed on the first try and knew the backflip was mastered. The key is jumping as high as you can, immediately throwing your head backwards and grabbing your knees in a "tuck". I agree with everyone else though online tutorial are no where close to physical coaching and spotting. Alright thanks a lotI made these for about $15 dollars because I did not have parts of it. Also the straps were in a set of four. http://scoobysworkshop.com/diy-trx-6-dollars/ It works well and you dont need to spend $200
Lower center of gravity!Highly underrated comment.

Sleep is the foundation to EVERYTHING you do. Don't fuck with sleep or it'll fuck with you.Damn. I was wondering - how good do you have to be at a skill to be able to include it in a routine? E.g. you have two instances of maltese, two instances of full planche and a press out of plance in your routine - what are your max maltese/planche hold times?If you tried something and you noticed your health or performance improved afterward, it's certainly your prerogative to keep it up without worrying about the cause for that improvement. But if you don't have convincing evidence that that improvement was due to that thing you tried (because there's no way to control for all the other possible factors in your life at the time) or a verifiable explanation for *why* it worked for you, then you have no basis to judge whether it's likely to work for someone else, or whether there are conditions that might make it ineffective or dangerous. If you're just experimenting with yourself, that's fine, but if you're recommending that other people do things, it behooves you to look for evidence and explanations for their effectiveness, and to be as honest and open as possible about the lack of such evidence and explanations when they don't exist.BWF is great for smaller guys. You'll be putting less strain on your tendons and joints, so there is lesser risk of injury than for your larger counterparts (Like me 6'1, 175.) Obviously, weighing less means you have to apply less force in order to accomplish e.g. a pullup, so it should be easier for you to get your reps up in the various movements. Plus, being shorter gives you a big advantage once you get really strong and start trying for things like the Human Flag or other high-leverage tricks.

One downside that comes to my mind is that you will be disadvantaged when it comes to the gains possible using just squats. The advice to supplement your legs with deadlifts or something is probably more important in your case.Ya as far as obtaining the higher level progressions, you'll hit them all years before I even come close. If you're looking to bulk up though you'll have less natural weight to use.&gt; it'd be nice to have a scientific consensus on why certain types of stretching work really well

Or even *whether* they do. From what I've been able to find, there's little in the way of convincing evidence that PNF/CR stretching is any more effective than plain static stretching, and some that suggests positively that it's not (like [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21802037) finding the same effect from PNF stretching contracting either the target muscle or a completely unrelated one). It's tough to do good blinding in these sorts of things and there tends to be a lot of room for researcher and subject biases to creep in.I'm 6'5" and 210 lb. Accept is really hard, accept pull ups are going to be hard, accept dips are going to be hard. I struggle with L-sits, but like with anything; success comes from consistency.

Accept that you will be able to do it, and you'll be that much stronger than the average guy.Water bottles are the cheapest microloading in existence, I think :)

You could use buckets, just try to make the handles at least an inch thick with tape or old clothes or whatever.
The answer is clearly more bicep curls and then having 2 friends sit on your back. You are not helpful. I want to progress with my planche. If you arent going to take me seriously then please dont comment.Quality trolling. Hats off :)You are short and light. You have good self-leverage (probably). This means you can go ninja mode! Flips, jumps, cartwheels, anything that involves throwing yourself around will come easier to you than taller people. You will be limited in your raw strength when it comes to lifting and pushing, compared to larger people. 2/10 trollingBy standing on the edge of an elevated surface (in order to get the full range of motion -- all the way down and all the way up), I need to hold onto something for support. However, this also obviously takes some of the body weight load off of the calves.

For this reason, is it better to do calf raises on a flat surface (without support?)

Lastly, is T-Nation's article recommending us do 50 calf raises in one set altogether? And, does this article also recommend us doing these raises with the full range of motion (on the edge of an elevated surface?) or flat?

Thanks!Downside... he's short...

Edit: Why all the down votes? "Short people got, short people got, short people got no reason to live."

Edit Again: Lot of short people on this sub I guess... so sensitive. I was kidding.I'm fairly new as well, but I had the guys here on the sub critique my routine a bit. I've been lifting for a while five days a week, so my body can handle the additional microcycle volume. I do bodyline work and skill work five days a week. I do strength training 3 days a week and leg work/core work/conditioning the other two.

[[Here is my routine]](http://pastebin.com/aqu9nqvQ) If you want to take a look. The best advice I received was to stay focused on your goals. My goals are heavily skill based(planche, iron cross, HSPU, muscle-ups etc.) so, I had to take that into account when designing my strength routine. You should do the same.Well I have been weight training on and off for about 4 years now, I'm decently confident with my knowledge in that realm, but now that im trying to enter BWF and wanting to incorperate the two toghether is where im running into trouble. I was also thinking of push/pull, what would you do if you plan on doing push pull? (if you have time to write up a mock program that would be cool)Square cube law means that your strength:weight ratio will be higher than bigger people. Shorter arms means more mechanical advantage for certain moves, and less distance to travel.

For disadvantages, I can only think of the obvious things like lower lift numbers relative to bigger people, lower jump height if you are doing something like basketball or parkour, lower sprint speed, etc.Get rings instead...The owner won't let you hang a doorframe pullup bar?
How often are they around?  What does your lease say?
If you use towels on the door frames and don't try to kip, you won't do any damage to your door frames. (Assuming the molding is in good shape etc).How long should one hold a stretch for? Ive been doing nightly stretches, particularly for hamstring tightness, with 60 second holds but have made pretty slow progress. Is there any benefit/risk to holding longer than this? One of the trainers at my gym said that many gymnasts hold for 5-10 mins at a time.&gt; if you want to work chest you should do wide pushups or something

And I was SO on your side up until this.

OP, if you want to work your chest, do something harder.  One arm pushups.  Dips.  Handstand push-ups.  Whatever.  As long as you are doing something more difficult you will make gains.You're both short and light, so leverage based moves should be easier for you.  You also need to gain less muscle than tall guys in order to reach the same level of physique.

Can't think of any downsides.  Enjoy it.1. Wear pants on arms
2. Act like a silly cunt
3. ????
4. Profit!Dips hit the shoulders quite effectively, and pullups and rows will both work the rear delts well.

Don't worry bro, your shoulders are gonna be fine.  Just keep working the beginner routine.try it, and see if you like it.  a lot of people can't get results with foundation due to the strict gb style programming.tendons improve slower than muscles, so you can get to more advanced positions faster because there is less stress on them.  Bodyweight is proportional, so if you are looking for a high level of raw strength, you'll have less potential than someone who is taller/bigger.  You have to get pretty strong to get to that point tho.  Sorry to piggyback on your post but what is the Foundation program like?  Your discussion sounds like it's exactly what I've been looking for for the last several months.  Oh cool. I think I'm going to enjoy this. I've seen Pavel's name mentioned quite a bit around here but never actually read any of his books.I've seen a hit in the NFL knock a dude into the straddle splits.Man you guys are mindreaders - flexibility is on my hitlist for learning more. Hamstrings are holding back l-sits and straddle, and my shoulders get in the way of everything (e.g. unable to stab elbows for elbow lever)My husband said he looked up a video when he was younger and the guy just said to jump and tuck your legs to your chin or something along those lines. He did that and said he just ended up doing a back flip and it was pretty quick to learn. His was doesn't sound safe though. Naked Warrior is the book that coined the term "Grease the Groove"It seemed like a relevant but not revealing amount of info to me.. Most of the espoused benefits of massage is CAM, as it is a technique employed without backing evidence. [Massage is recognized in the US as alternative medicine](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/massage). This does not mean it does not work, it merely means that it is unfounded or unproven.  In fact [massage has a large number of studied benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage#Beneficial_Effects), but it is very difficult to prove these things, as that page points out.


However, [bodywork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodywork_%28alternative_medicine%29) employs quite a bit of garbage methodologies beyond massage, such as the Bates method of vision training that treats vision focus as if it were a muscle that you can train (this is false).I've seen knockout hits make people do some pretty impressive rag-doll postures...When I say bodywork I am referring to deep tissue massage. Is deep tissue massage "alternative medicine" to you too? I'm glad I'm not the only one! I'm on mobile and it's really sunny over here...that's my excuse :)Squats killed my uncle. #notevenone&gt; bodywork

This is also alternative medicine, FYI.


The distinction between alternative medicine and evidence based medicine is as follows:

* In evidence based medicine, you form a hypothesis, test things out, maybe test it on real subjects, and eventually conclude "this works".
* In alternative medicine, you form a hypothesis and conclude "this works".
Most likely.

The stretch reflex is fired by a mechanism that's roughly like a chinese finger trap. Much like pulling on a finger trap will make it squeeze enough to cause pain, stretching muscle fibers eventually reach a point to fire off a "omg cut it out" reflex to stop the stretch.

If you become conscious with the spindles all stretched out, I imagine they'd start firing off like crazy. In fact, they might even fire off when unconscious, it's just that your CNS cannot react to it - I dunno this level of anatomy too well.He decided fudging around on internet forums was too distracting from *real life*.Could you do weighted push-ups with a backpack and water bottles/books?
Also could you use buckets filled with water for curls and lateral raises?  I don't have access to a gym right now, and I guessed they'd be good for micro loading.Yes, please everyone note the distinct lack of scientific literature in this week's CW! I do believe this is one of those subjects in which it'd be nice to have a scientific consensus on why certain types of stretching work really well, but for the moment, practical experience tells us they do, so let's just rely on broscience for the moment. I probably should have made it a bit clearer that this wasn't 100% science.

I wouldn't even want to get into GTO... :X

&gt; The body recieves some form of sensory input about its position in space, motion, load, muscle lengths and is mediated to some degree by other stimuli (similar to pain) and then the body reacts by contracting skeletal muscle to some degree.

Is the wishy-washy version.You can further refine the weight increments, win winOh, I was wrong again! What happened to him?I know it is unpractical but what would happen as the subject gains consciousness and is unable to return to his usual ROM? Would the stretch reflex kick in immediately?Okay, things like this make me hate April 1st. I feel so confused and betrayed. Statics is something I will work on at the top. Also I should definitely look into a length of climbing rope.Do you have any links to these videos? I'd love to see this. Youtube?It's a bit irresponsible to try to teach a backflip or learn a backflip online. Find someone who knows how to both do a backflip and spot a backflip and then learn from them. You can learn it in a day with a good spotter.Jujimufu! Not sure how gymnasts would rate this, but this man was a big part of my youth. https://youtu.be/mZ8CRrFXzH4&gt; But the whole "fascial meridians" thing that Anatomy Trains talks about isn't really scientific either.

I find it hard to believe that all the [Fascial Dissection courses](http://www.anatomytrains.com/fascial-dissection-courses/) with cadavers that they put together to help you find how all the fascial lines flow are just bull shit. Maybe the "meridians" themselves aren't very important, but how they are all connected to each other ARE very interesting. Tom Myers stuff on bodywork is the best I've ever read for massage and understanding how things are connected. Maybe adhesions aren't the right word. But whatever word scientists do decide to call it, I'm not gonna be surprised.  It's like telling me that gua-sha (or the garston technique) is bull shit because researchers haven't been able to observe how it works. But what do I care *if it does work?* alright thanks.Ah, interesting, thanks for the feedback. I'll add that in and see how it treats me.Fair enough, that is just on the edge though. Find out if your weight lifting has done you any good and try to get your dips up, it should help for the L-sit.

Also Leg raises, but if you can do 8x3 full leg raises you should be fine in that department.I tried to do a backflip once...didn't end well.It is possible to lose weight and still gain strength. A large part of "noob gainz" is simply your CNS learning how to lift heavy things, not actual muscle gains.Injury.&gt; Now I don't know if it's fascial adhesions or what, but something is definitely becoming unstuck there.

You're likely just warming up the scapular muscles and improving their range of motion with the dynamic stretches. Were the concept of "fascial adhesions" real, you would expect the adhesions to go away and not return (or return to a significantly lesser extent due to lifestyle factors).

Additionally, moving a joint increases production of synovial fluid, which lubricates the joints and makes them easier to move.HAHAHA well, it's good to see the same old thing happening, I guess. Consistency :)

(sarcasm)Pretty upright, I'll have to make a video but my leg proportions make it pretty easy for me to stay fairly vertical.

Yea, I'm 6'1" or so, may be 6'1.5"But Mister Mod, surely everyone reads the sidebar before they post, this seems redundant /s.
&gt; Fascia isn't a made up thing.

It certainly isn't. But the whole "fascial meridians" thing that Anatomy Trains talks about isn't really scientific either. Nor are "fascial adhesions" a generally accepted concept.It's for Technique Thursday tomorrow. I have the write-up more or less finished.&gt; It should be noted that it's not clear at all whether "self-myofascial release" actually has some fascial release going on.

OMFG thank you. Not many people are aware that "self-myofascial release" is actually alternative medicine with zero evidence to support the sorts of things it claims.

Foam rolling definitely has benefits, but to say it's due to "reduction in myofascial adhesions" is a bit of woo. It likely works for the same reasons [all sorts of massages work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage#Beneficial_Effects). For this reason, I always use the term "self massage".

Robert Schleip (German Rolfer and Feldenkrais practioner, probably one of the few real "experts" on fascia, also the same one who taught Kit a lot about fascial training techniques iirc) says in a recent lecture that, from what we currently know, foam rolling is likely not that useful (or maybe more accurate: practical) as an actual fascial release technique. This is mainly because in order to promote an actual releasing effect of fascial adhesions, scar tissues the so-called "fluid shear" (pressing of fluids out of tissue, so that fresh fluids can enter afterwards) has to be slow as fuck! As slow as foam rolling 1 cm within a minute of consistent fluid motion, Schleip says that's almost impossible to do. From what I understand his message seems to be: try, but don't expect too much.

I'm by far not as educated in this topic as I'd like to be (so take this all with much salt), but from what I understand this is where Kit's advice comes from, to do long duration stretches of several minutes in order to emphasise on fascia, again "fluid shear" needs to occur very slowly.

[Schleip's introductory lecture on fascial training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STq3aE05CYQ) is quite informative, but sadly for most of you it's in German (no subtitles provided). IIRC he goes into foam rolling towards the end somewhere in the third part.A rule of thumb for maximal lean muscularity is: **length in cm - 100 = BW in kg**

According to this it would be around 98 kg / 215 lbs. Please note though that this yardstick is skewed towards _maximal_ leanness level, and may be a bit overkill to aim for, unless you're into natural bodybuilding. For the _athletic physique_ you asked for you can afford to carry more fat.

It's just a rule of thumb but it's a pointer at least... You are right, its not true circuit training. But moving from one set to another with a break of however long it takes you to do some of the mobility stuff is pretty close.

EDIT: metabolic conditioning would be a better wordperhaps I should find out how much I could currently do, but I'm assuming 3X8 for both.You're probs right, but people on here are making much faster progress for a fraction of the cost of the foundation series which makes me doubt the programming.I found this one interesting, but haven't yet visited a facility with this sort of equipment for putting it to the test
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRmhf4AV0VkHow many full leg raises could you do? And how many dips?Because it isn't.

Straight from Foundation Courses:
&gt;Train only one exercise at a time; do not utilize giant sets.  Alright, got it, thanks!Putting strength and mobility on the same level is very important for beginners who tend to overly focus on strength. Since Foundation is meant to not be maximum effort and is focused on conditioning the body for more advanced work you shouldn't need breaks. So replacing rest with mobility stuff makes them better for beginners?

Granted mobility is important, by why replace something which is equally important for getting stronger.

Hmm, looking forward to that video though. I am hoping for a lot of shoulder flexion/extension work commentary. Will the video have a release date on youtube? Or will it have to wait for the website?I've actually been meaning to ask. How upright are you when you front squat? We're about the same height I think, I'm 6.3 and 216lbs and I need crazy ankle dorsiflexion if I have to be completely upright. I do realize maybe we have different proportions etc. but still.

I had some of of my posterior lateral meniscus removed and the knee has bothered me since, it sucks. Patience is key I guess as that stuff can take years. It's not like im trying to compete in weightlifting anyway. I can focus on building a giant posterior chain instead, yay.I have no doubt of the quality and I am really excited about the content. I think it would be something similar to what GMB just released lately.

Every comment complaining about the delay is being deleted so surely people will forget :DYou need a horizontal pull still, you can use a table or a stick across a couple of dining chairs to do inverted rows.  At that point you'll almost be doing the recommended routine from the sidebar anyway, so you may as well do that.  You can keep your skull crushers and curls and just add them at the very end if you feel like.

edit: you could also hang a couple towels or a sheet or something from your pullup bar and do rows with thatto be honest I replaced both with machine exercises and squats.I already have read the FAQ I wasn't sure if there were other things people found that worked better......Coach Sommer has repeatedly said that the information in Building the Gymnastic Bodies and the old forum WoDs are not appropriate for beginners. I can't, but most of our initial design roadblocks are out of the way. I actually just realized that I'm a week behind on getting a bunch of the .gifs together!

This has been a busy phase. Once I shoot the Skin the Cat video later this evening, I'll have to start getting on that.Rule 1.WIth the knee stuff you just have to take your time. I did 3 of the best front squats I've ever done in my life yesterday, not sure what happened. They were literally perfect. The next 4-5 sets were good, but not at that level. All I can do is keep focusing on technique hahaha... it seems to be paying off!

The split squats are good at any weight, but I think what you're doing is fine. I might also look for feeling the quads working in concert with the glutes, because that's a huge part of knee stability. This is what has been a big part of helping me with my front squats.

I generally just stop at parallel, but this last time I just hit the full range after about a month of hitting parallel only, which I didn't think I'd be able to do.

I think that sticking with the parallel squats has been helping my knee a lot.But... Can you give us an official deadline to when the website will be available to the general public?As for Sommer's movement stuff, I think it's going to be pretty good. When it comes to teaching gymnastic techniques, particularly the dynamic stuff, he's really in his element and I expect that he's going to have some pretty high quality instruction there.

I could be wrong, but he's really intent on doing things right. He knows that a year after the release people will have forgotten all about the year of delay.HAHAHA we can meme it up all we like :) I don't mind.

What's coming will be very good, and I intend to make it an intensely community driven place while having a very clear official section as well.That's totally true, and I appreciate you accepting my apology.

A lot of the biochemical pathways are understood pretty well, in terms of energy metabolism and all that, but there are always new things being discovered that make us re-think or re-orient our understanding of what we currently know. At this point we aren't turning much upside down, but we do end up understanding new nuances that substantially refine our ability to get a particular result or understand why things are as they are.

It's not as incomplete as it seems, but the road to getting a really good understanding is pretty long and involved. It can't be done in just a year.

A point that I would clarify here is that for the most part science doesn't prove things... it disproves things and supports things. The more we are unable to disprove something that has been supported so far, and the more support these ideas have based on cumulative experiments, the more it is taken as being close to the truth, or simple "the truth."

The beauty of science is that it can change everything we currently believe if there is enough evidence that can be replicated by multiple different teams. It is truly evidence-based.

The bad thing about a lot of scientific experimentation is that there are a lot of studies that get published that are honestly not great research. There are studies where methods aren't clearly outlined, the conclusions aren't actually supported by the data when you really look into it, biases clearly come into play along with conflicts of interest, etc.

Then there are all the "conference papers" that people end up quoting. Those things often have no peer review at all, beyond a cursory glance. They should pretty much be ignored in terms of being used to support an argument, unless they happen to heavily reference high quality research and correctly use the information to make a point that is supported by the references, while not asserting anything that has not been supported as being solid.

It's a mess, and takes a lot of personal time to navigate. That's why listening to people like Alan Aragon, Brad Schoenfeld, Jose Antonio, etc. is really essential to keeping oneself on a really solid understanding.

Those guys are quality scientists, and they do a very good job of helping people understand what's going on. In my opinion, they should be on everyone's reading list (everyone who wants to know more about all of this stuff).

Alright, great, thanks a lot!All of these items are just estimates.  Over time, depending on your goals and where you started, you generally want to see your waist get smaller and your weight either stay the same or possibly increase.

These calculators are very sensitive to the waist measurement.  Play around with it and see what changing your waist just a 1/2 inch or so does to your BF% &amp; LBM when you keep you weight constant.

Also, many people do not lose fat equally from their waist during a cut, see here for tracking recomendations:

http://rippedbody.jp/diet-progress-tracking/Only do this when you're totally warmed up with both dislocates and GHangs, but basically, when you're in the GH, keep turning your palms out to the sides.  You'll eventually do a dislocate.  Think of it as a negative inlocate.  Make sense?  Sommer is definitely right that you have to continue increasing the resistance on the weighted dislocates as the bread and butter exercise though.Any decent exercise physiology textbook should cover the "muscle confusion" subject fairly well, as well as neuromuscular function. Lieber's "Skeletal Muscle Function, Structure, and Plasticity" is a good second-level book for after you've read the introductory stuff.

Some of it you simply have to think about practically, like the switching exercises thing, but once you understand what's happening at the individual muscle level quite well you are much more capable of seeing the next level.

For the more applied stuff, reading the CSCS manual and the Corrective Exercise Specialist manual from NASM can really help to speed up your understanding, but they are written for people with 4 year degrees in exercise science, especially the CSCS.

All you really need to understand most (if not all) of the material in them is an introductory book and Lieber's book, read in that order.[Andreas Aguilar had a pretty sweet butterfly pull too](https://youtu.be/2q8KMnWUsvg)Get used to RTO Plank on the rings and do Incline Push Ups on the rings.&gt;[Foundation is effectively glorified circuit training

Absolutely. If you have a thick Gymnastic mattress just do a running start and jump forward. If you have enough jumping power in your legs doing a forward flip can be done very quickly. Then it's a matter of reducing the running start step by step and trying to do the flip more "economic".

At this point looking at tutorials online can be very helpful. Basically with a forward flip there are two basic technique and they both involve what you do with your hands, one, the most common one throws the hands in front of you Superman style, while the other style shoots the elbows up behind you as you jump.

But at that point you are already jumping and working on technique alone is doable.

All in all the backflip is physically easier, because you don't need to go as much around, after all you can always raise your legs to catch yourself, while the front flip requires rotating all the way around your back before landing.

But the issue here is technique, and fear, which is a much bigger part of learning it then the initial power jumping requirements.

Sorry If I'm rambling here, I have taught these techniques to others many many times before, but never in English. :-)    Yeah the backpack will be fine for curls, it's pretty much all you've got right now.

If you can't do rows, I would suggest learning knees to elbows and eventually tuck front lever rows.  Its pretty important to get some horizontal pulling in there.

So if you're going to be doing 6 different exercises, I would suggest pairing them differently.  Like, have pullups and dips as the first pair, have knees to elbows and pushups as the second pair and have skull crushers and curls as the third pair.  This is just to allow you to get the most productive work done.  If you tire yourself out with curls before you go to do pullups, you won't be able to do as many pullups.  If you tire yourself out with pullups, you'll probably still be able to do as many curls.Alright, thanks a lot! So, do you suggest that I do something like: combine pull ups and push ups, then a couple of the skullcrushers and dips and then finish it with backpack curls (that sounds awful) and L-sit progression? I plan on doing 3x6 each for now and I will alternate between the two exercises in each couple - a set of pull ups, then a set of push ups and then pull ups again until I'm done.Could I use the backpack as a bicep curl? Also, I do my dips on a sofa-thingy (I know, I know, I only have a pull up bar and that's all) so I can't really do rows.&gt; Foundation is effectively glorified circuit training, I have no doubt it will get user what they want albeit at a much slower pace.

hahaha, oh manIs a forward flip more achievable alone? Maybe use a resistance band to hold it in place but allow the limb to go back if needed.You sound awfully familiar to.. [Andreo Spina?](https://www.facebook.com/FunctionalAnatomySeminars/posts/875158209213062) :-PIt took me 5 months to get a full L-sit, shit takes time and dedication.so you have 3 pushing exercises and one pulling exercise.  I would suggest at the very least you do some curls to go with those skull crushers.

Also, if whatever you're doing dips on has an option for you to get underneath it, do some rows as well.Sometimes static progression can be achieved with Dynamic movements. How are your Leg raises and your Dips going?This is very difficult to learn alone.

Personally I would do box jumps on ever higher boxers, then seek out a gymnastics class, or something similar. (Breakdance, Capoeira, tricking, Parkour.)

The problem with the backflip is that it's backwards, which goes against our natural instincts. This causes us to do reactionary errors that are hard to spot and near impossible to correct alone. It's one of those moves where the error is going to be at the end of the movement, but the actual problem in the very beginning.Of course fascia is a real thing, obviously. I was asking about 'myofascial release' techniques, not questioning the existence of fascia.

Thanks for the book recommendation. Looks like my library has it, off I go.

Edit: library didn't have it after all, boo. However I did find this book, which looks awesome and hilarious: [The Naked Warrior](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51i-nG%2BcdwL.jpg). Will report back with a full review.No worries.

Some people like to do this sorta marching exercise where they hold the top position of a glute bridge and switch which leg they're standing on.  Doing something like that should let you get a good feel for whether you can maintain a decent end ROM one one leg as opposed to two.

Another good one is the reverse plank or even better the 'table' as I know it.  If you have any piking of the hips going on then you aren't quite there yet in terms of either strength or active mobility.

Edit: if you're having trouble visualising it, notice the bodyline of [this person](http://www.yogaartandscience.com/poses/backext/purvatop/purvatop.html)

Further edit: actually, they aren't *quite* there either.  Need to work on your glute strength yoga dude!1: Your backback thingy sounds most like a lying triceps extension or skullcrusher. Look them up on exrx or another resource to see which looks more similar to the movement you are actually doing.

2: What you are doing sounds like circuit training, although it doesn't seem to have a clear purpose for being in a circuit.  It also kinda depends on how you are resting.  Some routines (such as the beginner routine on this subreddit) have exercises grouped somewhat by opposite movements (so chinups and dips are grouped and performed in an alternating fashion, then pushups and rows, etc).  This allows the muscles used in one movement to rest while the other movement is being performed.  This allows local muscular fatigue to be alleviated with less total downtime in the routine.  The downside to doing it this way is full-body energy systems (basically the aerobic system) do not get the benefit of as much rest.  This is usually not a problem in a strength-focused routine, since the aerobic system is not often a limiter, especially for upper body exercise. To contrast, many free-weight routines call for doing all of one exercise at a time (3 sets of bench, then 3 sets of rows, etc) , at least for the big compounds, so that you are maximally rested for each set.  Accessory and isolation exercises are then sometimes done in a grouped fashion to save time.

Anecdotal evidence: dislocates.

I find when I do dislocates the first couple sets feel pretty gummed up but after I warm up thoroughly I'm getting a smooth 'gliding' feeling as my scapula become free to slide around on the surface of my ribcage.  Now I don't know if it's fascial adhesions or what, but something is definitely becoming unstuck there.

Note that this doesn't feel like I can stretch a muscle further.  It literally feels like some kind of friction has been removed.Thank youThere's no reason you can't work mobility every day, but especially with active mobility, loaded mobility or contract-relax stretching you're going to be putting your muscles under some strain which will necessitate recovery.

I would recommend you do easier, low intensity mobility exercises every day and then focus on more intense ones during your regular training.  For example doing a set or two of unweighted dislocates every day, and then a proper 5x5 weighted dislocates during an actual workout.Read Tom Myers Anatomy Trains. Fascia isn't a made up thing.I'm not a doctor, but if you sign a waiver I'll do it for you.Dude as long as you keep getting better at your progressions you can tell the LBM to go fuck itself.

As long as you keep getting stronger your body composition *has* to change for the better.  Thst's the beauty of training directly with proportional strength.&gt;Once you are bearing the whole weight of your body in or on you hands (e.g dips and pullups) you can't add any more load unless you double the load by using one hand. And then you can't add any more load, more difficult exercises just require more balance or technique.

You can easily add weight to dips and pullups with a backpack or weight vestAs phi said do plank holds, or try it from your knees.

Rings have a really steep learning curve.  You'll get over this in a couple workouts.It's not ideal. But should work.

Bonus: use less and less of your hand on top of the bar as time goes on.  Build up that grip strength.what if our snickers bars are only 55g :&lt;Don't forget instantly tooGreat write up, thanks!

I'm working hard to improve my shoulder mobility, which is limited since playing ultimate frisbee in college and never doing rehab when I had small (non-operated on) strains/tears in one or more of my rotator cuff muscles.

I am working on deep squats, and I do a lot of wall extensions, lat stretching, hanging, and also some things from mobility wod. I am noticing some improvements, but it's slow going. I'm actually thinking of scaling back my strength work and focusing more on mobility. Of course ideally I'd do both, but I don't think I have the time.

**So the question I'm pondering is:** Given my goals are handstand and the lever progressions and shoulder mobility, would it be better to do only 1-2 days a week of strength training and spend the other days on skills and on mobility? Shoulder mobility is definitely a big limiting factor in my handstands, and that mobility is something that overall I value more highly than being able to do muscle-ups. Or is it bad to work on mobility 5-6 days a week? Do my joints need a break from it?It wouldn't exactly be static, but it might appear that way from the outside.  It would really be a hard push to get those last few millimetres.

But yeah, it would help.I have begun that process I don't do isolation exercises anymore pretty much just Olympic liftsIs your username the golden ratio haha that's awesome. But yes I did read the article I just wanted to get some opinions on the recovery factor.I only skimmed over it, from what I've seen on this subreddit people have achieved the end goals much faster using programming described in the FAQ. Foundation is effectively glorified circuit training, I have no doubt it will get user what they want albeit at a much slower pace. I will see how my friend gets on.Isn't that's what cardio/GPP + Prehab work is for?

EDIT: I read your comment completely wrongGosh cant wait for April 1st to be over. Ya'll are starting to annoy me with this bullshit.Getting paid to deload is my favorite BWF exercise.One arm static holds for time and no legs rope climbing is something I'd recommend.Yes however i also use my bf% to calculate my lean body mass and it is that which has been declining.Try doing negatives until you get better.Honestly, your best bet would be to go to an open gymnastics gym.

I learned how to tuck on a trampoline first, then off of a running tramp, then on a springboard, until finally I could do one on a basketball court or concrete.

It's easier to learn the movements when you've worked on them with extra bounce.I once linked the poliquin ones to you at some point I think, here on this subforum, dunno if it was me. I can't do those because full knee compression hurts a lot:/ Can only go to about 90 degress which is what split squats get me, therefore I cannot squat anymore either. Strangely enough I can make the pain go away temporarily if I hit a single leg dog pose stretch hard for 1,5 min. - But anatomy wise I simply cannot figure out why...

I do them with a barbell on the back(should I use dumbells?), but currently I only use 40kg. for 4x10, im really trying to work on glute activation etc. before moving up in weight. It's not that tough for me, I used to front squat around 120kg for 8 reps, so my leg muscles are not really challenged, it's more a mather of activation really, I'm looking forward to your video. me too. im always positively surprised when i do them on small rounded ones though. seems gripstrength may be a problem for me at the moment, but i want to work on that anywaysPersonally i recommend getting a trampoline and practising on there first. then get a gymnastics coach or freerunning/parkour/tricker buddy to spot you on a crashmat then on grass. Worked for me and other "progressions" often don;t really help IMHO with something such as this. For example the link /u/sdonn613 provided starts with a trick which i personally cannot do yet i am amble to do a backflip. Infact i know alot of people who can't do it but can flip.Thanks for your reply, where can I read more into what you have told me? I can't wait ! I hope to spend some time thereSomething that might help is trying some plank holds on rings to get a feel for the top position. Also make sure to keep the rings close to your body.Rule 2 territory.haha, ohh.  sorry for that then.  yes, this is all a very sarcastic post.  Agreed.Fuck off, curls in the smith machine on a bosu.Rule 3.Well actually this was a serious question since im new in bodyweight fitness.I accept your apology.  Science .for the most part is not exact and we see many findings change when other things come into play.  I like your comment about "incomplete science"..as that is exactly what most science is anyway. Things that were proven last year have been unproven this year. Every seemingly impossible project is a series of usually improbable events that only look logical after the fact.  When you see how it all comes together you'll say - of course it had to be that way.  I think you forgot to link the videoMy favorite thing about body weight fitness over weights is that i can get in workouts outside of the gym. Then i dont have to deal with insecure meat head assholes like you.I am really in the same boat as you.

I am doing negatives now because I have lost too much strength post rotator cuff tendinitis aggravated by volleyball smashes. Then I dabbled too long in basic F1 type rows building endurance which really stalled progress. Now my chest is tight, but I can train pull ups well.

Summer is upon us soon and I hope to train outdoors soon so pull up training will definitively be prioritized over rows

How is your website going? I have a bad feeling that the delay is about to turn into a meme for some guys on here, just like Sommer's M1 which is 1 year delayed. No offence meant, just joking.

Thank you for your reply.I don't know about anyone else but I really like the pay per rep weights scheme. Weight gets heavier the more money you put into the slot on the side. Weight may or may not be evenly distributed.Please let me know how this video made an impact in you. It is a pleasure for me to share this on reddit and I am hoping to hear your opinions, advices, and much-appreciated love.When you start out with a link post, and then add a comment, your link gets erased, and it gets treated as a text post with no link. You need to post the link, then add any comment you want after you post.That's fair. It's pretty wild to watch videos of people under anesthesia that have locked shoulders obtain full ROM.**First strength circuit:**

1 set of 5-8 wall push-ups
REST FOR 90 sec
1 set of 5-8 vertical row
Rest for 90 sec

Repeat 2 more times.

**Second strength circuit:**

1 set of 5-8 pull ups
REST FOR 90 sec
1 set of 5-8 dips
Rest for 90 sec

Repeat 2 more times.

**Third strength circuit:**

1 set of 5-8 squats
REST FOR 90 sec
1 set of 10-30 sec L-sit
Rest for 90 sec

Repeat 2 more times.

The exercise that you perform (or the level that you select) should be the first one for each progression if you are just starting out. If you can do 3 sets of 8 reps of a particular exercise then move up to the next one in that progression on your next workout.

For example, if you completed 3 sets of 8 reps for wall push-ups when doing the first paired exercise set, then on your next workout you would try doing incline push-ups in place of the wall variation you did previously. I find it more productive to deload at work. ah, that explains it. I just got them secondhand from a friendI'm only midway through my morning coffee, but this looks like you just got fatter.  More weight with a bigger waistline means you gained fat and maybe some muscle.

Edit:  finished my coffee and reread your response. If you are back to 70kg and still have an 85cm waist then yes it may be that you lost some muscle. These bf% tools are estimates so I wouldn't get so hung up on it. Make sure your intake is in check and keep doing work. Get more data points. My weight spiked to 74kg from 70kg during a skiingtrip and so did my waist from 80cm to 85cm. Ive been trying to slowly lose weight so that I end up on 70kg again. Im meaasuring right over my belly button and having the tape parallel to the ground.I've been doing them in a squared bar for 4 months with no problemsNah, go to your local quarry at night with a flashlight and bolt cutters. You can pick your own, they totally won't mind.I really, really like split squats. There are a lot of ways to use them, and I'll be making some more in-depth videos for that soon.

The bodyweight recommendation is what Mike Boyle recommends, and I do agree that this is really an important milestone to hit before moving on to bulgarian split squats. you don't HAVE to, but doing so helps keep you from relying on the back leg once you make the switch.

The biggest advantage from a muscular balancing perspective is that split squats require a lot, and I mean a lot, more hip stabilizer activity. All those lateral hip muscles and rotators work a lot more than in normal bilateral squat variations, and you can tell. This plays into your ability to maintain your balance, but also helps keep you from developing glute medius issues. At the very least, I think they should be in warm ups.

There is a variety I was introduced to by someone not that long ago, which I believe is heavily taught in the Poliquin seminars, and it has definitely become one of my go-to exercises for front squat warm ups. I'll be getting into that as well.Rows aren't strictly needed. In a perfect world I'd do both, but many of us can't do that.

I can't do weighted pull ups for any meaningful volume yet, as the aggravate my right elbow flexors, so I do lots of rows to get the majority of the same musculature.

If I were to choose one, I'd choose weighted pull ups. I think they are a more complete exercise for the back musculature as a whole, and if I could I would be doing a lot more of them.

Anyhow, looking at it now you have a pretty good basic program that should set you up fairly well for the skill work you want to be able to do. What's the trend been in your weight and waist?  What point on your body are you measuring your waist?I tried dude, I really did.I have this one saved for when I actually have the time to start learning

Jogging is the original ShakeWeight!A superior resource would be hands-on training from a certified gymnastics instructor.The best part is they're free! Just walk into your local gym, find the weights you like and leave with them!Yupppp!What's important is getting your work capacity and mobility to match your strength.

The end goal is for Foundation to become your warm up for ring training.Did you guys read the intro stuff? If you can do the week 11 reps and sets for the strength and mobility work with no rest you can skip the element. So just spend a week or 2 testing through elements until you get to where you find a weak point and start from there.

Also don't be surprised if that weak point is a mobility element before it is a strength element. I'd like to ask something, since we are talking about the Pistols,

I'm able to do 3 Pistols with my left leg, but not a single with my right one.
It's not a problem for me, since I do shrimps to train my legs. The pistols are merely a little extra when I'm playing around.
I tend to push myself up with my hand when doing the weak leg pistols. Just to get the full (assisted) ROM. The weak point goes from dead position till ~ 90 (a little under). Is it ok to do so? I want to gain muscle and loose fat. I found a rec center with reasonable prices so maybe I'll go with a weightlifting program.Yeah I don't like to fuck around with programs but taking a year and a half to get up to 5x5 dips seems a bit over the top. My mate can already knock out sets of ring dips for reps.I do both.  I usually have workouts dedicated to one or the other.  My base routine is an hour of lifting every weekday, at least 4 hours of gymnastics throughout the week, and additional activity (tennis, raquetball, parkour, yoga, high-ropes) depending on conditions (weather, if friends are free, how tired I feel).  Some weeks I'll go heavier on the bodyweight and some weeks I'll go heavier on weights.  It usually depends on whether I'm trying to build strength/muscle or master a skill at a given time.  Just balance them however you think is best to meet your personal goals.If you are going to do the Foundation program you should at least try it with the reps and rest amount (none) that the Foundation program has listed. just a heads up-- when you are referring to a user and not a subreddit, use /u/ instead of /r/If the device allowed for motion, I would think that the legs would drift back to a more natural position.  If the device did not allow for any movement, my theory is that the muscles would immediately start to contract, probably giving the feeling of the worst ever cramp, and there is the potential for muscle damage as well.  I wouldn't volunteer for this study.I'm fairly new to being able to do unassisted pistols, but I still find them easier using a weight or medicine ball held out in front of me as it acts as a counterbalance.

I also stand one legged on each leg for a few seconds, leg slightly bent before trying them the first time to just get my brain aware of the balance.Do you reckon adding weighted static holds at the point would help?Try climbing/ holding yourself up on a HIGHER box.  Letting one foot dangle makes it easier for the brain to get the positioning right.

 lighten up, its almost friday :)To achieve this goal in life merrily is but a dream.Keep on tryin it, man. That's all you can do.  You'll get it in no time, I  promise. Namaste!!!weight vest?Oh yeah it's april firstI have been wanting to try this exact thing to see if could be used as a method of training flexibility.  I don't think I can find a doctor willing to do this once, let alone repeatedly.  I also wonder if this could be done with local anesthesia.
Adding to that i think the hypertrophy range is 8-12, while strength is 4-6Better at what?

Creating muscle mass?  Yes.
Creating the ability to lift heavy weights in specific ways?  Certainly.
Practicing for Olympic power lifting?  Without a doubt.

Free weight lifting is a great thing to do if those things (and others) are your goals.  I also don't think you have to choose one over the other.

But to say free weights will always be better is ludicrous.  Why are the climbers, gymnasts, grapplers, etc. (people who do cool physical stuff!) overwhelmingly including vast amounts of body weight training into their regimen?  Is it because they are stupid?

PS.  Your trolling today is graded A+.  ;-)Really looking forward to reading this series. As always, very well written.

I'm still trying to somehow structure my stretching/limbering routine. For now, I've been with Kit's material, trying to find what's right to me currently and getting acquainted with all of the exercises.

I try to do limbering exercises along with MM every day so I don't undo any progress I've made in previous sessions.

After every strength training routine I'll do actual stretching which mostly includes isometric stretching, doing the contractions Kit suggests for every exercise. At the moment I'm still not using all of my force to contract, but I'm building up to that.

No fascia release or foam rolling at all for now.

I've also been following /u/ReverendBizzare's advice, he's been helping me out whenever I have any dumb questions. I think his and /u/AmazingEmmet's input on this series would be nice to have in the comments every now and then!

Edit: I'm dumbThat's why people wear headphones and listen to music while jogging.  If I'm working shoulders, I work In push ups and pull ups. I learned that push, pull and weights is a great combo to make sure I hit all those small muscles. I use a push up app called xfit push ups by lolo, they vary ups the push ups and progresses day by day. Pull ups I just vary myself. Then for legs I mix in a lot of box jumps, hiit with some sled pushing. Squats with weight. I made sure I had proper form first before worrying about weight. I'm inly at 150 squat at the moment but little by little working my way up. Hmmm if you have any more questions let me know. This is all I could think of as I typed this out. i mean, you could throw your body on the floor too.deloading as I'm writing thisI completely disagree. If you look at the isomorphic hypertension loading graphs when doing bodyweight exercises you'll find the whey build up is maximised through casein pathways not present when doing free weight exercises. I have a degree on Gainz from Wheybro University so I know what I'm talking about.Ah, chicken chicken, chick chicken?Ohhhh.... I was thinking that /r/fitness was being very out-of-character and kinda mean... didn't check the sub lol.

First time I've been gotten today, you earn one internet point.Can I pick all three?

Kidding aside, strength is the main goal. I'm doing this as a compliment to my climbing.Sounds wise, will do that. Thanks!That paper is certainly changing my mind on a few things.What about the benefits of weighted clothing, like the new Titin weighted compression set?I can't support this, you have not provided any statistics or research papers proving this.CHRIST I just got so angry for like the last minute.

The links were eye opening, thanks! Anyone wanna buy my rings?I feel like the supplements I get from GNC do enough on their own. "A good example is that when you're unconscious, you can probably do the splits..."

You should probably change this to say, "A good example is that when you're under general anesthesia, you can probably do the splits..."You forgot to mention that a body free of toxins and radicals is able to convert fat *directly* to muscle.Once you can deadlift 2x your bodyweight you're one step closer to becoming a sayain...just saiyanI'm disappointed to see such bro science being posted here.  Jogging?  Jogging causes muscle tears too and can lead to injury. The best advice to bulk up is to sit on the couch and browse reddit.  I just had a big deload this morning after coffee.It should be noted that it's not clear at all whether "self-myofascial release" actually has some fascial release going on. Personally I'm not convinced since if that were the case, the effects would be more permanent. However, foam rolling tends to only give relieve for periods up to a day.
Note I'm not debating the efficacy of foam rolling for short-term movement fixing. It works, absolutely. I use it myself. However, I'm fairly convinced that the mechanism that gets the muscles to relax is not myofascial release, but rather something neurological. Just like stretching.

I don't know why I didn't believe you and checked it in classRule 1.Do as Antranik suggests; leaning a little less to be able to bang out at least 3 x 3 reps without more than 1-2 min. of rest.&gt; EDIT: It's starting to clear now, weren't you the same mod who imitated coach Sommer last year?

RIP /u/SodomizingMexican :'(Or judo.Target.Yes, the science is irrefutable.I'm so glad I clicked the links before I furiously typed out my rebuttal.Think that is just for free weights?

You have obviously never seen me bale in a handstand...Good form is important for both BWF and weight lifting.  Machines can lead to bad form.  You should consider using free weights rather than machines.   Or add weight to your BWF routine; weighted pull ups, weighted dips, weighted hanging leg raises, etc.augh why. back to strobe crossfit.m092 you are misguided, you can micro load the body in small increments to. Simply ingest snickers bars (100g) til you reach the required increment. Deloading is simpler where you removed pieces of you legs, lets face it legs are just in the way in regards to BWF anyway.the hilarious thing is that my dad recently bought one of those- and he used to lift free weights and follow some sort of bodybuilding program when he was younger.That's the best you got? Are you even trying?thats so nasty ..that gif made my day, m092's nearly unmade itCan I just sleep through today?shhh dont spoil it! Weights are born free but everywhere are in chain stores.Ow. One fleck of chipped chrome...Sorry, thank you :')&gt;Fuck Free Weights!

Functional Strength is better than everything! [SOURCE](http://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/images/314x314px-LL-375a6e39_TooBO.gif)
Fuck Free Weights!I couldn't get your links to work properly (just glitching out with images) but I have read [this paper](https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf) which goes fairly in-depth comparing freeweights, machines and bodyweight, as well as a very thorough and informative section about nutrition.I've never thought about it like that before.

Peace out, may your toxins and free radicals dissipate forever!Thats good to know im not alone.Can you please share a brief breakdown of your program? I am really unhappy with the decrease in my functional strength, since starting to lift. Actually, you're just feeling better because you're now carrying the weight of the juice around. Even liquid free weights are better than bodyweight training.I've found great success in ceasing working out altogether.

Instead, I started a juice cleanse about 3 hours ago. I immediately noticed that my body was shedding toxins and free radicals.

That's all I need to be healthy and fit. "If you wanna get really good at moving fast for an hour, then crossfit's your thing" -- sounds' cool. Start literally holding it until you cant no more and just drop. As every second passes just focus on getting to the next. With something like Lsits you really have to hold it as long as possible to see progressWhats your take on split squats? I've read somewhere that you recommended the regular once (up to bodyweight used?), and I'm doing them on all my lower days atm, I find both bulgarian and regular split squat to be a must that lets your work on balance components that bilateral movements dont accomplish?I can't ever find free weights, the people at the store always tell me I have to pay for them. Will I be a manlet forever?Yes, which is why gyms play loud music.What are you goals? Are you trying to be a bodyweight fitness guy, or are you just trying to gain muscle lose fat? Someone your size could take advantage of it and look into powerlifting/strongman. But it all depends on what you want to do.I'm new to BWF so I have no idea if this is a good Idea or not so I'll look to others to correct me if this is totally wrong. But I was doing L sits in a shallow area of a pool to assist with taking the weight. With the eventual idea to move gradually to shallower water.[Crossfit Coach made me lose my gainz](http://i.imgur.com/DVj8KGP.jpg)He's referring to an ancient strength training method where trainees would lift larger and larger keys.

This said, I'm still early in my BWF journey myself, and even I'm considering different two-part splits. Either push/pull, upper/lower, or low rep/high rep.Look at the calender. &gt;objectively wrong

You're trolling now aren't you?

EDIT: It's starting to clear now, weren't you the same mod who imitated coach Sommer last year?

EDIT2: I clicked the link and looked at the calenderI agree but...

&gt; Our goal is to do cool stuff though, so isn't bodyweight a good choice?
Fuck no, deadlifts and overhead presses are cooler. End of story. Full stop.

No thanks, I'll take deadlifts and squats for my lower body and planche, levers and weighted pullups/dips for my upper body. I don't find curls very 'cool'.

EDIT2: I clicked the linkThe guy apparently can't handle April fool's day on reddit so he decided to be a sarcastic arse about it. I dunno. What did they say? Sucks when people delete comments.Volume is key as in, the more volume the better, right?It's not about the goal, it's about the adventure that gets you there merrily, merrily, merrily.Not only does cardio kill gains... it kills dreams.

Thanks based mod.I would say that your goal is going to have to remain a dream.I would prefer to gently row my boat down the local stream.Vigorously? Or Gently?How many times bodyweight do I need to row before I can row an entire boat?Woops, I meant to write pull ups instead of push ups. Editing it now. How does that change the balance? Is rowing work for strength strictly needed?

When my pull ups have improved I plan on adding 1-2 sets of FL hangs (the progression according to my level, varying) as skill work. Deadlifts must count some too.Volume is key.

The study is very informative, thank you for bringing it to our attention.Change up the order and switch between normal order and alternate order for each workout. Soldier on, you'll get through it eventuallySorry, but this is bullshit. The best way to gain muscle is to go jogging. The vibrations of the movement will cause tears in the muscles and bones that create strength gains.

Here's a paper explaining why.
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/rooter.pdfFrom a physics point of view:
Strength = force * gravity
(force being in Newtons, multiplied by 9.81 for gravity = weight in kg)
Power = force / time
Since power is showing strength over time to overcome equilibrium, the amount of time you spend moving that force is how much power you put into it (measured in kcal for human activity). So if you can move bigger force in shorter time, then that means you are more powerful than someone who can move a smaller force over a longer period of time.Squats and deadlifts?! Haven't your gym owner told you they're super dangerous!?  [This machine is your new best friend son](https://adidashardware.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/h/o/home_gym_site.jpg). Oh, he knew. He's just a dick.Soooo much WOOSH... in there!
Smith machines are so cool. It really puts the adrenaline in you when you know that if you fail your bench, there is no getting it off you. You just die. Real badass.why so low reps on DL and squat? I go for 20 - 30 so I get toned and not too bulky. Plus, 20 DL in a row is *really* *really* fun.Bonus for being tall is, once you manage the moves, you are gonna be really strong because of the harder leverage!You don't *have* to find it funny. Can you not give people that *one* day of the year? So much for mindful kindness.Try and relax by doing some breathing exercises. Might help you during your workouts as well.Generally a light jog is okay a couple times a week on your off days, but cardio isn't strictly speaking necessary.This is a good question that needs to be answered.Personally I've found a vegan diet can be incredibly useful as far as losing weight and maintaining or increasing muscle mass goes.  I thoroughly recommend you at least try it for a month to see if you can stomach it or not.

Edit: as far as basic nutrients goes, as long as you eat a lot of leafy green stuff, beans and nuts you'll be fine.  You might miss out on b-12 and omega 3's, but it's pretty easy to supplement those and/or eat some liver once in a while.I do this to get better at the balancing and flexibility aspect of this exercise. Strength wise I can do it concentric, but the balance is sometimes way off. So I do the negatives as controlled as possible without looking for the time. Dude, shit like L-sits are just incredibly hard at 6'5". I'm the same height. I'll bet you can't planche either, or front of back lever, or elbow lever off the ground, or human flag. All that stuff is way, way harder when you're taller, because the leverage is terrible.

If you want to get better at it, definitely drop any extra fat you have and it'll help a lot, but even an L-sit at out height is asking a lot, to say nothing of further progressions.Which is what you're supposed to do in the first place!Rule 1.Rule 1.Rule 1.Rule 1.Thanks. These points are interesting :)

At the gym where I'm at the crossfit people are generally nice, though. About one quarter still are pretty elitist, though.&gt; I need guidance/sidebar

wtf?&gt; Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands (SAID)

Thanks!! I'm going to suggest further down the line that you progressively replace all your weight lifting exercises with body weight only exercises. Especially if you're into rock climbing, they will get you into the best shape for it!Regarding your last question:
Avoid eating anything highly processed and/or cooked in fat (e.g. cookies, snacks, doritos, sodas, deep fried foods, etc). Or better, since it's not easy to radically change like that, try to slowly replace these foods with healthier options. You're hungry at night and can't wait until the morning? Have an apple or a banana.
There is plenty of healthy options that will get you fuller longer than junk foods, for example anything cooked with starchy foods.He did.
Bodyweight or GTFO! I can get a full workout in just by [yawning](http://i.imgur.com/PHwRRof.png)!

So, do the MJ, iron hugger! [And...](https://youtu.be/Ym0hZG-zNOk?t=1m57s)  I'm sorry, but you're objectively wrong.Sure, you can always PM me. If you would like to chat at some point in the future. I could always learn some more body weight stuff, or have someone push me to greater limits :). In essence, we can help each other get to our own individual goals.

Ahaha I totally hear you out, who isn't a sucker for fatty meats huh :). Hmm buttery biscuits dipped in a swimming poool of syrup and honey. Its funny, but I used to think of a friend of mine who would be grossed out from the excessive fat that they would put on certain Burritos, like Chile relleno. I never understood him, he would say how his body and his stomach can't process all that fat well. It makes him sick etc... so he would try to always take the excessive fat lol, and I would tell him "come and give me all that fat baby." Yeah I grew up vegetarian long story short, and I used to think vegans were crazy roflol. I told myself, I could never give up cheese. It was like a total deal breaker for me, how in the world could man survive without the cheesy goodness! There is this Nacho Cheese from Mexico that my mom would buy, that I was literally addicted to. I have my mom enough money to buy me 3 weeks of that Nacho cheese. I kid you not, those were the 3 happiest weeks of my life roflol! I was eating that stuff for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For 3 weeks, some friends would tell me if I am not grossed out. They never understood my passion for cheese, ahaha. If you told me some years ago that I would go vegan, and actually promote that stuff. I would have told you are crazy, but yeah that is part of what makes me see the good and bad things on veganism. I came from a completely skeptic background, in fact I researched into it, for the sake of trying to disprove them. At the end of the day, I found I had no reasonable arguments against it, and once I had actually given it a try. Its like wow, this really does work. There is no placebo effect in me, because I did not think it made much of a difference. Past like 15 I was starting to eat plenty of meat each time I would go out with friends etc... I never bought meat personally or cooked it myself, it was always with company, but hey if you go out a lot and socialize quite a bit that could mean 3 out your 3 meals are meat on a pretty consistent basis.

So in essence don't feel bad if you think its a bit nutty, in fact I would say that if you don't have that reaction you are not normal. It is so counter intuitive to tell diabetics that the way they could reverse their problem, is by loading up on fruit sugars lol. When I tell them that, they think I am smoking some good stuff. I put my Dad on a 3 month fruitarian based diet, he has had 20 years of pretty out of control diabetes (type 2 in particular). In those 3 months he was able to eliminate all his pills, stabilize his sugar levels to just about normal levels. The only thing is that he stopped, and returned to his normal lifestyle, but he knows it works. Now he is doing a bit of a mix, but the important thing is for them to see the objective data.

I know when someone is telling me BS, and when they are actually doing the diet. Like a friend of mine was telling me that he tried "raw food" for like 2 years, roflol. The guy is literally obese, and was totally lying through his teeth. So I had asked him whether he was consistent in not eating crap food, and what time period he was keeping the diet. Sure enough, on the supposed time period I had personally seen him on more than 10 occasions eat fast food, my dad had seen him even more times, heck he even had Facebook photos.

My dad did not even tell me when he had stopped the diet, the pure numbers told the story. I knew if he was keeping good sugar levels he was eating as I had instructed him, (all you can eat, on good food every single meal, of every single day). Only to find out how he went to a party, and binged out. So you take a brief look at him, and see him all dosed out, because he is practically having a diabetic coma from all the sugar rush. Eating Bunuelos with Atole, is definitely asking to die for a diabetic. So yeah I told my dad, and everyone I talk to. You can only lie to yourself, but you can't fool me. You can tell me all the crap you want, but if you are not getting better. You are cheating yourself, it really is that better. Because in the long run, if you keep doing this with consistent exercise, for like 5 to 10 years you are guaranteed to drop to your normal weight levels. Ohh by the way, my Dad for the first time in his life has been able to keep his own weight due to eating healthier vegan foods. So he was always around 220-240,  and now he is 170's. The numbers don't lie, my little brother dropped from 300 pounds down to 160, and he has gained it back to 200. He started including more meats, and high fats. But he has been working out quite a bit too, so he is really strong now. If you stay faithful like I said you will maintain your weight for decades to come, depending on how bad you fall off the wagon you can always recover. The only rule of thumb is never eat processed foods, you can always use starches as back up meal plans, whenever it is impossible or inconvenient for you to keep a good high raw food diet. Its hard to eat enough fruits and veggies in a day, that will make you gain weight. So much darn fiber is just hard to make you gain weight fast. Its usually the empty calories that are easy to overdo. There is only so much space in your stomach, and trust me I have tried to eat 35 banana meals. It takes real hard effort, to do that more than once a day. Plus without exercising you will not get a crazy appetite. Diet alone won't get you fit, you obviously need to exercise too. Diet alone will make lose weight, and my dad was proof of that. The man has not done a single push up, or run, or done a sit up, since I was small. In fact he is quite inactive, and despite that he lost the weight. For weight loss, it really is like 90% diet and exercise could help, but is not absolutely necessary. At the bottom of the page is the alternate progression called box pistols, which I think is what op was talking about.
Box pistols are definitely more repeatable than assisted - I find that I compensate for bad technique lots, with less assistance at the start and lots at the end of a set... I try to use a minimal amount of assistance, but with assistance,I can keep going way past eight reps - I just use my arm more and more.
I tried a few weeks ago and did over twenty beginner shrimp squats without too much effort...

Maybe I should try negatives? Or just stop the assisted pistols at eight reps with minimal assistance? I will give this and some of the other options a go and see what works best for me at the moment. Thanks for your input.I can do these with my hand half way down my forearm. This is a nice idea as I can vary intensity pretty easily.bodyweight squats.  It's really quite effective! http://www.subtleenergyproducts.com/uploads/4/6/4/2/4642325/8736356_orig.jpgThank you! I own overcoming gravity so I will have a look through it again.I do both and have seen great improvements in the past few months. Highly recommend doing both together. To the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq), my friend.  Do what you can.  Keep at it.  Fix your diet in the manner that you find works best for you.  Walk some.  Just move more.  Some movements will be harder for you than others.  Either look up variations, or find substitutes.  Try to read and learn as much as you can.  As you get stronger, you will become more educated on what you SHOULD be doing and you can change your program as you go.

When you start, do your self a few things.  Get before pics and measurements (Don't do it for that sweet, sweet Karma, do it for you.  Don't show anyone unless you really want to.  Sometimes when we tell people how we are doing, we lose perspective and backslide).

Then pick some exercises and get a baseline.  Push ups, pull ups, sit ups, plank for time, maybe even some kind of running.  Then every 3 months re-evaluate.  As long as you keep at it, these reviews will serve to motivate you.

Good times.  Good Luck.  Have fun.Diet to get thin. Exercise to get fit.

Not saying that exercise doesn't help weight loss, but agreed with your statement.Does either one correlate to a specific exercise?

Like if you can do diamond pushups you should be doing dips, and the same with the other two?

Or is it once you can do both exercises you can add pull ups and dips to your routine? L-sits are the worst. Super hard exercise for me, so I feel you. I've progressed most of my isometric progressions by only increasing by 5 seconds every time. So, for example, I usually do two sets of L-sits. On a given progression, I start at 20 second for both sets. The next time, I increase the first rep to 25 second but leave the second rep at 20 seconds. The next time I try to do 25-25 and continue on until I get 60-60. I also do a progression all the way through on paralletes/dumbbells before moving on to simply having my hands on the floor. It's probably not a perfect system, but progress is pretty noticeable, even if its only 5 seconds at a given time. The shakes definitely haven't gone away, though!If you want to lower your bodyfat, diet is more important than exercise. Not op, I will answer this. Looking to get stronger from the program. I work out quite a lot but I've been missing the core strength, so I started doing the beginner routine a little over a year ago when it looked a bit different.
Still can't do a single pull up though my core is a lot stronger. I've been working on them for 2 years.  I can do 3 sets of 40 sec on a good day.  Lsits do not happen over night.  They have been the single most problematic bw exercise.  Flexibility is my largest blocker for them.  datkipWow, man.  Thanks so much for taking the time to write all of this out.  I'm pretty disciplined with my diet, I haven't had Mc'Donalds or Pizza Hut in years.  Or even wanna-be healthy options like Subway.  My basic rule of thumb is to avoid anything packaged.   I used to eat that crap but now I couldn't imagine.  It just doesn't even look like food to me anymore.  I'm also aware of the new "organic" trend.   I'm still a sucker for fatty meat though.  But, in the quest for lightness, energy and of course health, It would be something I could give up.

Again, really appreciate your input.  You've certainly given me plenty to *chew* on.The planche question is nearly impossible to answer, but over a 5 year timeline, with a genuine focus on planche basic strength and skill training, you should definitely hit a full planche for a respectable hold time. I can't guarantee any specific number, but even 3-5 seconds is better than nearly everyone anywhere.Reach down, grab your balls...repeat You'll find that each lift has its own progressions. I never hope for more than 20 lbs per year in my work sets on stuff like biceps curls or overhead press. For lateral raises, 10 lbs at best. Larger lifts like DL, Squat, and weighted dips may go up 30-50 lbs, but generally not all at once.

You're right, and I said that as long as form isn't changing that's fine, but I'd rather see that beginner take the first 3-4 months to drill the shit out of form, then take the SECOND 3 months and explore their strength.

I think that strategy ends up giving better results, because you don't end up with mistakes that either stall you out until you go back to basics or get you hurt down the line.Look, you can talk about what you want, but when you are literally pedalling bunk, I'm not going to pull punches. I was rude, and I do apologize for that, but not for the general message.

You gave no context, made statements without explanations that were not factually correct, and immediately started talking supplements and incomplete science.

You want to talk supplements and what you do, that's great, but your success has no correlation to the accuracy of your statements regarding what's happening at a molecular level. On the other hand, your success suggests that you have done a great job in achieving high levels of strength and muscle mass, especially for your age. That's fantastic, and I am glad you are sharing what you have used.


Creatine is not used for energy in the mitochondria, it is regenerated in the intermembrane space (from what I recall) and in the cytosol, and used for energy out in the cytoplasm. I understand the basic science well enough to have an in-depth discussion on this, but it won't benefit anyone here except you for the most part. That's fine, but know that it will probably take a month or two to complete since I really have other things to focus my time on.

What you spouted earlier was broscience, as these supplements do not make energy in the mitochondria, and what you're doing now is either quoting books poorly, paraphrasing poorly, or genuinely not understanding enough to speak clearly. Again, that was no excuse for my rudeness.

Whatever the case, your communication quality was poor in the sense that what you are talking about really doesn't have relevance to healthy people, other than the fact that your supplement stack contains two of the most effective nonhormonal supplements in existence, and that they are complimentary to each other. Adding betaine anhydrous can also help.

I still don't think you actually understand the methyl trap based on how you are writing. It's quite complicated and typically is not impacted by these supplements in healthy people, which is why I am saying that your statements regarding the science show a general lack of sufficiently complete knowledge. A medical biochemistry text is a good source for that. I don't know what other peoples' opinions on those are, we use Mark's Medical Biochemistry at my medical school.

I love the fact that you are interested and learning, keep it up!
I disagree, it's way cooler and more awesome to use lifting machines than free weights. I love that gigantic pulley driven bench press analogue, so badass.If you are 6'5" then you have to consider that it will take a lot longer than 1.5 months to get to a full L sit. I'm 6'4" and have been going for two months and I have finally gotten to a 5-10 second hold of both legs tucked into my chest. I figured it would take a while and I've been doing a mix of progression exercises that help to strengthen my core enough to hold my legs off of the ground.
The full L sit is my goal and I still can't really imagine how it will feel to finally get it...also I've been working on flexibility. I'm just going to keep working on it, you should too.I'm going be a sarcastic Grammar Nazi and ask you what this "yoga weight lifting" is all about. :P

But seriously, I would say to give it a shot and just gauge how well your body handles the stress and adjust as necessary. Everyone's recovery capacity is a bit different. If it's affecting your ability to hang onto those pinches, crimps and slopers then I would say to dial it back.I can only speak from what my b-boy friends tell me, and the one time they talked me into going to their studio, (the less said about that humiliation the better).

Strength is a pretty significant component, you can't spin on one hand until you can support all that weight, but the spinning shit that comes afterwards relies heavily on your core and your technique rather than extra shoulder power.

Your core needs to be strong enough to hold you stable while your legs get you the momentum.

The short answer to "what kind of routine will help you develop this kind of strength and mobility" is dance, probably about a decade of it, with a ton of balance, flexibility and stability work thrown in.is it your arms, back, core, or legs that's giving out on you?I do upper and lower body splits, in terms of emphasis, so yes I do think that works out well. I'd never try to do all of those in one workout.

The biggest problem I see is that you hardly have any pulling. No serious rows, no serious pull ups. I'd do at least one of those. That will be a problem for you, I think, but if you're willing to take that risk then there you go!Nah mate, I am from USA. The worst possible country to be a fruitarian is Australia, just look at Harley and his g/f. The sort of ridiculous prices they pay, no thanks. Fruitarian heaven is around the equator, Thailand, Mexico is pretty good, and in general places that have don't have laws that prohibit the importation of other fruits. Without market competition you are going to get the lowest quality fruits, and with a higher price tag. No thanks.

Australia is beautiful, but hey if you have loads of money to waste go for it!

Yeah I love body weight fitness, because their is no excuses to fitness. Even if I wanted to, I simply don't care enough to have to travel to the gym all the time. Just the trip alone, I could get most of my workout done. I also don't have any distractions or funny stares, this is especially true when you are a beginner. No one in their right mind wants to look like a total noob, I have a little bit of self-respect. It took me 3 weeks to get to my first pull up, just imagine me grunting at pure negatives lol!

A funny little story, I was recently with my brother attending a wedding dinner, and a college dorm friend of my brother was also there (small world). The guy is a genius PhD from Caltech (where my brother graduated from and his wife also), but he travels like all the time. I mean where most of his day is spent on a plane, and I was really surprised, because the guy looked decently fit. Especially for being a nerd, and massive traveler. So I had asked him, how he kept fit, especially given all the traveling he does. Then he told me that the solution to his problem was body weight fitness, he started reading Convict Condition, by Coach Paul Wade. He says that is what has helped him stay in good condition, because no matter where he is at, he has access to walls, and floors lol. Now all you need is just a pull up bar, and some dip bar and you literally have 90% of your gym. If you would carry some portable ring bars, then you would be set pretty much anywhere. In general the folks who do body weight exercises, tend to get the message more loud and clear. That there is no easy magic pill solution, and that is what I love about the community. They know it takes slow steady hard work, to get the gains you want, but to those who are consistent enough the rewards will come. dude I have those exact same curtains&gt; Our goal is to do cool stuff though, so isn't bodyweight a good choice?
&gt; Fuck no, deadlifts and overhead presses are cooler. End of story. Full stop.

I completely disagree, I think the human flag, planche, one handed pushups are a million times cooler, I don't need to be at the gym to show somebody.

Edit: So I'm guessing it was an April fools joke... In my defense I saw this as soon as it was put up at like 11:30pm March 31... So it was a little reasonable for me to not get the jokeI think that rest-pause is best saved until after form is really pretty cemented in, just to put that out there. I wouldn't use it if form is compromised.

Over the first year of training, they would likely make the exact same gains. Over the first 2 months, perhaps somewhat less.

The longer we look out, the more we favor the slower approach, so it really depends on your goals.makes sense. kudos to you for making a killer resourceThere are many ways to progress. Moving the weight faster requires more force to be produced, because you are doing the same work in less time. That requires more force production.Yes and no. I was able to get my hips several inches off of my arms in a horizontal middle split fairly quickly, and I do attribute that in part to the triceps work I did, but I also had very strong shoulders and traps. All of that matters, and the skull crushers obviously aren't going to do so much for those other areas :)plus you can throw them on floor!! free weights ftw!!Just curious, are you suggesting that someone who is overweight shouldn't be doing the beginners routine until they are within the ideal weight range?This is false.

Muscles do not have the capacity to know what is happening to them. All they do is experience forces of different amounts, for different periods of time, at different speeds.

Changing exercise order means you are fresher when you do whatever exercises move to the front, and those muscles may respond to the greater amount of work they end up doing, but that is simply changing the amount of work. Nothing more.

Changing the actual exercises used does something similar, as each exercise is typically unique in the stability requirements and relative contribution of each muscle.

The muscles are not getting used to an exercise, they are either being stimulated adequately for continued growth or they are not.

You may also be developing an imbalance that could hurt you, and your body could be holding you back from that injury. Addressing this issue with different exercises and/or different emphasis on lagging muscle groups tends to fix this problem.

Again, that is not "muscles getting used to exercises."Ah, ok. As for the Russian twists, I would switch those out for either compression drills from Overcoming Gravity, Hanging Leg Lifts, Ab-wheel Roll Outs, L-sits, or Dragon Flags. All have different benefits, but will hit your abs well and translate better to overall core strength than 3x20 of those twists.

Basically, you are at the point to start moving into the low-intermediate strength progressions, which is a great spot to be in!

I've done a half marathon before, but I'm by no means an expert on training for an endurance event like the Ironman. I'm sure you can find loads of good info on how to properly train for the Ironman. As for the strength stuff, look up those progressions in the FAQ and the progressions wiki and keep churning through them =)

Happy training!It could be an issue with flexibility not with strength. Can you touch your toes? If you do a google search for "l-sit flexibility" you will see many people discussing this issue.

Have you tried without shoes on? I have ultra light shoes but it still makes a huge difference if I take them off because their weight sits at the furthest point in an L-sit.

Have you tried doing an L-sit on parallel bars or on parallettes? This is easier than straight off the ground?

I find sometimes switching to a slightly easier variant (e.g. using parallettes and with shoes off) can help you to either work into the full exercise, help you to build strength or build your confidence.That's actually quite false.Alright Ill see what I need to improve to fix my L-sits.Im 18. Does this mean that if I want to see similar gains I need to get into body weight *right now* or is it too late? When does the puberty gains end Just do them first. Eventually you get to the point where the place in the routine you do something doesn't make as big of a difference.There is a good reason, when you are running on deficit diets. You are always on empty, its much harder to give 100% to your workouts. This is especially true the more the deficit is, you will always feel fatigued etc.. This is why 100 calorie deficit is hard to do, because you need to start counting calories etc... Honestly, it takes more discipline to count calories then to do strict raw vegan. I know it because I have done it for 8 months, and did previously a vegan with non processed foods.

My main advice is simply to ease into it, if you are used to just going from one fad to another. Start by eating an all fruit breakfast, that is how I started, and its the best thing I can recommend anyone who wants to have an excellent caffeine free morning packed with nutrition. The reason why the all high fat diet seem to work, because of the excessive caffeine these guys take in order to just be functional. Fruit is your best friend when it comes to recovery and nutrition + free energy.

Don't forget, if you stop exercising just reduce your intake of food. Its pretty obvious, but yeah it goes without saying. If you ever feel hungry on a raw vegan diet, have a large meal of dark green leafy vegetables. That usually means you are missing certain nutrients, and the greens cover you. Sometimes folks confuse hunger, with the body asking for certain nutrients this is why fruit and dark green leafy vegetables combo each other so powerfully. The dark green leafy vegetables are packed with loads of protein, and so many other important nutrients that fruits don't have in abundance.

For fats I mostly just prefer seeds, so that can be chia seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seed. My ratio to Omega 3 to Omega 6 fatty acids, is usually close to 1:1 which is the perfect ideal. This is easy to accomplish with seeds, but vegans usually have a 1:22 omega 3 to omega 6 ratio. Which is why they die at the same rates as their carnivorous counterparts. Well that is because of all the vegan junk foods with vegetable oils, fake meats and the so called "olive" oil is healthy, is pure junk propaganda. In the first place about 80% of olive oil out there is 75% vegetable oil based. Real olive oil could only survive in extremely dark containers and it spoils extremely fast, and it is extremely expensive. Thirdly, once you cook the olive oil the only little nutrition it has is lost (Vitamin E), also when you cook the food to give it a browning effect with oil, it is so cancerous. Its like the worst possible thing you could do to your food, that is why I don't cook with oils, I just boil all my food. I don't want to die an early death, not if I can do something to prevent it. I could of course just die from tripping with a pen or a million other ways, but lets just say I try my best to control what I can be able to put in my mouth. Instead of eating olive oil, hey why not try the actual olives? They are super packed with nutrition, its actually one of the few foods I wish I could eat in higher amounts, I am slowly attempting to get an acquired taste for.

Remember the trick is to simply get the highest amounts of raw food as you can, never be so worried about the last 10% or 15% cooked. This is a long term lifestyle, and not having to be so dogmatic and inflexible will only lead you to go to your local McDonald's and binge. Also it turns out that eating vegan is super cheap, literally I would challenge anyone out there to see if they eat cheaper than I do. I am of course assuming a calorie to calorie comparison (since I tend to eat the quantities of 2 or 3 average people), plus nutritional density which is important to take into account. If we take these variables into account, I would easily win any time.

The more money you have the more variety of food you can eat, also don't worry so much about eating organic. I can't tell you how much I get tired of hearing that. In the end of the day the folks who are so worried about "organic", they want to be sold snake pills, pots and potions. They want a magic "formula" and want money to fix all their problems, give me a little pill and this will solve all my problems. They are the ones that get duped into buying over priced marketing "health super foods." They will never ever listen to simple sound logic, reason. If it is not expensive, they will simply not listen to you lol. These are the folks you can guarantee are going to fail at any program, because they are dead on arrival. They buy "healthy" marketed processed foods, lol. Its like they can't get it, their brain can't process simple reason. No eating pasta, with a bunch of sprayed nutrients "is not healthy." Fortified food cereals, is "not healthy." So I just wait until they have their heart stroke, pre-diabetes test, and let the pounds rack up. After they humble up a bit, and come talk to you again, when they are serious about hearing a no BS non-corporate sponsored advice. You see I don't get any royalties, or even could possibly get even if I wanted to by telling people to eat fruits. Also btw I am not vegan, because of "ethical" reasons. There is absolutely nothing unethical about someone eating animals for food, I strictly do it for the health benefits. We happen to be biologically made to eat that stuff, and just like you can feed a dog your processed carbs. Sure he won't instantly die, but he will have diarreah, get bloated and generally not be in optimal conditions. The only real nutrient that a strict vegan diet is missing is B12, and you can easily supplement that. I generally recommend against any supplementation, but since you are not getting any B12 from your food, this is an exception to the rule. Don't listen to any fanatical vegans tell you that you don't need it, their full of pure manure, piled high and dry (or you can call them PhD's).

Instead of hearing the good old hard message, that the only way to good health is good 'ole habits, eat your fruits and veggies. There is no other way around it, you can have all the nice intentions you want, you can even read super scientific studies on the subject, have 3 post doctorates on the subject. It doesn't matter, how many nutrition degrees you have, or what the hell your magic credentials are. If you don't eat that healthy food, you are not going to be healthy, period! I just love it when I talk to these fat nutritionist's preaching to me what is "proper", when they can barely take a run around the walk, and are wheezing when they breathe. Compare their blood with my blood, and see what the objective facts show. From being scrawny, unhealthy, lethargic, sick person to being fit, healthy, energetic and not get sick anymore despite not getting any flu shots or taking any magic supplements. You start to notice after two years, of getting sick only once and recovering in less than 48 hours. Whereby I can be able to work out at 100%, yeah that is the sort of stuff that makes you know, you are doing the right thing. When everyone around you can get over the most basic cold, and you kiss/hug every single disease ridden sickly baby in the household. This is when you know that all that massive Vitamin C dose you give yourself everyday, with the super packed anti-oxidant dose you give yourself daily, makes a huge difference. Also you start to notice that your skin looks cleaner. I use to have a problem with acne, now its much much better. Fruits have been good to me that is all I can say, and I know they can do as much good to those who are faithful to them. The only thing you need to do is consistently eat your greens and fruits, and you will have a higher quality of life. Ohh did I mention perfect poop? No constipation problems, perfect regularity all the darn time. Also you don't need to drink 3 gallons worth of water, since all your food hydrates you. Not that I would recommend it, but I have gone without drinking water just to test it and I have not been dehydrated. I would still advice to take 2 liters to play it safe, it could depend on how much water based fruits you have had (the ones higher in water % such as papaya, mangoes, watermelons etc...). There are some very few strict fruitarians who haven't had a sip of water, in like 2-3 decades and they haven't died. Once again I don't recommend it, but if you are eating enough high water based fruits you will be covered good. Just a little bit of more water would be even more optimal in my opinion.

Fruits that will make your mouth orgasm,
Fresh, ripe and ready.
1) Cherimoyas are just amazing, its like an explosion of flavors in your mouth. Ohh soo good!

2) Mangoes (ohh if you find the right one, its just sooooo darn good)

3) Blueberries (these ones are hard to find the real sweet ones, but ohh man when you find the really good ones, they are amazing)

There are so many fruits, that when you find them in their perfect ripe state. Literally nothing cooked could ever even dare compare to the deliciousness of a fruit. Just peel and eat, no cooking, no adding salt, or anything else. That is just priceless. The best of time of year to go fully raw vegan is during the summer, literally you feel the best. Your actual core body temperature drops several degrees, which is also one of the negatives in the diet, because if you live in colder climates. This is why nothing feels better then eating a nice juicy watermelon that is fresh and super sweet in the summer. Especially if its a bit colder, yeah its real easy in the summer. Also pretty much all the fruits are in season, so everything is much cheaper, and the nutrient density is the highest always when you eat the fruit, when it is in season. So say if you tried, 8 months out of the year, going raw vegan when it is easiest. Certainly sounds like a good long term plan, make it enjoyable and you will stick to it. But can I do both and get gains?

Here's my routine:

Pull ups 5x100
Push-ups 5x100
Ab crunches 5x100
Squat 5x10
DL 5x10

I do a PPL split. So not that it's a "problem", but just imagine for a second that you were, for example, thirty pounds lighter. It's certainly not going to make it *harder*, right? That's thirty less pounds you need to carry and hold up. Overall, it's not a problem and it's still certainly doable. It's just obviously going to be easier for someone with less weight. Doesn't mean you can't do it, just keep working at it.I am making an assumption of this part of the article:

&gt; Judging from said experience, developing the cross should take a person with average pull-up strength of about 8-10 repetitions, good conditioning of the elbows and shoulders, and a light body frame150 lbs or lessaround 9-12 months. It will obviously take more or less time depending on the level of training beforehand as well as how well the athletes genetics tend react to strength training. https://fitloop.co/ includes said beginner routine and provides video examples of the movementsReally? Where does he claim that?I agree, but Low seems to have clientele who have completed this route... Who knows.Mostly raw vegan bwf freak represent!

Edit: - I am also a big fan of cryptocurrency. are you from Australia?A year from a handful of pullups to a full Iron Cross? Sounds too good to be true, from what I've seen/gathered from the internet.It's definitely more technique. Bboys drill specific moves for years to get them looking as clean as they do. Of course you build the appropriate strength along the way, and a lot of them do training that is not just about technique, but you don't get those moves with strength alone. Muscle memory and getting the "feeling" of the move are super important aspects of learning power moves. Oh alright, im on mobile atm will check when i get homeA lot of the more commonly seen power moves like mills, swipes, headspins and air flares don't actually require much more strength than being able to hold a handstand. It's more technique/body control than anything. Of course having strength/endurance makes learning a lot of these movements significantly easier but it's far from required. I've met quite a few larger/less fit bboys capable of doing incredible power combos and even more that would struggle to run even a mile. Well I've done Capoeira most of my life, and I can do most of the things you saw in that clip.

Just like Bodyweight skill work, it has progressions, lots and lots of progressions. You start with a cartwheel and doing the bridge, then you do cartwheel with one hand, then no hands, then if you can do a no hand cartwheel really high you can try spinning for a 360.

etc.. Everything difficult has progression like that, and it all really starts with Cartwheel and bridge.

And then its repetition, massive and massive amounts of repetitions. When I was working on my Backflip I did failed backflips for a full year, landing on my hands every time until I managed to get my feet under me. So I would say it's 80% neurological recognition. You teach your body to do advanced moves without thinking about them.

But for my part I should have worked more on strength earlier on, I relied too much on pure technique, thinking I could just train myself into it. Which was not wrong, but being stronger and being flexible makes everything exponentially easier.   Thanks chodeking, I love you too :) I love jump rope. It's hard on your shins at first so be prepared for splints when you cross the 1-2m w.o stopping threshold. Jump rope is good for high intensity (which also boosts testosterone fyi).

I lost the most fat with distance running. If you're gonna commit to that make sure to learn proper form. Most of all combine proper form with what feels natural to you.

There is a nice trick I thought of that works great for distance running. If you wanna run an extra mile and you don't have the wind, walk a mile after your initial run. Not only will it break the mental barrier it primes your lungs for longer distances.

But yeah. Your body will adjust to how you use it. If you want to lose the belly I'd say running is your best bet.  Well thats a start. So could being slightly overweight be a problem for L-sits? Im 6' 5" and 225 lbs?There is a beginner's routine in the sidebar-chk it out. I'm gonna do that one, then. membership to gym is only 15 a month and I've got a pullup rack (clothes rack) in my closet lol. Thanks dude. I didn't want to do anything wrong and fuck myself. &lt;3&gt;  (especially if it's your birthday)

So true.Strength is partly dependant on how much load your muscles can handle, and partially how much load your nervous system can handle. Technique=StrengthAdd more sets, continue doing the same number of sets but with less rest time, try MORE rest time, move up to the next progression anyway, try a different core exercise instead, figure out what your weakness is that's holding you back and add in extra exercises to correct it, lose weight, gain weight, stretch more...

Your options are literally limitless.  Those are just the first 10 I thought of.I love you.I realize that, but that doesnt help me.stop lol.Shaking =/= sucking.I would honestly suggest just working the inlocate in a feet supported position and reducing the amount of resistance over time.

Inlocates are extremely rough tho.  If you don't already have a respectable (shoulder width weighted) dislocate I wouldn't suggest training for them too hard.

As far as one arm pushups go, just stick them in the workout in place of the one arm Pushup progressions.  Do pullups instead of chinups because they're harder.  As you get better at them you're gonna need to find more difficult progressions, but 3x10 chest to bar pullups is a good goal for now.

As I said you may need to do handstand Pushup progressions instead of dips.  There are some progressions on antraniks website, look up his intermediate routine.  Don't actually do the intermediate routine yet, just look up the handstand progressions.

L sits should be more than enough for core, as well as the bodyline exercises from the warmup.

Don't worry about convict conditioning, it's garbage.  Just focus on the beginner routine and don't forget to lurk in here.  You'll learn more as you go along.Sorry that it took a long time. I am pretty new to reddit, and I am working on preventing the whole tl;dr thing.

I see your point with the format. I'll try not to think of it with a weight training mentality with the programming and go with the fundamentals.


Sorry that I didn't specify what kind of pushups I was doing. I was doing them all with a wide grip, and I can assure you that I was doing them with perfect form, just like everything else.


I have decided on doing the beginner routine. I think it looks good, and I can probably find the time to fit it in my schedule.


Thank you guys for the input, not just on programming, but on reddit advice in general.


Peace.If your planet fitness has a squat rack, bench, dipping/pullup station and is okay with deadlifting... I say go for it. Hell, even if it's not okay with deadlifting, you can still do controlled barbell rows. Once you've leaned down a bit and have more muscle on you, you can always come back to the bodyweight stuff if it appeals to you. You will make faster progress then.Ok, thank you. I am going to do the beginner routine. I will get some rings, and get to work.

I had a feeling that the split idea wasn't as effective. It was kind of easy to program, but I suppose the beginner routine will make it even easier.

I can do about 3 one arm pushups on each side with decent form, where should I add them into the beginner routine?

I can do 9-10 chin-ups, and around 5-6 pull-ups. I think I like chin-ups better, but should I get my pull-ups up? Also, I can do a one arm chin hold for about 5 seconds. I have convict conditioning, so that can help me. But again, how should I incorporate this into the beginner routine?

To answer your last question, I do ab work 4-5x per week. It's only about 5-10 mins tho on youtube. I'll put a link below to the playlist. Should I do something else?

[Abs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxyE6J7xq-xwLkYL_dxb6eHuWaYgSmxMu)

Thank you for the suggestions. I am grateful for the responses.As in you hold onto it as you go down? If you cant go all the way down try just doing them on to a chair or something lower, I don't think you will ever improve your balance by holding on to the bar. I have only just started to get them, and what I did for a while was just lower myself down all the way, steady myself with my hands until I was balanced and then push back up. Ya I haven't been measured but I was around 8% a few months ago but put on some weight to bulk so I'm probably around 10 or so in the photo. To be honest I still feel really small considering the height. I know weight goals are bad, but for us tall guys 220 is still small. I'm trying to get to about 240 next but I see myself working towards 250 if I want a reasonable size. Focus on losing weight via fixing your diet, and supplement with either biking or swimming (low impact activity). Once weight is in order, transition to walking. Once you are to your desired weight, you can begin strength work. 1.)  you are just out of shape

2.)  check the recommended routine, but since you want to lose weight, look to increase the number of sets and reduce rest between sets.

Try the following tips
* never overeat carbs

* don't eat anything after 9 pm

* stop eating when you are no longer hungry.  If you are full, you've had too much.

* divide your meal into thirds, and take a 5 minute break between each third to facilitate the previous rule.  also, eat slowly.

* minimize all liquid calories.Fyi Colored Marxers, I eat 3500 cals a day, which is around 500 more than maintenance. I will try to fit the beginners routine into my schedule three times a week.
One quick question tho, what should I do for cardio? Should I do HIIT? And how many times a week should I do it if I am already doing the beginner routine?
Thanks!You need more intense pushing work.  I'm assuming you don't have access to dip bars (get some rings) so for now you're gonna have to work handstand Pushup progressions.  Pike pushups are a good start.  Work your stomach to wall handstand as well, maybe even add in alternating shoulder taps for time.  Handstand push-ups are a must unfortunately.  Probably be a good idea to work one arm pushups as well.  You seem reasonably strong, you can probably grind out a few dirty reps to start with.  Just focus on cleaning up your form.

Shoulders and arms is useless, scrap it.  Handstand work and pullups will work your shoulders and arms more than enough.

If Armstrong is working for you I won't tell you to fuck with it, but if you want to build some real strength you're gonna need to start working front levers and one arm pullup progressions.  How many pullups can you do right now?

I would also suggest adding in some L sits.  Some people swear by hanging leg raises but I find them pretty useless.  Definitely need to work your core more tho if your doing martial arts.

I strongly recommend you check out the beginner routine in the sidebar.  It's going to be the best thing you can get your hands on right now.Don't have access to weights right know, and a gym membership isn't in the budget right now other than planet fitness lol.I dont have calipers but I would guestimate i'm around 20-22% But thats kind of the build i'm going forBruce Lee is a perfect example of power or explosive strength in punches. Train dirty.

The hardest part is actually getting the hip extension right at the end of the curl, and maintaining that while you're extending the leg.  If you don't have that control, stick to two legs, do some arch body holds to learn about glute contraction and stretch your hip flexors.Ma'am, but it's all good!I've been toying with the idea of going raw/vegan for this purpose.  It sounds like the way to go to achieve that type of body.  I'm not unhappy with how I look physically, currently at 185, but I could see being able to do a lot more at 175-170.  Again, it was mostly just the sore factor.  I always feel less sore when I eat a lot. There are a lot of options but doing something that is most similar to the actual movement will yield the best results due to the movement pattern carrying over. You could also string an circle elastic band through itself and around the bar. You put your foot in the base of it to lighten the load. Towel option can also be used. Elastic band is one of the better ones.

Look into the book overcoming gravity. There is a whole section on OAC / OAP, eccentrics, etc. Hybrid weigh lifting and bodyweight routines are very viable, but I do not recommend them for a beginner, pick one and stick with it. The recommended routine is great if you have someplace to do pullups. You do that routine 3 times a week, my pattern is Monday-BWF, Tuesday-Rest, Wednesday-BWF, Thursday-Rest, Friday-BWF, Saturday and Sunday-rest. Inverted rows, some leg raise progressions, and parallel bar support holds.200lbs is quite skinny at your height. You'd have to be around 230-240lbs for a muscular but not huge, athletic kinda look. That's assuming you're mostly muscle though, 10%BF or less. At your size you'd see much quicker gains with a good lifting program, honestly. The heavier/longer you are, the harder it becomes to scale bodyweight exercises. If you want your muscles to grow it's all about hypertrophy. Whether you're lifting or doing body weight pick exercises that you can do properly but can do within a range of 5-8. Also focus on exercises that have long time under tension.

Basically just make sure it's a hard exercise for you. If you're focusing on endurance. Make sure you go to failure.i hate these routine review threads.  Do you know how hard it is to look through a long list of exercises and keep a mental track of what muscles are neglected or overworked?  This is compounded by the way your routine works.  The number of exercises you have with a specific rep total comes from a bodybuilding routine meant for weights for an advanced athlete.  Its a poor match to both bodyweight fitness or untrained athletes.

Take a big step back and think simple.  Think fundamentals.  You will get maximum value out of your time and energy by focusing on a handful of principles and key exercises.  For example, your chest routine is terrible.  First, if you want to work chest, you ought to do wide grip pushups or something else.  Regular width pushups don't work the chest nearly as hard as the triceps unless you are doing them wrong.  The fact that you can exhaust your chest before your triceps makes me 100% sure your form is bad.  Keeping good form is critical to bodyweight because it is synonymous with added difficulty and injury prevention.

So that said, think simple.  I'd recommend either full-body every workout, or alternate upperbody/legs.  The more frequently you train a body part, the better off you'll be, up until you are so strong that a serious workout requires extended recovery time.  Get the most back for your buck with compound exercises, and balance directions and push/pull.  Work hard, with minimal rest, and when exercises get easy, move to a new progression.  That should make up the bulk of your workout.  Then, if you want, you can spend time doing extra stuff or accessory exercises.

P.S.  Your level of volume is impressive, especially on leg day, but you need to focus more with an eye on increasing intensity/difficulty.Ok then....Can I do weight lifting while doing this or bad idea?

How many should I do, is there a set number or too little or too much per day?

I found this http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine

am readingWell, it does help that OP was standing under a spotlight that creates perfect shadows from his muscles.1. Go to FAQ
2. Read FAQ
3. Profit ???I honestly can't tell if this is a joke Figured I could give you a general idea because I'm 6'7" but your body shape and genetics will play a huge role. Here is me a few weeks ago around 215-220.

http://imgur.com/hWDWxNpHigh reps of flutter kicks and shit aren't an efficient means to creating larger abs. Exercises that are so difficult that you *cant* do more than 3x10 reps of are your friend. Look into our routine in the sidebar, and find a place to do pull ups or at least rows from. Your shoulders will get imbalanced from only doing pushing exercises.The most athletic NBA players at that height weigh around 205-220. There are heavier guys too that are built like brick houses. It's a different sport altogether but might give you an idea. No, I am really not being pedantic here but let me say that I have seen that.

Why did I still post then? Because I am not really in a position where I have got to "maintain my gains". I am starting and incidentally, triggered by events in life, my trip coincides with me starting this. So I thought I will ask people how do I kinds start bw exercise (as a beginner on the move) while on the move.

Also that routine follows a strict regime and requires at least three times a week. Sometimes I might as well be on trains for pretty much three days in a row. I even saw "I Don't Have This Much Time!" but I still needed some custom advice.

I was looking for tips that I could get from experienced bwlifters that I can do practically on the move and that will help me strengthen (buildup the initial push and break my non-exercise inertia; I have always felt very different towards running and exercise as in my attitude) and when I am back I can start with full swing.

I hope this answers your concerns. Thanks.You've got a nice "A" build going.  Skinny fat individuals tend to have an ["X" build](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1491111&amp;d=1219311507) due to fat in the lower chest, love handles, and belly.

Keep up the good work!The pull up bar you linked looks just fine.  If you don't urgently need a pull up bar, I recommend taking some time to bargain shop and check out local Goodwill stores for one.  I purchased mine there for $5!  I purchased a book called complete calisthenics. It is full of  good work outs and progressions to undergo. So based off of what you have said so far I feel like I should keep mixing my calisthenics with some weight training to build muscle or tone. Currently tone though. Well I am going to beat the mods to it by suggesting the [beginner routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) and also say that unless you are eating around 3000 calories a day, you will never gain mass, and it will be incredibly hard to gain strength past a certain point. Furthermore, your routine seems geared towards muscle endurance and cardio, not strength. what else do you use it for besides dips?Well, honestly you shouldn't commit to one area of training. Kudos for picking up calisthenics but you should work calisthenics in with your weight lifting routine.

Maybe work on bench and pullups the same day. Work your way to one legged squats and maybe on the same day do weighted abs workouts.

Bottomline it's good to incorporate multiple things into your workout. Proper calisthenics will make you realize your less used muscles and tendons. A good book for beginning Calisthenics is called Convict Conditioning. Brings you up from the most basic level.Yeah don't do it on knees.

Also allow me to suggest clap push-ups.It's never too late to learn!! In that case, since you're very new to it all, I'll cover the basics first.

Freestyle (aka frontcrawl) and breast stroke are going to be your main strokes for exercise. Really it'll be mainly freestyle but breast stroke has a nice leg element to it which can be good to build leg strength in a certain range of motion.

When swimming freestyle be sure to incorporate bilateral breathing. This means to breathe on both the left and right side of your body regardless of which side feels better. This will help prevent muscle imbalances down the road. (trust me, bilateral breathing is a small price to pay to stay even. I'm still working on correcting muscle imbalances over a year since I finished competitively swimming). Your breaths will come in odd numbers of strokes (e.g. 3, 5, 7).

It is going to be VERY difficult at first if you've never swam for fitness or if you haven't swam much in your life. DON'T GIVE UP!!! The most important thing is the keep swimming when it gets hard to breathe. This will do wonders for your cardio and endurance. You'll settle into it about 2 weeks in and it will be much less difficult.

You will want to start each session with a warmup of about 200 yards since you are a beginner. You should feel slightly out of breath at the end. Be sure to swim the entire distance in one shot, no taking breaks at the walls. If you can't perform a flip-turn yet just touch the wall, turn around, and push off again with your feet (learn a flip-turn ASAP!! It's great core work and really makes you a better swimmer).

After that warmup, a typical workout will involve some heavy sprinting with a lot of rest or long moderate swims with little rest. Sprinting is usually better for building/maintaining muscle than long swims so that should be your focus. (Disclaimer: you will not get huge swimming. It just won't happen. You will develop muscle and great definition provided you eat properly but you will never be huge like you would be from weight training. Shoulders, back, and arms will show the most along with a good core. The beach will be your best friend eventually!)

This is an example workout focusing on sprinting freestyle:

200 Freestyle Warm Up
200 Kick (100 free kick/ 100 breast kick)
10 x 100 sprint free (take 30-90 seconds rest between swims)
200 Breast nice and slow
200 Freestyle Cool Down

This adds up to 1800 yards, just a little over a mile. This workout will be super hard in the beginning but just keep a watch at the end of the pool and use that to see how long each 100 sprint takes you and always aim to go faster than before.

I hope this all helps you! If you start to really enjoy it and want some more variety let me know, I can write some good workouts that also won't bore you but you need to have a good clock for the edge of the pool that you have practice using to time your swims. Good luck with everything!!
I was thinking around 200lbs...I just don't want to get too small. The workout is definately the easy part I've been doing the beginner startbodyweight workout for about 2 weeks and already feel stronger. Diet seems to be the hard part. Thought about trying lean gains as it seems like less to keep up with. Should I add some type of cardio? From what i've been reading you get more bang for your time with a solid strength training programI'll defer to this guy/gal, as my experience with cap is maybe a total of 2-3yr.  But I will second what s/he said - classes.  They're kind of pricey depending where you are (at least, I think $20 for an hour is pricey), and there's a huge cultural/community aspect to it that kind of frowns upon being a casual, but if you want to learn, they'll push you to your limits and you'll learn.Who says you can't have both? Porque no los dos?

I have found my personal solution to that conundrum, I know many people in this subreddit will frown upon it etc... I have found that a good balanced vegan diet without any of the processed vegan junk foods, and empty fats. Is the best way to be able to enjoy life and at the same time eat to your hearts content.

I eat mostly fruits, dark green leafy greens and vegetables along with seeds, and more recently due to having moved in with a brother of mine started adding mostly starches. However, the best way to go is to start incrementing the amount of raw foods in your diet, and stop eating the easy filling foods that leave you nutritionally deficient. You will feel much better recovery times + a guaranteed heart healthy diet, without having to worry about the most debilitating diseases later in life. I call it heart attack proof :), your cardiologist will hate you ahaha.

Yeah there is no real reason why you need to carry 40 extra pounds even if they were pure muscle. At the end of the day, you can't run and be as light + enjoy life as much with much less weight. Once people realize that modern BB standards are ridiculous and the only way a man could ever keep that up is with extra-curricular medicinal "herbs" if you know what I mean.

Learn to love your body at a good healthy weight, that way later in life you don't have the arnold syndrome. Where you look like a 80 year old female, that needs a serious bra. Your breast will be sagging lol, your children will ask you for milk. For the love of all that is good and beautiful, don't do that to yourself :).I can confirm how deceiving RTO pushups are. I can hit 3x18 diamonds, but I still struggle at 3x6-8 RTO pushups. Get rings and do them. They're awesome.The only reason I have it this order is, if you can't do diamond pushups and horizontal rows then you shouldn't do pullups/dips according to the FAQ. Edit: i've matched the routine order and changed the wording now.Hand over that grilled cheese sandwich smothered with triple layered cheese and more mayo than a frat house of white guys could handle.

Get me some biscuits with some dripping butter, poured all over that special high fat sauce, with some more cheese dipped on more cheese.

While you are at it, hand me those pancakes smothered in whip cream with some sugared powder, in a sea of honey and syrup. On top of that let me drink that with some high fat milk. Hmmmm hmmm buttery cheesiness goodness... .... ohhh yeah....

In general just keep the fats lower, don't add any extra empty fats to your food, that should also help keep your caloric intake down. It is much harder to break down fats, than it is to burn carbs. So keep the fats down to healthy things like avocados, seeds, and a few nuts here and there. You will notice how much easier it is to maintain your weight without having to workout so hard. I think I have the strength for pistol squats, but I don't have the hamstring flexibility (and may not have the ankle flexibility).  I *can* do shrimp squats, which are listed in the [basic routine](http://www.startbodyweight.com/2014/01/basic-routine-infographic-poster.html) after pistols.

Ido Portal has a video demonstrating what he calls [beginning and intermediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpgn6eRtsdw) shrimp squats.  Notice that for the beginning shrimp squats his foot is touching the ground at the bottom, and providing a bit of liftoff.  For the intermediate shrimp squats, he is only making contact with the rear knee.  His [advanced video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EJtZsA43vI) has him holding his rear foot.  I have also seen a video of him doing it on an elevated platform, with his rear knee going below the level of the platform.
Haha! I liiike. /borat voice I have.  That's where the confusion is...for me at least.




Also...I obviously have a body image issue.  Hahaha!I always find myself in the conundrum of gaining muscle and weight eating tons and enjoying life at the cost of my knees and other joints vs staying lighter, feeling faster, but also feeling more sore all of the time because I'm not eating enough and my body is breaking down.  Summarized [here](https://www.trxtraining.com/shop/gear).  All of them provide the same basic functionality.  The strap material is a little different in each and the buckle lock may be different on the force.  There are also different accessories that come bundled, but if you just want a hotel room workout, get the home kit.  If you want to shave a few ounces off of the total weight get the force.i have 7 years experience with capoeira, though i can't do all the moves that most people might consider flashy. i'd say it's generally a fine balance of strength and technique. the breakers in the video you posted have very clean technique, but i've seen lots of breakdancers do cool things with a lot of strength (and speed/explosive power more importantly) but poor technique. but i think to most people those look just as flashy


my impression is that capoeira is much less a street art than breakdancing at this point in time (at least in the US), which means that a lot of our training is relatively formalized-- indoors, supervised, semi-structured. so technique is emphasized.


an important factor is coordination. like coordination between muscle groups. this is important for a lot of the moves like hopping on one hand. notice he kicks his feet while he hops-- that's lifting the weight of his legs (1/3 of his total weight IIRC) *at the same time* that he pushes with the one hand (and with his shoulder muscles). this means it's not just upper body strength he's using, but several muscle groups at once to perform the desired movement


edit: i think it is mostly just "keep doing THAT specific thing"

edit edit: accidentally put edit in the middleIt really depends how advanced you are in your bodyweight training. If you can can do double digits on muscle ups, and other advanced upper body strength training exercises, than it will take you more specialized training to get to that point. The hard part however is out of the way, also when it comes to performance there seems to be a perfect weight between good quality muscle and weight. To carry more weight on your even if it is muscle, would definitely always weigh you down. This is why you don't see gymnasts, be 250 pounds and compete against other dudes that are like 165-175 pounds. At some point every single pound will make you lose performance, but there is plenty of personal talent and skill involved also. At elite level performance it is the little things that make the difference, like natural talent, age, weight etc...

I will get to that point sooner or later :), hardest thing about it is to stay consistent in progressing in strength. Most of these things are a lack of strength (this includes tendons) and flexibility.Almost.  Gotta make the 2 handed pistol.  It's half the fun.  Pew Pew Pew!like /u/antranik said, do pullups/dips before you do rows/pushups. After two weeks of the fitloop order with the same problem as you, I switched them around and haven't gone back since.Yeah, I bought a walker for about $5, and it works great for a variety of exercises.Make fists, too.Rifles!

Jk, I'd suggest /u/Antranik's [progression video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7Oj8-8Htyw)! Just stick to the chest to wall version for now until you could do 60sec holds easily and work toward getting your hands closer to the wall. Also the other reply is good too.Thanks, I will keep at it.I started putting my feet on stairs before doing the PPPU.

If you have rings (you should get rings!) you can do rings/RTO pushups as a next step too.  You'll be surprised how hard that is.  Hmm, I don't know what you are talking about...

/me looks at pictures around the height/weight I posted.

Oh.  A lot of the tall people are weirdos.  I guess that explains a lot about my brothers.Your goal should be to do 12 months of the beginner's routine, progressing the entire time. While you're doing that, start tracking your calories specifically, develop diet discipline, and really learn how to feed yourself in a cheap and healthy way. Consistency, knowledge, and patience like that is the way you can really achieve your goals in the long term.

If you're looking for a number: I'm 6'5, and 3 years ago I was 255 lbs, and hadn't lifted regularly in years. Now I'm 192 lbs, around 10% bodyfat, and I really, finally look ripped. I'm going to cut down to about 185-188, so that I look super shredded (I should be at 8% BF at that point), and then start slowly, slowly bulking back up while eating clean. If you want to look like a fitness model, I'd suggest cutting down to under 200 lbs while working out hard, and then seeing where you are at that point.

Remember, your physique is MOSTLY about diet. BWF or any of 100 other programs will make you stronger. Getting stronger isn't that hard. What's hard is not putting too much food in your mouth. That's what trips up basically everyone. Good luck!They were easy enough to not really be a challenge anymore. You might still struggle a bit because it is a pretty big jump from 2 legs to 1 but just make sure you do a controlled negative and worry about perfecting your form overtime. How many reps were you hitting before you switched to one leg? I can knock out 15 reps or soThis is basically how I did it. Do them on two legs first.  When that gets easy, switch to one.Raise your feet
Like Sarah Connor in T2? Not sure if that would fly with the hotel staff.In 6'5".  I guess it depends on what you want as the end result.  I had always figured 210 was my sweet spot when I was working out a lot.  Then when I started climbing, I realized  that I wanted strength and to be more toned, and then I was at 200, and realized I had more fat than I wanted.  Then at 190 I still had decent mass, for me anyway, but still more fat than I wanted, so set the goal at 180.  I'm regressed a bit back in the 190s, but working on it again.  http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Measure-Things-without-a-Ruler/Didn't say I couldn't afford it[$4 tape measure](http://www.amazon.com/Singer-00218-60-Inch-Tape-Measure/dp/B000B7Q9FM/ref=lp_553284_1_8?s=power-hand-tools&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427843408&amp;sr=1-8)

Male, 19, 6"1 150lbs

Goals: Ferocious strength and agility, bodyweight control

Routine: 5 times a week

Day 1:
Practice swordsmanship with a heavy metal bar for 10 minutes
Practice bending metal bar for forearm strength
Pushing walls for more pushing power
Max pullups (chinups, and other variations included)
Max pushups (various types of pushups)
Day 2:
Ab wheel rollouts
pistol squats
Jumping squats

and sometimes i go out for a good run and sprint.

Diet: I just eat whatever, but been trying to drink more milk and eat more meat veggies lately.

Mood: typical, I'm not too enthusiastic about training. I just want to be strong and healthy and be able to beat ass when i need to. I like to keep my workouts simple and I prefer the old fashioned strongmen training methods of the old. So i keep to calisthetics and isometric exercises. There's something about the whole gymrats with caps and nikes on doing all these elaborate squatting variations that just makes modern training seem so artificial to me, not a big fan of it.

Question: Have any of you guys noticed a height increase after stayng consistent with your pullups regime? Will doing jump squats and ab exercises enough enable me to do backflips effortlessly without even having to practice?Maybe just do air squats for a while? Or get a weight hold it in front of you and do goblet squats? You could even fill a bag with books and put in on your back. Personally, I got to the point where I could pistol squat with a 35 ilb kettle bell on the side I was doing pistols on and I still preferred just doing barbell squats. Pistols are fun and look impressive but it does get time consuming doing the set/reps each side. Hahaaha, what is going on with that website? Full disclosure: my handstands are pretty bad, but I've been working my ass of at them, and watch/read everything that guys like Yuri Marmerstein and Ido Portal post. So this is just what I've learned from them that has helped me in my learning.

Play with your balance in the wall HS. Learn to feel what hand movements provoke what kind of response. Push into your palms to come off the wall, then with your fingers to come back to the wall, etc. Work on developing an understanding of how your weight is distributed across your hands. It's one thing to know that's how it works and another to feel it.

Learn the hollowbody position while you're against the wall. It's easier to spend the extra effort on developing good habits than to break bad ones later on. Yuri says that every problem with form in a handstand is amplified 10 times when learning a one arm handstand, so if you think you MAY want to learn that a few years down the line, work on that form now.

Edit: learn the hollowbody position lying on the ground before you try it against the wall to get a good feel for it. Check that you're resting enough between sets. Thanks m80I actually have capoeira in mind with this question.  I see so many similarities between break dancing and capoeira, I figured I might ask about break dancing as it seems to be a bit more prominent.  You don't start with air flares or windmills. You start with toprock. Then you learn floor work. Then stalls. Then you start doing some moves.

You don't start with one arm handstands. First you need handstands.

These guys have been doing it for years. There's strength, endurance, and skill in there. The most important being skill.Yes! It's just another movement to get comfortable in. :) Mother of God.. This beats the hell out of my spread sheet. Thanks!Idk, ive been at 310 diamonds for about a week and a half and idk where to go. Im disliking unilateral movements so i guess ill just do weighted diamonds for a bit.Yes.

You can't track progress well if you're doing different things all the time.

I'd personally change a routine every 3-6 months depending on how results are coming on.

https://fitloop.co

Fantastic website for the recommended routine! Press on each exercise* for an example. Endless options here. pistols squats, pushups, handstand, back bridge you only need the floor/wall ofc. Then with pullups/chinups he can buy a pullup bar you can set to the doorframe, without any bolts. AND you can buy gym rings to hang from it and thereby doing ring dips.

What is your ultimate goal that you want from the BW program? I ask because you'll likely need to change the order (or priority) of exercises you perform to suit your goals.

The most common goals:

 * Getting lean

 * Gaining muscle

 * Getting stronger

Can you prioritize what you want?Sorry, but what is fitloop?Why are your wall straddle press eccentrics 3x10r? Usually programming for negatives is {sets}x{time}. Doing 30 negatives seems like a lot.Ok that makes more sense. Also I can't do it freestanding yet, just against the wall. I have been doing the chest to wall handstand, should I ever try back to wall to vary it up? Thanks for your help.//I just can't imagine what kind of routine you would follow to get your body to do those types of things.//

Simonster (a b-boy with amazing balance and power moves), in an interview on youtube, talked about his b-boy training, which started at age 12...

I suppose you could try pommel progressions for the straight arm strength and the power and balance needed for basic power moves like air flares. I'm only 30, but I find them irritatingly difficult.I can't do pistol squats at all, and do them to get into/out of chairs until I can do it to that depth. It's much less discouraging for me, maybe that will help you?I don't have experience breakdancing, but I do have a bit of experience with capoeira, which has a number of showy movements that are similar to breakdancing.

Capoeiristas have pretty decent endurance, as a roda can go on for hours and individual bouts can last a while (especially if it's your birthday).

Most of the training we did was extremely specific bodyweight work.  Some guys added weight training on top of it, but basically, if you wanted to learn to do something, there was a progression for it.

So, train for what you want to do.  Running will not allow you to do windmills or headspins.  Nor will headspins make you a great sprinter.  I don't think many people own calipers, there are a lot of people who don't own tape measures either...For instance, I'm a college student, I have neitherNo. and some unrequested advice: be patient with your training.

From what I've seen you've made some really spectacular progress since you've begun. Jumping to a higher progression before you're ready puts you at risk for snapping your shit up, which would slow you down much more in the long run -- I learned this the hard way.
Start losing fat and stop when you're happy. Your body is too complicated for some stranger on reddit to give you a number. Still, I'll try: I think you need to get to 210 to look good and 190 to look great. Less than that to look like a fitness model.Google "skinny fat" and get back to us.  You are neither skinny nor fat.Sure, as long as you count calories, it will definitely help.For the pull up bar: it is good to have one at home because you can just hop on any time, but I don't have one right now. I don't know where you live, but I am sure there is something you can use within a 10min jog around your house. For me it means that even if it's cold or rainy I still have to put pants and shoes on, but there must be a park or a tree or a parking lot thingy somewhere. It makes a good excuse for a run anyway.

About your 20lbs dumbbells: depending on what you are doing, even 15lbs in each hand is nothing to laugh about especially if you are starting. Like, shoulder press, cuban press, flys... Don't lose motivation because you think 20lbs is heavy. EVERYTHING is heavy until it's not.

About motivation, I'm just going to give you my personal and subjective experience of the last 12 months: my routine is made of things that I think are challenging (and in bodyweight fitness or fitness in general you can always find a harder version of any exercise) but I also always have one exercise I'm looking forward to (right now I think front raises are fun, go figure) and one that I absolutely hate (it used to be pseudo-planche pushups, now it's pistol squats).

Anyway, a good routine is a routine you stick to, it's not forbidden to make it fun! I have been experimenting with weighted pushups recently. I wasn't lookng forward to my workout, the whole thing felt like a chore, but I was looking forward to the weighted pushups and see if I could reach that 5x12 with 20kg on my back. Well, since I was at it, with shorts on a sweaty, I also did the other exercises. Having that one thing in my routine is the reason why I have also done my curls and squats consistently.

Track all progresses. Not just your weight on a scale, or how much you bench/how many pullups you throw. Improving your flexibility and mobility is progress too. Do planks and yoga stances (you don't have to tell your friends), not just because they're good for you, but because you will improve at them too and that will make you proud.

edit: I've just learnt about Cossack Squats. Now I'm looking forward to the next workout, because at the end I'll allow myself to try that new thing (and they will replace pistol squats because fuck pistol squats, they're too hard on me). As long as I have one exciting thing in my routine I manage to keep motivated.&gt;However, power diminishes as you get older

That's the sad truthPart of "being fit" for me is experimenting and enjoying exercises.

That means I have my goal-focused workout (where I progress continuously, using weights or progressive bodyweight variants) and I have my "experimental" workouts, which I work into off-days or post-workout. These workouts are normally me practicing skill work, or messing/attempting "artsy" calisthenic moves like plyo push-up variants, Jack LaLanne push-ups, tensing random muscles while swinging around, doing silly things, etc.

There's purpose to progression: hitting new strength goals. It's a great barometer for that, and internally that feeling of progressing is amazing. **But you also can't forget to have a little *fun* with it**, to test out your body and its movement in new exciting ways. The feeling of improvisational movement, whether structured into a part of your day or because you're bored while waiting at the dentist, is one of those untold and often unmentioned joys.

So mixing it up a little is fine. Your running example is another way to mix it up; a little cardio never hurts (unless it's over an hour long, cue the "overexertion mortality" study...) so go ahead and run!
No, because you should be able to easily do diamond pushups, there isn't a point in the progression where it makes sense to do PPPU on kneesTry finding an appropriate exercise from [this squat progression page](http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/squat-progression.html). Find the progression that you ca do more than 3 x 4 of (with good form) but less than 3 x 8 to 10. Several months ago I was struggling hard for clean form on rear foot elevated split squats (or Bulgarian split squats as they're labeled on the page) as u/bipocni recommends and am now rocking out some assisted pistols. I can see the unassisted on the horizon...I just started a jump rope routine (5 minutes/3 days/week - for now) a couple weeks ago.  I'm going to try to get up to 15 minutes/3days/week...do you think that will do?DOMS is only an issue when I take a full week off without any training.
I'm flexible enough, still working on it.Why would you do that? You lean the shoulders ahead of the wrists only to the amount that you could handle. If you're tryin to lose a bit off the stomach I would start a cardio routine.Making progress on a given movement isn't the same thing as growing more muscle. Good chance you'd see greater gains in muscle mass with a wide variety of pulling movements.

However, you wouldn't progress as well in the climbs. Again, depends on your goal.But you should really "milk" a given movement for a while. Actually the progressions in the beginner routine do this perfectly - for example diamond pushups work the same muscle groups in a different way, which should "confuse" the muscles by just the right amount. That's why following the progressions is probably the best of both worlds.With not seeing any progress in the way your body looks, do you not see a visible change immediately post workout?

I can usually see a large difference when I'm done and look in the mirror in the change rooms. This convinces me what I should look like as a next step if I continue training.It's the same reason noobs see big gains in strength without gains in muscle size within 2 weeks - your nervous system adapts to the demands more quickl . than your muscles do. They make it easier for the muscles. A large part of pure strength training is neural adaptation without hypertrophy.

In the case of hypertrophy, it's better that the muscles aren't "smart", because if the nervous system is coordinating and recruiting motor units more effectiviely, it takes a load off of the muscle fibers.

It all depends on your goals. However it's probably true that sticking with a regular progression will lead to better strength and hypertrophy in the long run. There's your problem right there.  You're literally not strong enough to train pistols.

Do some Cossack squats and some rear foot elevated split squats.  After you can get 15-20 reps with both come back to the pistol.No.I'm pretty sure if I spent six months training rope climbs I would make better progress than a dude who spends one month on rope climbs, one month on chinups, one month on rows ect.I do yoga regularly and would consider myself quite flexible. I never thought of the two being related!Also, making muscles stronger is best for strength, but not always for size. When the muscles are "smart", the neural units that activate them make the job a lot easier by firing in coordination and recruiting more fibers.

When the nervous system hasnt been trained to do this, the muscle fibers have to take up all the slack.

This is the reason why noobs see big gains in strength without big gains in hypertrophy within 2 weeks of training - the muscles haven't grown, but the nervous system has adapted.Oh, I'm using that as like my limitor because I can't do all the way down to the bottom. I'm doing partial reps, so I find my doorway pull-up bar (Telescopic, not Iron Gym) is the easiest so I can control my rep range.Well it depends on a ton of factors, but if you're just looking to put on muscle, and you don't care about where exactly it goes, and you don't care about following a specific progression, yeah.

However following a specific progression, and making consistent gains, will probably lead to both greater gains in strength and hypertrophy in the long run.No. Not at all.Cha Ching!!!  Thanks!Yes, that would work also, but switching the movement entirely should theoretically allow more hypertrophy. Of course you'll be using slightly different muscle groups so this is probably a big part of it.

Just depends whether you're trying to put on greater overall muscle mass, or build overall strength on that movement. Adding weight or increasing reps would be best for increasing strength, but probably not always best for adding muscle mass. Depends on a lot of factors.What exactly are you using a bar for?So it sounds like you don't like them because they are hard?  Something that recently helped me is squeeze every part of your body before starting a rep.  I start with legs, squeeze my ass, brace my core, lock my ribcage down and even retract/depress my scaps.  Once I started doing this before every rep, I could complete sets with much more stability.  It sounds silly, but whole body tension works well for me.  annually or what? i mean, lifetime injury rate is probably 100% regardless of activity.Muscles and tendons aren't made of the same thing and heal at different rates. If you get micro tears in muscle fibres they will repair much faster than a tendon which is made up of almost purely a facia type tissue which will most certainly react to tears and will strengthen but if you do it often enough and bad enough you will create scar tissue through the facia and you will pay for it later on in life.  One thing I have heard to help is to have a rope or ring attached to your pullup bar. Start with your hand very high up on the rope/bar (say 4-6 inches below the bar). As this becomes more comfortable move your rope/ring hand further and further down the rope and away from the bar. The lower you grab the rope the less assistance that arm is able to provide.What are the differences between pro, home, and force kit?From what I've gathered, listening to the body means = taking note of what is happening and not ignoring it.

So, if something hurts or puts you in a position where you don't feel good... or where it doesn't FEEL right, just don't do it. Listen to your instinct/gut. Are you flexible? The biggest hurdle ive ever had to deal with was my flexibility. Once I spend long enough getting my muscles healthy and long my DOMS was reduced significantly. You might also consider wrist wraps, which can help stabilize and support your wrists in the vertical positions /u/Mattobox mentioned (eg. dips).

I picked up this pair from Rogue after spraining my wrist:
http://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-wrist-wraps-white-series

The idea is for the wraps to keep your wrists from accidentally flexing beyond that 80%.  I used the them to keep my wrists in the right position for various exercises (eg. pushups on handles, dips) while they recovered and strengthened, and I still use them for some intensive non-bodyweight lifts, like cleans and snatches.



No, you're not. Medium build with a little fat.I read in Overcoming Gravity that beginners will see better hypertrophy in the 5-8 range, with longer rest periods. Do you know why this might be the case?Yeah thanks for that correction which provides me with no information. You're doing God's work.So tl dr changing you work out every two months gives bigger muscles but not necessarily more strength This is really true. If you're training for something specific - a particular competetive sport or something, then sticking to a focused routine is more important. If exercising to generally be healthy and strong and good looking, the main thing is that you *do* exercise consistently. An optimized routine is great, but if you get bored with it then it's better to do anything on a regular basis than to do nothing. Some people need to keep switching it up to feel motivated and that's far better than the alternative.... Can I get some backup here /u/Joshua_NatermanYes at this point you either add more weight or do more reps to elicit the same training response.

You want to make your muscles *smarter*, not confused.Any movement has to be good. You win no matter what. They never listen man, I don't think anyone has ever read he FAQ/wiki first haha.Strength is the amount of force you can produce. Lifting a heavy object would be an example of maximal strength because you can take all the time in the world it takes you to lift that object and reach your maximum strength.

Power, also known as explosive strength, is the speed in which you can produce maximal strength (Or generally high strength). If you wanted to hit a baseball, you wouldn't have all the time to apply force to that ball. You want to accelerate as quickly as possible to maximal power from a standstill - Power.

An example of explosive strength would be punching. There is no way that you have time to ramp up to your maximal strength during a punch. You want it out there and then back again so you can't be countered. Nobody cares about a puncher who has a strong maximal strength. Mike Tyson was explosive. He would just be standing there and suddenly ramp up to his full power in no time at all and smash you with all his strength in that tiny amount of time. Maximal Strength, on the other hand, is the most force you can exert over any given time. Doesn't matter if it takes you 6 seconds to deadlift 600lbs, you still deadlifted 600lbs, so thats maximal strength.He's not wrong, it's basic muscle physiology. You're correct, but every month is a bit too often. Your nervous system becomes adapted to the same movements, and when you switch it up, it means your muscle fibers have to take up the slack for the reduced neural recruitment and coordination, meaning greater hhypertrophy.

Hypertrophy and strength aren't the same thing of courseThe following are my principle critiques/problems with Crossfit. This is not to say there are not good boxes out there.

* Lack of basic periodization and programming. The workouts are literally random. I disagree with "muscle confusion", as progressive overload is the standard for increasing both strength and endurance. While new movement complexity can and will make you stronger, basic programming and periodization should be implemented for optimal results.

* Form and lack thereof. I'm not referring to kipping, as it has its place. From Sommer himself:

&gt; "Kipping pull-ups or, as I call them, Chinese pull-ups, are useful tool for easily increasing total amount of repetitions as well as more importantly developing elasticity in the shoulder girdle. They are also beneficial is developing a sense of rhythm and coordination.

Someone who already understands the mechanics of the movement can start from a hang, however I have found that it is usually easiest for beginners to begin from the top of the pull-up. To get the most benefit from a kipping motion on pull-ups I would recommend the following:

1) Begin from a static hold at the top of the pull-up.

2) Drop as quickly as possible to the bottom of the pull-up. While the body is dropping press the shoulders (feel the arm pits STRETCH) forward and the hips backward. This will result in the body somewhat resembling a stretched out letter C with the hands on the bar, the shoulders slightly in front of the hands and the hips slightly behind the hands.

3) Bounce strongly out of the bottom position. Use the momentum from the bounce to propel yourself back up to the bar, strongly reversing your body position on the way up. Do not attempt to stop precisely at the top of the bar, but allow the body to go as high as it wishes. Your may find that your hands are also hopping slightly off the bar at the top if your kip has been powerful. Finish with hands on the bar, shoulders slightly behind the hands and the hips slightly in front of the hands.

4) Do not pause at the top, but immediately use your speed and momentum to bounce down into another repetition.

5) This movement is self regulating. If you are not using the swing of the hips and shoulders in coordination the movement will become awkward and out of control and you will be unable to proceed to the next repetition.

6) Pay close attention to your hands. Several high rep sets of these can result in some spectacular blisters if you are not used to this kind of work."

* Form continued: However, kipping only has its place AFTER the basic pullup has been mastered, preferably for at least 5 reps, preferably more in order to allow connective tissue strength to build. The main problem with forms comes with deterioration over the course of a session, as well as the total amount of reps required during a session. There is correct form for a reason, whether it just be the way the exercise is performed or the mechanics required for safely doing it. For example, high repetition Olympic Lifting is not meant for high reps. Correct form is required, and as fatigue sets in it gets progressively worse. This encourages injury among participants, all for the sake of getting a fast time.

* Delusions of superiority over other forms of training. This is self explanatory, and self evident.

* High level Crossfitters do not follow a Crossfit. They specialize their specific program to tailor their needs.

No, it's based on neural adaptations to specific movements. When your nervous system becomes more efficient at carrying out a specific movement, the individual muscle fibers do less work and there is slightly less potential for damage to the muscle fibers ans therefore less potential for growth.

It just depends if you're aiming for strength on a particular movement or just plain muscle growthconsider doing one-handed chinups (different from one-armed, see Rocky movies).  As you get more comfortable, move your supporting arm from your wrist to your elbow, then bicep, then shoulder.Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands (SAID) - your nervous system adapts and improves upon specific movements. Motor units fire with improved coordination and efficiency as you perform a specific movement repeatedly, so your muscles basically have to do less work as you get more practice with that movement.

So if you're looking purely to improve hypertrophy, switching up movements might help force your muscles to gain size, since your nervous system isn't quite as efficieny on that movement, whereas if you're just looking yo increase your overall strength on a given movement, it's best to stick with it to allow your nervous system to fully adapt to it.Oh gosh, absolutely.  I trained my body into the ground trying to keep my rugby career alive.  There was pain everywhere, all the time.

Pain's about stress and adapting to stress.  It's more about feeling than form. Form can be deceiving, feeling can't.

Often people see pain as the need to do less than versus different than.  I've just learned to become a proponent of the latter. That is true, I'll try a deload week every 4 weeks at first and see where it goes.
Thanks.maybe work on the progression that you're able to do comfortably (e.g., breathing)?&gt; I'll try to schedule a week off but it feels like I'm missing out on some extra training time.

Like you said in another comment, you come back stronger than ever after you take a week off. Laps. Lots and lots of laps. http://ruthkazez.com/swimming/ZeroTo1mile.htmlIn terms of losing weight the program was great. Whether or not muscle confusion is a load of shit, I went from a chubby 165 to a fit 150 thanks to that program, and really got a good foundation to start more serious strength training.First question: As long as you come back to a central program and KEEP PROGRESSING, then random workouts thrown in are a great idea. If random workouts interrupt your progression on a program, however, then they will hurt you. You don't just get stronger by working out consistently. You get stronger by working out consistently and at a progressing intensity. You have to do more each time, and the best (only) way to do that is to pick a program and work it.

Second Question: If you want abs, it's all about eating. Doing lots of cardio is great for losing weight, but (in my experience) it's not all that great for going from pretty-lean to abs-lean. Your body will resist getting under 10% bodyfat, and it will resist a LOT harder if you're doing heavy cardio, because your body thinks it needs some fat as a reserve. For me, this manifested as extreme food cravings if I got to the end of a day in a caloric deficit.

You're also a little confused about how cutting and bulking work. If you're trying to gain weight, you're probably not going to lower your bodyfat percentage significantly. The best you can hope for is keeping it about the same. If you want abs, you should start with a cut until you're as lean as you want to be, then slowly start bulking while eating as clean as possible.

In any case, it's all about diet. If you want abs, be prepared to track every calorie you intake, and think of food as fuel and not pleasure. It's about hitting macros, and, while it is possible to eat well and hit macros, it's a skill. You'll have to work on it a lot. If you're already fairly lean and just looking to cut to shredded, I highly recommend leangains. /r/leangains Certainly, some sort of calorie/carb cycling program is crucial. Good luck!I meant Hollow Body Hold progressions. I started with Bent Hollow Body Hold, then on to progressions of HBH. It took me a while to get to a HBH (straight legs).Explosive concentrics help build power and all exercises should be done that way.  However, compare clapping pushups with weighted pushups.  The former builds power but the second builds strength, but of course there is considerable overlap.I had an extremely similar situation. It was..lessened (not solved, but decreased) by Hollow Body Hold strength increase.Calipers or a tape measure. It isn't rocket science. Any technique will be imperfect but if you use the same one, they can still be useful to track the trend. People get so caught up in having exact bf% measurements. All I need to know is that my bf% is going in the general direction towards my goal. The relaxed part is hard. I usually end up cranking it up and gunning for either high pace or high difficulty.Yes, but harder to measure for a newbie.If you use a suspended bar to hang rings off of you can keep one narrow set of rings up high for pullups and another set placed lower for dips and rows or even lower for ring pushups.  Mount your bar from two points though so it stays level and stable. Not much info from me, but when I started i couldnt even curl 5lbs. Keep it up, i believe in you. : )I do. Aa a guy who never grew up near a pool. I have decided to learn swimming over the summer ( never know when itll come in handy). What are some really beginner workouts that you would recommend that are best for growing muscle and in shape?This times 9 million. Also push-ups with a plus, integral part of mobilizing the scapula, preparing it for work and hammering home your protraction.(Notice I said "lose fat", not "lose weight")&gt; why do those here who want to bulk up &amp; get jacked choose bodyweight calisthenics over weight lifting?

To add to what eshlow said, it's also introverted people that are more attracted to BWF because they don't have to go to a gym to workout and they could do it alone.The pain is really mild, I barely feel it.
It isn't the kind of pain that screams trouble.
I'll try to schedule a week off but it feels like I'm missing out on some extra training time.After you finish Support and HS skill work, do the Pull Up exercises first rather than Push Ups or whatever else.We recommend the concentric phase (the pull up) to be done "explosively" but control the eccentric phase (coming down from the pull up) to take 1-2 seconds.  Now, with that said, never sacrifice good form for speed, so yes, you are correct. :)http://www.cockeyed.com/photos/bodies/606-260.html

That site isn't perfect, but can give you some idea of what weight looks like at different heights.

I've had to learn not to make weight targets a goal, because how much muscle/fat you have will greatly affect your weight.  Maybe 230 will look muscular, maybe it won't.  It depends on how much of that 230 is fat.  You'll start to look muscular when fat stops hiding it.  If you are mostly fat, that'll take longer than if you are mostly muscle right now.  It will likely be different in different parts of your body.  (My arms look super muscular, my abs do not)

If you are making goals, I would say "Make progress on progressions every month, lose fat every month" is a good start. So, should i be doing the same Leg day, upper body workouts every week? it's so cute though :)IMO bf% is much more useful than BMI. I don't stop, I just do only one set of the most basic exercises and without any added weight.

Glad to hear someone treats tendon pain like me although I would never push through it because I really don't want to know what actual tendon injuries feel like.

Another thing is that when I have tendon pain my strength is also way lower so it's not even worth the risk.Mmmh fried chicken and waffles smothered in syrup. The holy trinity of good eats. I had to after seeing you cutting these out. It's the first thing that came to mind. &gt; I don't have a deload week planned in my routine so I do them when I need to, aka tendon pain.

The point of a deload week is to give your fucking body a break BEFORE tendon pain rears its ugly head.

&gt; If I had a deload week every 3 weeks I wouldn't even know what tendon pain feels like.

So DO THAT.

&gt; This is just me being stubborn and trying to train until my body tells me it needs a break. It works for me and the pain is always the same, never more painful than before.

It works for you? It doesn't sound like it works for you. You're the OP making the post saying I'm getting elbow pains, remember?  It's not normal to train until joint pain. Respect your god damn body, dude. Or don't. Not my body.It depends on how much muscle you're carrying.  Usually aiming at a BMI of 25 is a good start, then build from that. That's about 215 in your case.  If you're very strong, it might be closer to 240.**Stats**: Male, 32, 5'11" 175lbs

**Goals**: Stronger core and chest, Squat my BW (leg injury makes it slow for me on leg day), hand stand and more versatility

**Routine**: 5 times a week and once a week I play dodgeball. Come summer more biking

**Diet**: Breakfast: Oatmeal or eggs, lunch: mix veggies and grilled chicken, dinner: mix veggies and grilled chicken, snacks: smoothies, fruit, beans, almonds or whatever I got that week.

**Mood**: Since I purchase my new bed, sleep quality has improved so much I no longer having shoulder pain and its showing at the gym after 3 months of illness and back injury.

**Question**
I go to the gym in the morning so no crowds but I do have times where I have to get extra sleep for whatever reason. When I go to the gym at night, its  a bro-fest? How do you approach this situation? Leg day is horrible cause everyone uses squat for other things #rage

Appreciate feedback on my routine, I feel my chest is my weakness. I feel just doing daily push ups does more than chest day.

On personal note, how do you overcome the feeling that your body is not showing any progress? My friends tell me they see it but mentally its really annoying.

Thank youhmm yeah makes sense, ill try them out.. thanksDepends how much muscle you have.

This is bodyweight dude.  Find some progressions that will define you as strong, and once you reach them you should look strong too.Do at least *some* endurance work on the wall.  If you can hold yourself there for a lot longer than you can balance for, it makes balancing easier.The wall plank is there to help beginners get over the fear of going upside down or going too close to the wall before they are ready, so it wouldn't be appropriate for you to regress to that.

If you are holding a 10-15sec freestanding HS already, continue practicing that. And to help increase your muscular endurance, do chest to wall handstands for time (60sec per set is a good goal) and that should help.Personally I push through tendon pain a bit, because I'm young and I know what actual tendon injuries feel like.  I've made the value call that more training is worth the higher risk of injury.

That being said, I definitely don't train at maximum intensity.  I run steady state cycles for a lot of my more intensive exercises and I deload regularly.  I've learned to listen to my body, but that really only came from abusing it.

Don't just *stop* for a week.  Keep working out, but at a lesser intensity/volume.I recommend you switch to jump squats, you're probably already doing pistol squats so stick to those too. Jump squats are where it's at because you can't really plateau with plyometrics. You'll just keep jumping higher and higher and your legs will get more defined and muscular as a result.Cool, so I should be doing my strength exercises as fast as I can without letting my form get sloppy. Correct?If I do it just lasts for a day or two and isn't unbearable. I don't break for more than 4 days so maybe that's why. 4 days is just what works for me. If I go longer it seems like I start to get "soft" - and any shorter it seems like it was not enough time for the muscle to heal.Maybe someone more experienced will say your approach works fine and that monthly tendon pain is no problem.  Nothing else I can contribute here.

Good luck.

Pain also means that the muscles get stronger faster than the tendons and you need a break for the tendons to catch up.

Train long and hard enough and you'll get tendon pain at some point even if your form is perfect.

You never got any tendon pain?Good thinking. I hadn't considered doing that.I don't have a deload week planned in my routine so I do them when I need to, aka tendon pain.

If I had a deload week every 3 weeks I wouldn't even know what tendon pain feels like.

This is just me being stubborn and trying to train until my body tells me it needs a break. It works for me and the pain is always the same, never more painful than before.You know, if all the good people don't apply to be police (I like to think of myself as a good person) you will only have a force made up entirely of shitty people and it will just get worse. just saying..I suppose when you start the workout you can lower the initial rest periods and then add 10s per click if you want to wait longer as a workaround until they do add something like that in.For your specific elbow issue (assuming it's the inside or medial aspect that's causing you pain) here's a link by Dr. Andreo Spina in how to "fix":

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiW2BuxKT84

It doesn't sound like you are willing to address this recurrent problem. I may be a pussy but if I got recurrent tendon pain requiring a break every month, I would look for a long term remedy so it doesn't force me to break so often.

Deloads are a thing. It's to help with any number of problems. Being forced to deload because of an injury that recurs every month should tell you something. Pain is a sign you're doing something wrong.  Taking a break or working around or resting doesn't fix the problem; it simply takes away the movement-caused the negative outcome.  Rest doesn't heal a movement-based injury.  Not doing the movement (guised as rest) makes the pain disappear.  If a certain exercise causes you pain, it's a sign that the joints or sequence of motor control is 'off'.   The movement itself isn't bad, it's the way you're performing it.  The movements are a test of how well your body has been prepared to move.  Listening to your body means having your training program reflect the need for a fix, and performing regressed, re-learning exercises to solve the problem, not avoid it. Short shallow breaths.  You pick up the technique eventually.  Just focus on breathing.Not at all, after the light week I break most of my records either in the first week after starting or the second.At first I could do less negative MUs before I needed a break, now I can do more. I guess the problem is going away slowly.

Taking a break once in a while is not a bad thing, before training for MUs I still got tendon pain but it happened every 6-7 weeks. Antranik, for instance, suggests a week break every 3 weeks even before you get any pain.Have you done anything to manage this recurrent problem?  I think this should be a HUGE red flag.  You should really figure out the exact nature of your problem and start a prehab program so that it doesn't return every month.

Having tunnel vision with a goal does you no good if you keep having to take a week off every month. Seriously, you have the rest of your life to reach your goals. You only get one pair of elbows. damn.. sorry about that maybe i was a little more explosive, but like i mentioned before.. my legs are really lagging so i probably wouldnt recommend what i did as it hasn't really workedSaying it to a transgender woman is discouraged. You're just a kid, your off the hook.I sure hope so.

I also notice that rest countdown add time thingy.
I wish there was a way to subtract just 10 seconds. You can either add 10 seconds, or skip the rest entirely.Don't.^jkWhat particular improvements did you get from that? Super toned legs? Higher jumps?I used the rep-count adjustment tonight and also noticed that if you tap the rest countdown it will add another 10 seconds to it.

I tend to look a the little silhouettes to try and figure out a couple of the odd ones, but I'm still not sure. They could definitely do with an option to click on the individual exercises and have them break out to explain the motions, just like the do with the training routines.

Maybe that'll come in an update? Right, I've added a triceps and back shot as people asked for more angles.. gonna post some pics from the progress, so pics from month 1-7 etcdo you lose progress during that week break?Are rings ok?  if handles are ok, then rings might be ok, in which case a huge world is open to you.

If you think of the area infront of you as blank wall of potential hand positions, there is a red circle in the middle where handles or fists are required, and a wide circle where the angle is low enough to not worry about (wide pushups at the sides, superman pushups at the top, planche at the bottom).  The problem is when you transition from one to the other.  For example, in the planche, people start with their hands at a sharp angle, then lean forward and with their wrists pointed down, that angle decreases until its almost flat.  But how do you transition to this position?  If rings are ok, then this isn't a problem.I don't care if it affects my other training, MUs are my main priority.
I can do them for about 3-4 weeks then my elbow tendons start to hurt and I need a week break.Don't you get DOMS after a complete break though?
I train light for a week just because I get really bad DOMS if I don't do anything for 7 days.Ha, ouch!Strength is simply maximal force.  Power is more complicated.  Your muscles do not instantly turn on.  I believe Type II fibers ramp up to full strength faster than Type I, so although both are involved in maximal strength, the ratio of the two matters to power.  Power is also classically defined as force x velocity, so anything that limits speed applies.  In very strong contractions, you can feel antagonist muscles activating to control the load, but this also slows you down.

also, don't trust that wikipedia article.  I can see several controversial things on there that have been disproven or unfounded.Go outside?[Two weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2yju5c/training_tuesday_post_your_routine/cpbdoap)

**Stats**: 22 y/o, Male, 5' 10", 174-178 lbs.

**Goals**: Freestanding HSPU, 1.5x squat. Long term: levers, planche, etc.

**Routine**: I had to take an impromptu deload week last week as I got sick and couldn't operate at 100%. I came back kinda weak, which was disappointing, but with three workouts under my belt I'm back at pre-deload levels.

Pull-ups right now are 5/5/6. I really want to make them steady 5/6/6, but every time I try to add the rep to the middle set, I can't quite get my chin over the bar on the following set. *Sigh*.

HeSPUs actually feel awesome. My ROM is better and I'm feeling super strong at the bottom of the rep. In a week or two I'll start adding reps.

Squats took a step back, as my knees started clicking. The weights moving fine, but I hate the feeling. Deadlifts took a step forward and I'm happily pulling 245.

Rows are ok. I further elevated my feet so they're at bar hight, which should be challenging for the next couple weeks.

I'm adding time to my planche leans to work up to a full minute under tension.

Dragon flag negatives are ok, but I'm worries about my form a little. I'mma submit a video this Friday.

**Diet**:
Gonna have to really start taking this seriously. I put on another couple pounds, and now fluctuate between 174 and 179 most days. Tracking is necessary, if not a cut.

**Mood**:
Pretty good, sickness excepted. Rec league season is starting, and my flag football team played for the first time on Sunday. I balled hard and everyone kept saying I looked "athletic". Nearly managed a full ROM HeSPU when someone asked me to try one, but I fell over on the concentric motion.

**Questions**:
*Deadlifts*: When do y'all work them? How do you fit it in with squats. I'm squatting Mon/Fri and deadlifting Wed. I'd love to add volume but don't know when to put it. I don't think my body can handle squats + deads in the same workout. Certainly not at max weight. Any suggestions?If you know which exercise causes it, simply train around it. Also, reduce volume for those  MU's 'till you reach a point where it doesn't affect you other training.You're wrong.  Have a correction.What was their injury rate again? like, upper 70's?It's garbage.  Muscle confusion in general is a crock of shit.Apologies.. but anyway. isn't saying man a unisex thing? like hey "guys"??WTF, 610 for 4 at his weight????? Jesus, this really makes me want to start powerlifting :')

go stomach to wall until your comfortably holding it for 60s. Then come off the wall.Do yourself a favour and check out Richard hawthorn.This sounds like a fine plan, I'd do handstands every session (or even daily) as skill work. Then, after you're able to do a few HSPU's, I'd do them every other session (and keep working on the OHP), since specific trainings trumps everything else. BTW, the [Overcoming Gravity strength charts] put the HSPU at 0.9xBW OHP.As far as pain - I just don't do anything to agitate it. I have bad wrists and am susceptible to carpal tunnel and crap like that. It mainly bothers me if my palms are flat, so If I have a flare up I either stop doing pushups or modify them by doing them on my fingertips or fists. If I pull something in my leg, I either stop doing the moves that agitate it or modify them, etc. etc.

I can tell when I'm due for a complete break from exercising just by the way I feel. I will feel like I don't have as much energy and will be struggling to hit my rep goal. I will also start to get DOMS that lasts for multiple days (I rarely get DOMS anymore). When that happens, I relax for 3-4 days (without even so much as running / cycling) and eat at maintenance with plenty of protein. My favorite workouts are the ones right after this break - I always see huge strength gains and smash my records. I take a break like this probably every 4 weeks or so.Great! Glad to hear you have changed your mind and will instead be on the side of your people and not the state.Or the [towel trick](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-suHkWAnuuOY/UsgWvvkRPxI/AAAAAAAABug/zoNqhqXRJp0/s1600/IMG_20131218_181844.jpg)? The higher you grab it, the more it feels like regular chin ups. If you grab it low, you get little assistance from that given hand.I do know what it's from, negative muscle ups.
I never took a longer break than a week, I think I'd go mad.Would skull crushers also help in the strength part of developing the manna?that's a genious idea!#####&amp;#009;

Those are crap. Source: Myself, doing a half backflip with the bar in hands at a friends house :-)Here's a couple of resources that I found helpful:

http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/pdf/How-to-Build-a-Home-Bouldering-Wall.pdf

http://www.amazon.com/Building-Your-Own-Climbing-Wall/dp/0762780231The random pain throughout the day happen 3-4 weeks apart and last a few days.What worked for me was that I would throw a towel over the bar and grab it farther and farther down from the bar with the supporting hand to increase intensity.oh i feel you... i'm 25y old and still (and forever) at your height. but at your age you still have a good chance to grow a little.
oh and don't wear super tight fitting close to show off your muscles, it makes people think that you're trying to compensate. people will see and recognize them anyways. also, chicks will treat you like a cute teddybear occasionally, don't try to fight that, own it and they'll love you for the fact that you're not trying to be uber manly. just two quick pro tips from another tiny dude.This guy is dead on here. Swimming is, in my opinion, the best lifelong sport out there. I swam in high school and all 4 years of college. Swimming is absolutely outstanding for your body. It builds strength and endurance while keeping your heart and lungs healthy. It's also very easy on your joints as Inkognito said. It also does wonders for your metabolism and let's you eat a lot more of what you want without worry, at least that was my experience. I can write you some quick intro swim workouts if you're interested!! Also feel free to ask any questions. However, I should mention first that you won't necessarily build huge amounts of muscle from swimming. It's possible but it has to be trained for very specifically. You'd look Hella good at the beach though ;) Okay! So just add in some support and take it away over time. I have done archers outside but inside my pull up bar doesn't really give me enough room to do them. I hadn't thought do using a pulley system like that. I'd have to invest in a piece of rope and be careful not to drop them onto the hardwood floor! Would you advise against using resistance bands? They come with less inherent risk of me punching a hole in my floor. Just an anectode from myself. I crashed my Supermoto (one like [this](http://www.ktm.com/de/supermoto.html)) in 2006 at age 26. Had nearly gotten my right leg amputated below the knee (and nearly died at the site of the accident because a fragment of my shattered shin bone nicked an artery which resulted in severe internal blood loss, but that's not the point here).

&amp;nbsp;

After 4 weeks in hospital and several surgeries, the doc said that the leg stays on but I probably will never be able to use it to its normal extend again. After a couple weeks of rehab and getting rid of the crutches 5 months later, I said fuck it, and jumped on my mountainbike and started slowly working out again.

One year after the accident I slowly started jogging again (still had 2 metal rods, 1 plate and 10 screws in the leg, I had those until 2 years after the accident). The doctors said it is fine as long as it doesn't hurt too much while working out and as long as I don't do something stupid like crashing with the mountainbike.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, 9 years later I have no real restrictions in functionality despite the considerably worse prognosis I have gotten after the accident. The only this I don't do anymore is jogging, since this normally results in pain in the right knee. But who cares, I never really liked jogging anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

So what I wanted to say is: Don't let you get discouraged. Maybe the problems in your wrist never go fully away. But maybe you get even stronger through persistent training after all.

&amp;nbsp;

Regarding your question: When your are fine on handles there should be no lack of available exercises. I mean, pretty much all floor exercises I can think of right now could also be done on handles, like L-sits, handstands, pushups, planche progressions.

Foam rolling is one type of soft tissue work, there's also various forms of massage patterns, stuff like IASTM (instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization), and other things of that nature.

In fact, foam rolling is often used too much in my opinion. Foam rolling should product noticable changes in 3-5 sessions and keep improving. If it's not improving the situation, the issue generally isn't soft tissue work but usually some type of instability or specific weakness. See how it goes with soft tissue work, but if it doesn't help start improving the issue(s) then you may need to go to something elseThe body is confusing.  The general advice here is to continue if you have no pain.  However, if you have no pain during the workout but have lingering pain (not DOMS) for a few days after, then you should really stop and figure out the problem.

It absolutely sucks to have to break for longer than a week, but if you have your eyes on the long game, it's a drop in the bucket. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfXEra2Pxe4 1:16 but if you feel like going down fast hold with your other arm just 2 fingers of how much you need to    Over that year and a half I've lost 30 pounds in pursuit of a six-pack. As you can tell from the photo..it's going poorly.

Losing 30 pounds is great progress.  The road to a six pack can be very long, don't get discouraged.Thanks! I do a lot of travelling, which can leave me either missing my standard work out time or leave me exhausted by the time I arrive. I usually manage to workout still while traveling, but I lose the routine of home and end up trying to fit things in instead of waking up early and getting to the gym.

But maybe I need to move the priority up in my head and focus on that. I appreciate the thought.Yeah, same here. Some of these workouts I'll have to jog to the park for.  They look like fun though. I look forward to trying some of them when the weather in nice enough and I have the time.If its progressions your after then [this](http://www.startbodyweight.com/2014/01/basic-routine-infographic-poster.html) may be great for you (Top post of all time on /r/bodyweightfitness.)did you try archers? i think the problem is the same as with pushups, with 2 hands the movement is too much different, so you arent really training much the weak link

since you are quite small i think one easy way would be doing 1 arm chin with a counterweight, just use a rope and your 30 kg and hold them with your loose hand (making the weight subtract not add to you, ofc )Nah, just practice.Man - he says not to do the exact thing I've been doing: increase the lean each time.

I've read about SSC before, but I forget what it stands for. Steady state cycling? I know the general concept, of picking something and staying there for a set number of weeks before upping to the next level, but I forget the particulars. 12 weeks?

EDIT: Found this [guide](http://antranik.org/how-to-implement-a-steady-state-training-cycle/) that /u/Antranik did on SSC in case anyone else needs a reference.I actually just started using it last night.  Did the Body Shock workout.  I like that it tracks the time and reps and pauses.  I guess it works at a higher pace than I'm used to, as I was worked by the time it was over.  Also forced be to include sprinting in my workout which I don't normally do.  It does have done exercises that I won't be able to do, like Korean dips.  I don't have a bar I can use like that.  I would recommend swimming. It's a low impact sport that won't much pressure on your wrists or joints in general, and it builds strength in basically every muscle. I swam swim team in high school and it's the only reason I can do a lot of push ups or pull ups.

As for push ups, try doing knee push ups, and for chin ups and pull ups, try doing negatives only for now.

I might be 20, but this guy is 50+ and I listen to what he says: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XHNZDn3btv7454Pkz7THg1. For me working out is very high priority, and I will drop almost anything in order to make time for it. With good planning that rarely happens.
2. Archer rows could work.Antranik is the man.

There are two methods that people tend to use when trying to up their pullup reps:

1. do extra sets, so 3x4 would become 5x4 or even more
2. do negatives after you've maxed the standards, so each set would become 4 regular followed by 4 negatives, and then over time: 5-3, 6-2, 7-1, 8-0.
3. There's also 'greasing the groove' (GTG), where you basically do as many pullups throughout the day as you can, in addition to your workout.  Thanks for the tip, it feels like the just get up and do it attitude worked best for me when I lost motivation, just can't let it pile up.I would recommend seeing a doctor or pt if this has been persisting for a while. My general rule is that if there's no pain during the exercise or directly after wards, then it's okay.

Make sure to take it slow, use proper form, and take rest days. There are also some videos on youtube, search some there.
There are even some that admit they used steroids and look just like the ones that claim natty, figures.Yes, absolutely, never do something new and never vary.http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine

Pullup bar looks fine.Not an expert, but here's my opinion:

Yes, that works fine. A pullup bar isn't absolutely necessary. I've read about people using tree branches with a towel thrown over them if you don't want to shell out the cash for a pullup bar. But it definitely makes the routine more pleasant and some would argue that it really is a necessity if you want to properly do the work.

Just a warning though, if your doors are non-standard, there is a chance that this one won't fit right. An alternative would be those ones that use pressure to fit in the door frame itself, though some people have experienced those falling.

Also - regarding motivation - the moments of no motivation don't just apply to your dumbbell work. They will happen with BWF, with work, with anything that you do that isn't leisure. I struggle with this too. I would encourage you thinking hard about what specifically happens in your brain when you start to feel demotivated, and what you can do to short-circuit that behavior pattern so that you keep on track. Starting something and giving it up sucks almost as much as not starting at all.First time posting here; hoping it will encourage me to keep with it!

**Stats:** Female; 26; 5'6" (167 cm); ~115 lb (52 kg) (I don't own a scale, so this is not terribly accurate, but my weight has been steady for many years.)

**Vague Goals:** get stronger, look fitter, keep up a consistent routine

**Specific Goals:** be able to do a negative pull-up (yes, that's right, I can't even do a negative &gt;.&lt;), improve my side plank (40s right now), and keep strong on those killer horizontal rows

**Routine:** Start Bodyweight 3x/week

Bulgarian split squats 7/7/7

Leg-assisted pullups 5/4/4

Incline pike pushups 7/7/6

Forearm knee raises 5/4/4

High incline pushups 6/6/5

Bent knee bench dips 8/8/7

Inverted rows legs bent 6/6/6

Side plank 35s

L-sit 30s

**Diet:** I only recently started counting calories, so I'm still trying to tweak things around to find what works. I had been doing very large daily green smoothies, but I'm starting to think those weren't helping me very much--too many calories for not enough fullness. My protein is around 15%, and I'm hoping that's high enough to see some progress.

**Mood/Energy:** Spring is here! Spring is here! All I want to do is go outside and run through meadows of warm sunshine. And exercise! Been doing lots and lots of walking around outside and some yoga at home.
Thank you for the comment, I'll look at the FAQ on the side to do the pushup and pull up progressions.

"Russian twists" are also called "Alternating Floor Oblique Twists": https://youtu.be/pDTHSnoGoEc?t=30s

As for the running, I'm new to that so the progression will take a while, I stopped by /r/running to get started.

Thank you again. because it's not coming from an url like "frombonytobeastly" or "sixpackabsecrets" or some inane stuff like that. and i do trust some of them, it's just that they're all FAT LOSS, not muscle gaining, so it's a completely different thing. anyone can lose fat, but i rarely see skinny to muscular transformations after the age 18.Sorry, I should mention I have strong legs - years of cycling and walking make sure of that.  Problem is, I really have practically no upper strength at all - can only manage 1-2 pushups and 1 pull up.  That's irrespective of the knackered wrists.

&gt;Assuming you can take all your weight

Yes, just.  As long as I don't need to really support myself on flexed wrists, I will be fine according to the Doc.  They were at a bit of a loss as to what I could do, hence asking here.

I take your point on the advice, however I have to accept the fact the muscular/tendon damage could be permanent the one way (bending hand forward) and not so the other (which has improved).  I'll try and get a video of the movement range and describe the limits I have in my motion/support.I stay in a lot of hotels. For pullups, I have used the bathroom door when there's nothing else available. Also the room door itself. They make these doors pretty sturdy so I'm not worried about pulling it off its hinges. I'm 185lbs and have had no problems.

For rows, I've found that most hotel rooms include a table of some kind, and I do rows using the table edge. These are generally also heavy pieces of furniture so again, not common that I have a problem.

Definitely not as fun as an actuall pullup bar or rings though... I've thought about bringing my rings with me and using a tree outside, but not all hotels have trees and grassy areas that work.

Why would you trust OP's then?Ok. Will do. Just as an overall thing, you want to try and train legs a fair bit too. Most of the strength for almost all movement comes from the legs, so I understand if you're purely going for physique, but if you want strength too then legs are undoubtedly vital.

What would you have trouble on with the beginner routine? Assuming you can take all your weight in something like a chin up so taking your weight at a straight angle isn't an issue, you could do dips on a dip bar (Vertical Wrists), Pull Ups/Chin-Ups (Vertical Wrists), replace L-Sits with Hanging leg raises from a pull-up bar (Vertical wrist) or floor exercises where your hands aren't on the floor like russian twists. Horizontal rows are also normally straight wrists and leg work doesn't work wrists at all.

I might advise staying away from weight training until you know your wrists are strong enough. I know this is BWF so you may not be trying to weight train, but something like a Deadlift or Clean&amp;Press would put a lot of strain on your wrists when doing heavy weights. Please do not join the police.Haha he's totally clueless.#####&amp;#009;

Missed the last couple of weeks of this post, but:

**Stats:** Male, 25, 5'10", 182lbs

**Goals:**

**Routine:** I follow the beginner routine, except some days I go to the gym instead of to the park that has a pullup bar. On gym days I do OHP instead of HeSPUs, and I do weighted squats instead of bulgarian split squats.

I also spend 30-60 most evenings stretching, working on sitting in a squat, working compression, practicing handstands, etc...

Yesterday I hit my 1BW on squats. I know it's not a big deal but it's a PR for me and an exciting milestone.

**Diet/Mood/Energy:** I've been craving read meat like whoa. Eating a lot. I'm actually trying to drop weight so this is not helping, but given that my bodyweight has been fairly stable for the last month or two while my strength has increased tremendously, I'm confident that I'm dropping some fat.

I've been suffering from lack of motivation the past couple of weeks. Partly because my life has been hectic and I've lost the routine/habit of going early in the morning. I need to get that back on track. This kind of thing often happens where I build a good habit but then a disruption happens and I lose it. I really need to find a cure for this behavior.

**Questions:**

(1) How do you guys deal with situations like I'm describing where you settle into a good workout habit and then life happens? I tend to respond by getting kind of bummed out and demotivated. What tricks do you use to pull yourself back into the habit as soon as life has calmed down again?

(2) I need to progress on my pushups and rows. My pushups I'm working on PPPUs, and that is good but I can generally easily do 3x10 even with my hands down by my sternum. Going even farther puts strain on my wrists. What do? For rows, I am doing wide grip rows, and seems like the next step is Tuck FL rows, but I don't think I can really hold a Tuck FL, and also there's only one pull up bar at the gym. Alternatives? Should I start working on archer rows or something like that?

Thanks! This subreddit is my favorite. You guys and gals are awesome.

get of this sub, pleaseThere's quite a few DIY high protein soylent style recipes on google after having a looking so your idea has solved my dilemma anyway.Too heavy handed. You gotta be more subtle. You should've said something about squats being pointless.&gt;Wish I could help you dude but the problem you have is retarded parents.

Well they have managed to raise a decent 15 year old kid. What have you done you fucking waste of space?It's terrible. Ha, that article was pretty bad. A bunch of "well this may/could happen". If you are constantly working out, you need more protein. OP is not probably trying to consume 400g of protein daily. Without some kind of intrinsic liver problem, you aren't going to get hepatic encephalopathy unless you consume crazy numbers of protein without exercise over a period of time.[Modest cardio speeds up post-weight training recovery](http://www.ergo-log.com/modest-cardio-speeds-up-post-weight-training-recovery.html)

These are great for squatting - make sure to warm up with just the bar, and then you can proceed to squatting your bodyweight!

I'd also recommend getting some squat jorts for additional support in the hip area though.Welcome to the club! First off, that machine that you describe as a "crazy weird bar thing" is a Smith machine. Stay away from it (from what I understand, it's the gainz goblinz machine; I just use a squat rack for most of my exercises.)I understand that the squat rack  is for squats, but is there something bad about doing curls on it?squatting so hard you became a hobopoint your nipples... at the floorListen, what you're looking for is someone to make you do the work because you lack the discipline to do it yourself. I, and most people on this sub will tell you that there's no way in hell that you're going to see any changes until you force yourself to put in some effort.

And please notice that I'm using the word "discipline" and not "motivation." Motivation is a fleeting feeling of fantasy and desire. That doesn't do much for you. You need to just force yourself to put the effort in. Especially when you're a beginner and new to lifting and scared.

Sorry for the tough love, but fitness is really really simple. That doesn't mean it isn't hard... So what you need to do is A: want to change yourself despite knowing it'll be a lot of work. B: read the wiki on this subreddit.

After you do that, start to work towards some fitness related goals.

Diet: remove soda from the diet, eat vegetables for a snack, count calories, track macros using the app myfitnesspal

Resistance training: get a gym membership or look at r/bodyweightfitness, look up Alan thrall on YouTube and watch his videos on the squat, deadlift, over head press, and bent over row. Practice these with a broom handle. Then go to the gym and do them in real life. Get yourself on a beginner lifting program like strong lifts 5x5.

Mobility: look at beginner yoga videos on YouTube.

Edit: because I didn't answer your question, there's no way to throw money at someone, sign a contract, and be forced to get fit. You'll need to do it on your own.
Endurance/cardiovascular health: read about HIIT (high intensity interval training) and find a size appropriate form of cardio. (Running can be shit for your knees if you do it wrong and being overweight just makes it worse).

See there's so much you don't know about fitness that I'm sure it's terrifying, but arm yourself with the wiki here are have the discipline to move forward to some fitness related goals. Whey protein won't damage your liver IF you have a healthy liver. With that said, dude you're 15 years old, you don't need Whey. How can you possibly be low on protein? Are you eating grass or something? That whole 1g/pound is just a guideline and it is way too exagerated to be honest. You don't need to meet it EXACTLY.It will not damage your liver unless you're taking in extreme amounts of protein. You can show them all the proof you want but I doubt they'll listen. Just let them know you've researched it and are going to make an educated decision.175 lb on squat is tbh not allowed , also not 200. Any reason you bumb up the weight every set instead of keep the weight the same and do it 5x5 ? You know it's called overload, it's the overload of a weight multiplied by the reps with sets. If you do 200 lbs 5x5 you have lifted alot more weight than ramping it up. If you want strength it is alot easier to calculate the weight if you keep it the same for 5 x 5. It's pretty difficult to track your progress if you do it like this.I forget not everyone loves carbs as much as I do. Sorry. Prep everything you need before you go to sleep so you can wake up, put on your gear and hit the gym. Eat along the way if you must.

Not going to the gym and not eating properly is how one abuses their body, and abuse is not love.

I hope to see you at the gym soon. Take care of yourself.
same, used to always orgasm when doing pullups, rope climb, parallel bar crawl etc. was a weird occurance in the elementary school playground.Im 33 and I a better body and fitness than most 20 year olds I know including myself in my 20s. I constantly have 20 year old girls interested me though I am married.

With age comes wisdom.  I know how to eat better, how to work out better, and how to have a healthier lifestyle.  I also have more disposable income in my 30s so some of those goals are easier.

Though there are some sacrifices. You're metabolism is slower and you are generally bit more sedentary. So diet and workouts takes a bit more effort.  You many married and may out may not have kids so time is of the essence. Also the sex drive does slow down a bit but it is more enjoyable. Also the d receding hairline but there is always Nixon.

I am more confident now than I am in my twenties. If your back is actually in pain, that's a form issue and you should try to correct it before doing more planks. There shouldn't be any actual pain during the exercise.

But if you just mean that your back gives out, then there's no problem. Continue doing the planks and maybe add some extra exercises like back extensions if you feel like back is a weak point.Not my wedding :) Sorry for confusion. Will be meeting my SO in Spain in 2 weeks time though, in spain for a wedding. So I have 2 weeks to be irritable. Though thanks for advice re creatine. &gt; Do some light to moderate cardio immediately after your lifting.

Sorry to ask, what is the purpose of this?Last night at the gym, some guy asked me to move elsewhere (although there was no other barbell curl). Said I was getting in his way, and "smelled like shit" (probably true since I ate refried beans for lunch), both of which were messing with his workout. It was so unexpected I started laughing, my natural reaction, which caused him to get angry and get right up in my face and started yelling. I was sitting down and stood right up and squared myself right in front of him. I told him I didn't appreciate him being rude to me, and that he was just going to have to deal with it. The gym was dead silent, and we just stared at each other. Eventually he stepped back, put his headphones in and continued working out.

I'm glad it turned out like that, because he was one hulking manFor cheaper, buy a sled or prowler. Do heavy hitt cardio instead of endless jogging.Burning &amp; *calorie dense* foods. Starting a DL from the ground is quite difficult I find with long legs, I fixed it by using two 45lb plates as a platform for the barbell+weights6AM: Double whey in whole milk (600), coffee
7AM: 2 sour cream donuts (700), coffee
9AM: Cottage cheese (225), Peanuts (325)
11AM: 2 bags of chips from vending machine (600)
1PM: CiCi's, 24-28 slices (5600)
3PM: Oatmeal (325)
6PM: Double whey (250), pint of ice cream (1000)
8PM: Taco Salad (3000)

So that's 12,625kcal.  If I had a smaller lunch, then I'd probably head to Golden Corral for dinner and eat 6-7 plates of food and 2-3 plates of dessert.  This happened yesterday:

I walked into the weight room and for some reason it had gone deadlift-crazy. As well as using the weight platform, people were deadlifting using the bar from the squat racks and bench. Weird, but fine I guess. I wanted to squat so managed to get on the power rack.

Then I went to move on to the bench, but there was still someone using the bar to deadlift.

"Hey, can we work something out here? I want to bench."

"Sure, I've got three sets left and it's all yours."

"Can I work in? Or you could you try working in over there." I pointed to the weight platform where someone was deadlifting. "It might be easier."

"I was here first."

I indicated the label on the bar. It read "BENCH BAR". "I'm trying to accommodate here."

"Like I said, I was here first. Moving it from the bar to the floor is going to eat into my transition time."

I was done playing nice. This guy was in for it.

"How about we try one set and if it really does take too long, I'll wait."

He nodded. With that I pulled the grips and weights off, put my weights on and threw the bar onto the bench. I finished my set and he went to help me move the bar to the floor. Too slow. Before he could touch it I wrenched it off and had it on the ground. I had the weights back to his required weight on one side faster than an F1 tyre change. He took five full seconds longer with his side. He finished his set. I worked even faster to make the change and preserve his precious "transition time".

I finished my set and prepared the bar for his again in twenty seconds. I was so fired up I hadn't cared about taking my full rest. Trying to save face, he went for another set and failed his last rep.

"I'm done," he said.

"Cool. Work *with* me next time."

I went to lift the bar. My right arm ripped out of its socket with a loud crunch and fell to the ground. Blood spurted everywhere. He screamed. I turned to him again. "And that's why you don't hog the equipment."It's not worth it.  Kick the creation to lose some water weight. But going down to 1000 calories will make you tired and irritable and that is the last thing you want to be around your fiancee in these last two weeks.
Happens to everyone. #1 enemy against dem gainz is locked doorsSorry but there really isn't much you can do.

You're 18 so you still might have a very small amount to grow left so just make sure to get a good amount of sleep and eat well.

If you ever need inspiration just Remember that [Brett Gibbs](http://instagram.com/p/yjKVYkGiU9/) is 5'5 and is a beast. You don't need whey to get enough protein in your diet. Eat 2 eggs with your breakfast. Drink at least a pint of milk a day. A can of tuna or a chicken breast with your lunch. Another decent serving of meat for dinner, say lamb, beef, fish, pork, or chicken. Whey makes getting enough protein in easier, but it is by no means necessary, especially for a 15 year old, whom I assume wants to put on weight, not lose it. I'm also assuming you don't have a dairy allergy, but even if you do there's plenty there for you to work with. Lift heavy, eat big, sleep soundly, and believe in yourself.

I like his styleWould be perfect if that macros were different, from what I've read about it I'm sure it said it's around 400g carbs, could be wrong though.I've been so scared of the gym for so many years. I had an early life experience that left a really negative link between the gym and myself, and then an *even more* emasculating experience in my teens at the hands of a trio of middle aged school teachers. I knew was wrong and needed to go, but never did.


The apartment complex I live in has a gym with some equipment attached to it. It is literally 50 feet from where I am typing from right now and about 10 feet from where [my bike](http://i.imgur.com/W0nOBnF.jpg) is right now. I remember being so nervous *just walking in the place* when I was viewing the property for the first time. Like, I literally said internally "Hah never going in there!".


Two years ago I weighed 180 pounds. I was fat (I'm 5'7"). In about 4-6 months I dropped down to 140, and a few months after that I hit 133(I was 120 in highschool for reference). Since then, I've stayed in the 140's with ease. When I moved to this city(and this apartment), I began to enjoy all the various foods they had on offer and bloated back up to 150 in about 2 months. That was 2 months ago and I'm now 140 again, but I'm skinny fat and still know it. My plan was to hit 130 or so and see how I felt.



Tonight though, I just got a bug up my butt and went down there. I watched [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doT2FvAlmoU) called "I hate my body", where too body builders and two skinny kids get professional training to change their bodies. It was really inspirational to see both the lifters and the skinny kids work through their respective regimes. I'm on nights, so I went to this gym at a nice safe 4am. I had the place to myself.


I walked in, and just walked around the place like a cat does when you introduce it to a new space. I looked at all the stuff, tried to figure out what they do, and just be comfortable. I don't even have gym clothes yet so I was wearing a T-shirt from [one of my favorite bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN5NpaSbVQU), a pair of jeans, and some Circa's.



I hoped on the machine I knew I would be most familiar with, the stationary bike. When I was a kid I used to ride my bicycle everywhere, and [pretend it was a motorcycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCSWyCU-cEk), so I've always had a love affair with bicycles. When I was a kid, +30 mile rides were pretty commonplace. I started a 4 mile ride at an average speed of 11mph.


Right now I'm just trying to lose this extra 10 pounds, so I figured cardio is good for me. That 4 mile ride was a bit rough in spots(forgot what it feels like to push stuff and things and junk), but I enjoyed it a lot. I went over to grab a towel and a bottle of water, and then headed right back over to get another 4 mile ride in. This time at about 12 mph. I put on some of my favorite songs for motivation, I was [rocking the fuck out(wait till 1:09 brahs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1Gwtep2oXw). Shit felt so fucking good, I only wished I was really riding. My *actual* bike was stolen off my balcony a few months ago. It had flat tires. Like who the fuck wants a bike without tires? Dicks do, that's who.


I live on the second story. This dude climbed over the gate of my complex, climbed up to steal the bike, threw it 25 feet off the bitch and rode away on flat tires. What the actual fuck dude.



After I finished that my legs were feeling pretty damn well used, and I got curious about the other stuff. Stuff I would never have touched before. I went to the lat pull down and instantly broke it. I pulled it to the top kinda hard and it got stuck up there. Anyone know how to fix that shit? I just figured building management will handle it. I probably fucked someone's routine this morning. Sorry bro I'm new.



So I grabbed some dumbells to see how weak I was. I did two sets of 15lbs at 11 reps each to set a baseline. Also did some tricep extensions, 2 sets of 5 reps at 20pounds. I could barely do that last one.


I tried this crazy weird bar thing they have (there's a bar but it's on rails? And there's safety shit you can put up to keep it from falling to the floor. Looks like [this](http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/squat-machine__oPt.jpg)). Is that the squat machine I'm not supposed to curl in? I *so fucking* did that, haha whoops. I tried an overhead press on it with 25pounds on each side and managed one, quiet shakily I might add. Probably doesn't count as it's on rails.


I hit this ab machine they have which [looks like this](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/60169924704/2014_newest_T_5011_ab_machine_gym.jpg_220x220.jpg). I got 3 sets of 12 reps at 70 pounds which I was surprised and happy with. I went for a 1 rep max and got 100 decently, but 115 was too much and I couldn't get it to move.


After that I hoped back on the bike machine and road another 1.5 miles.




So, all in all, today I conquered my fear of the gym, rode 10 miles on the bike, found out how weak I was but got a nice baseline. I'm supposed to continue losing weight until 130 pounds, so I think it'll mostly be exercise bike from now until then.



I must say though, after I left, I felt so fucking good. So amazingly awesome. I can see why people get so hooked on this stuff. I used to hate straining myself when I was younger but right now I feel great. I love to make my legs work. I want to buy a new fucking bike and start racing (Although I'm about to buy a GSXR750 racebike specifically to start racing those this summer so that might take precedence). I want to joke to work, bike to work, etc, etc,


Oh, and my slam piece texted me and wants to hook up tomorrow. I feel awesome.



Thanks guys.Saw someone squatting in the curl rack today...I mean, wtf is wrong with these people?Soylent?Nice site design, but surely it would make sense to put calorie count in these recipes?My wrists are bent like that as well when squatting.  I've always just chalked it up as a flexibility issue.Ah ok, it's just that after the first month I was scared that my shoulders would be underdeveloped compared to the rest of my upper body. I started doing exercise for that, and I started doing more and more lol. Thanks, idk what I'm doing haha.Going to the gym is pointless. Its a waste of your fucking time. Learn to love your body for what it is.OP you say that going to a gym or aiming for strength isn't worthwhile at your age and with body, what do you mean by that? 14 is a perfect age to begin working towards any goals in the future.

Also read the /r/bodyweightfitness and /r/fitness FAQ and I'll link the 4chan/fit/ sticky post http://liamrosen.com/fitness.html. These resources are amazing! Seriously you can accomplish most goals of yours by ignoring everything else you ever read and only following what's in these links.10-12k on a rare occasion.  Usually more like 6k on weekdays and 8k on weekends.  Though there was a period where I was hitting buffets twice a day and, with in-between meals/snacks, I was hitting 10-12k semi-regularly.  Funny, I put on less weight (and it seemed to be leaner weight) than when I dropped my calories back to ~4k and grazed through the day (that was also sloppier/fatter weight).The low bar squat in general? Or just the way rippetoe explains it?Makes sense!  My fitbit adjusts my TDEE based on the days exercise but exercise calories burned are also inflated a bit in fitbit imo.Cool read! Thanks! This post wasn't at all to gloat or act like I'm some sort of Hercules. Also the reason I put that I've been lifting that long is because the first time I posted this it got removed because that part of the info was missing. Otherwise it wouldn't have been there. Also I'm not just going to up and compete because I think I'm awesome. I just think it would be something fun to do because I enjoy lifting so much. If this offended people or made them think I'm being an asshole that wasn't at all the intention. I just wanted to share that I'm happy I was able to be where I am.
Also I don't plan on remaining a "morbidly obese slob" I wanted to hit my strength goals then lose as much weight as possible.

I have quite a bit of lean mass, but also a little bit of body fat.  I look like Eric Lilliebridge, but smaller (225) and maybe a little softer.Ditch the power blocks and get Olympic handle dumbells.

They literally break your legs there every few centimeters, and you have to wear a stretching device while the bone is growing back together, filling the free space between the broken places. It is horribly painful, costs a lot of money, and it will just bring you a few centuries. Not worth it at all.No. My point is that once you have a healthy relationship with food you don't need "cheat" days. A diet is what you eat all the time, not your "10lb cleanse".

One day you'll realize your 6-10k calorie days don't fill that void in your heart.Have you read the book?You may still have some physical growth to do. Get your posture on point. You might even try petty tricks such as shoe lifts, different haircuts and clothing.

But after all, abide. Embrace it. Nobody gives a fuck about it but you (And if they do it's a surefire sign to dismiss them from your life).what don't you understand? the movement regardless of bar position still should and with enough weight will travel perpendicular to the ground.  The differences would only be where the knees/hips/shins end up which is dictated by stance and limb length. Speak for yourself...It tapers off extremely though. You can expect to get another cm or 2 at most. [source](http://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/childhood/parents/mch/mchgrowthbmiboy18yrs.pdf)There's a dude at my gym, I'm not sure what to make of him. He speaks incoherent shit in between sets, but he's strong as an ox.

"1-up! Let's go Ryan." **front squats 315** " are you kidding me? Garbage fucking form, get your head in this."

Honestly it's inspiring but sometimes he says stuff that doesn't even make sense and I'm convinced he's doing his best to scare all the oldies and noobs from the rack forever.Pretty sure he'd have me killed if I do so given that he does pretty much does everything with terrible formSomeone needs to make a .gif of him patting that guy's back lol.

Also makes me want to get a SQUATZ AND OATZ tattoo.

Great vid.Are there any pictures of Ripp on a cut out there?Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Sorry to disappoint but I am actually not a women so I think I'll have to change it soon haha. Yeah, his weight:weight_lifted ratio is atrocious.I eat a lot a training days and cook up some big meals so would like something where I don't have to put too much thought into for rest days and just get it out of the way, otherwise I will deliberate all day over what I want to eat.Last weekend I ended up with a nearly abandoned weight room too. I think I did end up roaming around doing random stuff just because I could for at least a half hour after my normal stuff. Wear heels. (   )Okay. Here is the thing. I have never liked the formula that mfp uses to convert the fitbit TDEE into the mfp magical height and weight based calorie calculation. Mine has always been inaccurate and jumbled so I stopped letting them sync.

 How long have you had the fitbit? Longer than a month? Great! You have an estimated TDEE! Now you can take a 500 calorie deficit off of that estimated TDEE from fitbit and use that as a manual calorie goal in mfp! Then as you use this estimated TDEE and log your weight loss, you can see if fitbit is accurate for you or not based on how much weight you lose.

Had it less than a month? Use what mfp tells you for the next month until you have a solid month of fitbit data and then you can start playing with the fitbit TDEE stuff to see how accurate it is (see paragraph above).

Don't get stuck in a loop of doing activity to have more to eat. That can be a dangerous game for some people. Now if mfp is giving you some ridiculously low calorie amount to use and you have had fitbit for less than a month, feel free to use a TDEE calculator from the FAQ in the meantime. No need to starve to death while you wait for fitbit data. ...why don't you just eat food...?

If they've already calculated their TDEE, the calorie calculation already takes their exercise into account. If they were to then go and put additional calories burnt (from exercises that would already be accounted for in TDEE), they'd be double dipping, so to speak.Showed up at the gym right at 6 am this morning to get a workout in before people show up. Then realized that my gym opens at 9 on the weekends......Does rip have a video tutorial on high bar?Uh. Nothing. Youre probably not done growing, most males continue to grow taller into their early 20sYou're basically limited by your genetics bud. There have been people who have had surgery that places rods in their legs to make them taller, however it is not covered by insurance and the rehab is excruciating.

On the bright side, shorter guys tend to be able to squat more, so enjoy dem gainz!!

In all seriousness,  don't worry about what you can't control and work on the things you can.I remember when I saw my first squat rack curler in the wild. Mesmerizing. And he had the pendulum form too, ridiculous. That wrist position correct? [Bent wrist](http://youtu.be/QhVC_AnZYYM?t=4m52s)http://niceme.meI'm laughing at the transformation your face went through during that workout. ;D

And now I'm doing the math and realizing *this* is how stuff at gyms gets broken. ;D
Thanks, really appreciate it!An empty gym is one of the most beautiful things in the world.

&amp;nbsp;

So I just joined new gym (Lifetime Fitness, it is noiice). So since its 24/7 decided to get in the gym this morning before work since the weather is supposed to be bad today.  Walked in and besides the people working just a couple cardio bunnies on other side of the gym. It was nice not having to say excuse me or work my sets around someone else. It was hard to stick to routine instead of just playing around.I say finally because for the past 4 months it's been my goal and truthfully it felt like forever. If I didn't have to put how long I've been lifting I wouldn't have but the first time I did the post it got removed for insufficient info. In hindsight I shouldn't have put that because it does seem like gloating which is not what this is about at all. It was just pure excitement. What shoes did you get?Thank you for clearing that up!So I'm at my university's gym and as usual, all 8 benches are taken. So I go up to a guy and ask how many sets he has left. He says 2 so I'm like great I'll just wait. 24 minutes later he's still waiting to start his second set. The guy literally stands there staring at the bar trying to do some Jedi mind tricks that will allow him to lift 225. F that guy[If he asks if you'd like to do some sprints, politely decline.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcu5sYxcEuo)"just do it"Squat, deadlifting, barbell bench, OHP. These are all major compound exercises you should be doing but to each his own. All of your sets seem to focus more on hypertrophy as well. I would recommend adding in some low-rep heavy weight sets at the beginning of your workout.well shit that's terrifying. make sure you don't comment on his form. My Dad and I created our own app for interval training because we didn't like the other apps out there.

We got an email on Thursday saying our app is being featured under the "Get in Shape" collection in the Health &amp;amp; Fitness section of the App Store!

Anyway, we want more people to try it out to give us feedback/ideas for some extra features (note that allowing each cycle to have different on/off times is in the works, as well as sharing a completed workout to Facebook).

It's free, with no ads or annoying rating popups, with a $2 upgrade to allow timers to be synched to iCloud for easier use on multiple devices.

Give it a try please!

http://itunes.apple.com/app/id957586938Push/pull split. Push: BP, Squat, OHP. Pull: DL, Weighted chins/pullups, rows.  2-3 workouts a week depending on my schedule. If I have some time I'll throw a couple of accessory lifts in as well but my focus is primarily compound lifts. Normally alternate volume/weight from week to week.
My diet approach is IF. Training days I workout fasted in the afternoon and if I am going for volume I might add simple carbs during the workout. I fast for 20 hours a day and eat from 4-8 pm, roughly. I try to eat 750-1000 calories over maintenance on training day as well as the day after. Days off, not including the day after training days I tend to eat 500 or so below maintenance. I used to track my calories but I don't really anymore as I have a pretty good feel for it now. I drink 3 or so beers a day as well.
Its not magic but I feel the intermittent fasting approach helps the minimize fat gain. In essence it is a cut/bulk approach, I just cut and bulk on different days, not different months.
The first 4 months I went from 195-210 or so and the last couple of months have been a bit slower.
Macros are basically high carb/protein on training days and days after. Higher fat/protein on off days.

Done with sufficient intensity it could interfere with your recovery, and thus your ability to squat heavier the next day, yes. If you keep the intensity and duration moderate, you may be fine.This fits in the same realm as 'you can't outrun a bad diet'

You can't outrun sitting all day. Hi everyone. My name is Chuck Gross. I was a fat kid growing up and by age 28, I was morbidly obese at over 410lbs.

On Fitocracy, I usually run 3 distinct courses:
Extreme Fat Loss, a group course which is habit focused lasting 8 weeks. A new course is starting on March 1st. Spots are filling up fast!
https://www.fitocracy.com/team-fitness/430/extreme-fat-loss/

Massive Fat Loss, a group course specifically for the obese/morbidly obese person with some weightlifting experience or willing to try. The dietary portion is based on low carb/keto/carb cycling.
https://www.fitocracy.com/team-fitness/428/massive-fat-loss/

1 on 1, personal/non-group course entirely personalized to a person's goals and utilizing direct email contact and Google chat and a quick turn around time for responses.

I welcome any feedback or questions! Thank you for reading!I'm saying I've never understood the rippetoe low bar squat.
But would making my legs tired on a rest day be counter-intuitive?For me, personally, the *longer* I stay seated, the worse I feel. My limit these days is about an hour and a half. *(depending on the time of year, I work out from between 6 and 12 hours per week, I'm 57yo)* If you work in a cube farm, get up and move around every few minutes. I used to have a long handset cord on my desk phone and would pace like crazy when on a call. I did this to burn off nervous energy rather than any attempt to counteract a sedentary lifestyle. But it did work. Many wireless handsets and headsets are available. I know of no research pointing to whether or not this will help. But, my joints and muscles feel better when I move around every hour or so. And...if it's better for my skeletal muscles, it's probably better for my cardiac muscle, as well. Also, Emergency dispatchers (911 operators in the US) have desks designed so the writing/keyboard surface, as well as monitor placement can be articulated from a low seated position all the way up to a full standing position. These operators are forced to stay at their positions for hours on end. The current [ergonomic dispatch furniture](http://www.xybix.com/ergonomic-solutions/dispatch-work-stations) designers offer differing heights (to be adjusted on the fly) to allow the operator to work standing, seated in a chair, a Swiss ball, etc. In the centers that I have worked around, the people that work from the seated position are typically obese, have poor health and eat all the junk food around them. The operators that articulate the work-stations to a standing position are leaner, fitter, seem more energetic. The question remains for the researchers....cause vs. effect. Bottom line...movement is life.Do you really think something from a computer is going to convince them? Eat more food with protein in it, it's the only thing you're going to convince them to buy for you. Saw same thing. Promptly explained to dude the proper use of the squat rack. He took it well. I got to do my squats.Why should someone ignore their exercise? It is a part of their TDEE.Are you exclusively in love with running for cardio?  I ask because treadmills will always have high maintenance costs and will always fail after a couple years of solid use (unless you spend thousands of dollars initially and hundreds on maintenance).  For cost effective home cardio you can't beat a concept 2 rowing machine.  Get one used, feed it 3 in 1 oil, wipe down the seat path, and you'll be giving it to your grandchildren.See the Getting Started section of the wikiSo, there are these 2 dudes at my gym, both well into their 30s, one quite obese and the other, who I'm assuming is his older brother, comparatively fitter.

Whenever they work out, they have 2 people to re rack their weights while around 7 more wait outside the gym doing fuckall. I always had a hunch that these 2 are bad news and a couple of weeks ago my suspicions  about them were confirmed. The older brother is a hardened criminal who, if rumours are to believed has spent several years in jail for extortion, kidnapping and murder charges where he killed 3 more people. He has had multiple cases registered against him and the ensemble of people who accompany him are his "security guards".

Just last week one of the "security guards" came in all blood soaked after roughing a guy up. These people are genuinely scary albeit an interesting addition to an otherwise normal gym.

People usually tend to clear the way for them even if it means that they have to cut short their set.

EDIT: Changed 3 years to several, don't know why I typed 3 in the first place.I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  That your meal plan is so awesome it depletes the need for cheat days? Maybe not bad for your liver, but if you are a guy then protein shakes are very bad for your sperm production. My cousin has a PhD in reproductive biology and she was telling me about it when I told her I used them.
If this does concern you, don't worry because after 70 days it's a whole new set of sperm in your body, just something to take into consideration. yep, after that i spent a few minutes feeling like everyone was giving me odd looks. then i wiped my lips with a wet wipe-another bad decision-because herpes and stuff.The results are not the same no. Although they can both make your legs tired.what are you sayin' though?

Jonnie isn't even doing a low bar squat, why are we comparing them? they are mechanically different movements. not to mention one is an athlete and the other is like fucking 60.Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Some people don't bother doing the run or gym, so that's the most unhealthy at one end.  What you do is better than nothing.  But then there are people that do too much, which is also unhealthy.  The goal is really a fine balance in the middle.

So long as you are doing something, and you are feeling good about it and yourself, you're good.You sound like a huge douchebag, especially with lifts that are nothing to brag about yourself.  Why hate on somebody lifting and working on getting in better shape.  Would you walk up to someone in the gym and run your mouth like you do online?  If so, I'm guessing you would get your ass kicked pretty fast.I was amped as fuck to go for 400 lb deadlift 1x5 this week - 4 plate work weight is something I've been shooting for forever.  The fourth rep comes and goes - I'm gassed but the beat's about to drop because I timed my set perfectly.  Started pulling that fucker for the fifth time and about half way up I felt an unfamiliar pressure below my waist - I shit my pants a little, but I'll be damned if I didn't finish that rep.

You ain't legit until you've pulled so hard you shit.... and now you haz da gym AIDz.
ok That's awesome man! I'm glad to hear it. http://gifatron.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/upset-jaguars-fan.gifSolid article, I'm now inclined to think you're right. Thanks for the concern and advice, friend.Personally I would save one meal for after you finish and have a snack or something at the first break.sometimes i get to focused on my workouts. i was having a nice aesthetics leg day; heavy leg press, extensions, calf raises. i finally just picked up my water bottle, took a way too long draught and went off to the barbell  which was miraculously free from use at the moment. it took a light set of deadlifts (135lb) and another two minutes before i remembered that i didn't bring a water bottle with me that day.I think that's normal too, whenever I do shrugs my left upper lip starts twitching like crazy sometimes I dunno whyI guess many powders are flavored artificially, if that's what your parents are concerned about. Maybe you can get an all natural, unflavored one, so that it literally is just basically dried milk. I went with the Jarrows brand and its got a great protein to calorie to price ratio too.mind sharing the post ..  you know ..for a friend Make no mistake, if I see him again I will try to give him some feedback. But he honestly didn't look like someone who recently started lifting. In my experience, people who have been training for a little while aren't very receptive to unsolicited advice from strangers.

I have helped newbies before and certainly will continue to in future.The final solution.I mean, I really think they weren't new. One was talking about supplements and had a tub of creatine and I also saw them benching quite a lot. It seemed like they should've known better.

If you've lost 17lb in 7 weeks, you're losing almost 2.5lb/week, not 1...Thanks, will do!It's still a carb and is counted for purposes for getting labeled, but it doesn't possess the same calorie count.

Sugar free syrup is an easy way to understand it.  My favorite brand is 35 calories.  The following nutrition information

* Calories 35
* Fat 0g
* Carbs 8g (7g from sugar alcohols)
* Protein 0g

Normal logic would tell you there's 8g of carbs so 8 x 4 = 32.  But your body can't get those calories from the sugar alcohols

So 8 -7 = 1 regular carb (4 calories)
And the 7g sugar alcohol left, so 20 / 7 = 2.85 (roughly 3) calories per each gram of sugar alcohol.

During the week, are your calories below maintenance and the weekends bring the average up?  If so, how far below?You're around the same size as I was a few months back, though I'm more than twice your age. That kind of approach has worked for me so far, I'm still in progress and expect to be for most of 2015.

Yes, your early big weight loss will mostly be water weight.  Remember that TDEE calculators are just an approximation, it's entirely possible that you'll need to tweak things slightly, so keep good records.

On exercise - I'd advise getting started with a strength program right from the beginning. It may take a few tries to find the right one - beginner programs tend to be written under the assumption that you'll be eating at a caloric surplus, which you won't be. Keep at it, results will probably be slow but worthwhile in the long run.Actually, I recently ordered the "Think deep, Squat deeper" shirt from Candito. So that oughta tick the guy off hahaFoam roll everything below your waist!Heck no. Unless running outside is completely not an option (cold weather isn't an excuse) then that's what you should be doing. Its more natural, allows your body to adapt better to elevation and surface changes and is more applicable to real life. cmon ... maybe there were new at the gym and really aren't that good orientated.
I mean , i just started going to the gym for the first time in my life ( my first week ) and i am paranoid because of people like you. i just see and make sure that i don't fuck up the gym etiquette everytime i do an exercise.
that's the reason i didn't wanted to start the gym in the first place ... but then i thought fuck it .. anyway ... what im trying to say is that be a little bit tolerant and helpful.. if you see something like this happen then go and tell the person... i would be more than happy to know when im wrong at the gym.

have a nice one How long have you been eating that little?  You *can* sustain metabolic damage from running a very deep deficit for too long.  How long has it taken you to lose 70lb?  Perhaps you'd see the same results with more calories.  What do your macros look like, PSMF?Makes sense. I'll look into rear delts exercises.

Totally unrelated: When I do side raises or windmill, a muscle under my right eye twitches. I've heard from others that it's the same with them.not a great story but i started at a new gym on tuesday which is a short 200m walk from my house. it's nice to have it so close by, and it has full bumper plates!I had this as well and got it checked by a doctor. I was told if you never experience any pain/it never gets any worse, then you should be OK. It just happens. But yes, work your rear delts more.

Face pulls for days What kind of progress/gains are you seeing?  How much of a deficit are you running through the week?You need Battlestar Gallactica Organics. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVKEl4Wxoqc

just sayin'You should get a t-shirt that says "ATG MF's!" and wear it from now on. ;D
It's easy to imagine that a short 5 minute walk every half hour or hour is good for your bloodflow, muscles, etc.

You also hear reports of people working in laboring jobs suffering bodily damage and advanced aging effects by doing too much physical work. On their joints for example.

Not really sure where I'm going with this. I just feel lazy if I am on reddit for too long after a days work, even if I've done a hard workout a couple of hours previously.First of all, that's not the way it works.  If you make extraordinary claims, you must have evidence.  If I say I squat 2000 lbs, and I advertise my services and make money based on that, it's up to me to prove it.  It's not others' responsibility to disprove it.  Alex has no evidence for extraordinary claims.

But it's likely that no one on earth ever in history who is his size, with his injuries, with his shoes has ever run a mile that fast.  You might claim he's a unique athlete, but there's absolutely no reason to believe that.  The only "evidence" he has is his word.

And his stories don't match up and don't pass the smell test. When he is confronted on that, he says he has a bad memory and is bad with details.  Really?  Every runner knows exactly what their prs are and when and where they happened.  And if you set a world record you think you'd forget when it happened.

In one interview he claimed to have run three marathons in the past two years.  In the next he said he'd run a 3:31 marathon (once again, no record of that).  In the next he said he'd only ever done one, years ago in 4 hours.  Really?  You can't remember running marathons?

I looked in to him because I was interested in the lifting/running combination.  His programs are solid.  But my BS detector went off almost immediately and the more I found out, the more ridiculous his BS appeared.  Nobody in the running world, nobody, believes him.
I've probably been watching too much of itLol im a man and i lift less than you.
Eternal cut though so that kind of gives me a justification, i also only lift for like 4 months from a completely sedentary lifestyle.    Send them to Mars to populate the red planet since they've discovered single sex reproduction? I am pretty proud of my squat form. I have had to work pretty hard to get where it is now. The other day between my sets of squats, one of the bigger guys in the gym walked up to me and told me that I should not go ATG on my squats because I am gonna blow out me knees. I was trying to be polite and told him that I wasn't squatting very heavy. He kept trying to convince me. I just nodded and went back to finish up. The squat rack faces the mirror. So, as I was doing my next set, I could see this dude just looking at me and talking to his friend pretty loudly about all that is wrong with deep squats. I just stared right back at him through the mirror as I was doing my reps. Unracked the weights and proceeded to walk right past him. I kind of feel proud of myself to hold my ground for what I know to be right!&gt; Nothing happened though

You have to 'mire back. They don't just suck you dry from across the room.
Congratz on the progress, keep it up, i go alone to the gym, and also lost some weight in about three months(for three months your weight loss is pretty impressive) its ok you can do it alone, but you can also look up bodyweight exercises if you wish, going alone gets a little boring after a while but if you just stick with it its worth itI have the same problem but with Side Raises, apparently it was because Rear Delts were lagging compared to my Front Delts creating an imbalance.

I've worked more on my Rear Delts and it has helped but not completely gone.They must be breeding. There is only one humane solution...Next time throw dumbbells at him when he is mid-set.Actually more of a rant, but since it happened just ten minutes ago, I'll post it overhere. Today when walking back home from the gym I noticed three guys mocking themselves about a disabled lady by whistling and shouting things like "Hey sexy lady!" and so on. At least now I have some new motivation - I will train so long and hard as it takes to beat up those guys I see them next time. After 3-4  months of doing some exercices without any programs and reading the thread "what was your biggest mistake as a beginner" I felt like I needed to stop doing all the machines and beginning a real program.

I took a rendez-vous with a coach and he spent 2 hours to show me the exercices of the first day of my 3 days program. I worked legs and triceps. This was the first time I did squats... and it fucking work!

The day after I had a party, when I came back home my legs hurt so much that I gave up and slept in a park.

Thanks /r/fitness! I saw TWO of these at the gym yesterday. Curling in the squatrack, I thought it was a myth, but no.^^  Money isn't an issue. It's more convenience. Awesome, congratulations! You must be really excited to start exercising. If you have the discipline to lose weight, you definitely have the discipline for working out, and you'll soon get addicted to the gym, I'm sure :) best of luck moving forward!http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/health/sitting-will-kill-you/

&gt; And yet, [a new study](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2091327) that's running in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that this kind of sedentary behavior increases our chances of getting a disease or a condition that will kill us prematurely, even if we exercise.

Take it for what it is. There's so many factors involved, I wouldn't say this is the end-all-be-all correct conclusion.

If you're eating right, and exercising, and your job forces you to sit, what are you supposed to do short of getting a new career ?

So you quit your computer programmer job for a construction job, and your co-worker drops a forklift of plywood on your head. Still not winning. ;D

Some other articles I've read that referenced this study, suggested one get up from their desk and walk around for 5 minutes every hour or two. They didn't however, provide a study showing that actually does anything.
Dude, you forgot to put your pants on once again...There is this particularly attractive lady that frequents my gym. She's the cherry to my workout shake. So as it goes I am squatting quite heavy for me as I'm on a 5x5 routine and am on my third set. I'm doing quite alright with no troubles whatsoever as I'm squatting. First rep good, second rep good, and then as I'm going back down she walks past me and I can see her in the mirror and I start staring at her as I go back down. Not really paying attention I leaned forward (as if I was trying to lean into her ass) and I just completely fell down. Thankfully I refuse to squat outside of the power rack for this very reason so the safety bars caught it and it made a LOUD noise so everyone (including her) turned to me as I was on the ground. I got up and had to deload the bar which was quite embarrassing. The entire situation was embarrassing.

**tl;dr** Squat for the booty, not squat while staring at the booty. Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

I'm a student and fitness addict, I have this profile to help track my physique progress. I've gone from 135lbs to 170lbs in around 2 years of lean bulking. If you're interested in following my progress, please follow me. (I'll follow you back)Lyle McDonald argues that bodyfat levels below 15% (males)/24-27% (females) are optimal for gaining muscle mass as opposed to body fat. Thus before going on a caloric surplus to build muscle, it would be wise to be approximately below these body fat percentages.

http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/muscle-gain/initial-body-fat-and-body-composition-changes.html/

That said, you should do resistance training no matter at what weight you are right now. If you are a beginner and/or overweight, you will gain mass also on a caloric deficit, and even if not, it will help you maintain muscle mass, is good for your health and also trains the neural aspects of strength.

I went through the same deal while I was trying to lose weight. Its going to be hard to get over, especially in the beginning, but here are some tips that I put to use that got me through the first few months.

1) I started going at times where the gym was literally empty. I had to move my schedule around a bit but I got to the gym and got it done. This might take a few trial runs to find the right time but keep at it.

2) put head phones in and don't look up. headphones with good music or audio book can submerge you into whatever you're doing. keeps your mind off other things.

3) remember even the guys or girls that look good are there for the same reason you are. to improve themselves. No one either fit or otherwise looks at an individual at the gym and thinks anything negative. "he's improving himself, good for him"

4) confidence only comes with time. once you start to see the gains will it become easier. It might take a little while but it will come. just put in the effort and give it time.

5) make sure you're having fun. If I wasn't feeling a day at the gym I left. there is nothing wrong with calling a day short. if you aren't having fun, or you aren't enjoying yourself. call it a day and start again tomorrow.


Keep it up man. you can do it if you put your mind to it.
People are making apocalypse jokes like there's no tomorrow.https://instagram.com/callangibbons/

Check out my instagram! I usually have a new post every couple of days about my powerlifting progressWill you be my dad?Went to Chipotle after doing shoulders and triceps yesterday and I was wearing a tank (because ya know, gotta show off them gainz). The girl in front of me in line was mirin HARD, it seemed like she was about to break her neck turning around every few seconds just to check me out. Nothing happened though and I'm just bragging but I think I might have finally made it bros.First week with squats shoes - they are amazing.  Never thought I would feel so stable and comfortable with ATG range of motion.You're not making much progress any more probably cause you're underestimating how much you need to eat?  You should require close to 4000 calories to bulk properly at your height/weightOK guys, it finally happened.

Over the years, I heard rumours of the existence of these creatures. Eyewitness accounts of them in their natural habitat, even amongst many of you here on fitit.
For so long I sought to see the majestic spectacle for myself, and it was denied from me for so long that I began to doubt they even existed.

There I was, resting between sets of deadlifts, when it sauntered up to the rack next to me. Tall and lanky, but with enough muscle on its frame to suggest that it was experienced enough in the gym to know how to lift some decent weight.
It moved quickly and with purpose, its gaze focused on the rack.
It clearly knew what it wanted to do and what it had to do to achieve it.
It took the barbell off the pins and lowered it onto the safety bars, "he's probably going to do some rack pulls" I remember thinking to myself.
It proceeds to load up a 5kg plate on each side, "OK, he's probably doing rows, with a light warmup set, fair enough".
It gets behind the bar, double supinated grip ("well thats not the normal grip for... no... is... is he?") and then begins to CURL THE BAR IN THE SQUAT RACK!

I was stunned, completely speechless. I had dreamt of seeing this for so long that I felt like I was looking at a mythical beast.
But there it was, after almost 10 long years of searching, right in front of my very eyes: The rare, extremely elusive (for me at least) Rack-Curler.

My reaction was not of anger as I had imagined, but of curiosity (with perhaps some pity mixed in).
My mind was flooded with questions, questions I knew I would not have the courage to ask.
Why did he feel he was worthy to use up the holiest of space in the gym for barbell curls?
Why not use the pre-set barbells no less than 6ft behind him?
Did he know how bad his form was? My back ached just watching him.

It didn't even enter my mind to help him, I just sat there watching like Sir David Attenborough would watch a wild animal. I couldn't startle it, in case interrupting its ritual would cause it to erupt in a rage of curse words and flying dumbells.

He proceeds to knock out 3 sets of the most god awful curls I have honestly seen in my life and then once finished, wandered off into the forest of pin-loaded machines on the other side of the gym, never to be seen again.

And of course, he didn't re-rack his weights.

**TL;DR:** Saw someone curling in the squat rack for the first time ever. Almost shed a tear. Unco Same is looking good.Well, prior to getting the exertion headaches I would usually use Excedrin to treat migraine-type headaches. It is just aceteminophen and caffeine. It worked really well. But the exertion headaches are a totally new thing for me; they feel different from other migraines. They started about 6 days ago while I was doing push ups. I usually workout every other day, so I'm in fairly good condition, but the exertion headaches have stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read elsewhere that it is probably a good idea to take a longish break from heavy exercise and, like you said, reduce caffeine intake. After I ween myself off the caffeine, I'll try taking a naproxen sodium prior to working out. To be honest, though, I'm pretty freaked out about the whole thing. The headache scared me really badly. I know now that it is probably not serious, but they are still super painful and keep me from continuing any exercise. Seen a lot of deadlift form checks on Reddit lately. This video helped me out more than any other. I think its better than someone rambling on here preaching nonsense. check it out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyRiw2b8yI4Maybe he just likes food. That's the only way i think it makes sense.Nothing much to share, but made some great friends since starting (I'm a new years resolutioner) and ran my first 5k today! I don't know if I'll be able to walk tomorrow though...This video helped me increase my weight and I no longer have back pain when lifting. I went up 50 LBS just from switching my technique. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyRiw2b8yI4
That is completely against what you just said!

&gt;lower rep ranges yield the exact same size gains as long as volume is equal

This just is not true. Higher reps = More size as long as we are talking about moderate rep ranges and not the extreme 100 example I used earlier.

Why would you lift for strength in curls? Well if what you said is true and size and strength are both optimal in lower rep ranges then you would lift for strength in accessories in order to be able to increase the total volume you can lift in said movement.

But that isn't the case and you are wrong.No a forward lean puts more pressure on your quads and knees.  It looks like you are doing a high-bar back squat, and the chest should be tall and very much straight up as you can get.

Throw some plates under your heels to help with your flexibility.  Lots of people squat in Olympic lifting shoes to help create a better angle.  Small 2.5kg plates work if you don't have the shoes though.When I first started lifting I was pretty self-conscious about my form and what not, and avoided peak hours at all costs. I started going at 4-5am for a month or two, played around with all the equipment figuring out what machine was used for what, and that make me burst out of my bubble. Just knowing what the different machines were used for, and how to use them correctly was a significant confidence boost. Thanks for the guide. I've been working on my pullups for the last 6 months. I'm almost at my goal of 4x10 with a 2min wait between sets. Few weeks ago I managed 3x10 and 1x8, today I did 2x10 and 1x8 and 1x6.
At the start I couldn't even muster 1 pullup. I've really started to like pullups, it has made me really aware of my back, where before I didn't even know how to use or 'flex' my back.
I started by doing chin ups and neutral grip pullups first.Get it cheap from Craigslist. Many people did exactly what you fear will happen with you. At least you would be getting a possible clothes rack cheaper.I use LiftRep and haven't had any issues with it. I'm pretty happy with FitNotes. No frills but works for me. I used the SL app while on that program but needed something new when I switched it up.

There was also a post the other day in /r/Android about a new workout tracking app someone developed (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2wfquj/my_material_design_fitness_tracking_app/). I haven't checked it out myself but the comments seem positive enough from those who already tried it out. The dev seems pretty responsive to suggestions as well. How big is the gap between your programmed macros and your daily intake? Hint: if you can't answer that question in 5 seconds, you don't need protein powder... You need to examine your diet.In my current position, we don't have the luxury of set break times, so we try and squeeze in a meal or two in-between down-time. That being said, I like packing something that's quick and easy to eat, yet nutritious at the same time.

My lunch-time work meals lately have been:

* Ham/Turkey sandwiches packed with veggies on Ancient Grain bread (yum!)
* Chicken breasts (chopped up into little cubes) w/ Corn, and whatever other veggies are in the fridge. You can sub the chicken with Steak and Fish to change things up week-to-week.
* Blended oats w/ a scoop of protein powder in milk/water makes for a quick and filling snack.
* Chicken/Fish mixed into a caesar salad.
* Trail-mix / mixed nuts make for a quick snack, same with fruits.
* Lamb/Goat w/ brown rice and potatoes.

That's all I've got for now.


Like the other posters said, go light until you've nailed the technique. Also have a look at Alan Thrall's series on Youtube. His deadlift video was excellent for a beginner like me. The three things that really improved my technique and cut down on back bowing:


* tensing up and 'pulling down' into the correct position
* taking the 'slack' out of the bar before the lift
* don't think of the excercise as "lifting a bar off the floor'.  Think of it as 'pushing the earth downwards until my legs are straight.'

Hope that helps! I've only been doing this a couple of months though, so take what i say with a pinch of salt.If you are doing SL 5x5 then you do 5 sets of your work weight. And several (I do ~3-5) sets of warm up weight, all with increasing weights. Oh, I get that side of it for sure. Just OP is talking about doing cardio so that you are able to stomach more calories.... which seems a little self defeating. Sure, you might get to 2500 calories do some cardio and then have a greater appetite to reach 3500 calories, but now you actually need 4000 calories.

Numbers made up just to illustrate that doing cardio to increase net calories is a bit like 1 step forward 2 steps back. Not to say that it won't work for OP but I think for most people finding it hard to eat enough food, doing cardio to increase appetite isn't going to help overall. Ur retarded if you think you're going to teach me anything about anything.  Congrats on typing 200 words of absolutely no meaning to anyone.  Just how many times a day do you look at your own reflection and masturbate to porn?

Also two things.  One the article you are using, while I considered actually reading it, didn't do to the fact that it quoted no reliable sources and was outdated and even wikipedia stated:
This article needs attention from an expert on the subject
This article needs additional citations for verification.
So no, I'm not going by that article.
Second, your ability to write, reason, and maintain a line of thought that doesn't obviously just pertain to furthuring your own narcissistic point of view is just laughable.  I only read the first couple lines but, just what are you going for here?  Most conceited asshole with least amount of actual facts of the year award in the douchebag hall of fame contest, held every year in Alpha Male Kingdom of All That Masturbates Profusely and Without Equal?
I don't often write people off as being too dumb to give an actual response to, but you won in that regard.
At least retarded people are actually retarded, they have an excuse.  It takes people like you to take that retardism to the next.

Also while I'm aware of the fact of saying anything to a person like you is arguably an intense waste of time, the FIRST LINK you gave me, is a bullshit website article, written by a nobody, using facts from nowhere, quoting no reliable medical science whatsoever.Actual science says yes.But for me, from a psychological perspective (aka broscience) I'd say no. I tend to be like "oh ill just cut these vegetables so I make room in my macros for another couple of sweets", which is bad for overall healthIt's just that it's in the form of casein, which digests much slower than whey protein.Seconded. Bodyweight fitness is what you're looking for.Sounds like you're on the right path. Looks like you've come to realise that too big a caloric deficit is not only unhealthy bur unsustainable.

When you miss your gols for a day (overeat) don't beat yourself up too badly over it. It's going to happen, and the odd day here and three wont make much difference anyway. Just keep hitting your numbers and keep yourself moving. The combination of weights and cardio is exactly the right thing for someone your size to be doing.

While you want to be minimising your muscle loss, also don't obsess too much over that either. getting the fat off is the goal here and should be your primary concern.

~~That sounds like it's a syncing issue between Fitbit and MFP. Did either of them have an update recently that may have triggered the issue? You can try unpairing them and going through the setup process again.~~

~~If it continues, you should probably contact Fitbit customer support and explain what you're experiencing. They may be able to shed some more light on the situation.~~

Edit: Wait, I just re-read what you wrote a little more closely. Are you saying it's only logging 85 calories burned from exercise (walking/running)?

If you're looking to lose weight, stop taking your exercise calories into account. Calculate your TDEE, subtract calories accordingly, and eat at a deficit. If you walked an extra mile one day, great, bonus. But don't treat those calories like you have more to eat for that day. Without having any other details about you and your goals, that would be the overarching message. Ask in /r/Parkour since I don't think that many people in /r/science or other subreddits will be able to help much.But dem hot pocket gainz are mad gainz brah ;D
You don't need to take protein. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGXfBta2T5Aman coles' bottled water is the shit. so cheap for a 24 pack. I personally prefer dumbbell rowing, but whatever floats your boatAlso:

&gt; Weight: 330A week ago I released my first Android app, Chrono List. It is a simple and intelligent manager for all your different interval timers. The app is completely free and without ads. An Android Wear app is also planned where one can take all their saved timers on their watch.

[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marks.chronolist)You sound fat.Ask them if Little Miss Muffet had liver problems.

On a serious note, whey is just a component in milk that is separated in the process that makes cheese. Nothing in it is more chemicals than milk or cheese. It's very likely your parents eat more "chemical-rich" foods when they microwave a hot pocketThere are actually some claims that excessive consumption of protein leads to liver problems.

http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/three-problems-associated-much-protein-intake-6546.htmlbecause its far easier to do 3 sets of 10 than 10 sets of 3. High reps are superior for achieving total volume if size and aesthetics is the only thing you want, and literally don't care about your numbers. Bodybuilders don't care about their numbers. They COMPETE in how they look.

Why would you lift for strength in your cable flies, bicep curls and tricep pushdowns? no one cares how much anyone can move in those. Their purpose is to help make your muscles larger, so that they can become stronger in the major movements.

If you have the time, watch this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVkGPJ9zAsc[This paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/) says 30 minutes of moderate intensity. So maybe back off a little but push a bit harder than your 40 minute sessions? I personally like to do a 5 minute warmup, 20-30 minutes moderate, 5 min cool down, and definitely feel energized and clear headed after. It seems like you are already noticing some benefits from your 40 minutes, so maybe mix it up on different days. I also have anxiety and depression and I would like to mention that both meditation and yoga have helped bring me relief as well. Could you link a source? Why not just lift for strength in your accessory and isolation work as well though? And why do body builders and powerlifters continue to focus on different rep ranges if this is the case?

**Edit:** Here are several studies and articles that suggest the contrary and lower weight high reps results in more size: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012033#pone-0012033-t002

http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/layne45.htm

http://www.doctorpg.org/how-many-reps-to-build-muscle.html

Several studies have shown what you say is true in untrained individuals but not in trained individuals. This is, in layman's terms, 'noob gains' i.e. when you are untrained you experience drastic increases in size no matter what range you lift in.

I've been searching and reading for half an hour now and I can pretty much conclusively say that you are wrong on this.No, you've understood perfectly fine, I don't think the OP has though.  I generally do little/no cardio on a bulk (only for purposes of flushing lactic acid out of muscles).Yeah, vegans don't get to enjoy bacon.  There's an upside, though: they don't fund the torture and death of animals used for meat/dairy.  Pretty good trade.Consider using dumbbells instead if you can. I started doing bench press using Smith machine too, was progressing very fast, but when I switched to the regular bar I realized that I struggle to stabilize the weight and had to deload. Really?
TILYour parents are idiots. They could fix their ignorance on this issue with a quick Google search, but like many idiots, they'd rather stay ignorant than actually seek answers.

Learn an important lesson here. Always Be Learning.Weak core could be to blame. I recently failed a 1rm attempt due to the forward lean. You might want to add beltless front squats to your routine if you don't already, they should help you learn to stay more upright. [Why form is key in the gym](http://www.fitbodyquest.com/why-form-is-key-in-the-gym/)

Latest post about my journey and how I found that concentrating on form is much more imperative to your progress than throwing up weights that are too heavy for you. Have a read. You are missing a critical component of weight training: rest. Your muscles need time to rest, because that is where they rebuild and grow stronger. When you work the same muscles every day, they can never improve, they are always trying to just keep up.I doubt you can convince them, parents love to be right and refuse to be wrong. If they won't believe you, can't you just buy it without them knowing? Although I don't see the need for extra protein if you have just started lifting.Watch the scales and watch how you look in the mirror. Not liking the way things are going? Change up your calories and either eat more or eat less.

This is really a question you need to be asking yourself. Somebody in a thread elsewhere said "bulk until you hate the way you look / cut until you hate life"

If you're after strength gains, just make sure you're eating back the calories you burn off from running - again - watch the scale/mirror. Best of luck!I don't think it is that they put muscle on faster, but adding 1kg of muscle on a shorter guy will likely show a bigger difference than 1kf on a bigger guy. I think that is why smaller guys might seem to get bigger faster.If you already have that expectation then it will most likely become a self fulfilling prophecy.

I have happily run half marathons outside, but after 5-10min on a treadmill I am ready to bail.Ive just started week 7, have added dips, chin ups and pull ups. About to add barbell roll outs and candle sticks (eventually dragon flags) as my core is becoming a limiting factor on squatsI really like having a good preworkout. Just down it. 1. It'll be wasteful if you don't go after already drinking it. 2. Makes your workout feel amazing and you chase that each time you go to the gym.Do you wear headphones? If not, try it out.  I don't suffer from anxiety, but I imagine being able to tune out the surrounding world helps.

Maybe try setting a smaller goal to get over the initial fear. Just go in and hit the treadmill for like 10-20min and see how you feel after that.

If you don't think you can overcome the anxiety on your own, definitely talk to a GP.Realtalk: you're a fucking asshole to your core

Who gives a shit what his numbers are? He is in the gym, he is lifting, and he is working on losing weight. 1000 lb club is a milestone and he is proud. If you don't like it, then downvote the thread and fuck off.Y'all too tall. If your ass were a bond villain you'd go round dropping cocunuts on people while making out like you a palm tree. And about diet not thinking about it won't get you your asthetics as fast as you want.

Studies have shown that lower rep ranges yield the exact same size gains as long as volume is equal. That is why the more intelligent method of training is beginning your day with strength oriented training for your major movement, then doing your accessory movements and isolation work for your huge volume work.If I were you I would go take a look at /r/bodyweightfitness  it has a great beginner routine in the sidebar. If you want to train endurance I would go for 12-15 reps before you move on to the next exercise.
If you do cardio it also says how you can combine it. Good Luck.

EDIT: its also really cheap the only thing you need is a place to do pullups and a place to do rowsDrink your calories. It's much easier and convenient really. If you got time to cook, spend a couple hours in a weekend making your own protein bars.  It can be done fairly cheap, and I saw some once that had 3-500 calories a piece with like 20-30g protein. Thanks for the honesty :). Time to go look up some programs!Really? As in 100x1kg is going to have the same result as 1x100kg?

Not proven but widely accepted? It's what body builders and powerlifters have been doing for generations isn't it?

Time for my own foolish Friday. What is the alternative theory? I mean the different rep ranges obviously have differing results.

**Edit:** http://en.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1bly8t/strength_size_and_the_truth_about_rep_ranges/Not all foods are high in macro nutrients. Reaching your daily protein goal might end you up with way more calories than you actually require for a slow/medium bulk. Burn those off with cardio. I am a vegetarian and this is what i do.Well, I'm not a deathfat seeking validation on a fitness forum so at least I've got that going for me.Uhh, the curds contain 80% of the protein content of milk and it certainly isn't just fat... I have no interest in competing. I just lift to be strong. Congrats but, "finally" when you've been on it for only 7 months? Feels bad manWish I could help you dude but the problem you have is retarded parents.  Saying whey caused liver problems is like saying water gave you a stroke or you got a heart attack from eating bread.  Whey is protein derived from milk.  It's food.  Just food.  Do some googling on your own, i'm sure someone somewhere has done research on what I consider to be a retarded subject.I understand your thought process when someone doesn't get where his lifts actually are compared to his size, but at least he's actually lifting.

You're right that you wouldn't be competitive. There's no reason not to compete though. On that note, a coach would tell you to put on weight if you wanted to be seriously competitive.I haven't done a lot of those exercises tbh. The ab wheel is good and you can get them very cheap. It's an effective tool, so I recommend it but if you're having good results without it, keep going I guess.or just go see the sunA pound of fat has 3500 calories but you can drop 15 lbs in a day if you cut water and take diuretics. Which he probably didn't do but over 4 months of cutting your going to have less in your intestinal tract anyways which is kind of a similar situation. Same with the water in the muscle and fat and intestines.Sorry to say this , but this is just a bunch of exercises put together without a real concept.  That is what usually happens as beginners and that is the reason people advise to pick well designed programs from professionell coaches. Why do you need so much ab work ? Your abdominal area is just as much of a muscle as every single other. There is no need to do about 100 sets every single day. Even top Casthlenics people do split their workouts into bodyparts or do full body workouts with each bodypart for a few sets.

I think no one will advise you on that written down charter. I'm sorry but you can go for westside barbell program or any other programs towards strength for athletic.

All normal weightlifting routines carry over alot to casthlenics. Your body is an adaption machine. The best way to get better at bodyweight exercise is to overload, and the best way to overload is doing weightlifting. So maybe you do 2 day's of weightlfiting full body workouts and 1 day or 2 calisthenics where you can practise any particular movements.

Or pretty sure /r/bodyweightfitness can help you moreI don't know if I've misunderstood the idea of a bulk, but isn't the idea that you are eating in a calorie surplus? i.e. the more work and more calories you burn during your day, the more you have to eat to remain in a calorie surplus?

Whey is literally dried milk. Yeah, that's the plan. I was just looking for a program with less squats. I decided to try out 5/3/1 BBB and see how that feels.It's not good if you can't get it up at your age.Congratulations ! This is seriously impressive ! I have a question though, do you still drink occasionally or did you cut it off?http://examine.com/supplements/Whey+Protein/

"Whey does not harm the liver or kidneys, but it can exacerbate pre-existing damage. People with damaged livers or kidneys should exercise caution when increasing protein intake quickly without the guidance of a doctor."It's a good opportunity but be aware he made his gains while taking AAS so his training methods would differ massively from a natural.

My page, updated daily with motivational pictures, information about nutrition and training and pictures of my current physique.1. I did follow the formula, 130kg*7kcal=910kcal deficit. Im going with 950, which is very close.

2. All right, will do.

Thank you for your response, I appreciate it.

**EDIT**: So my math is really not that off, thank you for the confirmation. Also, yeah, I will recalculate the numbers, thanks for the reminder! I don't understand why people are so worried about their asthetics after stronglift's or any beginner program. Just use the time in the early 6 month to skyrock your strength and then afterwards you can still do the phat and get newbe gains all over your body. It is not like you waste 6 month or 3 . You will maybe not develope same asthetics as someone who does a split in the beginning with high volume, but in the long run lets talk about 2 years or 1 and a half you will get ahead of him.

Lifting and bodybuilding or powerlifting is not something that developes overnight. The most important thing is patient and to plan your future 2 - 4 years ahead. There is no shortcut. Plan long term and you will enjoy this sport alot more. Also you won't sweat stuff so much, you know you have time and also if you fuck up for like a few training sessions you have so much more time in your life to archive a great physique and power strength.Nothing definitive but check out this article: http://m.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-does-heat-affect-fat-burning
Fwiw,  for the same speeds, I notice my heart rate and RPE is usually higher when the weather is hotter. I just love to eat I don't give a fuck what it is, potatoes pasta rice brocolli egg. Cutting is the worst bro :(&gt; A) Am I on the right track here? If not, what should I change?

Overall, yes. Some tips ...

1. [Follow this formula](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq) for losing fat at a maximum rate while keeping / gaining muscle.

2. Start lifting following a program as soon as you can. Do some light to moderate cardio immediately after your lifting. 30 minutes on a bike, as an example. Elliptical, treadmill, etc are fine too. Whatever works for you.

You can only lose fat so fast ( that math formula ) before you also start to lose muscle, and your deficit can come from exercise, or diet, or both, so you shouldn't feel the need to starve yourself, or only eat 2 meals a day, or any other gimmick that promises "rapid weight loss."

At 286 lbs, the formula says you can keep / gain muscle at 0.7% body weight loss per week. 0.007 x 286 = 2.002 lbs per week. Each 1 lb of fat is approximately 3,500 calories, so 2.002 x 3500 = 7,007 calories per week, or a daily deficit of TDEE - 1,001.

As you lose weight, those numbers change, so be sure to recalculate them. No need to do this obsessively, but once a week, or once every 2 weeks would be fine.

&gt; In my experience, I lose weight faster, especially in the beginning. Is it mostly water I lose over the first few days/weeks?

The first week or 2 most people lose weight at an accelerated pace, and it's mostly water. This is why all those diet programs on TV promise everyone they can lose "up to 5 pounds in your first week !" Ignore it. The above math shows what you should be losing in fat each week.

Good luck and much success.
How much can you squat ? I ask this because where is no strength power there will be no explosive power. It is always advised to start building strength before explosive power.

It's simple physique Power (P) = Force (F) x Velocity (V) So how do we get P if we don't have enough F and V ? Right you get it.

There are different ways probably to force the F AND V but squatting would be the fastest and most efficent way. When you got a decent strenght base you can work on V more to P.

You can just develope as much explosive power as you have in your trunk as POWER.

Westside barbell Program's are great to develope both at the same time.

Many powerlifters can jump pretty high without even working directly on their vertical jump. It all carry's over to jumping from squatting.

In Westside you have Dynamic effort day's and Max effort wich will help you to get a really good strength level in a short amount of time, if you can affort the work you have to put in.

It's not advised to do Dynamic work while squatting 3 times a week you will soon stall out since alot of vertical jump or death jump exercises are really taxing.

TLDR ; would advise looking into westside barbell program for athletesYour submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

In particular high LDL ("bad cholesterol") and low HDL ("good cholesterol") have been shown to be associated with a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular events -- which basically means heart attacks. This has been well demonstrated in a number of large population based studies, the most famous of which is the Framingham study, but there are many others.

Based on this knowledge, doctors in the 1970s started to tell their patients to eat less cholesterol. This was based on the assumption that cholesterol that we eat will raise the cholesterol in our blood. It was a reasonable assumption but it turns out to not be true. It turns out there is no good connection between the cholesterol that we eat and the cholesterol levels in our blood.

There is however a connection between certain saturated fats (especially trans fats) and blood cholesterol levels.  Which is what Boonkadoompadoo is referring to. I don't know the references for this fact, but I suppose I could research it if I wasn't lazy.

Source: I know shit. Yeah Bench is only in workout A , OHP and DL in workout B with CGBP as a 3x8 accessory I'm currently doing SL to develop a strength base after being on a 4-day split for several months. I adopted the powerlifting stance for my bench press as Medhi advised but noticed that I wasn't getting as much activation in my chest as before. If my long-term goal is aesthetics, should I nix the powerlifting stance for the rest of my SL run?Dont mess with the program for atleast 6 months brother,after the first few weeks i promise you it will fuck you up,once you start getting into bigger weights and nearer your max's all those extra exercises will go out the windowNobody cares whether you subscribe,  or why. Oatmeal , idk man but usualy my morning routine is like this :

90 g oatmeal with a banana + almond milk 400 ml+ peanutbutter. 50 g natural cereals

some rice protein from myprotein. ( i have allergies against all milk products) + 200 g strawberry's + 200 almond milk + cashewbutter+Oatmeal  : I blend it in a mixer and just shove it down in the morning.

Sometimes also some scrambled eggs with toast.

And usualy my other 2 meals are 1 meal pre workout . Smth like rice + beens + or meat + veggies , i just devide into 2 halfes 1 for pre workout because i like to have smth in my stomach and one after.

If I would need more calories i would just cook more rice potaotes or what ever your carb source is. Easy life easy gains.

That gets me in about 2 meals around nearly 2k  calories depends if i take more fruit oatmeal or not. And i need to eat like maybe 20 mins ?

And if you can't get that sometimes in just eat a pizza lol . It's maybe not as nutrition rich but it's worthy to get your macros in.

Realtalk: This is not at all impressive, especially if you're thinking of competing sometime soon. I'm  5' 10" 170lbs. (i.e. basically half your weight) and my 1RM bench is 260, deadlift 365, and (high bar hams-bouncing-off-calves) squat 295. I would not even be competitive at my local meets in the 165 lb. class. Go [here](http://www.strengthstandards.co) to see how you're actually doing.

Furthermore, saying you have "finally" achieved that "elusive" 1000lb. total after "7-8 months" of lifting is spitting in the faces of normal people who have taken years of dedication and hard work to achieve that goal whereas for you it was largely just the result of walking around as a morbidly obese slob.

5'10''Wow.  What a coincident.  We lift the same amount of weight for the same amount of time, and have the same question.

If someone wants to take them he or she will hardly stop because someone on the Internet said so. That is why talking openly about them can promote responsible use and also lowering adverse effects.
Talking openly ahout it is also good to safe noobs from thinking they are hard-gainers.

*7716, if you want to be like that &gt;So what I've gathered from the comments is that I was informed (misinformed rather) by a colleague who said creatine has a certain level of water weight retention inherent in its use (not ideal for a cut).

You weren't misinformed, this is true. But retaining water weight is irrelevant for cutting. For two reasons:

* You'll gain it back once you restart creatine anyway, and...
* Cutting is about losing fat; water retention doesn't matter.

If anything, the water retention means you *definitely shouldn't* stop taking creatine during your cut, because then you'll have a harder time figuring out what's actual progress and what was just transient changes from temporarily stopping creatine.

The exception here is if you for some reason need to care specifically about the number on the scale, rather than actual body composition - perhaps because you're in some kind of weight loss contest. Bodybuilders also sometimes stop creatine leading up to a contest, because they're optimizing what they look like for one day and not so much the rest of the time. If you don't fall into one of these two categories, you should probably keep taking creatine.Or, being 16... When hormones are running wild and you're seemingly unbreakable.I dont think you can.

My dad is a cyclist and has always been super fit and active (1-2 hours or even more on long cycling days of cardio a day, no exceptions), we have always eaten healthy and he raised me to be very attentive to physical health and fitness. At 51, he had a major "widow maker" heart attack while cycling. It was due to high cholesterol. He's 165 lbs and 5'11". He's always been the fittest and healthiest eating person I know. The doctor said that had it not happened while he was working out, he most likely would not have survived. He was found passed out on the side of the road by a passing runner.

He had to get a stent put into his major artery and they tested his cholesterol and it was some of the highest they'd ever seen. His grandfather had a heart attack and died at 51 (eery) and his mother had high cholestorol. They tested me. I was 17 at the time, 5'7" and 125 lbs and a distance runner for my high school. My levels were through the roof, and this was 5 years ago. My brothers were also ridiculously high and he's 6'1" and 170 lbs, also an athlete.

All 3 of us have to be careful now. It's insane! All of our friends and family were shocked because we are known for being an athletic and healthy family.

It can happen to anyone! Good luck to you!

You can create your workouts and then update the weights used and total reps as you go through your workout. It also remembers what weight and reps you did in your previous session.
It's free but if you want the paid version you get features like graphs which show your progress over time too.cutting will slow your progress, no way around it. Try a lower volume program (sets of 3 perhaps) and you may be able to see some progress on it.This worked for me, it may for you.  Everyone is different.

My opinion you're doing bench too much.  Try this and see if you get the results I did.

Stop benching 6 days a week, do 2.  Spread them out so they are about even on rest days, best you can dividing 7 days in half.  Say Tuesday and Friday.

Do 5 sets, 8 reps (5x8).  Less days but more volume and heavier on those days.  If you can do 5x8 then it's too light, add 5-10lbs.  Add enough weight that you can only get 3x8 completed and your last 2 sets fall short because you just can't get out 8 reps.  Then your 4th and 5th set do as best you can getting 5 or 6 reps, maybe.  Keep doing that weight every time you go until you get 5x8.  Once you get 5x8 increase the weight.  I went up 10lbs every time I increased.  Once you go up in weight keep doing that weight until you get 5x8 again.

Following this routine I went in 1 calendar year from a max bench of 180 for only about 2 sets of 8.  To 300 for a full 5x8.Why not get something like [this]( http://www.amazon.com/Magnet-Bicycle-Indoor-Exercise-Trainer/dp/B004I576SM )?

That's most likely your problem, your improving, but improving in the wrong area.

Much better results come from using more common rep Strength building rep schemes i.e 5x5, 3x5, 8x2. This allows a person to go heavier with their sets, typically the rest between sets is longer.

You might consider to use percentages when lifting.

If it were a 5x5 - a few warm up sets with just the bar and maybe one at 40% of your 1RM,  then get into your working sets, for example 65%, 75%, 80%, 80% ,80%

Most people, who don't know what they are doing just go up in weight on every set. And don't actually lift more weight, (if you added it up) than if you stuck to using percentages.

Accessory work is IMO crucial to improving your bench. Two days a week tops, typically and strength day, then a high rep, speed day.

Here is a list of some accessory exercises that have helped me the most in improving my bench. I don't personally do much else.

Floor press - works your lockout, with this exercise you have a smaller range of motion than a normal bench, and as a result go heavier. Note, you will need a spotter, and it's best to do this in a power rack.

Tate press - great strength building triceps exercise

Skull crushers - great strength building triceps exercise

Bradford press - As a female, you will have a slightly wider grip than a man, and use your shoulders more than triceps in the lift. This exercise works both your front and rear delts, and is great for the shoulders.

Deficit pushups, use weight plates if need be, work the negatives if you don't have them yet.

Pendlay row - Your back needs to be strong for bench as you use a lot of your back muscles in the bench press.

High rep Banded rows and banded triceps pull downs, also help a lot, flushing the muscles with blood as a good finisher.

I do cross country in the southern US, and it gets pretty hot here in the summer (avg probably 35C). If im doing a short run like 10k or less i dont really change anything, but if you are doing more than that you should definately find some way to rehydrate halfway through, whether its a water bottle or you just stop at some random building. Other than hydration, just keep in mind that the heat will slow you down significantly. You probably wont be gettingany PRs past 30c.starvation mode is stupid hard to achieve voluntarily.

One is that carbs cause insulin levels to rise faster, and peak higher, than either protein or fats do. When this effect wears off, there can be a sudden crash.

Now, if you're just sitting at your computer, this is arguably not a good property of carbs. But if you just finished running a marathon, or finished a weight lifting session, carbs can help replenish your glycogen stores and prevent you from feeling tired and provide energy.

So like any tool, you can kill yourself with carbs, or reach new levels of performance with them, just like a hammer you can build a house with, or smash your hand with.

As for 'preventing your body from tapping into fat reserves' ... no. Eating above TDEE will prevent this. If you are eating below your TDEE, your body will tap into it's fat reserves for energy.

[Ketogenic low-carbohydrate diets have no metabolic advantage over nonketogenic low-carbohydrate diets.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16685046)

5% of energy from carbs or 40% of energy from carbs made no difference in regards to fat loss.

( also be aware when you are researching, the term 'low carb' can sometimes mean 'keto' or no carbs, and it can sometimes mean 40% of energy from carbs ... the definition of 'low carb' varies widely )
I was in the same boat as yours a couple of years back. Weighed 130lbs and was afraid of working out because i could loose what little weight i had. Ate everything i could till i reached 155lbs. Developed belly fat on the way too. Turns out i had it all wrong, you either gain weight by building muscles or building fat and i did it the wrong way. Start working out and eat high protein calorie surplus diet and you will gain weight along with muscles. Yours is the ideal situation to start bulking with exercise, don't just eat your way upto 140.Is it true creatine makes you pee blood?Drink olive oil, its calorie dense and has a lot of health benefits.
Testosterone boosting http://www.ergo-log.com/olivetest.html

http://www.ergo-log.com/margarinesdepressed.html
And a lot of other health benefits As the previous commenters mentioned, smaller sets less frequently would be much more beneficial to increase strength. I'd suggest 5x5 every other day.

Other things to consider:


  *    **Form**. Make sure you are benching correctly. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYKScL2sgCs). The most important part is to retract your scapula, which means pulling your shoulder blades back and down so they dig into the bench.


  *   **Microloading**. As a female, I've found smaller 2.5 lb jumps very useful for increasing upper body lifts. I use these [washers](http://www.mcmaster.com/#91081a046/=w02xoi). Each one is ~.625 lbs.

  Edit: by using the smith machine, you lose out on the stabilization strength that free weights offer. You should try dumbbell benching but it is harder to progress. Epic meme, dude :)Nooo. You don't break the weight with your quads, wtf! My checklist is: hips high, chest up, arms shoulder width grip, tuck neck a little, squeeze lats, take slack off the bar, stand up with the weight. ty for offering a different perspective. i often find myself crashing from just sitting on my computer after 3 hours of not eating-- naseous, dizzy, irritable, just because i havent had a bite to eat. thinking it might be my high carb diet, and inability for my body to dip into my fat reserves rather than glycolgen reservesReading comprehension is a thing. Or you can just take one comment in isolation and comment on that like a jackass. I told him not to buy Quest. He stated he wanted them to address nutrition, I said waste of money and described what $40 can buy him as he stated he doesn't get enough protein or fiber. The point is it's a waste of money for a 14yo kid. After that I'm just giving his background on who actually uses Quest.
F's sakeYou are delusional. Absolutely delusional. Your diet is dictated by the season?
How does that make sense? Dude, you are turning into an anorexic. You need to cut out your shit now before it's too late. Emotion follows motion. Get up and move! Because the written word carries power. People often believe the very last thing they read, without looking for evidence to the contrary.

For the vast majority of people there is no benefit to adhereing to a keto diet. There are also some downsides to following a keto diet. There are benefits to reducing carbs below the level of what 'the typical westerner' consumes each day.

Carbs are not something you should feel the need to avoid entirely, merely because you just read a book about it.

http://iifym.com

( You are of course, free to do whatever works for you, but please continue to research it, and examine the potential downsides )

We all know the benefits of protein, but imagine how silly it would seem if people were writing books about an "all protein diet" and 1,000's of people were following the "peto diet" and eating nothing but meat. Oh wait, some people do that. ;D
Why would he need whey OR quest bars? This is rediculous adviceExactly! But, be careful not to overtrain your discipline muscle. If you're trying to create too many habits at once, you'll crash and burn. Make gym the #1 priority until the habit kicks in and you're well on your way to becoming the best *you*.How is your form and is your back staying tight?

I was struggling with my bench and I figured out that I would lose tightness in my back and that would fuck up the lift.

Add a shit load of back work and it's helped immensely.

Would also suggest doing dumbbell bench press and dumbbell floor presses to help.Are they really better than weighted planks? Bicycles on the floor . etc?

I might have to invest in one.why woudl you say that?Take this into consideration: http://baye.com/you-dont-know-hit/. It sounds like you're already thinking along the lines of the article. Intensity trumps duration of the exercise. If the 40 min exercise gives you time to clear your brain, by all means. But if you value your time and would prefer to pursue other interests then focus on the intensity for a shorter amount of time. Hope this helps.Also man, If you want to save some money instead of getting the quest bars I'd do what plenty other recommended and get why powder or just buy a gallon of milk every few days,oats, and some eggs and youll be set with protein. So if this is still going on great since I'm always running late for these kinds of threads! I would like to ask if it is necessary to be a certain weight before working out. My situation is that I was once skinny weighing at 125 lbs. I was afraid of trying out the gym because I thought that I would lose the little weight that I had. So here I am bulking up and will hopefully reach 140 lbs. hi dolomiten - thanks brother - I will check with mods first... cheers!Don't think of whey protein as  a supplement, just think of it as a food, because that's essentially what it is. It's a way to get more protein in your diet. If you don't want to take it, that's cool, but make sure you're getting enough protein. And creatine is very good, you should take that when you start training.

Since you have to wait until next year to use the school gym, either look at the routines over at /r/bodyweightfitness or get a gym membership. Again, while it's true that the gym isn't needed, I think it's the best way to put on size and strength. Read the sidebar and get on a beginners routine. I like Stronglifts. It's simple and only a few exercises per workout, but it does get intense and you'll really notice the strength gains. Plus, there's a free, very comprehensive guide at [stronglifts.com.](http://www.stronglifts.com) Form is vital, spend a lot of time reading about and watching videos on proper form (look up Alan Thrall on youtube). If you know someone who knows how to do barbell lifts properly, see if they can help you.

Let me know if you have any other questions, and good luck!Had a look around your other post.

To build up endurance and leg strength for soccer your best bet it uphill running and stair climbs. They are going to increase the strength in your legs as well as overall body fitness. Wall sits (weighted with a 5kg dumbbell or weighted) are also going to increase the muscles endurance without putting pressure on your knees and back which are still really delicate right now with you growing.
On-the-spot running with light 2kg dumbbells are also going to work on your muscle's strength and endurance as well as help with form - once again without putting undue pressure on the skeletal system. You can do a lot of great exercises with a 2kg and 5kg dumbbell set and they're like $25 for both.
Push ups are another good one and then of course planks, oblique blanks, legs raises etc for core. All really good without messing up your growth plates.

You shouldn't need supplements. Stir fries are amazing meals with most things you need you just have to stop skipping lunch. Take a salad or whatever...make up something healthy with lots of leafy greens and beef. I know Australian school canteens are rubbish and I wouldn't buy food from their either but you do not need any of the supplement crap out there. You are not 'bulking' you will get everything you need form food and it's just an overpriced scam unless you're proper weightlifting.

Check out /r/bodyweightfitness for some good routinesHere is what I've done in about a year. The first set of pictures is after about 3 months of just starting to work out, and I was on a brosplit my cousin made for me. The second set is after ICF5x5. I tried to keep the pictures the same size and pose for accurate comparison, but it isn't perfect.

http://imgur.com/LpUJNur

Where it gets a little surprising is that I was about 170lbs in the first set of photos and 195lbs in the second. I started out at about 160lbs, so I've gained a lot of muscle in a year and a quarter. Most of the muscle gain is my lower body, which is hard to take pictures of. Also, my muscles don't show up as well on camera because I am kind of pale. There is likely some fat gain, but I don't think it is too much, maybe an extra 3-5%.

My numbers went from:

Squat: 135lbs to 295lbs
Deadlift: 150lbs to 395lbs
Bench: 135lbs to 260lbs
OHP: 75lbs 5X5 to 150lbs 5x5

My OHP is very inconsistent though, because whenever I would progress into the higher weights, I wasn't able to maintain it and would have to go back to 135lbs.

Overall I am pretty pleased with my progress. I get a lot of comments about how I look big and muscular. For some reason people ask me about how the local football team is doing... I am 24... Anyway cutting down would really help my aesthetics, though I don't care too much about that at the moment.

My plan is to get to the point where progress becomes rather slow, where I have to spend two months to add 5lbs on my squat. Then I think I'll focus more on cardiovascular fitness and lift enough to maintain my strength and make some progress.Impressive transformation for sure. Is my math off or did he understate maintenance/overstate deficit?

3,500 cal = 1lb

Weekly caloric deficit = 200*7 = 1,400

Weekly weight loss = 1,400/3,500 = 0.4lb

Weight loss over 20 weeks = 0.4lb*20 = 8lbI noticed this when I was doing shoulder press. I drink tons of water at work and then go to the gym afterwards. My bladder was getting fuller every minute; because I chugged a 25 oz water bottle half an hour before lifting, and expanding upon my prostate. The force of the weight pressing my gooch into the seat also exacerbates the sensation. It doesn't even take much weight, I was only using 30 lbs the last time. My core is always rigid and sometimes the lower abdominals cramp over the course of 90 seconds. It is well that the lift only takes that long other wise I'd be sporting an awkward gym chub.How to cut? Just eat less calories?The only candy I eat is 70%&gt;Dark Chocolate and Gum.

I might pick em up if I feel like i'm starting to gain.Ah. hadn't heard of that. Thanks. Yes, things are fine now. Should be hitting my goal in March. Thanks for asking. :)&gt;Here's my advice to you: start lifting weights now. You'll be a god by the time you're 18. I wish I would've started at your age.

I can do that and i'm planning to but i'm still not sure what amounts to do. Bout a year ago I struggled with just the bar.

&gt;Since you're young, I wouldn't recommend being too strict with diet, but you should try to eat a bit more, get more protein (is there a place you can buy whey) and try to slowly put on mass. Also, don't be too worried about occasionally eating junk food or eating out.

Would assume so, but i'm not too keen on supplement at this stage. Have these if it matters http://imgur.com/K8FxF81,r2OqcdC

&gt;Does your school gym have a squat rack and a bench press? If not, I'd recommend using that money on a gym membership if there's a good gym near you.

It's more of a proper gym connected to the school so probably. However weights are off limits until year 10.

I know you said in the OP that you don't want to go to a gym. Is there a specific reason for this other than you not feeling like it's needed? (which is technically true, but imo you'll have a much easier time putting on muscle with access to a gym).

Basically that it isn't needed and partially because i'm 14. I've got the confidence to go (and my friend is willing to go with me) but I just don't really see the point. It's also bout a 5 minute walk away from my house.'MericaThe thing with them is they're high protein, moderate calories, high fiber, with very little carbs and sugars.

Great job! I know the exact feeling, I also set 1000lbs goal in September and entered the club late January

Bodyweight: 180lbs (at that time)

Bench: 230lbs
Squat: 353lbs
Deadlift: 418lbs
Total: 1001lbs

Lets keep going!I eat at my caloric requirement, and that means I'm building muscle with very very minimal fat gain. The whole bulking/cutting thing is great and all, but it really is not necessary. Many people will have you believe that bulking and cutting is superior to eating a high protein maintenance diet, but the facts simply aren't there to support it. Do whichever one you want but I particularly enjoy the maintenance diet. I have noticed excellent muscle gains from it and I don't intend to stop anytime soon. Yeah my definition is/was wrong I get what you mean now.
I'm gonna skip on it now. I thought it was like a pick me up but now I suspect its more of a jacked confectionary. Why the FUCK is he taping this while driving??Puberty i'm 50/50 going through. Some parts of puberty have hit me earlier than others and some are still going through. Strangely enough though my pitch can go higher than before. And yes I am getting pubic hair, height growth and sweat increases. Next 2~ years imo I should be getting the full front.

&gt;It might just be the muscles getting worn out because they're not used to being worked.

That's spot on, and i'm just curious as to whether or not I should add onto that or just leave it until they tear to the point where that activity doesn't really strain them. I can't really work them in that state anyway. [Here you go.](http://www.caloriecount.com/svunt-shake-blueberries-half-whole-recipe-r560368)He still gets hit, has to break tackles, and sometimes scramble. I don't get what you're arguing. Yes, he isn't a mobile quarterback, but the amount of physicality he has to do I'd rather be strong than weak for.I think its safe for you to start gaining weight and skip the extra fat loss. You should always remember that when you lose weight, you're losing muscle too.

I'd highly recommend a 'ramp up' approach for your lean bulking phase. E.g. start at 2400 a day and measure how much weight you gained and adjust. 1 lbs a week is enough. Don't eat too much because unless you're on gear, theres a limit on how much muscle you can get a week (the rest of it will be fat that you have to burn off again later). Have a target weight in mind so you know when to stop bulking.

If you feel the carbs are too high, you can increase your protein intake a little. Any extra protein your body doesn't use will be converted to carbsIt's suggested because ignorant people think you need to treat it like steroids when the two are nowhere near the same thing. Thanks for your thoughts. I had not connected that building more muscle would come along with some additional fat gain, and will definitely keep that in mind. In that case, I think I would just forget worrying about the bf percentage. I'll look more into the macro ratios and do some experimenting.
There is no meal replacement sufficient enough to replace real, healthy food. Well, soylent is the closest thing I can think of, but whey protein definitely will not meet your nutritional requirements. Whey is just a protein derived from dairy. There's nothing magical or dangerous about it.

You seem to feel you need Quest bars, so go for it. They are pretty much a supplement though, although I suspect our definition differs.Of course wine doesn't count.1. Definitely running. Cardio definitely, my weights below average I think.
2. Do just about all at home and variations at the park. No dumbbells?
3. Will keep in mind.
4. Going for endurance so should be fine.
5. I eat fruits daily (1-1/2-2 apples before showering), veggies are always part of dinner, usually eat meats but I can't tell whether they're lean or not because of my parents style of cooking and the asian butchers they go to. (Most of the stuff is stir-fried though, so it should be relatively clean). The scariest part is any tea can be cylon tea.Extreme emphasis on the "at most." The most I'll ever bench is twice a week. I read your edit. Sorry if this is a weird question, but have you gone through puberty yet?

And when you say they hurt, what kind of pain is it? It might just be the muscles getting worn out because they're not used to being worked. That's how they get bigger and stronger. You wouldn't burn more calories than normally. You might/probably will burn less because you wont be able to work as hard from the heat. Lesser intensity on the work out and for a shorter duration of time hence a lesser amount of calories burnt than normal.I'm able to buy a lot of stuff (more so through cash at supermarkets) but at this point I don't really think supplement is needed.First, I would strongly recommend against losing anymore weight. For your height, you are basically near the threshold of what is considered healthy and losing more weight can be very bad for you. I'm not entirely sure why you obsess so much about your body fat percent but I highly suggest that you do not lose any more weight, but of course it is your decision.

Second, your calculated carb intake is indeed quite high. Do not be afraid to eat more than 135 grams of protein. The 1 gram per pound is a guideline that is by all means not the end all be all of your intake. You should be thinking of your nutrition in terms of macronutrient ratios, not these arbitrary finite numbers that must never be exceeded. My ratios are 40% carbs, 30 fat and 30 protein. That's a very common split but you can adjust it as needed.

I am very confused about your goals. You say you want to lose bf (which I suggest against) but also you want to gain muscle. Muscle gain is almost always associated with at least a small degree of fat gain, and depending on how intense your bulk is, it can be very hard to maintain low bf percents. What I suggest for you is that your main goal should primarily be muscle gain, NOT additional fat loss. The more muscle you get with your current bf, the more cut you'll look. But you don't want to look like a lanky stick do you? Thanks, I will do that today! Why does everyone have to see a therapist or a doctor for shit like this. He doesn't feel like going to the gym, so he needs to see a shrink?!?!? Come on.

Man the fuck up and get into the gym. Yeah I absolutely hate milk and dairy. If it would benefit me though I can chug them like water.

Also edited the OP to show what supplement I (my brother) has.$40 can buy you a big jar of whey protein a box of rolled oats and a jar of peanut butterAwesome! Looks like you're absolutely killing it! I'm looking to get a 1000 lbs total today at my meet. Last time, I totaled 990 lbs.If you're doing Stronglifts, it has its own app to track workouts. Otherwise I've found Jefit to be best. The update from a month or so ago made it kind of cluttered, but it's still pretty damn good.That makes a lot of sense![This is great.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/sherried-sardine-toast-recipe.html)Hi Marcus, you are very welcome to post it to this thread! As for posing it to the subeddit, it may be worth messaging one of the mods first but I can't see it being an issue. I would like to read through it! It's not. Perhaps you could try a bodyweight workout at home or something like P90X or Insanity until you sort out your anxiety issue?Only reason i'm thinking of picking them up is because I'm eating "under" what I should be and I feel like protein, nutrition and fibre can help . I'm not the best cook and waking up at 6:50 doesn't help that. Usually I skip lunch unless i'm really hungry (canteen food is terrible) and eat when I get back (4:15~). Investing in a blender soon.


They're also $40 from where im planning to buy them.You're getting some good advice here, and I agree with mixing things up.  I'm 30F 5'8" 155lb; my bench is 120lb (I think I started with just the barbell 8 months ago). I work out 6x/wk with a PPLx2 program; this is what works for me:

* 3x20 Wide-arm push-ups (warm-up)
* 3xF Dips
* 5x5 Barbell bench press
* 3x10 Incline db bench press
* 3x10 db flyes (sometimes I do cable flyes instead)

And then I do shoulders + triceps. If you want to get stronger, lower reps + heavier weights is the way to go (5x5).1. Do you want them to be stronger for lifting or running?
2.Going for cardiovascular strength or to cut?
3. Push ups,pull ups, dips, pistols, nothing that will make you bulky (soccer players arent bulky)
4. They're good just dont eat too many in a short time frame (lots of fiber)
5. Depends on whether you want better endurance or strength.
6. Eating clean isnt for everyone but adding in fruits,veggies, and lean meats here and there will make a big difference. You could do a set of pullups after every set of a pushing exercise.If you can do 3 chinups, I'd do Pavel's Fighter pullup plan with chinups.

He has one for people who can do 3 and it'll take you to 20+. Bit of leg press/ wall sits and lots of stair runs is all you really need. Sprinting wouldn't hurt on the oval either.

Stay away from heavy lifting, you're still growing. 12 reps is perfect for what you're doing. Also lots of protein sups etc have lactose in them, being Chinese you probably have zero tolerance for them so best to stay away.

Need your goals.

People saying Quest bars are pricey are probably in the US/Europe. In Australia saying they're pricey is a major understatement. Unless you really need fibre or you're doing keto there's not much point for you here. Way better ways to get a healthy snack or your protein.Check out Pavel's Fighter Pullup program. You can start today.Edited.You do not necessarily have to lock your elbows. In your case, you most certainly should not lock them. You don't need to do cardio to lose fat, just eat less. Track your TDEE and eat under it. This is covered in the wiki It's probably because we evolved from animals that swung through trees to travel (brachiating), so we still have lats that can take a beating. Good for you.

Seeing as you enjoyed the achievement of hitting 10K so much, why not sign up for a 5K or 10K funrun. There are tonnes of them around and they're pretty fun.

Just keep in mind 10K on the street is a lot harder than on treadmill if you do. Just because dangerously hot temperatures are common where you live does not mean it's any better of an idea to go running in it. That makes sense. Since weird elbows aren't common, I've always just assumed that you go until you can essentially lock your elbows. (I just recently got back into bench pressing. Excuse my potentally bad form info). Hahaha no man hahaha bad jujuYes, this. Must be answered before we give you an answer OP. http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/02/arnold-schwarzenegger/

Arnold is a supremely accomplished human being, from which all of us can learn much and garner inspiration.

He is not however, perfect and infallable, which is true for all human beings.

I myself have told people that "milk is for babies" ... it is, but that statement doesn't mean that science has proven it does not provide benefits for adults, because it does.

So we can applaud the attitude ... "Man up bitch, milk is for babies" ... while recognizing it's not valid nutritional science. ;D

( also, iirc, at one point in his career, he sold whey protein powder via a mail order business, and he puts his name on branded whey protein powder today, so selling milk products is obviously not for babies, so there's that )
Just do legs. Show meI eat airpopped popcorn when I have hunger cravings.  20 calories a cup.  Add a bit of salt for flavor.  Ok. will do.

I'm also thinking of taking up HIIT cardio workout. I've simply not been able to budge my belly fat. I've seen development everywhere else except that. Hope I can couple that in with one of those workouts.Oh okay I see. I've been wearing my knee brace for almost 13 years and it's fine to lift in but won't heal it. Just remember that by wearing it you aren't working that muscle above your knee when you do lift very much and it will need to be worked separately to keep it strong for stability when you aren't wearing the brace.Start lifting now, there are beginner programs in the wiki.  You can lift while cutting calories, your first few months you'll have plenty of fat reserves to build muscle while loosing weight.  No one likes a skinnyfat Jared looking sumbitch, lift weights. This sounds like a great opportunity. You were already using him to correct your form, so it's not like he'll be that annoying bro who says your knees shouldn't travel past your toes when you squat. Plus, having a partner makes skipping workouts much harder.1. Wait until they're strong enough? Start working those legs now and they'll get strong.

3. What are your goals?

4. They're fine. They taste good and have good nutrients. A bit on the pricey side though

I'm pointing out that lifting weights is not going to make him look like Kali Muscle.. and to not avoid lifting weightsAre you locking out your elbows correctly? If you are double-jointed, I would recommend not going past 180 degrees when you're pressing the bar. Stop at 180, and make sure your forearms, arms, chest, and back are tight. If you tighten up your muscles throughout the rep and especially at the lockout, you'll put less pressure on your elbows.I agree with this and also, buying a planner has helped me a lot.

I have more muscle mass now than ever before.Changing (specifically, increasing) your synthroid dose can actually have a really negative effect on your body, including, paradoxically, causing you to GAIN weight as your body tries to compensate for the rapid increase in thyroid hormone. Don't do it. Talk to your doctor. Thyroid stuff is very finicky and you can suffer from a lot of negative effects by messing with the very specific dose your doctor has prescribed.

No, really. It's a hernia.The second option you listed is what I do most of the time. If I'm pretty damn sure I can't do the next rep without sacrificing form, I'll rack it.Thanks man and yeah im definitely gonna start hitting lats once more per week and go harder on trapsNo. I can tell you why not to do it though.
It will take approx 3 weeks or moe of creatine use to start receiving full benefits.

So I guess ask yourself, why would you wait until your body is primed to use the creatine levels and then stop taking it?Look I'm a paramedic, mental health is a massive overlooked issue. I really do suggest going to the GP and inquiring about it.Without going into all the potential causes of anxiety, perhaps you have 'expectations' and you are 'afraid' you won't meet them.

Just go to the gym and *try* to follow a program, without caring what actually happens. Trust in yourself to adapt to whatever does happen.

The only true failure is failure to go to the gym. Everyone who bothers to go, succeeds to some degree.

I just told you why ... they are made from garbage, literally.

Type 'recycled gym floor' into google ... you'll get results that are all black floor mats.
the search i did was to see if it was only me who was seeing this... which apparently i'm not. and the fact remains as you even said, the consumer mats are almost always black. The question was why are gym floors always black? Amateur boxing. It'll quickly become your on-season if you get into it though, so not sure how much you'd want that.Read the faq and wiki.

Losing fat is 80% diet and 20% exercise, so you should be really paniced about not fixing your diet, and only have minor concerns regarding the gym. ;D

How many days a week are you working out and how tall are you?The 1x8 of 135 is likely hurting you because that is about 80% of your working set and it is a decent number of reps. It'll cause some muscle fatigue, and lower the amount you can do on your working set.

Most people recommend warming up with about 50% of your working set, which would be about 80lbs for you. You might also want to try less reps for the warm-up.

If you are concerned about not being warmed up enough, you could add some box jumps or a few other movements to help. My rule of thumb is to do the least amount to warm myself up as possible. If I didn't warm up enough, I can usually tell, and I just make a note for next time.

Something I'd try is doing 20 rep squats. This is an old yet still popular squatting program. It's easy to make progress and they are very effective. The main problem with them is that they are very difficult.yeah no worries. I was more getting at while the ratio seems to be 75-85% for people with good form, most people trying to front squat for the first time aren't going to be anywhere near for a whileRight?   How does OP not see how this would infuriate someone?Have you used any medicines to treat your headaches? I ask because many people find naproxen sodium or ibuprofen effectively relieve their headaches.Well if it makes you feel better your stats are impressive for a young female I just don't have a social life. He is the butt plug. (   )My first day back from short breaks is never part of a lifting routine, but I give myself a day to "remind" myself how my body works. I think I don't like going back cold and putting my routine progress to the test immediately - it'll suck if I slipped.

I hit the gym with no time constraints and without a plan other than to "wake myself up" - usually ends up being bodyweight stuff. This last time I ended up running, doing 50 pull-ups and diamond push-ups each, tons of squat jacks, burpees, star jumps and jumping lunges, and abs. So, not a bad workout. The momentum kinda builds up until you're stoked for the next workout.

Anyway that's just what works for me. Work on school stuff on the weekends.  It's friday night I am writing a paper, catching up work sundays.  I'm a phd student and work part time.  still lift 5 days a week and do all my meal prep. Amazing progress! I have a similar body shape to yours and am very inspired by your results! What does WW and SS mean, by any chance? Not a big deal. All that matters is that you're at *your* peak athleticism. If it makes you feel better short people tend to live longer because they need to eat less and are thus exposed to less oxidants.In such heat it really depends on relative humidity in terms of primary danger.  Very humid would prevent effective heat reduction with high exertion.  Having an intermittent cooldown plan would make exercising outside fine.  In very cold weather, even -20 to -40c you'd be surprised that a simple spandex base and light jacket and pants is fine up to an hour at least.  I've even gone only spandex -10c after a warm-up.Do you want me to find a flooring supplier for you ?

Maybe call a flooring store in your area, and talk to a professional.

My post was intended to communicate, that there is a world of options out there, and you won't necessarily find them on amazon.com, just like you won't find polished aluminum skyscraper facia panels at home depot.

The 'black mats' you see are a consumer / agricultural product, made from recycled automobile bumpers and used car tires. It's cheap, and standardized, and has many 'consumer' uses. Finding a gym floor material, in a specific color, in a specific form factor, is a 'specialty product.'
At the very start of your descent, your first movement is bending your back, like you're bending over to pick something up off the ground. at that moment, all that weight is being forced upon your lower back. Did you hurt your lower back from conventional? Same thing will happen. Even when you get the lift, you need to be careful about the descent, alot of people get careless after getting it, then hurt themselves trying to put the weight back down with bad form.ah. science! haha thanks for the response!Currently it feels like -27* Fahrenheit with windchill.

For exercise, I put on my wool gloves, walk to the wood pile, place 10 pieces in the wood stove, and wrap myself in 5 wool blankets.

I've lost 30 pounds this winter.i still don't see them in rolls, only puzzle mats. Am i missing something?It really depends on what you want out of your cardio workout. Are you looking to train for a 5k or sport or are you just looking to burn fat? And if distance training/cardio is what you want where do you live for climate, can you run outside most of the year?. If you just want a pure cardio for fat burn, there are plenty of alternatives that don't cost a thousand to 5 thousand dollars. You can find a lot of body weight interval programs that will keep your heart rate up and get other benefits as well. So unless you have money to burn, there are plenty of options, even including a cheap gym membership for a year just for treadmill would be cheaper than investing in one. Again, that all depends on what your goal is out of itSorry, I think I misread your post!Run early morning or at night.

Running in 40C+ weather can be a bit dangerous. I think you will be fine, but your body will definitely act differently. Thanks for the prompt response. I'm been thinking recently about cutting back on morning coffee anyway, so I'll start to work on that. In the meantime, I think I have to take a significant break from working out (a few weeks or so) until I get these headaches under control. After the first rep you lose your tightness and hyperextend your back instead of keeping your core tight. Watch the difference from rep 1 to rep 3. If you have any friends who exercise or go to the gym ask if you can tag along with them. I went to the gym for the first time in a while the other week because my friend wanted to go after playing tennis, and simply being there for an hour has really motivated me to go more often This has been really helpful for days when I didn't manage to eat enough food early enough. It would be 9pm having to fill in 900 calories before I sleep... just a couple bananas, some whole milk, whey, coconut oil, and pb... gainzWhen you say "more legs, arms, and shoulders" what are you adding?

The original ICF program has bench on one day and DL on the other right?General rule of thumb that a power lifter taught me that has actually improved my bench a lot. Do major compound lifts every 2 days. So if you go on monday and do bench, squat, or deadlifts then don't go back until thursday. If you set up a decent schedule this will have you going like four times a week. Also this does not exclude going and then working out smaller muscle groups.

 Another thing, sometimes its better just to force yourself to go up even if you cant hit a specific number like 10 reps or something. Generally when i go I warm up on something 10 pounds under what i lift for 1 set, go up 5 pounds for a set, go up another 5 pounds. Each time the number of reps decreases with this, but it allows for me to move up in weights pretty frequently. For reference today I did a set of 120 for about 8 reps, then a set of 125 for about 5, and then 130 until I couldn't anymore. If you have to stop and put the bar back up that's ok. I tend to focus more on what weight i can currently get off my chest rather than for how long I can do it. So i'll probably end up doing 5 sets of 1 rep (stopping in between each to reset and rest a few seconds). Another thing that can be helpful would be to get a spotter and do negative reps at about 5-10 over what your max is. Just go slow on the down portion and you'll have that person there to help lift it off your chest.

 A final thing that helps is inspiration. Like, I am a woman and even though id gone to the gym for years i never really knew any other female lifters besides my mother and she always said she maxed out at 90, so when i maxed out at 75 I kinda felt like "oh, well this sucks.." Until, I met another girl a year younger than me who was lifting around 300 for her 1 rep max. Since meeting her in may i've gone up from a 75 bench to a 125-130 bench. Having someone to compare yourself to helps in a big way to piss you off enough into working harder. Edit: don't blend rice that's gross.I have one, but to be honest only so I can run in the winter if the weather is bad. I'd rather run on the streets or in parks, trails etcI live in an apartment, and I already cook most of my own meals, just need to cut back on the portion size and add some more variety into the mix. I had a used treadmill I got from ebay for $200 or so, and I used it and enjoyed it. The digital display kinda helped me keep going.

That said, when it died, I replaced it with a bicycle, and can say I enjoy cycling outdoors much more than I did running on the treadmill in the house.

I would say there is a place for both, depending on where you live. Cycling outdoors isn't really an option if you live in the arctic circle during winter. But if you aren't going to use it, don't bother, as no machine I've ever purchased included a bag of motivation in the box.

dreambulkYou have a higher ceiling for strength than a short person but you may not necessarily reach it. Short dudes can out work you depending on your work ethic. It's also easier for short guys to put on muscle that looks big relative to their body proportions. Look at Strongman competitions.Just watched the video where ICF was first introduced and he says you can sub chin-ups for curls, he just recommends curls becuase the people who the program was designed (Newbie lifters) can't do enough to make them effective. I haven't done a progress pic since October but here is my album.

SL5x5 + keto


http://imgur.com/a/zHY4O&gt;  I have before and after pics, although I'm not gonna post them ;-)

Then why mention them?Today was deadlift day for me

Is there a real distinction between 1x5 (banging the reps out continuously 5 times) vs 5x1 (i.e. resting between each pull)? I'm talking about in terms of its effect on your strength and muscle development. I'm asking because I deadlifted a new weight today (285 lbs) and it's the most I've ever attempted, I lifted it 3 times (resting a bit between each pull)

I take a multivitamin, fish oil, and fat burner in the morning.
Multivitamin just for the positive effects, would take even if i didn't work out. Fish oil for the fats because I don't eat a lot of fish and to combat inflammation.  Fat burner just to keep my heart rate up during the day, I work on my feet as a baker so its a cheap helper to burn some extra calories here and there and the energy is much needed.
I take creatine before and after my workout to help keep my muscle since im always cutting and to help with the soreness.
I take whey protein isolate an hour before my workout because my body feels better during the workout. I also take a whey/casein protein combo after my workout for recovery and to keep my levels high until I sleep then a spoonful or two of cottage cheese before bed to keep my protein levels high.
It only burns too many calories if you get out bed during your catabolic stage, duh. Great work!  I found it interesting to see your front view change quicker than the side view.

I'm the opposite: my profile is slim, but I've gotten wider over the last year.

Good luck to you!&gt;Instead, its excreted in the form of creatinine.

Creatinine eh? That's an interesting way to spell explosive, painful diarrhea.

Hey man nice work and progress.  You seem like the skinny type who has built himself up slowly but surely.

You're doing it right.  Give it 2 years and you will be a machine.

One thing I might add...make sure to keep eating...a lotI dunno, I just don't feel like I'm working my arms hard enough! It's not quite like leg days where I walk like a newborn deer after lolWell the only thing I can think is that it's mental, maybe you just need to rebuild confidence so your body knows its got this. Just take some time, start low, and build up again.Why would you do 6 days!? Lol
Just find a legit program like Starting Strenght or Texas Method or whatever you end up liking...
Also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYKScL2sgCsI had this progress shot. I started SL right before the 2nd pic and the 3rd pic was something like 4 months and +10 lbs later. I did add weighted chin ups and dips to SL pretty early on however.

http://i.imgur.com/Y6I7P1t.jpgImagine that your arms are strictly to connect you to the bar and serve no other purpose. They're just "hooks", it sounds overly simple I know but it really helps when trying to picture it in your head right before the lift.The program that will work is the program that you stick to.Which is roughly 80%. Sounds about right to me.Hey, I'm the same height &amp; gender as you, and honestly if I was as light as you said I'd be very concerned. As others have said it is very much in the underweight category. If guess that you are currently what is commonly described on here as 'skinnyfat'. Please be aware that elite like elite level athletes and models etc will only keep a low body fat for short periods of time, like for a competition or event, then bulk back up Afterwards.

I would strongly advise you to take some time reading the information in the FAQ, ask as many questions as you need, and please be very careful as I have friends and a relative with the same attitude, and it lead them to a dark place and I would not like it to happen to anyone else.

Please ask more questions, train hard, and eat like a champion

SGet to a gym. Workout. Lift. Keep a log. Watching the numbers go up will make you want to do it more and more.Currently doing PHUL (http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout), and on the lower power day, my deadlifts are being killed by doing heavy squats RIGHT before them. Moving them to the end of the workout just means I'm even more tired.

I want to move the deadlifts to be the first lift on the lower hypertrophy day, is this a bad idea? Should I move something from the hyper day to power day to compensate?In before the 5x5 brigade. Start with bodyweight exercises. Goblet squats, band rows, box jumps, etc etc. Once you feel comfortable and are able to hold a  bar for the duration of an exercise then find a gym. As far as food goes. I blend everything. Oats, rice, peanut butter and full-cream milk are diet staples and once blended easy to consume for calories. You could probably even save enough money for a gym membership if you stopped spending money on takeout.This is the first time I've had aircon in a few years. The last house that I lived in was really badly designed so it got hotter inside than out (like a greenhouse) and no aircon. I'm staying inside because I'm enjoying the luxury.Hey, thanks all, I think I needed this :)We are not your physician, see rule #5Your shoulders are too far in front, you essentially lifted that with your lower back which wont be safe at higher weights. You want your shoulders directly over the bar throughout the lift. Sit back a little more at the start and keep that bar close to your body. If you can imagine laying a transparent clock over this video, envision "pulling" (standing) towards 1 o'clock rather than 12 o'clock.Im on my 17th day of cutting, lost like 5kg but alot is water but some fat too.

What are your macros/weight/height/tdee calories?


Also how do you track your weight?


Lets fix your cut bro.Thanks :)48 hours between workouts.

If you do a full body workout, that's every other day.

If you do a split, that's 48 hours rest for each muscle group.

[The time course for elevated muscle protein synthesis following heavy resistance exercise.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8563679)

&gt; It has been shown that muscle protein synthetic rate (MPS) is elevated in humans by 50% at 4 hrs following a bout of heavy resistance training, and by 109% at 24 hrs following training. ... At an average time of 36 hrs postexercise, MPS in the exercised arm had returned to within 14% of the control arm value,

Individuals vary in their recovery time, but because most all of us operate on 24 hour schedules, 48 hours is the generally recommended amount of time. Some people might function better on a 3 day program. ( 72 hours ). So should you find yourself failing to recover, try 72 hours instead.

24 hours is almost certainly not enough recovery time for nearly everyone unless you are taking steroids or possess magic superhuman powers us mere mortals lack.
Couldnt agree more. Lowering the volume might let him keep adding intensity but its not all progress, mostly just peaking. Someone at that level should be working on building up their work capacityLiterally grab a broom handle and work on your form if you have to. You're very welcome, and good luck and much success.
I LIEK UR FLAIRI always hurt myself with conventional.  Dunno why, I've had my form critiqued and people said it was fine, so for the safety of my spinal column and lumbar spine, I'm going to have to stick to sumo.i know someone who does this all the time too. gahhh, we only have one squat rack and onee smithNo problems! Good luck.I'd say lean back another 2-4" your shoulders get in front of the bar on those reps and that puts more stress on your lower back and also makes the weight feel heavier. Essentially you want your shoulders directly over the bar throughout the lift Bigger non eating windows = giving body more time to burn fat. R/fitness is so anti IF its hard to have a serious convo about its benefits.Oh I agree.  Just like anything of you get on it early is easy to fix.   Unfortunately for me I have a high pain tolerance so when I feel something is already too late.   I was squating the first day back and in my last set at the bottom of a squat I felt something weird in my hip just on the groin side of the femur. It wasn't painful at the time, rather it felt like there was a release of fluid in the area and then from the next day it felt more like a strain.

I'm 22. I haven't been training long, my working sets were ~230lb until I took the 2 months away then when I came back I worked up to a second set of 185 which may be where I went wrong (too heavy too fast perhaps, but that's just something for me to learn from).

I haven't been tracking my diet thoroughly since then but it has been fairly well rounded with some effort to eat a high protein meal at least once a day and minimising sweets etc. About maintenance calorie wise.Stop and set up between reps. Think 5 sets of 1 rep instead of 1 set of 5 reps. Experienced guys can knock out reps like you are but they know how to stay tight the whole time. Slow it down until you get solid form down.

You have lots of horizontal motion in the bar on the way up and the way down. You start each pull with the bar way out in front of you. It should be over your mid-foot and actually in contact with your shins when you break it off the ground.

You are never getting your core tight and your back stays rounded. You should get "squooze" before each rep. i.e., pull the slack out of the bar, pull your shoulder blades together, push your chest up, and tighten your back. Once you get tight, get tighter. When it feels like your eyeballs are about to pop out, you are finally ready to pull.

Watch the Alan Thrall and Ripetoe "how to setup to deadlift" videos.Baseball or Tennis ball for your chest works, I use that then also hit my triceps,biceps with it tooI think that's my problem.. I need to switch it up. Thank you!Thank you so muchReally good advice, I'll give that a try then. Thank you!What should I do to keep things fresh while cutting? I'm on Stronglifts and I am not progressing anymore. I'm eating at a deficit. My squat max is 200x6 and I've been doing 200x5 for two weeks now.5'9" 159 and I'm eating 3500 cals as well.

My advice is, split up your meals every 2 or so hours.

Do cardio 3 or more times a week.

Workout intensely. That's it.You'll stall eventually. When you can't do anymore, maintain or decrease a little so as to avoid injury. Then once the cut is over, you'll see your lifts go back up again as your calorie intake increases.Testosterone levels decline gradually with age. Any changes that people report upon entering their 30s are very unlikely to be attributable to normal decline of testosterone levels -- at the very least, I know of no evidence to support that.Your routine is so much like mine, that I looked at the username to make sure I didn't write your post this morning and then forgot about it. Woooah woooah there, hold your horses there Mr Dropbear!

You yourself said leaving your air-conditioned house would be foolish no?switch it up a bit. drop the reps down to 5x5 for strength and hit some accessory work after for hypertrophy. I like dips and incline bb/db for high repsSome people can do it, but with only three months under your belt it's going to be very hard to bench that often and recover properly. I do an intermediate program called Madcow, where I do 4 X 5 warm up sets, working up linearly to my three or five rep maximum. On volume days I do 8 X 8 at about 75 % of my 3RM or 80 % of my 5RM. I do heavy, rest, volume, rest, heavy, volume, rest on consecutive days over a week. I also take *long* breaks leading up to my heaviest set, often 10 minutes. If it doesn't bore you then don't be afraid to take long rest breaks. It really does make a big difference, especially with that last set.Amino Acids = Protein


Yeah, yeah, the balance of individual amino acids matters, and paying attention to this is especially important on a vegan or vegetarian diet, but if you're getting enough protein daily the timing doesn't matter at all.I read one study,  but the dosages were ridiculous. 8g/100g... If you were a 200lb man you would have to eat 16 pounds of garlic powder power day to replicate that. I'm Australian. A day that you call "The firey depths of Satan's anus" I would call "Tuesday"So if its a carb that's not being digested, then it shouldn't count as a carb in the first place; is that correct? I assume its an artificial sweetener that just goes right through the gut and into stool. So it doesn't affect one's macros. The gap between your pecsDefinetly take the slack out of your arms at the start of the lift. You can easily tear a bicep or fuck up your neck with heavier weights jerking the bar like that. Secondly, get your ass lower at the start and break the weight off of the ground with your quads. Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. Glide it against your shins. Lock the weight out by thrusting your hips forward but don't exaggerate and hyperextend. It really depends. It is possible.

There are many factors we need to understand the situation.

What is your height, sex , age and weight?

I went from a fat 250lb and am currently at a slightly less fat 228lb and all my lifts have gone up.

Just for example my squat has gone from  185lb 5x5 to a 260lb 3x5. you never know, 100% of people who exercise and sleep eventually die. also 100% of people who breathe air eventually die. these are the silent killersI love peanut butter so much. I add it to oatmeal, spread it on toast, or just spoon it directly into my mouth.

I strongly recommend against running in 40C+.

Heat stroke, dehydration...the **very unlikely** risk of seizures, definitely not worth it amigo.Strstd is generous on their 1rms, i find the all things gym calculator to be pretty accurateYour squat is 100lbs less than your bench and 200lbs  less than your deadlift? How does that work?In the gym, where people tend to be focused on physique, does it bother you to interact with someone that is a significantly taller than you? e.g., if working in means that the equipment has to be adjusted for height, do you care? With some guys I get the vibe that they dislike the fact that I have to literally raise the bar for my sets.

That plate under the heel trick works like magic. Thanks I appreciate it! That really sucks I worry alot a out hurting myself. You recover okay? Until pretty recently I would have been recommending bench dips strongly, but the fact that you have to internally rotate your shoulders to get a grip on the bench set up behind you means the shoulder joint is set up fo all sorts of junkiness.

So, while I'm a big fan of dips on parallel bars or rings, I wouldn't recommend them *yet* until she's gotten used to moving her scapulae around and developed enough strength to keep good form.OPs squat seems very low compared to his other lifts so I was thinking similarlyYes, cold temps cause you to expend more calories.

How many more ? Negligble amounts.

Feel free to research it, but it's hardly something worth exploiting. Continuing to follow your program, and modifying your program if you can't, so that you keep exercising and keep eating a proper diet is the 99% you should remain focused on.

[There is a limit to fat loss without also losing muscle](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq) and it doesn't matter if your deficit comes from cold temps or hot temps or average temps or inside exercise or outside exercise or just eating less food.

&gt; The overall rate of an animal's metabolism increases by a factor of about two for every 10 C (18 F) rise in temperature, limited by the need to avoid hyperthermia.

( while this may sound like a lot, you have to realize most people won't be running outside in the cold for 24 hours ... assuming ones BMR was 2,000, that's 2,000/24 = 83.33 calories per hour, so if you're outside running for 30 minutes, a 'factor of 2' is only 41.66 calories versus 83.33 calories, and not eating that single slice of garlic bread at dinner is worth a good 100-200 calories )

( note ... i think I may have completely fucked up the math, but i think the overall point still remains valid ... its neglible in the context of an overall program ... now where did I put those nootropics ... )
In addition to what's been said, a couple things I've found help:

* Eat more vegetables with your meals.
* Use sugar free gum and black coffee to stave off hunger.
* Drinking a 1L bottle of seltzer makes you feel quite full.
* Play with your meal timing. I got on intermittent fasting a few years back, I typically eat breakfast around noon. The first couple weeks were kind of rough, but after I got used to not eating until that late, I rarely get hungry in the morning, and I'm able to eat more in the afternoon/evening, which helps me feel full. Other people have better luck by eating small meals more frequently, or snacking.I prefer 48 per fortnight. 65 to me doesn't feel like a heavy weight to me, so that may be part of the problem. 65 is just my comfortable level where it's not too light or too heavy, and I can do higher reps of it. But it would make sense to cut it out of a couple days and maybe change my weight I watched [this](http://youtu.be/ikydoRZUUIM) video on it and it all seemed safe up until he started talking about Yohimbe extract A.K.A [Yohimbine](http://examine.com/supplements/Yohimbine/) which is used to treat erectile disfunction. I actually don't want to get erections while I workout. But reading the bottle it doesn't say anything about Yohimbe extract.  Here's the [dosages](http://www.popeyescanada.com/images/InfoPages/MuscleTech/mt-nanostim-info.gif).I hope you're not being sarcastic. Because the program isn't made for  aesthetics but for strong lifts... Even the result pictures they use on their website aren't that appealing. Those are supposed to be the best of the pictures they got.What's a chest gap?Thanks mateI personally found that oatmeal is very satiating.I actually can &amp; do do those already!I bench 6 days a week, which I'm told I shouldn't do lol. But I consistently do 65 at 3 sets of 10. I haven't tried changing that because I struggle with the last set so muchShe doesn't have to start by hopping onto a pair of Olympic rings and trying to max out. She could easily start with [bench dips](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/bench-dips), which are pretty safe and easy to learn.

Or she could easily use a dip machine or some resistance bands to do assisted dips.Ok good to hear. Thanks so much for your response! Is it heavy every day? You're probably struggling to recover. Maybe drop a couple of days completely and change two of them to relatively light weight, but high volume. High volume will get you some hypertrophy, which really helps with benching.How often are you benching and how much volume? I bench four times a week. Two days are "heavy", with one working up to a five rep max and the other working up to a five rep max. The other two days are high volume, 8 X 8. Although my bench is still shit, it is improving.I'm 5'8" and 190, I have a very small chest gap, my hands are medium/large sized, and my wrists are about normalMost animal sources of protein are about equal. Plant based proteins tend to not have all of the amino acids you need, so they must be combined such as beans and rice to form a complete amino acid chain.Cheat days are good psychologically but you have to make sure they don't turn into binge days. This has been a problem for me lately.

What I have to get back to is... A day of maintenance eating (not formally, just eating like a human) with one cheat meal. You look great man! Nice progress!  Next bulk if I were you I'd hit your lats and traps harder, but it all really depends on what look you want. Amazing transformation.Try keeping your elbows pointed down throughout the squat.

[form analysis](http://i.imgur.com/i7Lqddg.jpg)

The left side of the picture is the start of your descent.  The right side is in the middle of the ascent.  You can see your elbows go from pointing down to pointing back.  I think if keep them down throughout, your back will stay more upright and you'll get the fluid rise out of the hole that you are looking for.I read a thread recently here on a similar topic about motivation when the OP asked about having motivation because of negative body image. Someone else replied with, "I hate my body more than you hate your body."

It's very bleak and blunt, but it triggered a motivation in me to continue at it.

I also agree with everyone, getting outside when the sun is shining helps. Breathe fresh air. Keep it up!
Addiction,discipline and habit beat temporary motivation any day!Very true.. Thank you!In addition to what /u/leftcoastgrump said compression clothing helps wick sweat away from skin, and it's a light weight layer of clothing. I like wearing compression pants under my shorts when I run in cold weather.Thank you! I am gonna be working on those.Then it's on the ground, so it's not your problem anymore, seems like a no brainer to me. Thank you! I'm very enthusiastic. I've never been a huge gym goer but as soon as I started lifting, I got addicted :)I don't think it would be wise for her to try dips yet, 3 months into training and having only had experience of smith machine bench pressing so far.You need to add more than this.

Height, weight, age, sex, how much is your deficit, supplements, macros?

How much sleep are you getting? When did you start the cut? How long have you been lifting? A 140 pound female squatting 200 lbs for reps is different than a 220 pound male squatting for reps. Its hard to diagnose your issue without knowing more about the whole situation.

*edit*

Thanks for the downvotes, fucksticks... Bodyweights until you can do a decent amount. (e.g. 20 pushups, 5 pullups, 30 squats). Then you should start hitting weights.*high five* With our superior lower center of gravity, we'll be running this place!Thank you! I'll incorporate some of those.Step 1: Be Tony Horton

That dude is like 55 and fitter than most people of any age. What's your height and weight? Do you have a chest gap? Do you have small hands/wrists?Excellent, good luck!
Glad to hear of all the progress you've been making elsewhere though, you sound enthusiastic :DThere are only two differences that being 16 will make. You will recover faster than us old folks. Also if you injure yourself via bad form you'll have to live with it for even longer than us.I'm getting to 7 weeks out from a figure competition. Did my first show last spring and this will be my second one-put on a lot of muscle over the past year and I'm excited to start seeing the muscles being uncovered as I work on cutting! :)

https://instagram.com/p/zVkjAkBeKp/
(Sorry I don't have Imgur so I hope it's ok for me to link the pic to IG)Stalling out while cutting is normal. Follow the program.The only problem I see is that you're doing sumo.Okay! I will work on that.One thing I notice is your bar placement is high, but you start the lift with your hips instead of your knees. This causes you to have to fight folding over on every rep. The bar wants to remain balanced over your instep, and if it goes too far in either direction you're gonna have problems. I see the same thing in my gym all the time. People sitting way back but with high bar placement; a lot of them end up balancing on their toes every rep.

You might have better luck remaining more upright and breaking at the knees first (a normal high bar squat) or putting the bar lower on your back.Dips(with or without weight), Incline/decline bench, close grip bench, dumbbell presses, etc.

Pretty much anything that works the muscles used in the bench press.Hell yeah, dude! Congrats. Had hopes of hitting 1000 club at the start of this year but I got a knee injury. Thanks!I've spent the past several years watching the number on the scale slowly creep up...  The bigger it gets, the worse I feel about myself and the lower my self confidence seems to be.  My whole family was thin until they graduated high school, then they all put on weight until basically they were obese or very close to it.  Since I was a kid they always would say things like, "Enjoy all that bread and cheese while you can!  One day it's all going to go to your hips and butt and you'll get fat if you don't stop eating it!"  Now that I'm older and starting to get a bit too chubby, they're almost rubbing it in.  They actually make me feel bad for trying to get in better shape too because I'm the thinnest/fittest (aside from my 16 year old sister who hardly has any fat content).  Every time I try to do something, I get discouraged one way or another and give up.  Not telling anyone is actually great advice, especially in my situation.

I'm 22/F 5'3" and stopped weighing myself when I was teetering around 160lb.  I didn't want to know anymore.  I'm sure if I'm past 160 that I'm at a max of 165, but it's still at least 40lb more than I want to be.

Seeing you achieve this in only a year makes me feel like if I could get myself to stick to it I'd feel amazing a year from now.  I think it would really help my relationship too.  Most of the weight was put on after I got with my current bf because I worked from home last year for several months.  Money got tight and we started eating way too much junk since it was cheaper.  He's mentioned getting in better shape to me, but I just can't seem to stick with it long enough.  I want to do it for him almost as I want to do it for me.

Great job and congrats.  You really do look great.  I think I'll at least start watching my calories for a while and hopefully work up to the kind of things you've been doing.  :)Holy crap, I scroll through the pictures to compliment what an amazing job you did with your body and its transformation, and then bam, I see the flawless Mystique cosplay. Wow, I don't know which one I'm impressed by more now...Small sustainable lifestyle changes are the way to go if you don't want to put it all back on. If you go off to some camp and you loose weight that's great, but not if you fall back into the old habits that got you overweight in the first place as soon as you get home.6 days of benching per week is far too many I'm afraid!

I'd advise every other day *at most*.


Additionally,  a form check video could be helpful.[Here is what strstd says.](http://imgur.com/CW5oK47)

Oddly if I plug in my 5RM on deadlift it calculates my 1RM quite a bit lower.

I've never tested my 1Rm on squat and probably won't until I think I have a shot at the 1,000 club. stdstr says its 281 which seems frighteningly heavy to me. I don't even think I would attempt to unrack that now.

I have no idea why my OHP is so terrible. Its my first priority when I finish my current cut.
Maybe bench *less* often, to give yourself time to recover.

DB pressing could help, or dipswell done keep it up :)Another Nutella user here, I love it with my whey! I just scrape it off with a knife onto the inside of my blender bottle and shake it up. Sometimes it will have a little residue but I just lick that shit up.

I use it as a 2:1 ratio with my whey. 40g whey, 20g nutella. Might taste too light for some people but it's perfect for me.Sounds easy enough. Thank you!I feel great at 34, too. I do all of the things /u/AyCarrumba listed, and life is good. In addition to fitness, these things will make you mentally sharper, too. If I'd known how good my 30s would be, I'd have turned 30 sooner. I've been a gym rat a little over half of my adult life with some long lapses here and there. All in all, I think I train smarter and harder now, and I have better psychological hardiness to keep working hard when I'm suffering. I think a little bit of age makes it more important that I keep my sleep, diet, and alcohol consumption reasonable, but I feel great overall.
What was your routine as far as volume goes to get it up to that if you don't mind me asking?Spot reduction for fat isn't a thing. Only possible thing I can think of is maybe it will give you some size gains in your legs, and the butt will be smaller in comparison? But i don't know the specifics of ellipticals, but i doubt you'll be gaining much muscle by doing light cardio.I bench every time I go, which is usually 6 days a week.. So I definitely do it frequently enough I think. I'll definitely try less reps/more weight. What would you recommend as far as accessory work?This post has [too little content](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_3._posting_rights_require_minimum_qualifications). **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness&amp;amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2wml56/why_do_dairy_farmers_all_have_huge_legs/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

Just be sure you track caloric intake, macros, lift numbers, etc. and follow it.

If you get stuck or stall, ask for specific advice and explain the situation so people can help you past the specific problem.
Brah, your life is still novice, trust me.Thank you for the reply! I hadn't even considered that!Two months? Wooooo good job man!You should do more weight and less reps if you want to gain weight. Ten rep sets is mainly good for muscle mass. Sets of five reps would be much better for gaining strength. Also adding more volume on your bench will help as well. So basically bench more weight for more sets or more often.I just did a Google search for it, it seems like a real product. If you want to know what it does head over to examine.com and start looking up ingredients.It also has a good amount of fat in there.For legs I prefer orc squats over goblin. A lot of resistance band stuff can be done by wrapping the band between your palms/wrist instead of your thumb. You can probably get a varied workout that way if you have access to bands.Is your username for sale?You have several options:

* Bench more often

* Switch up your sets/reps, do some 5x5 sets or heavy singles or doubles

* Add in accessory work to aid your benchSo, in effect, if I follow it to the best of my ability I will see results, and when those results aren't getting me where I'd like to be I should change it up?What's healthy is something sustainable. Usually that means making small changes. A boot camp might work for you, or you might injure yourself and be discouraged. I would reccomend choosing one fitness thing to start with and do that consistently for a couple weeks before adding another thing.

For example, start with couch to 5k and increase your stamina. Then in a few weeks start strong lifts or bodyweight training and add that.

Another option is just pledge to do one video from fitnessblender.com every day for a month. It's a great resource for short workouts, and you can search by difficulty level and equipment needed. A lot of their videos are a good combo of cardio and strength
Eventually you will probably want to look at your diet, too. Are you eating well? Even if you are, are your portions too big? &gt;Alan Thrall

Oatmeal is oatmeal. ( and by this, I mean, noone can tell you if oatmeal fits into your overall diet and program and life or not. Oatmeal is oatmeal. Should you eat some ? Only you can answer that. There are no magic beans, Jack. )

The above 2 links are all the info you need to create meals, and meal plans for yourself. http://myfitnesspal.com is good for tracking your actual intake and bathroom scale results.

( and just to try to be more clear ... I could provide advice like 'drink more water' or 'eat more protein' or 'eat a fiber pill' or 'take ephedrine it blunts hunger' ... but all that advice is for people who are already eating a proper diet ... the links I provided are tools for you to eat a proper diet, which might be all that is required to solve your problem ... it's generally not wise to put 100 bandaids on a wound that requires surgery )
I've had the same thing happen.Enjoy https://www.youtube.com/user/EpicMealTime/videosNot exactly stupid, but I missed the supplements day, so I will try to sound as stupid as possible here.

When picking up my 100% legal supps from my connection in a dark alley he gave me some "MuscleTech Nanostim Super-Concentrated Nitric Oxide Stimulant" for free. What the hell are these things? Will I die if I eat them? Should I trust spooky pills? Will this ~~give me boners while I workout?~~ give me stronger boners when I work out?More cold water got it. Thanks.Does oatmeal help?5' 6" and my PR is 340 lbs. Love DL because I don't have near the range of motion of you tall guys. My goal is to be able to pull 400lbs. I like doing the elliptical for LISS rather than jogging or power walking because it's easier on my joints... BUT a friend of mine has put a bit of doubt in my mind about it. She said that using the elliptical makes your butt smaller in size. She had no evidence to back it, just something she had heard. I like my bum the size it is...is there any truth to her claim? I understand why you would burn fat overall, but why would it specifically shrink your bum? I just finished week one. I went back and forth on the issue before starting and settled on starting with just the bar for two reasons. 1. To perfect form. 2. Adding weight every session means it will become real weight fairly quickly..

First day I busted out my squats with just the bar. I was happy with my form, but it was easy. I grabbed my shit and was moving over to the other area of the gym and some guy who wanted the squat rack asked me if I was done (fairly obvious I was), I responded affirmatively, and... He asked again because he didn't expect me to say yes. It was weird..

But yeah this first month is going to be a drag because it's way too easy, but I really think it's a great window to review basic lift mechanics.

The question is ... are you willing to use ICF to accomplish your goals ?

ICF is a program ... it is your job to follow it, and you will get out of it what you put into it.

When it stops delivering results, and you are certain you are putting 110% into it and following it correctly, then you can look for a new program. Should be good for at least a year.

There are too many variables concerning your life, personal schedule, resources, gym equipment, etc for anyone to be able to tell you "yes it's perfect for you." It is effective for people who follow it, as are many other programs.

Your post hit a lot of sensitive places for and made me really upset. It is exactly what I need though. I am your before picture. We could be twins and to see what my body could look like with some damn effort makes me feel really horrible that I am not doing it already. You are going to be my motivation though and I am going to stop hiding my head in the sand trying to feel ok about how I look.
Thank you for being an inspiration. Hi lulz - Looks great to me! Great program bro - keep at it - very good stuff!

When I see other xxfitters posting in /r/fitness it makes me feel like we need a secret handshake. Anyway, you look awesome and super lean, not at all puffy. Start smoking lol. Rugby!Strictest of diet and cardio. Drugs also work wonders. I guess that makes sense. I pretty regularly see people post their lifts and think that their squat value doesn't really mesh with their other two, maybe a result of an above parallel squat?

Thanks for your answer.Im 16 and 210 pounds. I have close to no stamina and most of my weight is fat. I really want a huge lifestyle change and want to turn, eventually, into the best me I can be physically. I need your guys advice? Is it healthy for me to get in super good shape super quick or would it be better for me too take it slow and steady? I'm considering doing a sort of fitness boot camp for the next 2 months or so, is this a good idea?My back squat is 170kg and my front squat is 140kg. That is more in line with everyone I know as far as ratios go.Multi vitamin: micro nutrient safety net

I just want to look beach goodHey guys, whenever I do overhead press while standing with a barbell, I feel a slight pinch/pop from a vein in my right hand at the very bottom of the lift. Anyone know what's happening? I don't feel it until I'm lowering the barbell from my head down_Someone in this thread said vitamin d. I think this is huge especially for people who don't go outside much. I'm going to pick up some from the grocery store tomorrow. I think I've got a bit of the same seasonal depression.I really don't think this is a good program for a beginner. One, because it's a lot of volume, you're likely to burn out quickly if you're not used to doing that much. The main reason is that the rep scheme changes constantly, so it can be hard to track your progress and know your limitations.Okay bud. Ur gonna Ronnie Coleman then die :(Thanks for your analysis man, it's super helpful, and me and my buddies were talking about starting to do front squats so I'm going to de load a tad and focus on form a bit more and see if I can't improve my squat [These things](http://www.tractorsupply.com/en/store/rubber-horse-stall-mat-4-ft-x-6-ft)Just get it waxed?Beauty, I'll definitely look into some programs. Thanks a lot!Use a variety of pull up grips - wide, close, pronated, supinated, mixed grip etc - it will make you stronger in every aspect of pull up strength.It's a deload week.Use common tools to estimate the amount.  So figure the rice might have been 1 cup cooked,  and the meat was 6oz etc...  Whichever measuring system you use its fairly easy to guess.  Added oils and hidden sauces will trip you up.  Most people eat home cooked meals for this reason when cutting cals, otherwise it will take you a lot longer to dial your diet in. Thanks for the tip man, this month I'm going beast mode.Also, use those glutes. Squeeze at the top of lockout to bring hips foreward.  Don't lean backwards like crazy.  Just squeeze your glutes enough to bring your hips forward.Man so apparently this shit happens all the time?

I feel like I am missing out :[ Thanks for correcting me, I was misinformed
They are chalked up. I was sweating bad and my hands kept getting wet. I went for 405 just couldn't get it up. You'll become a little slimmer, your legs and chest will become a little bigger and you'll have more broad shoulders. But no one will notice except you. It's not an aesthetics program and you wont look like you lift even a year on it.Use chinups instead A large majority of people do not squat ATG.

I usually assume lowbar and parallel or below but I guess I'm biased because that is how I squat haha. Nice dude! Just managed it on Sunday myself! Although I'm 212 lbs lol.

#102000 calories doesn't mean anything. It is a quantity without a frame of reference or application.

TDEE - X or TDEE + X does mean something. It is an amount over or under what your body requires for energy.

I have a very comprehensive and effective OAP/OAC guide I wrote - I would be happy to post; it if is allowed.

I am 180lbs/6'1" and have been doing multiple OACS (7 rh/5lh) for over 30 years.I'm 225lbs and 6'4". 185 is about 80% of my body weight. That's pitiful for a guy who was pulling 355 for 5 (I started deadlifting several months before squatting). Also, I've been fairly athletic for my whole life.Box squats... Adjust the height lower as you become stronger until you are doing full range squats,  or try a leg press machine. What's wrong with 3 chicken fetuses weekly?Care to share your diet/exercise plan that you achieved this with?What would be a solid exercise program for a teenager?  I have read all the dieting rules and have a healthy diet now.  I just need to get on board with a routine now.  I am not sure which sidebar program to pick as I am 16,  which I fear may affect what I should be doing don't jerk the weight up like that, and lock out better, squeeze your glutes and get a neutral spine - not leaning forwardI know it's not an aesthetic program, I still want to know what the aesthetic changes arefuck youCompression clothing can prevent various parts of your anatomy from moving around and chafing. I've also seen it recommended to people who've lost a lot of weight in helping to deal with loose skin. I suspect most of it is sold for aesthetic reasons, though.

Gloves will make it slightly harder to grip the bar. Chalk (or liquid chalk) is a better option if you're having an issue with grip slipping.Backpack push-ups are a worthwhile addition to your chest routine, provided you've a strong enough pack.I can't tell if your hands are chalked up, but if they are, you could've gone higher for your deadlift.I have nothing to add really, but I want to echo your endorsement of the program.

To save other people the trouble of looking it up, it works like this.  Suppose you can do three pullups. Today, do a set of 3, a set of 2 and three sets of 1.  Tomorrow, do 3,2,2,1,1.  For the following days do the reps like so:

    3,2,2,2,1
    3,3,2,2,1
    3,3,3,2,1
    4,3,3,2,1
    4,4,3,2,1
    5,4,3,2,1
    5,4,3,2,2
    5,4,3,3,2
    5,4,4,3,2
    5,5,4,3,2
    6,5,4,3,2
    ...
Train every day or almost every day.  When you get to where the first set is for 10, do 10,8,6,4,2 followed by 10,8,6,4,3, then 10,8,6,5,3 and so on.  Eventually, you will be doing 20,16,12,8,4 and working your way up from there.

This program works well for other bodyweight exercises as well.Well just about anything will work if you follow the program, find something you can do and do it is all. For me going to the gym is a fail, I do t go, but I go to the living room. So Kettlebells in the living room is my path to glory and it works for me, figure out what works for youMaybe see a physical therapist. They can give you an appropriate exercise program for your individualized status and needs. It is amazing how much endurance you lose even with a short hospital stay.frequently discussed in exercise science textbooks. One of the most reliable and productive exercise scientists in the world, Keijo Hakkinen, has demonstrated that the inclusion of aerobic training with strength training does, in fact, reduce the amount of strength gain compared to that produced by strength training alone (European Journal of Applied Physiology
89[1]: 42-52, 2003).
The mechanism of interference is not understood. In a pretty strong review of the relevant scientific literature, a well-respected group of exercise scientists from New Zealand noted that much of the research did demonstrate varying degrees of interference.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness) if you have any questions or concerns.*It applies for people doing splits, where they dedicate each day to certain body parts rather than doing a full body routine like Starting Strength. It's usually best for intermediate to advanced lifters, which doesn't mean that beginners don't do splits so much as they're usually unnecessary and suboptimal for novice lifters.

Typical types of splits you'll see are by body part (often called a "bro split"), by movement pattern (push/pull/legs), or by location (upper/lower).Cut out only 300-500 calories per day, do cardio at a steady pace, drink plenty of water, lift weights, make sure your protein intake is no less than 70% of your body weight (grams of protein of course). I prefer one cheat day, but nothing crazy. It does, thank you! Yah, I got it now. Thanks.They'll go to waist all right..I don't have a scale, I meant to mention that...
But I'll be buying one soon! I literally just said uncooked. There is no point in ever weighing your meat cooked.

*Always uncooked*. It seems like you're rounding your low back and not bracing your core enough.  Also, it's called a DEADlift, so make sure that the bar is resting on the ground before you get it back up again.  Don't be afraid to reset in between reps, it's better than hurting yourself.  You'll want to think of it as a push movement, not a pull.  Your arms are just attaching the weight to you, so keep them straight.  You want to push through your heels, not pull with your arms/back.Yeah i know, but in the end, it makes sense to me, can work with in the long run, and is better than sitting on one's ass. Slower progress, maybe, maybe not. Just do it, do it because you decided you will. It is not about being happy as much as getting things done.  Both exercise and overcoming obstacles make you feel betterfuck it dude, you look fine, do some cardio 3x a week and enjoy living into your 90'sI only feel this when using my favorite butt plug at the gym Thanks a lot! These happened to come up way easier than they felt. I'm going to retest them in about a month or 2 probably 2 to see where I'm at. I have seen it, definently a good one...

I find bent rows is the hardest to keep your breath in your belly forI had a s'mores one today and omfg. The taste is not quite s'mores, but it's a delicious baked-good taste with a hint of cinnamon and just sweet enough. I wanted to go all cookie-monster on it, lol.Looking like a greek god when ripped? Hello?Creatine is naturally occuring, so theres no need to cycle it, unlike stuff like pre-workout. I think cycling only has to be done on things "unnatural", so that your body doesn't get used to it, but like i said, creatine is natural.

And on a side note, don't bother overloading creatine. You'll just shit it all out. http://www.esupplements.com/article/creatine-myths/ "Excess creatine isnt used by the body. Instead, its excreted in the form of creatinine. So, overloading on creatine wont do you much good."Well first fix your diet, try the slow carb diet and it has a reddit. Next strength training, it can be weights, Kettlebells, bodyweight or some reasonable mix.  Do not design your own program but use an existing one, you don't know how to design a good program.  Then just do the program for 40 weeks for 40 pounds of fat. Its a 70cc scoop that is 30.4 grams/serving. If you don't have a scale then its right around 1/3 cup or 4.75tbsp. Hope this helps. I guess im just lazy to make my own, looking for a routine that has been proven to be effective for Judo. I had a S&amp;C coach for Rugby that made these stuff for me, looked like 5/3/1 but with linear periodization now that I think about it. When you see people training a lift 3x or more a week, they aren't focusing on damaging one body part enough to illicit growth. You have to find a balance of frequency, intensity, and volume that suits your goals. If you're performing a movement 3x a week you have to make sure that you are letting yourself fully recover before the next time you do it, which is harder if you are following it up with bodybuilding style accessory work.If you have a food scale, the website says it's 30.4 grams.32 grams aka 2.1333 tablespoons.Ideally you will want to have a slight bend at the knees in order to keep your back flat/straight.  Bend at the knees enough to be able to reach the bar.

Check out [Alan Thrall's "How To Barbell Row"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8l_8chR5BE) video for a great demo.  It was one of the first videos of his I watched, and has helped me quite a bit. I fixed the issue long ago. It was not popping in the bicep like you mention it was strictly my forearm and was solved by lower the weight while developing a stronger grip and forearms. nice work man!!! welcome to the club and your squats and deads looked to easy!It's not an aesthetic program. If you care that much about looks, you should choose a different program For me, a guy a little over 6' tall who can dunk, I think I owe it to the plyometric work that I do.  I used to train with a couple current and former NFL guys during the off season and slowly started adding more and more plyo into my workouts.  Now my preferred cardio workouts include a ton of lateral lunges, diagonal bounds to sprint, hurdle jumps to sprint, bench sprints and many others.  My favorite exercise is to kneel on the ground in front of a mid-high plyo box holding a broomstick overhead.  Then i do a knee to feet jump (kind of difficult for beginner athletes when done with proper form) then plant, gather and do a controlled box jump.  I also love sitting on a small plyo box/bench and then jumping onto a high one while seated...  Keep in mind the knee to feet jump is very tough for beginners when done correctly.  Heres a descent vid for technique...  [Knee to Feet Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y_WGJGaU0M)Since you can do 185x4, your 1RM should be just over 200lb.  That's very close to a 2x bodyweight squat, which for two years of casual lifting is really impressive.  You sound discouraged, but you've entered a level of training where it just becomes more difficult to improve your squat numbers.

I definitely echo the other users suggestions to get on a program.  It will help you break through your plateau.  The bulk of your workouts on a program would be squatting 75%-95% of your 1RM.  Now, it looks like the fewest reps in your regular routine is seven, you definitely need more sets in the 4-6 range, then heavier sets of 3, then even heavier sets of 1-2.  That will help you set a higher 1RM then you basically rinse and repeat.The shakes will be pre-made so all you have to do is take them out of the fridge and drink them.Carl's Junior and Chipotle. I can pack that stuff away like it's nothing. The only thing is that I have to drink a lot of water to offset all the sodium.I hadn't heard of him before. Apparently he once squatted 320 kg (700 lbs) for 11 reps. That is absolutely incredible.Soy milk? Pretty much tastes the same if you use protein powder.
Is there any age limit??If your goal is to lose weight, start lifting. If it's to maintain, start lifting, but make sure to consume enough protein. If your goal is to bulk, start lifting and eating more. Either way, lifting will help you meet your goal faster, whatever it is..That's not really correct. The US has more taxes and a higher public debt than Switzerland. Switzerland is just less of a horribly inefficient mess.

They have Decriminalized Marijuana, Legalized prostitution, relatively free banking, Public debt/GDP about 1/2 of United States (still not great--about 40%, .7% DEFLATION per year (I was shocked when I found that out) which, despite Keynesian fears, is working really well for them. Buying health insurance is mandatory, a la ACA, and minimal standards are set by the State, but consumers buy insurance from a competitive marketplace (it isn't handled by employers) and all plans have coinsurance premiums and deductables to incentivize frugality-- the result is that Swiss pay significantly less for healthcare per capita.

They're also  the most economically free country in Europe, and is  considered a tax haven With an average 1% income tax for individuals (up to 11% for multi-millionaires), .3% property taxes, 8% capital gains tax, 8% VAT.

So in many ways it's exactly what a lot of modern republicans and tea-party folk want on he economic side, and what the more moderate democrats and liberals want on the social side. Combine the two, and you have a relatively libertarian state. That's what I figured. My biceps so swole they overtaking important bits.Thanks for clarifying. I'll try tomorrow. The treadmills near me go by level for incline but I'm sure I can find the info online. I'll try it at 6 mph and see how that goes.
Any experienced runner is going to tell you that you can't do both well. You see it over in /r/running all the time.

That's what the off-season is for, heavier cross training and building strength. Once running season starts ramping up, you have to make a decision to either focus on the running and scale back on the weights or be mediocre in both (or risk injury because you're not giving yourself enough time to recover).Probably the nerve getting pinched a little.

My numbers are currently pretty low but I've been making a decent amount of progress and I do my best to keep up good form.

The Starting Strength involves multiple compounds lifts, yet often people talk about "arm day" and "leg day" and "chest day" and whatnot. I'm pretty sure that I'll stick with the program for the time being, but I'm just curious as to what kind of lifter that applies for--advanced? Intermediate?

&gt;If you're sick, hurt, or injured you should be getting help and/or advice somewhere else - preferably from a doctor. While people in Fittit might have similar conditions as you, not a single person will be able to examine you personally or understand your specific situation, and it's very hard to validate credentials over the internet. You should instead find a professional with proper schooling and experience who can examine and treat you in person. General Practitioners might not be the best for sports-related issues, so it is recommended that you find a Sports Medicine doctor or a Physical Therapist.

&gt;Prohibited topics include, but are not limited to: training advice with a known medical condition; training advice specifically involving an injured body part; and "general experience" posts asking about other people's experiences with a particular injury.  Posts on these topics are considered requests for medical/injury advice and are not allowed.  Posts seeking training advice that *excludes* an injured body part are allowed.

Whenever I OHP I would feel a weird popping in my bicep that didnt hurt but couldn't be good. Two things solved this problem right away. A bicep pump or forearm pump really fucks with the lift, especially at the bottom. Try to OHP first or at least before any direct arm work. Second, a grip too narrow with a really tight elbow angle contributed to the popping. Try widening your grip a bit, and see if that fixes it.It might just be a simple case of hitting the limit of linear progression.

A deload period might help, or doing BP substitutes for a while.Same!I will upvote any Bryzgalov reference.Anyone have before/after pics for SL 5x5?I like Kettlebells, they work for me, /r/kettlebell fore more info.  Not too expensive to get started withCylon tea.That's a good question, I'd have to guess strongman or olympic lifting because you get to see the other people competing against you. With olympic lifting though, if I had my way I'd make you go to a gym that specializes in training athletes like that with someone who actually knows how to coach in the lifts.Do you do any curls?You don't need motivation.
Motivation is that which gets you started.

Discipline and the formation of habit is what you require.
It's not randomly stopping, it's you not wanting it as badly as when you were first motivated.There are diminishing returns with this. A certain amount of moisture can overpower body powder quite easily. Who the fuck does 20 sets of one exercise? That shit is not optimal.Thank you, I've finally got accustomed to the hunger. Nuts and apples work like magic.5'6" man, I wish :(Nah man, you can just keep going and you can have more. I got to 4 once. k so do starting strength or one of the other programs while running in the summer. during CC, reduce lifting while maintaining/increasing running. during wrestling probs do the reverse.Bro - a fortnight = 2 weeks. Good try though.My girlfriend sells it works products! They have amazing diet supplements and vitamins, all natural. When used with exercising the results are amazing.

http://thatkrazybodywrapthing.com/Can't be as bad as rugby injuries, probably similar. hahaIncline is harder on the shoulders. My advice for your shoulder : do some light rotator cuff exercises in addition to whatever your main workout stuff is. A bad injury requires consistent attention to restrengthen the area and avert future injuries.Yeah, I'm 5'9" and 160 and currently eating 3500. I guess I get the worst of both worldsIm already decent at the Clean and Jerk. I refuse to do snatch, I am not a fan of the movement. You're lifting advice is definitely what I was thinking already, thank you. Definitely worried about knee injuries the most lol

My  Strength conditioning regimen was first about rugby then it became power-lifting (so I did try out starting strength) but I got depressed from it. My body was made to grab other folks and thrash around :P So although I've only started Judo recently I'm picking it up pretty fast, my sensei doesn't believe me when I say I've never trained before. 5 years natty, 2 years with gearI don't wanna be that guy, but you aren't doing the program if you change it like that. :( I'm doing a P/P/L and typically im doing 3 days on then a rest day. So typically im giving my chest 48-72 hours between workouts. My diet is on par with protein and calories, gaining weight. I do cross country and wrestlingRICE. Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. cyclingI think you're probably just done with your LP gains and you should switch do a program which has more weight and reps progression.I recommend doing lunges and dynamic stretches everyday to get your mobility/range better in your knees/hips. I had depth problems and started doing these everyday, as well as just trying to squat and stay in the squatting position comfortably. This allowed to me start going ATG on my squats and with some deloads I've been able to go up in weight with good form and depth. Just have to make sure you keep loose and warm up properly and stretch. Don't overdue it, and put in the time to get your flexibility up, your knees will thank you if you give them time.I've recently started doing those regularly. The guy I go with loves them and got me into doing them regularly and I can vouch for a large improvement in deadsWhat type of recovery are you giving your muscles? I'm talking in terms of rest primarily and nutrition secondDrink more water and drink it before and after every time you're going to eat something. Drink a glass first thing when you wake up, drink one before and after a meal/snack, and drink one when you go to bed. Wait I thought you were a tall guy speaking6'5 here, also aiming for 4000 cals. Shit is goddamn hard.That's exactly how I am too. Breaking the floor cleanly is critical to me not over thinking it and making the lift. Doing deficits really helpsI think fit buddy has something like that, it's a pretty good app all around actuallyThanks alot man. Yeah I noticed the deadlift came up easy so I tried 405 and couldn't even get it up. I guess for me it's get it up or not at all. Although it felt like it took forever as I was doing it What are you reading?

You don't need to cycle creatine. Just supplement every day.

[Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Creatine/)Just a recommendation, maybe add a link to Part 2. in your Part 1. post just to help maintain linkage!Nice work dude. That squat and dead looked easy peasyWell I mean, that will put a damper on things. Its all the pent up sperm I'm unable to get out because the tall dudes are taking the ladies.

But not really. Maybe? I don't know anymore. The chest press machine can be done without your thumb.yeah, i'm currently on 5/3/1 BBB but crammed it into 2 days.
It's not worth the trip imo for only 2 muscle groups, which is why I made the changes.  But yeah, I'd like to train more often, but I don't normally hear people training a muscle group more than 2 times a weekPeanut butter. I can't think of a more calorie dense food. Dude that is an awesome fucking direwolf tattoo. Pushing the hips back is a cue to avoid forward lean... So no. monday - bench + accessories (Pendlay rows, db curls, rear delt flys, a tricep exercise I pick out of a hat)

tuesday - squat + accessories (leg curl, GHRs, ab wheel)

thursday - OHP + accessories (lateral raise, rear delt flys, another random tricep exercise)

friday - deadlift + accessories (lat pulldowns or pullups, hypers if I feel like it)

I usually alternate volume one week with rep PRs the next week. I take deloads when I feel too beat up. Nothing special, reallyInteresting. I'll definitely try to focus more on that. Thanks!I think you're definitely right. Thanks for the tips!24, in Ohio. I eat relatively well tooGains are gains I guess...Great job! Those are impressive lifts at 190. What were your starting weights in September?I think there might be more of a market for fresh pressed juice. More of a pain to make/clean up than a smoothieAre you in the dorms at your college, or are you in an apartment where you have access to a kitchen where you can cook?Nice work.
Just out of curiosity, when you guys are giving squat values is it assumed you are squatting ATG? I see people list their squats all the time but never with a clarifying remark regarding style. I know that personally there is a significant difference between what I can squat ATG vs a power lifting parallel squat.Those are very impressive numbers!Nivea creme and coconut oil, no real way to avoid them just part of making gainz.
Totally depends on what your goals are but maybe lifting for one workout, running, bike or swimming for 2nd workout? Abs or yoga/stretching for 2nd?You should do them more cuz your running is aerobic, the opposite of anaerobic. Muscle building. Ice cream. It ain't hard to keep going. Take a daily multivitamin and take 500 mg of MTF-U preworkout. No, he isn't. 16 is a perfectly fine time to start lifting. To the OP: It can be intimidating to walk into a gym and lift but that shouldn't stop you. See if you can lift the bar and if you can't then I'm sure you can find some dumbbells to start with. Keep it simple when you start. A program like SS or SL will work fine. Keep reading up and start lifting asap!
Edit: If you feel more comfortable with body weight then do that!Thanks man! I take 2 days off a month, i think thats fine because I eat 3500 calories to make up for the amount of lifting i do haha, and I get plenty of sleep.I really liked the advice about not telling anyone. I have learned this about myself and sometimes other people. For some reason, if we're talking about it we're not doing it.I've never seen anything but the standard bar and these preweighted ones, which do indeed come in 10 lb increments. But I will definitely be looking when I go Monday!I take a fish oil supplement with my breakfast. I have oatmeal every morning and mix 5g of creatine into it.I've thought about that too, but I dont think I could get them tight enough to keep my foot from slipping inside the shoe.IMHO your dead wrong, I've seen stretch marks on my body appear pretty much over night.  I get a "Why bother?" sentiment
 sometimes when my confidence is low. I've just made going to the gym a requirement for myself so I go even if I'm feeling weak and chubby. I convince myself with the thought that I can always leave early if it's horrible but I've always left feeling better . I think your self-confidence will be improved by doing the hard thing of going when you are feeling low because you'll know you can have those feelings and still do what you need to.Same thing happens to me on certain exercises it goes away after a little while Thanks for the adviceSorry, just not comfortable with such an idea, plus I'm not going to be at thr gym again until Monday I also had really bad form with squats and what helped me was box squats.  You can find a video of Joe DeFranco explaining how to do them [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbz-txpK7KA).  I bought a piece of dowel for less then ten bucks and just used an ottoman as a box.  I found box squats to be great because you can sit then set yourself up like DeFranco explains.I understand what you mean. I have problems like this but more in the form of if I'm doing a certain exercise more correctly with less weight, or with more weight. I understand how you can do either 20 or 25 lbs. with 20 reps each set. It's about how you focus on the muscle, and sometimes less weight is better to get more of a focus on the muscle group, even if it means you have to up the reps or just flex more to feel it better, or even pausing where you feel the most burn to make it more difficult. I can't really answer your question, but I can understand what you mean - I ask my boyfriend questions like this in the gym and he just looks at me confused haha. There is the whole, "more reps less weight contributes to toned muscles" whereas "Less reps more weight contributes to bigger muscles". I think that muscles are muscles, and the "toned" thing is a myth. You're only spinning your wheels if you don't challenge yourself. So in regards to your question, my best shot at it is that like I said, muscles are muscles and you work them as hard as you are willing to push yourself. As a girl, I'm afraid of getting super big muscles, but I am still far from where I want to be with my muscles. So I will do lower reps, higher weight and more sets with the highest weight I can muster until I achieve the amount of muscle I want. As far as type of muscle, I don't think it really changes too much, however I could be totally wrong. I think that lower weight will cause you to only spin your wheels and won't get you to where you want to be any quicker. I hope I helped a little!!No sane person does 20 sets.I know its not wednesday anymore, but public service announcement. DON'T go to /r/progresspics if you like fitness. The comments make me so angry.I've tried both and I don't like either at all. I know it's an issue, so I watch what I buy and who I buy from :)Have you tried stir frying them or home made fried rice? each week i cook a few bags of veggies, and do a home made fried rice in my wok. It helps make them tastier! 4-5 eggs, few bags of veggies and like a pound of rice and some oil is all you need. Soy sauce if you want tooI used to eat anything I wanted no regards for moderation. I ate healthy foods but I also ate everything else.

I've been clean eating since January - spot on macros and caloric intake, no preservatives, no added salt, sugars, etc.

I give myself a cheat day but the more time goes on the less I actually cheat. After a month of clean eating, my cheat days left me feeling like shit; bloated, groggy, grumpy, hungover. Why not? It seems like a bit of a waste to go to the gym for a half hour workout 3 times a week. Is it normal to only do the 5x5 stuff?It might take less time to adapt than previously expected.  Studies show a significant change in your gut flora in [only a day](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-11/diet-changes-gut-bacteria-within-a-day-harvard-study-finds).

However if you eat a certain way 90% of the time and only eat differently once in a while, then you will have adapted back to your normal diet between each of those cheat days.  That would make each of them unpleasant.It's Easter, so take out with one set of in-laws on Saturday night, and an awesome Easter brunch buffet on Sunday after church.

Sounds like I need to do some cardio this weekend.If you didn't know there is a /r/yoga and it has a pretty good wiki and is active. there is more to cardio than HR. you have to take into account the oxidative capacity of type 1 fibers. SushiYep. I held on to about an extra 5 to 6 pounds of water weight for about 3 daysAll the competitive boxers at the gym I trained at this summer did neck exercises. I looked on in awe as the biggest dude strapped his head to a plate, looked at me and said "one day, my man, one day"Wut? But..... But..... GOMAD :(I have 2 scoops of whey PostWO and 2 scoops of casein PreBed each day.
Is there THAT much of a difference? I don't think so. But it does take longer to digest, meaning that you likely won't be as hungry when you wake up. Also, since protein does spike insulin, to an extent, casein will cause less of a spike compared to whey because it is slower digesting. This means that you might be able to benefit from keeping insulin levels lower (less fat gain).They care about butts though, which are generally trained with the legs.Taco Bell is a recipe for toilet disaster. I have that maybe once a year, if that...And I'm fully prepared for the consequences.Warm up, stretch. Work out, stretch. Start a strength program like Starting Strength, Stronglifts, or Ice Cream Fitness.  Do some cardio on your off days from lifting.personal trainers hate him for this one simple trick...Yes, that's why the fear of eating shitty food trumps the cravings for me. I get anxiety now when I know I have to eat out, and not fast food either, any restaurant, any food I don't prepare myself.  I do love to cook though and feel that my cooking is better than any restaurant I could go to that isn't a Michelin star rated joint.  Joe DeFranco broke it down a couple months ago, it'd be worth checking out:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyRiw2b8yI4Not that I'm wholly into it yet, but the human body is efficient to a fault. If it doesn't have to invest in strong bones it won't. Then you're left with a broken hip in your 60's.

Shhhh. You're making me homesick.Higher heart rate is a symptom of cardio, not a cause.

Kind of like wind blowing in your car window is a symptom of driving fast.  It will happen if you drive fast, but just because wind is coming in your window doesn't mean you are getting anywhere, it could just be windy.

Your heart rate can go up for multiple reasons, sometimes it's to supply extra oxygen for exercise and sometimes it's to force addition heat loss.  Sometimes it's other reasons and almost always some combination of reasons.

But just getting hot is not cardio, it's just getting hot.

It may burn slightly more calories as indeed your body is working harder to pump the blood and sweat etc to relieve you of heat, but the number of calories is minuscule and it doesn't carry many (if any) of the benefits traditionally associated with cardiovascular exercise.Chris Pratt with his shirt off.

This picture specifically http://images.kdramastars.com/data/images/full/65836/chris-pratt-jpg.jpgAs others have said. It's all about starting slow. This post is asking about what beginners do wrong. I think eating "healthy" and not really watching macro's wouldn't fall into that. Eating health is one small step, and then the macro's follow.

The same goes for exercising without a good program. Going to the gym for beginners is half the struggle. Getting there and just doing something is the start. And once they get more serious it builds into, I want to see gains, so they find a program.

I dunno, when I see someone drinking more than me I can usually catch up pretty quickly...sure, it doesn't end well. But compared to those other items listed, it's attainable! I played soccer once...You weigh everyday, so instead of worrying about what the scale says each morning, you get to see how your weight moves over time.  I might have gone up a pound since yesterday, but based on the last three weeks I'm still losing about a pound a week. Know what I mean?Do fitness for whatever reason you want to do fitness.  Some people need the validation that comes from posting their shit on social media.

If you aren't that self absorbed there's no reason to do it.Almond milk and coconut water are some additional options.I was allowed 1 cheat a week, but I rarely took it since I was already seeing enough progress.

If you feel like you need the cheat meal for sanity's sake, take it. Just know that you'll add weight faster (whether you think that's good or bad).

What happens? You gain weight.I like the cookies and creamI used to be the scrawny kid all through high school.
Then I deployed to Afghanistan. On my down time when I wasnt on mission, I would work out consistently, and I was eating around 8k calories a day. I would wake up at midnight and eat 8 hard boiled egg whites with a bowl of oatmeal and a peanut butter bagel. Came back from deployment 50 pounds heavier.

The attention I received got to my head. I started using some, ahem, supplements. Got an insane physique. I started stripping during weekends, just for the attention because my ego grew out of check.

After about a year of stripping, lifting just to maintain my physique, I hit a point where I hated what I became, and stopped using unsafe "supplements" and stripping.

Now I lift for stress release, and to feel awesome every day after a hard session at the gym. Completely comfortable in my own skin, when once I used to envy the other guys that were obviously using "supplements".Im glad I could help!That's awesome progress for such a small amount of time! Nice job!i ride my bike to work so tbh im already looking p muscularI did a little reading and yeah that was the basis of it. I'll probably just mix it with water for a little bit then try to go straight on it. Thanks for showing me these studies; I never would've known.Sugar gives me headaches if I've been eating low carb. (The theory is that carbs pull water out of your body when they're processed and stored.) My solution is to drink a ton of water with the candy-- works well for me. I was a unhealthy weight until high school when a kid my age and weight beat me by a shit ton in the school mile test. I asked him what was up with that and he said "oh I play soccer and run cross country to stay in shape for that". So this lead me to training for cc got my 3 mile time to 18:01 overy the next 3 the
Years dropping to 120 pounds zero muscle lol.
Joined the military as a fire fighter stayed relatively small had more endurance than strength allowed me to keep up with the stronger guys. Of course this didn't stop all my instructors from saying I wasn't going to make it due to my size. just gave me more motivation.
over the course of five year the weight slowly crept up. After my 6 year mark of being in I had gained some pounds, 120 to 205.
I got married then tasked to deploy this past year about 5 months ago from today. (got the wife pregnant before I left, it was planned). I told myself over this deployment I was going to get my shit together cause my princess needed a strong father and so did my wife. So now I'm back at 160 lbs and have never been this fit.

This forum has been a great tool in helping with my goal.Sometimes you just gotta try stuff. What works better for me may not for you.

That said, I did 5x7 for a while on OHP and that really helped. When 7 reps was getting brutal again I dropped back to 5x5 and kept going up on weight. Later, I made my 3rd day 4x8 of everything at 60% of my 5x5 weight. That again has helped me push higher on OHP. Last set AMRAP (as many reps as possible) is another strategy.

The general idea is that you have to start varying the load you're placing on yourself. You get to points where the same rep/set scheme isn't creating enough adaptation response, or if it is (at the next higher weight for example) it's then also too much to recover from and you fall backwards and get stuck in this deload-work back up cycle.Thank you my friend! I've never drank coffee or soda in my 20 years of existence so i'll have to pick some up and try it out.Some people are injured, especially older folks.

It is effortless to use and easy to create your own workouts. What should NOT be in my pre workout?Thanks for clearing up man, may the gains be in your favor :)Try going Thursdays, it's soup of the day.I went from around 285 lbs down to around 215 eating a very healthy, balanced diet with exercise.  I had a goal in mind and when I reached it, I decided to go out with some friends and splurge.  Burgers, fries, onion rings, shakes, you name it.  It was awesome.  For about 20 minutes and then I proceeded to puke pretty much everything out in their restroom.  I felt sick and groggy for a good 2 days.  I agree, if you want it, you can get itHe is wrong.

The first bit he is trying to explain is the citric acid cycle.

The second thing he is trying to explain is lipogenesis.

He is trying to make the point that glucagon "blocks" the pathway from acetyl CoA from the TCA cycle....which ok.

But the body prefers to burn glucose and glycogen before fat. I got to run and cant write more, but google lipogenesis and the TCA cycle for better explanationsAfter losing 140 pounds with lifestyle changes, yes.  I can no longer eat Indian food.Blue Diamond.

To do that it has to be due to muscular action.I literally just subscribed yesterday. Ive struggled with my body image for a long time. Im 25, 5'10" and weigh 184 pounds, so totally obese by any means. When I was 20 I weighed 160 and had a much better body fat to muscle ratio, was working out 5 days a week with my dad and had alot of fun. Then I started putting others before myself and got complacent. My lifestyle just spiralled out of control. Eating out almost every day, heavy drinking, new health problems, stamina slowly diminishing. My most recent ex girlfriend complained about my laziness or lack of enthusiasm for working out. I could tell that my growing insecurity and my body weight affected my relationship with her as well as previous relationships.

I did it because I wanted to take control of my life for once. Im ready to take this step and become something that alot of people thought Id never be. Control my finances, my attitude and most importantly my health. Ive never been more excited about something than I am about the future. Ill definitely be lurking around and hope to post some great results soon.Candy for dayz. I vaguely recall that study.  IIRC, the anabolic window for posting on social media was like 15-30 minutes, otherwise all gains from that workout were lost.

Skim also has twice as much lactose per calorie though. Milk confuses me.  One week I'm drinking whole, the next it's 1%. Now I've settled one whole milk, but I'm trying to gain weight. Or put Taco Bell in it. I meant that 30 grams protein from eggs is more or less the same as wheyI assume other people have more things going on in their own lives than worrying about my fitness habits.Nope. Unless I'm cuttingSo does the source of my macros matter? I'm on a bulk and I'm really trying to gain a lot of size and some strength. I'm running PHAT and eating about 3300 calories per day getting 180 g of protein (bw) and 100 g of fat and the rest carbs, but does it matter if I get carbs from like a brownie or from like potatoes or vegetables or what? And usually I get my protein from my food only and rarely use protein shakes, is this good? Bad? Neither? Any help would be great. I'm trying to avoid a "dirty bulk" but unsure of what that means. My dad. He always used to work out in the garage and I just followed suit. Start young = fitness for life.I noticed that I was always short of breath when I take the stairs at work. I haven't checked my weight in a while and noticed I was ~235lb. Before I started college, I was sub ~200. However, it wasn't till I watched some BroScienceLife that I started thinking that I should just start lifting.

Thanks Dom &amp; Gian.&gt;gotta get muh proteinI can honestly say ephedrine and caffeine are two of the most important factors in helping me cut.  It's night and day the difference when trying to cut with and without ephedrine.

Making ephedrine illegal OTC is a travesty.  It's a shame how taboo ephedrine is to most people these days when the research says it is 99.9% perfectly fine for healthy adults to take.  Another victim of the FDA and misinformation.My teeth feel extra gross after drinking pop now but that's it. I think that's not a good view of it. I love food and rewarding myself with something I enjoy isn't wrong as long as I do it once a week. My diet is pretty strict, and as much as I love chicken and salads, I also love tacos and want to enjoy eating out with my girlfriend on occasion.

There is nothing wrong with a cheat meal as long as you have the mental fortitude and dedication to get back on track after it. No.  Your heart rate changes for several different reasons, and heat is one of them.

Breathing rate might be a better simple indicator of whether you're doing cardio ("burning calories") or not, although it too is subject to several factors.

When you're doing "cardio", you're producing a steady stream of carbon-dioxide from the breakdown of various energy-containing molecules that your muscles use.  Your body has to get rid of the CO2 from your bloodstream (through your lungs) to avoid problems (blood acidity, etc), this drives up your breathing rate.  At the same time, exercising requires additional oxygen, which will also tends to increase breathing rate.

This happens in combination with an increase of heart rate to move the CO2 to the lungs, and the O2 from the lungs to where it's needed faster.

So, if your heart is working hard, but you're not breathing hard, you're probably not experiencing much of a "cardio" effect.[Anatomical Guide to Stretching](http://www.bandhayoga.com/MC1_inside.html)One of the largest reasons is that 6pu are likely double counting cals, example

bmr (doing NOTHING, you're body burns cals being alive

sometimes machines include the calories you would have burned just standing beside. so you'd double count.

Also elliptical are someone of the worst. for being, one study out of San Francisco in 2010 had them off target by up to 40 %

so I'd go with the heart rate monitor, but still don't eat the cals back if you really want results. Let yourself heal.  You can get your gains back when you're healthy.Jesus, such amazing progress!

2)Why not? If you respond to caffeine.

3) Caffeine, like any drug, can have adverse side effects. Don't use too much. Caffeine dependence is a real things; you can build up a tolerance and stopping can be a bitch.

4) Yep, in my experience (and *many* others that I know).

EDIT: added linkThis happen to me as well sucksGirls don't care about legs.Same here. I have up to 70lbs right now and do all my heavier lifting with a barbell. I'll probably expand to 90lbs eventually, but I think I can get by until the ends of this year with what I've got. I have zero regrets sleeving the money on them, they are great. Yeah, and that's basically what Alan Thrall is suggesting - he does static stretches and **then** does dynamic work. This is fine.

I will often vary 5-6 pounds over the course of the week working out every other day, and not until i take the weekend off or some other multi day break, see it really drop down below my previous weeks weight.  As long as your calorie count is dialed in, I wouldn't worry about it, if you aren't counting calories very accurately or at all, you may also be eating more than you realize now that you are back working out How bad for you is Subway?  I only eat the 'Heart Healthy' meals, but usually around 5-7 meals per week (about half on wheat bread, half in salads without bread).  Do I need to cut back?It's normal for me.
I used to have a terrible diet. Fast food and take out all the time. I cleaned it up and started eating only food I prepared myself. No boxed dinners or frozen foods. Bread and Pasta are the only things I eat that aren't a whole food. (whole wheat of course)

Now if I eat junky foods my gut hurts, and I have other weird symptoms. I'm very sensitive to bleached flour and eating too much sugar or too much fat (the bad kinds)
I do this with Chipolte.  2 spin classes, then a burrito bowl.  It's good fats and proteins and some carbs, right????I don't mind doubling down on my cardio efforts, what I am trying to get clarity on is what is the best way to do so without burning muscle for energy.My dad, after struggling with a food addiction for a very long time, went into rehab for it for 8 weeks. I started looking up a bit of weightlifting at the same time and I really got interested in it. I decided I was kind of fat myself and I hadn't ever really looked at it, so I got a membership and started gymming, looking at my food intake etc. Man, it is a lifechanger. Hey thanks I downloaded libra and it looks amazing. I wanted to ask if you could explain what trend mean in terms of weightloss?Not a waste, but likely not as effective.

I wouldn't say that it's a waste of time because it works by increasing metabolic function to metabolize/mobilize fat cells, but it's effects are enhanced with cardio since cardio is used to increase metabolic function.Can you setup Madows on any of these apps?Alternatively, some of us just really, really like food and understand that it's perfectly healthy and normal to allow ourselves to have something that makes us happy, particularly when it is also a social occasion. Unless you go completely bonkers and binge like 5000 calories, it's not going to undo all of your progress or kill you.Hot pockets changed my diet years ago. Once I realized headaches and malaise occurred every time I ate one. No processed foods and I'm curedSame here. I'm in my twenties and single, why not make my body look the best it can while I have the time. Also I'm not attractive so having a good body will hopefully help me out.Looks like the verrrrry base of your spine curves ever so slightly at the very bottom of your squat. Difficult to tell though. Grew up obsessed with things like WWF and Dragon Ball Z and loved action films with guys like Arnold Schwarzenegger. I've always had a desired body image heavily influenced by these shows/movies where the focus was on very fit and muscular guys.

Once I had enough money in my bank account to be able to afford the gym's monthly direct debit coming out I started lifting and haven't stopped since. &gt; So what is the most optimal way to utilize fat for energy during cardio? what is the most surefire way?

The most surefire way to utilize fat for energy doing cardio is... Do a lot of cardio. The actual intensity of the cardio has a pretty negligible effect unless you're an ELITE athlete already doing all the miles you possibly could.


Walk more miles and you will burn more fat. Run more miles and you will burn more fat. Workout longer or with more intensity and you will burn more fat. Do whatever it is that you ENJOY so that you can stick with it and you will burn fat. You're looking at the small details and technicalities when the BIGGEST factor is: Do more work.When I was around 19 I had stopped growing vertically, but I somehow gained about 3-4 inches shoulder width in a year, taking me from somewhat skinny to wider than anyone my own height I've ever met. Very wide shoulders without any upper body muscle look fucking weird.The visual in my head is hilariousthere are dozens of us.... dozens!Correlation does not equal causation. Food.Couple of thoughts:

1. You look great! Congrats.

2. As an amateur photographer, I can't help but feel that pic 1 was made worse by your attitude, posture, and how you framed yourself in the entire frame. Basically a perfect "before" picture.

I went to SD comic-con last year and the "pro" cosplayers knew how to pose. It wasn't just a superhero pose, it was a dynamic pose that shot well. The people who came just to dress up always gave me the pose from your first pic. Straight on with no energy.

Us photographers appreciate it when you already have a few poses in your repertoire ready to fire from the hip. Gotta have that Blue Steel at the ready.
had fluctuating weight all my life, but generally been on the heavy side of it. lived with my ex and my best friend, then she broke up with me and started fucking him. realized i always knew she was a shit person, but i had settled because i didnt think i could get anyone better. thats when i realized that i needed my body to reflect all the hard work i put into my life and how stable i really am so that i can attract the people i deserve and have choices, rather than deciding to settle for unfulfilling people and relationships just because my looks are dragging down my value. figured theres no reason i cant do it other than not trying, so i started trying. working great so far.

the moment that really hit me though, was after the breakup i was looking up a girl i was interested in and she posted something along the lines of "i dont understand how people can complain about being unattractive while they dont take care of themselves. healthy people are always attractive" (although i think it was phrased much better). that one really hit me.

even though girls were the trigger for it, it was really all about myself and thats why i was able to keep at it this time around. to me, getting in shape isnt about making myself better for women to approve of me, its about building my own image that reflects my good qualities rather than just my bad ones. i dont care if the girls want me after i get to where i want to be, i just want to get to the point where i feel like i deserve it.My weight gain was relatively slow and snuck up on me. I was starting to realize that the things I used to be abale to do weren't so easy for me.  Walk 18 holes while carrying my bag? I was huffing and puffing by the 5th hole.  Play pick-up basketball for a couple hours?  Yeah, you better take some breaks there chubs!  My clothes weren't fitting well and I realized I couldn't wear like half of my shirts, some of my favorites included.  I started just before Thanksgiving at 225 lbs. (5'7" 28M) and I'm just under 195 lbs. and still progressing.  I played golf the other weekend and did not tire out on the last few holes, I can play basketball for hours again and I've reagined some quickness.  Best of all though, is I'm fitting into my clothes much better and feel so good!When I was 13 or so my dad had 2 25 lb dumbells and I tried to curl one one night. I could barely do it once, so it became a fun challenge that I'd do every night when I was bored, and over time I got much better at it. Then I joined football and in the offseason we'd do weight training, which was when I clued into how lifting could make me more attractive to the ladies if I took it seriously. Dropped football after 2 years to focus on my own goals and it's been a part of me ever since. Definitely. I'm healthier and happier with how I look than I've ever been before. I'd still like to progress a bit more, both with increasing my fitness and aesthetically, but its a huge difference.

I think the most exciting thing for me is going from a sort of Typical Nerd (girl version) to my current mindset. I was never an athletic kid, not even when I was really young, and as I became a nerdy tween I got that typical mocking sarcastic attitude toward anyone who did actually exercise or spend time on their appearance.

As a kid, I could never run a mile. I could never climb a tree. I couldn't jump rope. I could swim and ride a bike and that was it for me. I would even complain about walking any significant distance.

Now I'm 28 and I'm learning for the first time that I CAN climb trees. I can walk that beam. I can jump that rope. I can fucking *own* those monkey bars that I would never go anywhere near at recess. I get to be excited about all these things that other kids did every day, and I'm just succeeding at them for the first time and realizing that I could have been doing it all along, if I'd just had the right attitude and motivation.**Q:** People who don't do *X*, why?

**A:** Because shut up, that's why.I like the cut of your jibtypical coonass couple, shitting on the same toilet at the same timeDisappointed in being a scrawny, skinny tall guy. I felt weak. I always admired heroes growing up (who doesn't) and wanted to look like one. Mission accomplished. I only talk about the gym to other lifters or people that ask about it. Most people don't care and know nothing about lifting anyway, so they aren't terribly interesting to talk to.Why must there be that guilt?! I just want to enjoy some delicious food and not feel terrible about it for once! Beside Whey (I do 1 1/2 scoop of ON) , what else is good for muscles to be built. Not trying to cheat the whole system but I do want to look lean by jul. Creatine? I have been pretty obese for the majority of my life, about 20kg (about 44 lbs). I've always thought about hitting the gym but I was afraid hitting it too early would just fuck up my personality and way of living. I had other priorities at that time.

Then I lost about 13 to 15 kg (28 - 33 lbs) by joining a sports club again. Don't get me wrong, I've always been a fan of sports and pretty active, I just used to eat the wrong stuff and too much of it.

A friend of mine started working out while on a year abroad in Finland and came back a little jacked in June last year. He never stopped talking about it.

I figured why not. Always been curious and had some now-or-never-way of thinking, so I signed up on my 23rd birthday last September.

Made me feel way better about myself.Drink lots of water and walk it off. That usually helps me out. Greasy foods bloat me up so I eat them sparingly. Only when they run out of industrial waste.I used to work in an office, and there weren't really shifts, but morning people and afternoon people. Some people preferred to come in at 7 and get out by 4, some would rather come in at 9 or 10 and stay until 6 or 7. The morning guys were hungry for lunch by 11, afternoon guys around 1. One guy would order a combo from wherever the 11 o'clock guys were going, and then another combo from the 1 o'clock group. Every day for a couple decades. &gt; When I find people who want to talk about it though, its awesome.
Do people get annoyed with you talking about your workouts?

No, because I don't bother them with that boring shit.

Also, ask him if he has any cure for these sick gainz you had lately too!So have someone spot you?

It didn't make much difference when the weights were light, but it's very noticeable now. After a couple days off, squats feel ~30 lbs lighter than they do on day five (third 5x5 day), even with a 5lb increase. OHP is more pronounced; I recently went from 95 5x5 easily (day one) to 100 (13/25 reps completed; day five) to 100 (18/25; day three, next week).

So, if lifting is your primary goal, go easy with the cardio as the weights get to feeling heavy. If cardio or an activity are your primary goal, just be prepared for your lifting to be a little uneven once it's feeling heavy. Do you ever feel nausea when having a movement?Fat burning zone is a myth printed onto cardio machines to make you think that's what you have to be doing. Holy shit.

Don't talk about it, be about it.shoulda had the nuggetsI am about same as you, you should probably be at around 2200-2500 unless you want to cut down then yea 1800 sounds about right. Maybe you had some setting for joule's and it showed you something like 4050 which translates to 1K Cal. See: http://www.theunitconverter.com/joule-to-calorie-conversion/4050-joule-to-calorie.html
I guess, yeah, that is was it was telling you!!Hunger isn't necessarily *good.* After 3 days, you probably won't be hungry, that ain't shit haha. You'll probably get hungry, you may not. All depends on the deficit and you're body.

I'm on week 2 of my cut and my calories are at 4,500, from 5,500. I'm down 4-5lbs and I'm definitely not hungry; I'm looking forward to dropping calories even farther. Well, some people don't like to consume anything they don't like. Why should I "not be a baby" when I can add 30-80 calories to transform it into something I LOVE. Seriously, whey with water and forcing it down but whey with almond milk/milk, I'm wishing I had more.

Which protein do you buy though? Maybe I feel that way only about ON's.Started my first cut ever a while ago, it's terrible and I feel your pain.
Although I have some tips. I'm 5'11", M, 22 and started at 190lbs. I'm eating around 2100cals/day and found that the easiest way is to make your breakfasts and lunches for the week, aiming to have 6-800 calories left for dinner.
Also buy a nalgene and drink like 8 of those a day.For most of my twenties I'd been hovering around 170 lbs (at 5'10"). At the end of the summer of 2013 I realized I was really more like 175 lbs, which is officially overweight according to the BMI. I figured that since I wasn't getting any younger it was time to start eating right, so I dieted my way down to 150 lbs.

Then a coworker of mine convinced me to start going to the gym regularly, and I thought "hey, why not try this Starting Strength routine I've heard so much about?"

Now I weigh 180 lbs.

No ragrats.Chic fil a followed by an 8 mile run later that evening to punish myself. For not saving those calories for something more important I would recommend it. Lots of people get fat on SL5x5. Also, you will recover better if you stay active on your days off. The increased blood flow will help break down lactic acid and decrease DOMS. This aids in the muscle rebuilding process.

I would also recommend adding some accessory work. On bench day add chin ups, tricep isolation and abs and on deadlift day add dips, bicep isolation and maybe abs. You'll see much better gains. Just be sure to give it your all on your big three lifts. The rest are to help you be better.

One other thing I notice a lot of people lacking is a 5-10 minute cardio warm up and cool down. This should help you get focues, keep your blood flowing and to stay warm. did it work?Plus you get the added benefit of butt confusion.I have the same problem, I started eating really healthy awhile ago and eating a lot of healthy food in one sitting to keep my calories high enough to build muscle (I don't have any time during the day to eat) but I find that now I can't eat nearly as much junk food without feeling sick. It doesn't make me feel guilty at all cause I find it difficult to gain weight through fat but I just can't eat as much shitty food. I think it's normal and you'll be fine.I was seriously thinking of joining the army and did the official exercises to past the physical fitness test.

I've always been like him, being addicted to video games, being ashamed of myself, making me isolate myself in my house. I didn't want to be like that anymore, and that video gave me motivation. I've been lifting for a year and a half, and I'm never going to stop.A combination of depression, boredom, and lack of self esteem. I want to look good for women and don't ever want to be fat. Let's be real. I will only be eating Reeses eggs on Sunday.Google valgus knees, it's the term for when they come in towards eachother. It can come from a few sources:

1. It's just the shape of the bones - could have been born that way or from an injury when you were growing.

2. Flat feet as mentioned before - this is likely your issue by the looks of things. Flat feet can be structural (shape of your bones) or adaptive (being pushed down due to other issues)

3. Tensions in your core can lead to an internal rotation of your hips, valgus knees, and flat feet.

If you have structurally flat feet, don't waste your time with trying to strengthen it. Your heel (calcaneous) has a ledge on it that holds up your ankle bone (talus). On some people this ledge never develops enough to hold the talus up and your ankle rolls inwards. Orthotics are the fix. But don't go to anyone who uses a scanner, find somebody who will take a cast/impression of your foot in a neutral/non weight bearing position. Cheap drug store inserts may be a good alternative if you don't have access to orthotics.

If it's not structural, go walking/running in the sand. Where I live we have no sand, so my patients spend time at playgrounds/track and feel sand pits at times to get their feet worked out.

The easiest way to know at home if it's structural vs adaptive is to have a friend look at your arches when you have them resting on the ground without weight on them (like sitting in a chair) and then stand and see how much they drop. Then switch with your friend who hopefully does not have flat feet, and compare if yours dropped notably more than theirs. This is not a fool proof method, but it's free!

Strengthening your tibialis anterior is helpful to holding up your arch, but I see a lot of people to give themselves tendonitis overworking this muscle, so don't over do it. Safest route is to practice pulling your arch up on a regular basis whenever you think of it, especially in workouts.

Go see a physiotherapist if you don't feel confident or if things get worse.Eating 8 eggs a day is bad?Eat fattier protein sources. 80:20 beef instead of 90:10 or 96:4, or chicken thighs/legs instead of breast/tenderloins.

That's what she said!I've always been in relatively good shape, having played soccer for up to three teams at once (high school, regular league and indoor) and refereed soccer during the same period.  After high school and college I stopped playing and stayed in fairly athletic shape, but didn't do much aside from occasional paintball.

Got married and my wife and I wanted to stay in shape and learn some self-defense, so we started krav maga lessons under a local instructor.  I always had leg strength, but my upper body was pretty wussy.  I'm a lot more balanced now.  I sit between 155-160lbs, 5'11".  My wife is in better shape now also, not that she was in bad shape before at all.  Heavy bag makes all the difference.

I had people "jokingly" talk about the 5, 10 or 15 pounds you gain after getting married.  I have to say, they were right about one thing.  My suit needs adjustment.  My waist is smaller by a bit and my shoulders wider.  People tell me all the time about how "that food you eat will catch up with you."  No it won't.  Food does not come back an haunt you in the form of lipidous tissue.  Your metabolism will slow with time and lack of exercise though, and if you keep eating the same it will cause problems.  I refuse to sit down and just let myself get out of shape.  Up to you. If you want to increase your average calories to push your weight up a little more, do it. If you're happy with how you're progressing, then it's not necessary, I don't believe.

There are still certain ones that i can't stand, but i pretty much did force myself to eat them for a while and now i love to eat a lot of them.Just my 2 cents:

Are you a total newbie or have you exercised before in a serious way?

If you're completely new to it - don't split. Splitting makes sense and is sometimes even necessary once you hit those high reps and/or high weights so your muscles have enough recovery time.

The thing a newbie can do easier than experts is rest. Don't throw away your increased rate of resting by splitting early. Not setting smaller achievable goals.

Not making things a habit.Thanks, man. I'll see if I can swing the trip.Yep same here.

At first I wanted to just look attractive to the other gender. But after a while it became something I did for me and only me. So I'm starting a cut and found out about EC stacks.

When I was losing fat and putting on muscle a while back, I would drink full fat milk, red meat (occasionally), lots if olive oil in salads/stir-frys, butter with my eggs, fatty fish, etc. However, my portion sizes were responsible. Plus, your body needs fat!!   And when you eat processed foods that are stripped of fat and "extra" calories, a lot of the vitamins and general nutrition get thrown out and are replaced with shitty fillers and chemicals.

Eat real food, eat fresh food, don't eat processed foods or "diet" foods, just have responsible portion sizes!!Cheat meal? I didn't work so hard to re-establish proper eating habits just to look forward to a binge once a week. Do alcoholics recover by being sober for six days and getting hammered every seventh?

If the only thing getting you through the week is looking forward to all the glorious food you're going to eat this weekend, food still controls your life.Theoretically, it doesn't matter. ***However***, our DNA/genes dictate, to an extent, how we each metabolize carbs and fats. Everyone is different. That's why there isn't a one-size fits all diet program.

Fiddle around with your marco ratios and find one that you like (food wise) and that produces the results you want. Trial and error.

EDIT: spelling error and comma placement.Stepped on the scale and saw 290, got really really mad at myself and vowed I would never hit 300, down to 230, goal is 190It's not that bad. No taste. Feel free to mix it in a glass though, whatever works best for you. Most people will suggest just to not take it with caffeine because I guess some studies have shown it lowers the efficacy. Haven't read too much about it though. I wouldn't recommend doing Push/Pull 4x a week for two reasons. First, your shoulder girdle gets worked a lot on both pushes and pulls. Doing so 4x a week may cause you to overuse them and get some pain.

Second, you always work your antagonist muscles whenever you lift. Meaning that if you do chin ups, your triceps will still act as stabilisers. Some people don't notice this and can still lift as much weight regardless, but others might get weaker.

I would simply keep all exercises, but do it Upper / Lower style. No muscle overlap whatsoever and same frequency. It would look like this.

Upper

* Bench/Standing Press 4x6
* DB Rows/Weighted Chin-ups 4x6
* Incline/Flat DB 3x8-10
* Lat pulldowns/Cable Rows 3x8-10

* 3 Isolation exercises of your choice, which you can rotate each upper day ( Dips, Close Grip, Tricep Pushdowns, Curls, Facepulls, Lateral Raises, Shrugs, etc)

Lower

* Heavy Squats/Deadlift 3x5 or lower volume for deads (this will depend on how big you want your legs to get)
* Some lighter Deadlift/Squat varation of your choice (I love paused reps)
* Ab exercise 3x15 (I like cable crunches and leg raises)
* Calf exercise 3x15-20
* Lower back 3x15 if you want to

Just so it's clear, you alternate between Bench/Row and Press/Chin-up in order to balance the pushes with the pull. Same for dumbbell presses and other types of pulls. So it's 4 main exercises + 3 isolations. I put the Presses and Rows at 4x6 because it's a good mix of strength and hypertrophy. You still want to linearly progress in them, and then go for more volume with dumbbells and so on.As Flat footed person I recommend going to see a podiatrist and getting some fitted insoles. Years of flat feet left me with muscle imbalances in my calves and some awkward mobility that took a good while to get over. Correct the problem and not just treating the symptoms helped me out tremendously.I was fat my whole life, and then at 24, I saw a picture of myself and was disgusted.  I'm not having man-titties, goddamn it.  Lost ~80lbs (276-189) through diet and exercise.  Is Couch to 5k really that bad for someone moderately overweight? I'm doing it now for the second time, the first time I finished it completely at a healthy BMI. It hurts a little more this time around but nothing unbearable, and it wasn't exactly a walk in the park when I weighed less.Thanks for the info! I think I'm going to give creatine a try and see how it helps me. Would you have any recommended brands or such to look for?Same here, can eat super clean for a month or two then take a super-cheat day or 2 with lots of trash fast food and candy/whatever and feel super-fine.I don't feel sick, but shit quality food like burger king and Cheetos don't like my stomach too much anymore.

It's more so that your digestive tract has optimized itself to your current diet, so when you eat something different your stomach has to adapt. It's like suddenly lifting after a prolonged absence and getting DOMS. Not a perfectly analogy, but yeahone night i thought "maybe i should start lifting" so i started the next dayI realize you're saying to work harder for fat loss, but how do you define working harder? To me that means higher intensity, but you explained this could potentially burn muscle as well?

So what is the most optimal way to utilize fat for energy during cardio? what is the most surefire way?


doesn't that fly in the face of everything we are told in terms of using a certain % of effort will put you in the 'fat burning zone'.


I avoid the rice, stack your plates with sashimi. I guess I should say AYCE sashimi. Leg Press, 1 rep for max, 1x per month.Real men like broccoli, just saying...No and no.Thought process looks on point!
Yeah, food scale is a **must** for this kind of process. Get one with at least a 5kg/11lb tolerance. That's because you may want to measure large batches at a time (like your recipe).

Ps. Why cut out the sodium? Unless you are predisposed to hypertension (high blood pressure), you're negatively affecting your athletic performance by cutting it out. It's essential for muscular contraction. Slightly overpronating. Focus on proper foot posture the same you would back posture and you should be able to squat with normal form.

As for the cracking not much you can do about that. As long as it's not painful it's OK.2 years ago my cousin got me into crossfit. Before that I would just occasionally work out once maybe twice a week for fun. I don't do cf anymore but that started my whole disciplined fitness regimenIt's normal. I eat soylent and now when I try food I used to eat regularly, it seems I'm putting garbage in my mouth. Ok thanks for the replies.  Good luck with your lifting, and go for the WPC Single Ply deadlift world record!An ex boyfriend that was perpetually stuck at the age eight diet-wise. Chicken nuggets and fries and enough diet coke to drown America. When we were together he would "surprise me" with dinner which was almost always McDonald's. At my heaviest (I was still with him) I weighed 230. I am 5'1" and that is a disgusting weight for someone my size.

Shortly after we broke up I realized that not only am I way better off without him, I needed to also undo the damage (physically and emotionally) our relationship had done to me.

Now, 60lbs down, I am a clean eating coach and I feel AMAZING.
My current boyfriend is a lifter and I'm a cardio freak. We're going to help each other meet somewhere in the middle. He's going to teach me how to lift right and I'm going to motivate him to run or swim with me!Was pretty chubby in high school and decided to change myself for the better near the end of senior year. Started with daily after school jogs then transitioned to weights when my college schedule became a bit more flexible.

The progress and fear of going chubby again was what kept me motivated to keep going. I'm also a dude who's upped my fashion game since then too so don't really wanna have to outgrow clothes cause of bad habits haYoga is a craft as well as an activity. There is no substitute for a good teacher. I'd highly recommend taking classes to start with yoga. Fundamentals are extremely important. Doesn't mean you can't get better through internet articles/routines/advice/videos, but (at least in my experience) you'll progress faster in an informed group setting.i suppose that depends on what you mean by "mess it up". As it stands, the only benefit we know of for IF is that it's an easy way to restrict calorie intake. The other benefits of it that are touted have yet to be demonstrated in humans, so having a shorter fasting window may not make a difference.

I hope that helps answer your question. What are your opinions on kre-alkalyn vs. creatine monohydrate?

I've been taking kre-alkalyn for a bit and have noticed minimal results (although not nothing). I know there's studies on this or that, but I'm just wondering about personal experiences with either one. 2 weeks ago I fell off my bike into pavement and messed up my left hand. Had to give up pushing exercises for 2 weeks. Excited to get back to gym finally after 2 weeks of mainly leg/core workouts to let hand heal, FALL OFF MY BIKE OTW TO THE GYM. Fucked up right hand with 3 sprained fingers. I havent fallen on my bike in over 3 years.. and now do it twice in 2 weeks making my hands consecutively useless. Damnit.I eat about 35-40 grams of fat on my current cut.
Got pissed off that I wasn't happy how I looked in a bikini. I knew I was thin, but still had (er, have) a layer of fat on my tummy area that made me uncomfortable and I was really irritated (5'6 129lb). 5 months later I am 122.5lb...made a lot of changes, and been at the gym 6x/wk doing a mismash of things. Progress is crawling, I am still not happy with my tummy lol but I won't give up until I am. Started SL5x5 recently maybe that'll do it...Similar experience for me as well, body just feels so full when I eat out too muchSometimes not really though. Have a look at anorexia recoveries at /r/Brogress

Being fit doesn't necessarily mean being not fat. Shittake mushrooms with an omletteSome people feel that, especially for notice lifters, you cannot find a good starting position if you are already out of position when you first grab the bar.  Notice how bad your back is arching already.

Some sporting federations have a ban on creatine and caffeine (yes, caffeine, like coffee/espresso). It's up to you.If you have a moral dilemma with taking supplemental creatine/BCAAs/protein, then don't take them. If not, take 'em.

I live close to the beach and each summer I usually don't go because I've always been self conscious. NOT THIS YEAR BABYlolI had been living abroad for the past few months and had no friends when I landed in my new city. Working out was fun and made me feel good.I'm a few months in and I'm still trying to get it down. I started running outdoors in winter, I don't have the money for fancy shoes, but I'm considering trying out shod or thinsole to see whether it worsens or helps my arch. I've a lowered arch, not flat yet.

I've yet to get pain though, aside from one time I misunderstood verbal instruction and landed mainly on to forefoot into flat. I couldn't help but run faster but my forefoot hurt for 4 days.Seder. Matzo ball soup, brisket, farfel kugel, gefilte fish, hazelnut chocolate torte.

All the matzo.

Upper and lower jaw.  I'm so worried about losing my gains during the recovery period.  They said most people lose a lot of weight.  Worried about the whole thing, honestly... but excited about the facial gains. :)I lost a great deal of weight from just reducing what I ate and 'doing more' for the first year of my weight loss... taking the stairs instead of the lift, not getting the bus into town etc. I enjoyed being active knowing it was good for me, and being outdoors gave me sufficient alone time to get my thoughts together (I have some problems processing emotion and I used to find comfort in self-destruction but gentle exercise seemed to soothe my mind more than flipping my shit and lashing out at people).

 Then one day I had an argument with my boss, and came home absolutely fucking raging. And I came in, dumped my bag, and didn't break anything or overeat or chain smoke like I normally did. I put on my running gear, turned the music up and ran as fast as I physically could for 30 minutes. It was January, and raining, and I was still fat, but I fucking loved that run.

Ever since that moment in January 2014 I have remedied sadness, anger, boredom and anxiety with running. I can run for miles and miles now and I can deal with life so much better. My body looks AWESOME, I get fresh air and sunlight and I get space to organise my thoughts, or sometimes to just run and not think at all. It's the best thing I ever did. And I will never look back. Dynamic stretching: "bounce stretching", sometimes referred to as ballistic stretching.  Should never be done outside the comfortable range or you can risk pulling muscles.

Static stretching: Stretching to a discomfortable position then holding it for a sustained period.I work out and immediately head to Chick-Fil-A, that justification thoWho knows? I went to take a leak yesterday and there was a slice of cake on my desk when I came back.

That said, I eat 2 cups of liquid egg whites (approx 26 egg whites).
8 whole eggs contains ~37g of fats, so if your diet allows that, then there isn't an issue.

Whey protein has a slightly higher bioavailability than egg protein, so *technically* you get more usable protein from whey, but I don't feel that the difference is **that** difference to make me choose one over the other solely for that reason.

As far as micronutients, they tend to have more than other fruits along with more fiber, keeping you feel more full for a longer period of time.

Clearly its some speculation, as we can't see his backThat isnt comparable to cardio because a hot bath is just like standing outside on a hot day. All it is doing is causing your veins to expand from the heat which increases heart rate and causing you to sweat which will make you lose only water weight. Losing water weight isnt healthy and wont stay off long; it will also cause you to become dehydrated if you do it for a long period of time.That's kind of how it was for me - after I had my son and was able to think about moving I realized that if I wanted to be able to play with him, run after him, keep up with him, and pick him up as he got older something needed to change.

That was 2 1/2 years ago - I've actually gained weight since starting to work out-  but my clothes fit better than when I weighed less.

Also - It's really empowering as a woman to be able to help move furniture, lift sacks of grain and flour (we bake our own bread and brew our own beer so we buy in 60lb bulk bags), carry my child for long periods of time, change my own tire (lift out spare &amp; put flat into trunk) etc without having to rely on a man to do it for me.This may be a bit heavy, but I was abused by a boyfriend in high school and ended up with a horrible body image. There was a point where I was down to 95lbs (5'3") and still thought I was fat. After I started lifting, it made me feel in control, more comfortable with my body (now sitting at a more muscular 117lbs) and made me feel like my body was capable of so much. I can still be a little mean to myself, but seeing all my body can do has helped me get rid of a lot of the negative thoughts.Check goodwill too! I saw a ton there. Powerblock owner here!

At least thats what I tell myself.Did it a little bit in college as I hated my fitness level. Fat growing up.
But college was a time for studies so it never picked up. First job out of college started going 3 days a week, making it up as I went.

Did a few days a week after that and kept up with that. Moved to a place with a better gym in the office. Kept it up, no real gains.

Really jumped into it about 1.5 years ago with the motivation of doing a fucking awesome costume and finally getting muscle definition (as the costume requires ze gains and abs)

After being rejected and generally not liking what I saw in the mirror. Still a work in progress but a lot better now than I was a few months ago. Actually going out with that same girl now and I want to be someone she can show off (but mostly I just want to show MYSELF off)Increase your deficit. Either exercise more, or eat less. Pick one. This is my first rant I work out in a college gym so about 40 guys in there at a time most are nice but this ass decided that the weight rack was a good place to put his water bottle and notepad right ok the spot marked 65 so after my set it came time to rerack my weight and his shit is right where my weight goes so I put his bottle on the floor and put the weight on his notepad and he calls me an ass for moving his bottle and crushing his notebook so I just look at his and say that racks for weights not your fucking shit  Yeah, Omar Isuf does a video with Greg Nuckols that talks about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1hDFoPfFM

BTW - what did you use to edit your video w/ the line tracking the bar movement?I've started some strength training but the cardio machines at my university have time limits, unfortunately. &gt; It's pretty logical, if you're going to expose yourself to higher cholesterol foods routinely, it's worth evaluating your cholesterol baseline to insure that it's not raised to dangerous levels by dietary changes.

No it is not logical, because, as someone already mentioned above, dietary cholesterol has very little effect on cholesterol that is actually floating around your bloodstream. That's where research stands quite firmly. Your claims to the opposite is simply voodoo science.

What  I am objecting is you playing doctors here. Just like little kids know that doctors wear certain things, so do you think that recommending certain tests makes you a doctor. It does not.I was in a friends wedding in November of 2013. I was FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT! Those freaking wedding pictures showed my double chin in every light and my pasty white cankles gleamed in the sun! It looked like I had eaten the rest of the wedding party.Look up "breathing pause squats," they're a real thing Thanks! These are more 'inspiring' videos than 'let's go workout' videos.

Getting fit is so easy, eat less fatty crap and move more.
Once you got that dialed in, then you will know your own body enough to start worrying about what most people worry about at the start of their journey. Most people make it too hard ( I think subconsciously, so they have an excuse for not doing it) and give up.Doctors, fitness apps, etc. It's pretty widely known you don't eat less than 1200 calories a day unless being monitored by a doctor. If I were overweight I would be more interested in doing that, but I'm just trying to tone up and lose a few pounds for the summer.Damn, that's quite a difference in just 4 months! Keep going dude!Yes, this happens to me all the time. I try to eat a little unhealthy stuff regularly as it enables you body to deal with the toxic shock of eating bad food (I can't remember the journal reference for this).

Basically the study had people eat super clean and then have a bad meal, and then others who eat some bad foot normally eat a bad meal as well. Those who had it more regularly had much less shock on the system from eating the garbage food.

The moral is (in basically every case) moderation. Extremism is never a good thing

EDIT: grammar
switch to front squatI feel guilty before I even eat it, while shopping at the grocery store.   Then later I feel stupid for not buying any junk food.

The struggle is real.Obviously motivation is individual. The point I was making is that until you *personally* decide to make the change, no amount of inspiration, coaching, or external motivation will make it happen.

In the case of athletes and skinny people, the concept is still exactly the same. Needing to perform better at their sport, or deciding they need to get bigger is still the same concept. It all boils down to making it a priority, not just something you'd like to do.

The definition of need is to *require (something) because it is essential or very important.* Your comment was pointless nitpicking, not to be an ass.

&gt;Wait a minute, the wii u is really the wii 2?

Oui. I don't breathe when I'm doing regular sets, only during pause squats with light weight, I heard it helps build the muscle that helps with the internal pressure. Forgot what it was called.Damn. That sounds hardcore LOL. Can you mix it with a glass, or is the 5g scoop really not that bad?I felt fatter and got told I got fatter.. (laziness + nothing to do for a half year)

Little brother convinced me to go to the gym with him. Went for a while and he learned me the basics.

Now I get to know new people (good for my social anxiety, made a few new friends already), I lost fat, I gained muscle (I weigh more than when I started but I'm slimmer), I love doing the exercises and it fixed my sleep schedule since I'm tired after the gym.

So many benefits :D only downside is that I can't raid as much anymore with my wow buddies :( but real-life is more important than my virtual life :)

So, I wanted to lose weight in a few months and then stop but the benefits kept me here. (and I want to look good for the summer) Hagrid walks in:
You're a mutant NarrowRoad
Hagrid walks outThis is my favorite. Its not specifically geared towards any single activity, but it puts things into perspective for me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_oI'm all about the mozzarella sticks if I have the calorie budget for it. Besides, protein !Haha you're pretty much already there, if not so. The squat will come easy now that you've got form in checkokay can i just say that little "Y" spike there between may and june gives me hope. I know it sounds a bit weird, but i have been working hard for about a month and i've stayed at the same weight and even spiked a couple pounds even though  i have been working out and eating right. i know that i just have to keep going - a little bit everyday. thanks for the inspiration and keep up the great work!Calories always seem to be a quick fix to every strength issues. But the problem is I feel the best around this bw. I really don't want to be any heavier. I just want to get stronger while being leaner at this bw. Congrats! The healthier you are the more you can recognize what is good or bad for your body. You've reached a new stage of bodily enlightenment!

I used to eat fast food 2 times a day, now it tastes like terrible chemicals and sodium and I feel like garbage after eating it. I am so much healthier than I used to be, and not for any reasons I have to nag myself for. Good food tastes good to me (plus I learned to love cooking) and bad food tastes bad so I avoid it.

People always talk about the guilt and necessity of eating well. But its a damn pleasure to eat well and that's what motivates me. I eat what I want and what I want is good.Honestly I don't know. It always was a part of my life. When I don't exercise I feel like shitI actually went back and corrected my spelling - it's actually got two F's.

And yeah, it's fantastic. Even better as a topping for thick fried catfish.Grills and feels mostlyWhen I was in 7th grade I was kind of fat because I had a surgery a couple of months before. I've always done a little sport but not enough.

One day I got so sick I could barely eat for 4 days. I most quite some weight, obviously. That was when I noticed how fat I was before and said to myself I would never be like that again.  I fucking love this. /r/fitness getting called on its shit in a nicely satirical way. Finally no serious comments from people doing 3x5 for three months giving advice to much more experienced people.

Thank you, /u/failon At my 2500 calories and current ideal 40/30/30 split, 30% of protein is 187 G of protein (exactly 1.1g/lb) and 30% of fat is 83G (.488g/lb). I should have phrased my original question, should I keep a 40/30/30 split for a bulk no matter how much that increases protien/fat intake or should I keep protein and fat intake constant based on 1.1g/lb and .5g/lb and do the rest through carbs Pretty simple really.

I used to weigh about 415lbs. Life was pretty shitty. I always felt shitty and I was going to die if I didn't change.

So I quit smoking, started using MFP and cut my calories gradually down to about 1700/day. After I lost 100lbs I started lifting. At this point I'm pretty addicted to lifting and self improvement in general. I'm down 190lbs total. I've never actually been passionate about anything in life until I got into fitness.

Now everything is better. I feel better, I obviously look better, I do better with women, I feel smarter, I do better at work. You name it, it's better.

[A comparisson pic](http://imgur.com/a/r5sV1)Definitely man. It probably stems from the societal view (assuming you're from the U.S) that skinny automatically means "healthy". It's hard to have an objective view of yourself and your body when the mind is always warping your perception of it and what is "normal". If you depend of a reduced space for your workouts, i'd recommend you to get a jumping rope. I used to do 10 sets of 1 minute of jumping, 1 minute rest. The thing is to really push yourself hard. My Garmin tracks my HR and, while jumping, it goes to 185 average, and while at rest, 160-ish.
If this proves too easy, move on to doing 1 min jumping, 30 secs rest. If this is too easy as well, you will have to go to a running field and put some weight and do sprints.If you're making the switch to working out at home, go check out /r/homegym you can ask advice, get comparisons and opinions on products and browse other homegym set ups.

As for adjustable dumbbells, I think [Powerblocks](http://www.powerblock.com/prod_homeuse_u90stage2.php) are the best.  They're cheaper than buying individual dumbbells, can be bought in stages so you aren't paying a ton up front,  they have a lifetime warranty,  switch between weights faster than anything else on the market and feel great in your hands with no wobbling at all. There are also people who prefer [Ironmaster dumbbells](http://www.ironmaster.com/home.php#.VR1nQBmDTqA) but the big downfall to them is that you have to undo both sides and then add plates individually when changing weight, a full set has over 60 separate pieces that will just turn into a messy pile of plates and take far longer to change weight between sets. Don't even consider the Bowflex select tech dumbbells they're long, awkward and not a good value.

&gt;won't take advice from a kid like me, either

I'm in the same situation, 22 and all coworkers are 30+ but when I tell them that it's sorta counterproductive to eat a salad covered with ham, cheese and 3 cups (full ramekins, not measuring cups) of ranch, I'm just plumb silly.  Cosplay.  I always wanted to look like a badass video game / anime character and they were all in shape.  Looked in the mirror and realized, "yeah, I look nothing like that".Eh, at least ass isn't asthma inducingwhile i see what youre saying, as someone who remembers their mindset pre lifestyle-change...this would have just been impossible for me.

when i was at my worst i was terrified of the gym, super self-conscious about my weight/appearance, clueless about diet, clueless about realistic progress expectations, and had (at the time, unknown) hangups about food (mostly using it as comfort for my insecurities).

i went through a number of failed cycles of:

1.  "im going to do this all this stuff correctly!  right now!"

2.  huge mental buildup to get into the gym

3.  fuck i feel like a failure.  and for what...i didnt lose any weight this week!

4.  if this isnt going to work, fuck it ill just be fat forever

5.  shame-spiral.

6.  quit

for me what worked was to take the first small step and reduce egregious foods/drinks from my diet.  i could do that in private...and it helped enough to get me mentally prepared to eventually head to the gym.

and sure i probably wasted some gains by not jumping headfirst into a proper routine.  but im pretty confident that even if i studied proper form and researched routines i would have mentally sabotaged myself and quit out of embarrassment.  instead i was the guy on the elliptical forever.  that slowly gave me the confidence to make another jump forward.

i think it really depends on the person.  sure i would have benefited if i could have somehow done it all from the beginning...but my slow journey has been better than no journey at all.Very healthy looking.  Mirin the back.  Good job, man!Good cardio should get your heartrate in excess of 130-150 bpm or even higher, depending on your age.

Don't assume there's a linear relationship between heartrate and calories burned; cardio also burns calories through the exertion of muscles and the exertion of your diaphragm to breath hard.

Think about it this way: Is it cardio to give a speech to a large audience? To have an exciting dream in the middle of the night? To be waiting to hear back from someone important? These things simply activate your body's stress response, raising heartrate slightly as well as a slew of other effects. I'm sure your BMR goes up as well, but it's not comparable to cardio.I was diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma. Was stuck in bed and at home for 6 months not able to do much of anything. I also had a fractured hip. I had no appetite, My weight dropped to 145 lbs (I'm 25M, 5'9).
After I got better I was determined to get in the best shape of my life. I was just sick of sitting around.Same. I eat pretty clean in a given week, but I can still down "bad" foods like nobody's business when an opportunity presents itself.I don't mind if they have cake on their own, but it's not something I want. I don't want fruit. I don't want "healthy alternatives" that are designed to be ranch delivery systems.

They could also avoid this by not trying to surprise everyone. I mean, it's my birthday - I know you're going to do *something*. I wouldn't mind if they didn't, but like I said, I'm convinced that this is more about feeding the beast that is let's-celebrate-everyone's-birthday-so-no-one-feels-left-out-and-we-get-cake than actually celebrating an individual's birth and subsequent accomplishments.

During the day, I eat &lt;400 calories, because I'm on a 1600 calorie per day diet. Having cake pretty much blows that, double so if I actually planned a cheat meal to celebrate with my friends and family after work.

Yes, it's only one day. No, it's not the biggest deal, but at its core I see this as a respect issue. If you truly want to celebrate *me*, then understand that I'm trying to do something that requires a lot of will power that I didn't exercise years ago, which is why I'm in the position I'm in. Trying to tempt me is just rude.All of these things are COMPLETELY irrelevant to you. For fat loss, the PRIMARY thing to care about is DISTANCE and CONSISTENCY. There is very little difference in calories burned running vs jogging for one mile (around 20 calories for a 155 lb male). If you want to lose weight, do whatever you can CONSISTENTLY do. Period.

That being said, it is complete crap that you are "wasting your time" if you can have a conversation running. For distance running, you are SUPPOSED to train at a pace where you can have a conversation.The end of a LTR got me into fitness.  I was a damn slob.  I'm better now.Damn. Definitely jelly. One day I'm gonna be on your level. My ex always made me feel like crap about my body so I can thank her for my gainsGym buddy made me try weightlifting. I fell in love. Then I fell in love with his best friend who also lifts and encourages me daily.I shamed and loathed myself for being fat long enough (like 5 years) to finally being unable to stand my own body. One day just went to the gym and paid for the yearly membership (best decision ever). Never looked back.After some already substantial weight loss 245-205 at 5'10'', I decided to be more scientific about cutting. Keto/Calorie cut/Lifting Heavy.

Now I'm about 175 and &lt;10% body fat, and what keeps me going is a nerdy lifestyle and good friends that don't shit on me too hard for swatting away the ho-hos and beer.

Stopped the booze and dove headfirst into another addiction.  Getting jacked and tan dawg.  I dont know about exercising in a hot room (sounds like recipe for unneeded dehydration) but I remember reading an article somewhere that said sitting in a sauna can burn calories at a similar rate to a brisk walk.

TL;DR: Definitely maybe.Uh... beware with the gum. If it's made with artificial sweeteners you're probably gonna get the runs and HARD.whats with the banana hammock? NSFW lolI felt sick often from good food when I started eating healthy. Then I broke a toe and stopped working out for 2 months. During that time I ate what I wanted and lost 10 lbs (of muscle). Haven't felt sick from good food since.

It's probably like a drug for some people who try to eat lean food. You have to ease your body into it, else you'll trip balls.Seems like a random diagnosis, what on earth makes you suggest that?Mine was similar to yours. I had started my new job in IT sitting for 8 hours a day and my back was hurting just from doing small things. I decided to start working out again to fix posture issues and lower back pain.This happened to me back in October. The worst part was that after everything went to shit, I felt like a failure to failing and really lost my motivation to start back up again. It took me a good part of the year to get my head straight. I'd say this is pretty normal. Same reason pets will get sick if you suddenly change their food. Any sudden shift in diet, even if its only one meal, can cause distress. Doesn't really matter when you're adding flavored protein powder to it. Just make sure you get unsweetened so it's 30 cal per serving. If you haven't heard of it before, give [Bulgur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgur) a try. Also quinoa and CouscousIn my opinion, the best way to season chicken is some cumin and hot spiced paprika.


But, there's not a damn thing wrong with hot sauce, except maybe the sodium.Don't know if it's the same, but I used to have a terrible diet. 2 litres of Coke a day, chocolate, crisps and regular takeaways.
I stopped it all cold turkey and suffered crippling headaches for about three to four days afterwards. Now I have a much better diet.
Thing is, on the rare occasion I eat something deep fried I feel there is a film of grease in my mouth and the back of my throat gets bunged up, making me wretch. Also, one glass of Coke is enough to give me headaches again. It's a good deterrent and it's effective. I literally recoil whenever someone offers me junk food. I always tell people my goal cosplay would be [The White Violin](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37441/789701-whiteviolin.jpg) from Umbrella Academy.

Nothing like having to be basically naked in public to prove you're happy with your body.http://www.exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/BenchStandards.html

Unless she's over 140 lbs she's lifting at least an intermediate level and even if she is but she's under 180 lbs she's still lifting at or above a solid novice benchmark. I mean, on the off chance she weighs around 100 lbs, which is not impossible if she's short, or younger than you think, shes lifting at an advanced level. Womens standards are very different from mens standards, but 100 lb bench is solid for most women. Because red meats are higher in cholesterol than white meats. It's pretty logical, if you're going to expose yourself to higher cholesterol foods routinely, it's worth evaluating your cholesterol baseline to insure that it's not raised to dangerous levels by dietary changes.

I'm really not sure why you're objecting to such routine care. Lipid screens are as common as checking your blood pressure for hypertension or checking your blood sugars for diabetes. I don't know how you got the idea that such information is dangerous or useless, but I suspect you did not ask a doctor or other health care provider before coming to your opinion. No, it won't ruin me, but to be perfectly honest I'm tired of having to defend my dietary choices. I don't try to force my choices on them, and I don't appreciate the reverse not being true.

Who knows, maybe I'll wake up that day and want cake. I just started a batch of cake batter a week ago. It tastes kinda like the vanilla, but a weaker taste. It might be good if used with milk, but currently using water on my cut.However long it lasts, a day to a few days

&gt; Anyone else have a similar story?

Yea, most humans, if they eat more salt usually retain extra water for a few daysYeah, I actually didn't even fully realize it till I looked back. While I was self conscious, I also tried to convince myself that "I was meant to be this weight". Glad I got away from that mentality. I don't know your answer sadly, but this is Interesting.. when I get home I'm trying this for sure.Just confirming :P

I said ok, started that day and have been going strong for over a year and a half. Longest break I've taken since that day is a week for vacationIt might be volume.  For me I realized when I ate "badly" I tended to eat in my old proportions, which were large.  My new smaller stomach didn't like being stuffed and so I became nauseated.

Switched from sl to ppl because I just mentally wasn't into it any more and the higher volume is more fun for some reason. Start each day with a heavy compound lift for low reps, still making good strength gains :)If you started out skinny then probably, unless you make a serious effort to grow your neck specifically.By the time I started, I was already pretty trained and lean. I would do a few full reps (2 pull ups, for example) then start doing negatives. Over the course of a month my pull up max went from 2 to 8, just doing them most days at home. I'm now at 13. I attribute most of my pull up progress to negatives. No because you wouldn't be keeping it straight yourself. Therefore not strengthening the stabilizers required to keep it straight. If I do this, I don't feel sick so much as I just have farts that could clear out rooms.

Great work on the progress btw. Ah, makes sense.

My gut flora has changed, and when I was obese and eating whatever, my body was just used to it.

Now I get edema, bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, headaches and general malaise if I eat even a little of something.

[I made a post about it here, OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/2zlh9h/losing_weight_and_eating_clean_now_eating/).Have you thought about getting massage on those shoulders? IT would certainly help with the stress carrying part.This one really spoke to me. Thanks for the extra motivation today!There's definitely a balance that needs to be achieved.
Some people definitely go into overdrive with the overthinking though.Dude WTF I was in the EXACT same boat as you! Started out extremely skinny, but didn't realize just how extremely underweight I was until I looked in the mirror whilst tripping on LSD and found out that the Auschwitz-chic look wasn't working. I have Pectus Carinatum too (mostly fixed it with a brace) and  I can tell you gaining weight REALLY helps cover the protrusion up. Great job mate, keep it up. PS, the ladies will love the confidence. Try not to get a blend next time, its hard to actually measure that you end up with the right amount of creatine as it may not be perfectly mixed!I've done that shit. WorksUnsweetened, Original, Almond Milk!!! 30 calories per 8 oz. NEVER will i mix whey with water. 30-40 calories to make my whey taste like heaven instead of hell. &gt;  I actually dont have a calorie swing in my diet

It's a calorie swing in your macros, not your total calories consumed. That's why you're struggling with knowing whether you need to increase your macros or not, because there's too big a range there. If you keep it very steady at the upper ranges, that's a natural daily calorie increase.Deliciously Strawberry is great!  Strawberry banana also.Get Natures Best low carb dutch choc isopure.  I mix it with water and it tastes perfect (not too sweet).  It's the only powder I've found that mixes perfectly with water that I can take for a long time without getting sick of it (most others I end up getting tired of either the flavor or sickly sweetness).Anybody know anything about CanadianProtein.com?Yea, we're all on that journey of fitness at different points and while you want to.share your experiences and try to help, a lot of the time it's best just to.let them experience it themselves Is there any difference from mixing up a protein drink and consuming it right then vs. mixing it up and drinking it later, say several hours?

I would have just almond milk and protein powder and if I were to drink it later would make sure it's kept cold. But didn't know if there was a difference in effectiveness of the powder from when it was consumed.Hey, thanks for the tips! What I conclude from the thread so far is that I should switch it up when it comes to reps/sets. Thanks as well for defending me, I think people don't realize how freakishly small I am (with 70kg body weight I'm near overweight according to bmi if I recall correctly). I'll be switching it up and I'll hit that 100 in no time!Haha, that's cool.  Hopefully, it will work that way for us as well.  Although like you, we sometimes think we might not want any.Thank you - this is the help I needed to find here. I will work on legs today, Chest should be OK tomorrow or the next day or I can do a cardio day. I wear over the hear headphones because ear bud just dont work for me and hurt my ears after a short period of time. I dont do it to be cool, I do it because I'm tired of spending more time dicking with my headphones than lifting. Plus I bought $30 dollar ones compared to $300 dollar beats, sound the same.I hope to god you wear it. You wear that shirt!!!Just keep your averages sane, and you won't turn into a balloon. Don't worry.Got divorced. Decided it was time to get in shape and make something of myself. It felt like there was a lot going on in my life that I wasn't in control of so I figured the one thing I am in control of is my body, better make the most of it. Down 25 lbs the last 3 months and I'm training for a half marathon next month!I honestly had no idea, I thought it was one of those things that was over kill The Belgian Chocolate is my downfall.Either. Every time i try one i gag.Highschool football taught me everything about motivation and discipline, in addition to all that stuff about teamwork. Athletics, to this day, has a huge impact on my health and fitness.I notice the kinesiology flair there so I boggles my.mind that they think you're the unsupportive asshole, you're just trying to be practical mad offer an informed, and safe, opinion on the situation. It's probably just their ego getting butt hurt. &gt; That's a fairly large calorie swing you're rocking

I was responding to that part, trying to explain I actually dont have a calorie swing in my diet, but I do have a range in my macros. Your advice to stick to the upper ranges for protein and fat was good and I did note thatOh god yes, it drives me up a friggin wall. This guy says he's gone vegetarian, all he does is eat those frozen veggie burger patties at work and smother shit in ranch. He also loves to tell me how "striated" his butt cheeks were when he was my age (he's gotta be around 350 at this point). So my annoyance with him actaully goes a little beyond his hiding of bad health habits. Dude won't take advice from a kid like me, either. Stress causes the release of a hormone called cortisol that..... But seriously no. Get back on track. Weigh once a week, and see where your at in a few weeks. If nothing changes in that period of time reasses.

I can tell you now that I definitely fluxuate probably an easy 6lbs throughout the day! Heavy squats and deads hit your abs hard. At a beginner strength level, heavy squats and deads should be your main ab work. Either way, looks like you've made insane progress. You must be pretty happy with yourself! :)Dreamer bulks.

Wanting to get strong fast, and just eating all the things. Then never cut and just be built-fat. Or fat and not even that strong. Fine if that's what you wanted, but most people wanted a beach body.I would post a screen shot of the macros in the app but I don't know how to post that.I think the better is loss weightFor me it's the guilt and sometimes I do feel sick after but you shouldn't get depressed or freak out over 1 meal. Just eat clean the next few meals and you'll feel a lot better. It's good to have a cheat day/meal. Just don't make it a habit of more than 1 is what I say.Usually, the only powder I get is ON's, but the about a month ago I came up on a free container of syntha-6 protein. The macros aren't nearly as good but the one thing I loved about it was I could blend it with milk and ice and it would have an almost milk shake like quality. With ON's, if I blend with ice/milk, it doesn't really "come together" or get a smooth texture. Do you know what the difference is? The syntha-6 had 15g of carbs in it. What is something else I could add to the ON's to get it a similar texture besides a Banana.I will binge on Taco Del Mar about twice a month, and I'll have a mad stomach ache the next day. But damn if I ever stop binging on my mondo fish burrito!

To answer your question: yes for me. When I eat bad, I physically (and sometimes mentally) feel bad.You don't like the black or the green I take it?  There are alternative lightweight flavor enhancers but some of them may be too much of a contrast (I just like black olives because they seem to enhance a good variety of high protein bases like poultry).When you take a deep breathe and push the diaphragm down, it's the same feeling as pushing out your gut and flexing your abs.

Not straight up. From the starting position, I generally pick a point about 10-15 feet in front of me. It looks like you're looking about 3-5 feet ahead in the video. If looking far ahead is uncomfortable though, try looking ahead to the horizon, which will pull your chest up. Then, without moving your chest, tilt your head back down. yeah but well
people who lift tend to look it, which is somewhat indicative of the effectiveness

I'm using my fitness pal. My daily protein count could be off I probably eat more than 180 gramsOh of course, I couldn't just gain 20% of my weight without getting bigger. At the time, a lot of it actually came to my arms (I believe I had 9 inch bis, went to 11.5-12). Machines don't do nothing, they are just extreme isolation. I was at the gym for 2 or so hours a day, because I still had more energy to pound out more reps. I didn't have a set routine, I would just go on machines for the targeted area (back, for example), until I got tired. Not too efficient, but at 102, anything will work haha. Thanks!!Me too :(

Injury after injury from doing too much too fast and not letting myself healI saw a cosplay of Dr. Manhattan a few years ago. I think that was a huge part of what drove me to start exercising. So bad ass. Twice a day instead of only once.I mostly eat light throughout the week, small portions, fruits, veggies, water, that whole thing.  When I eat like shit though, it just sits in my stomach all heavy and whatnot, like I ate 5 pounds of rocks.  So I just feel like crap, and don't eat the rest of the day, or not until extremely later.

Before I started my diet I was the same though, ate crap all day, every day.  Fast food, soda, sugary snacks, etc.  It really puts things in perspective. &gt; it's my guilty pleasure though, so I'm never cutting it out of my diet entirely.

one of us, one of us.Thanks!I ended up doing the same thing.  I ended up selling them when I moved.  I might end up doing that again.HA! Yeah, my actual camera's screen got shattered and it hasn't been in my budget to replace it, so I've been stuck with my shitty ipod camera since last summer.Running after eating some carbs after being carbless for a few weeks really makes you feel like you have super powers.  It's so easy and enjoyable.Hmmmm, good to know. Seems like I'm losing much slower than normal then.I was driving the forklift around at work one day and felt my belly jiggle every time i hit a bump. 7 months into lifting and 50 lbs down its not as jiggly. You shouldn't let your form get bad enough to consider a rep a failure. Some shakiness and some struggle is fine, but if your form deteriorates so badly between your first and fifth set something's weird. Maybe take more rest time?Oh, that makes sense. I haven't really been paying attention, just had heard there were some type(s) of membership(s) that didn't have free classes.I can't agree more. I always hate it when the topic comes up and someone interjects with a "nah brah, this is what you need to be doing [insert latest fad here]" there's a degree of people who share with the purpose of aiding while I feel the majority it's just people trying to.measure their dicks. What works for one may not necessarily work for anotherPeople who tell you it doesn't matter in which form you eat the calories are not completely right.

If you hit your daily protein goal already (what ever you think is the best one for you, let it be 1-3g per kg), don't eat more. Proteins include nitrogen,  no other food type does include nitrogen. Nitrogen is not good for your body and your kidneys will have too much work. Guess the consequences.  Being laid off from construction/lumber yard work, felt lazy and wanted to do something about it. Obviously it doesn't give you the full workout of going to a gym, but looking in the mirror I wanted more so I decided to hit the gym. I like the SL5x5 app setup and timer so I bought the expansion. It allows customization so I use it for ICF. ( o  o)( o  o)6 foot 4 inch tallI am not a vegetarian, but I AM trying to reduce my meat intake.

Eggs WERE going to be your best friend, but without it you may need supplements.  Just adding a whey shake or two will help immensely meet your protein macro.

Also, [Textured vegetable protein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textured_vegetable_protein) is a great way to add protein to meals.  I make a "bolognese" with mine and put it on black bean pasta (or pasta...or anything, I love bolognese).  I haven't explored [seitan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_gluten_%28food%29) yet, but vital wheat gluten is pretty easy to find online and in stores and you can make seitan yourself.

Beans will of course help, split peas and lentils are cheap, effective ways to boost your protein count but also come with a lot of carbs (and most importantly, fiber, too much fiber can ruin your day).

Nuts and nut butters will help you meet your fat requirements while also giving you some protein as well.  Peanut butter is cheap enough.

Real vegetarian/vegan lifters will help more than me, but really you're going to have to cook a lot of your meals and probably start incorporating more soy into your diet or eat a lot of greek yogurt if eggs are not on the menu.  That's the beauty of using powder, you get to decide how much to have so you can tailor it to your tolerance. Just obviously make sure to measure it properly, having gs instead of mgs will definitely do you some harm!

Aside from that you can just have a little coffee before you go, much lower in caffeine and less chance of overdosing.Yeah I make my coffee the night before and put it in the fridge for in the morning, I think it's easier to drink while on my way to the gym for my morning workout so just adding the whey later would be easy. Thanks!!You dont really need to bring your hips lower but you should try and use the weight on the bar to pull your back straight. Pull the slack out of the bar before starting and use that tension to get your lower back flat.what the hell? some sick joke from the IT department? that's where I work. 3/10 employees (counting me) are healthy. 3/10 are obese. the other 4 are on a slippery slope.Looking at myself in the mirror caused me shame.  I didn't like that, since I should like myself.  So I got into shape.

Now I'm pretty vain, it's like I can't have a normal glance at a mirror.Sweet potato and broccoli cake with a side of EGG SAUCE!!!Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

One class period (70ish minutes) every other day.I love when they ask Dmitry if he'll ever send his daughter to the pool and he immediately goes "no...no!"Yes. In my case, it's about eating enough (3,500-4,000 kcal/day) without feeling full and disgusting all of the time. Upping my fat intake makes it more tolerable. Thanks! You will get used to it. Its so awesome. You have so much more time, because you dont have to eat.Any size difference in the 3 months?Working on it! you're probably sitting between 20-25%

As for bulking. There is no formula. You bulk when you're sick and tired of cutting. Personally if i was in your shoes i'd cut for a while longer till you were about 15%. But there is no magical formula for when to bulk/cut (unless you're cutting for a competition or something and then timing is everything) but in your case, keep cutting till you can't take it then decide to switch.In my experience there aren't any good adjustable dumbbells. I went down that road also. In the end I ended up buying a bunch of individual dumbbells at different weights. I'm actually really glad that I did. It was worth the extra money in the long run and now I have a very nice set up with a rack. I just bought heavier ones as I needed them so I didn't have a huge cost right up front.This is the answer i was looking for.What exactly do you mean by this? Literally tuck my balls between my legs? :Pmhm. one girl bought a box of the caramel delight girl scout cookies because "her brother" really likes them. if you're to the point of lying about your food consumption, how can you not see that it's time for a change?Not abs? I'm currently 120 lbs, started at 110. Haven't really bothered to work my abs, it feels a bit negligent.Most definitely! 102-120 felt like it happened over night (2, maybe 3 months?). Felt like I was stuck at 120-122 for about 2 months, but about a month after that I was 124-125.  Over the rest of the time, I would slowly increase (and sometimes even lose) weight. I've only been 130ish for about a month with little in my digestive system. It's slow, and it's unnoticeable, but you have to keep doing it. I'm sure you're gonna hit 100 before you know it! Depends on your definition on throw.Gotcha, nice progress manOMG i think you are me, I have the exact same problems!!

A coping mechanism after a breakup. Then it became about aesthetics and being physically strong.Now go for 30 more.Sorry, the other guy. Actually, not sorry, you're still wrong.[Hot sauce has no carbs or calories, and, uh, you know, sodium doesn't count as long as you don't read how much it has.](https://youtu.be/Px7Uc2GrnhE?t=2m53s)

It's not rocket scienceI don't agree. Most people can't handle that all at once. "I am going to cut out cigarettes, soda, alcohol, eat 100% clean, and work out 3 days a week." just doesn't work from square 1. I had to look up etoufee but wow, that looks fucking deliciousrhythm and agility.For protein I eat lentils, pea-based protein powder, soy milk, lots of nuts and seeds, plus whatever I get through grains and veggies. But why? Shouldn't putting weight on your spine cause it to increase in strength? Obviously not all at once, but gradually with incremental progression?This sounds good, I'll have a try for sure!I have a question about creatine. I did some reading yesterday and saw few articles saying you can take if in post-workout meal and that its more efficient that way (compared to taking it before workout) - whats point of it in post-workout meal? Also can i mix it with whey and dextrose right after workout... And which one would you recommend to somebody who never tried it out?First of all, congrats on getting through all those surgeries in one piece. That's a helluva process getting over having your core opened up. Keep your head up friend, your progress should be determined by your health, not others.

That's why I love lifting/fitness/bodybuilding. Yeah it's nice to compete and be motivated by other individuals. But in this world full of genetic freaks, and aesthetic gods, there is no bigger nemesis to compete with than myself. I play a lot of sports and get a lot of small nagging injuries. (currently have a stress fracture in foot, and sprained wrist) that are both keeping me from achieving my best. However I know if I don't stretch them or just give up altogether it will be even more detrimental to long term goals.You're totally allowed your cookies, but have you ever seen [this?](http://duke.spoonuniversity.com/2015/02/06/5-girl-scout-cookies-made-with-quest-bars/)That sounds ermm, dangerous?I understand how to take a breath and brace the core, but how do I push my diaphragm down? So should I be looking straight/up?When I was a kid, I liked to play tag and soccer. As an adult, I still like to play tag and soccer. That's pretty much it.Oh I know it might be a little harder to tell in a bad quality photo, but my mid section is definitely tighter than it used to be fat wise. And my arms are a lot more vascular now, while they're more or less the same size. As a note, I didn't purposefully try to "get cut", it just sort of happened as the amount I ate didn't cause me to gain anymore. Now, I need to eat even more. walking on a treadmill at 30 degree incline for 5 minutes vastly improved my squat form when my ankles were holding me backThanks for posting this, glad it wasn't just me.  I was fat and lazy for 20 years because I just never stopped to think that I could or should be any other way.  But when I snapped I went all in and hard with nutrition, running, and lifting.  That was 18 months ago and I'm still going.Just to play devils advocate here, not everyone sticks to lifting because they *need* it. Athletes and skinny people who want to get bigger come to mind. I get what you're saying here, but motivation is highly individual so I don't think you can simplify it like that.Oh no, you've contracted selfie-bluritis! (Great work, btw!)&gt; i see lots of people doing the stationary bike/spinning and even road and mountain biking, and very few of them seem to be at low BMI

Keep in mind that weight/fat loss is much more dependent on diet than on exercise. If the bikers are fat, it's more a commentary on them eating too much then on the efficacy/quality of the exercise.Being unfit.I go through the same with cigarette smoke.  I smoked for a few years  and quit about twenty years ago.  Since then, I can't stand the slightest smell of it.  I get nauseated just being around someone who has recently smoked.  So I guess the same holds true for any crap that you used to put into your body and then quit.  Your system is telling you, "No way, not again, that shit made me sick before."That's... That's a surprisingly good cueOne thing I noticed, your stated goal is hypertrophy, but you have very little volume on the lower body. If I had to suggest a simple change, I'd add leg press or leg extensions on push days, leg curls on pull days.IF you have everything dialed in perfectly you're looking at best around 0.5 lbs of muscle a week.Search Dana Linn Bailey... Thank me later![there is even a hypothesis forming, with evidence, that your gut bacteria can influence your food cravings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554020/)

[this study done by nestle, found differing gut bacteria between "chocolate cravers" and those indifferent to chocolate](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr070431h)I believe a correlation has been shown in research between the two. BUT that doesn't mean it's the only cause of decrease in libido. It could be any number of things. Testosterone level is probably the easiest to quantify with a simple blood test. If it were stress level that's much harder to judge.

Edit: it seems from your responses that you don't want it to be low T. Maybe it isn't, go get a test and rule it out first. Can do Bro. What about you though? Where you at? well you need to put in the right numbers, I quickly did it and it was around 2400 calories  on the site you mentioned.
Oh no, I was lifting at the time, sorry for the misunderstanding. That was the time I went from 102-120, in a pic somewhere else along this comment line.

What do you mean by this?

And what do you mean by 'sit back'?can confirm this very much. I've been religiously going to the gym for a few years now and I ate like 10 pieces of candy in a row and had a severe headache.Everyone saw the super general and no-shit "reason" (bad setup), and skipped saying it.  They instead told him exactly what needs to change.  You just shat on 21 other responses, then say the exact same thing in a slightly different way.  Maybe if one was stupid, they would lower their hips in a straight line, pushing their shins over the bar and preventing themselves from actually being able to pull the bar up, but i guess most of the other responses respected OP a little more.I've thought about the food thing.  I get really excited to eat lunch too and I don't sound like that.  The saddest part about my job is the web filter that specifically filters our "healthy living" and "sports."

I also do primarily compound movements when talking about bis and tris (pull/chin ups, bench/incline bench), though at the end I'll throw in some leisurely curls. While on ice cream fitness last semester, I definitely made some gainz, but I also wasn't enjoying the gym as much as I do now. I do SL on MWF and do some light workouts on T/TH.  I have a list of accessory exercises I rotate through.  I pick 3-5 exercises and do about 3 sets/10 reps (sometimes less).  The weight is typically challenging but I don't feel like I'm close to failure on every set.  I also walk on the treadmill for 20-30 min.

Does it hinder my 5x5 strength? Dunno, maybe. Right now my goal is weight loss and I'm on a cut so I'm not really concerned about increasing my lifts.  Saturday and Sunday are my rest days, and I tend to eat a little more to help with recovery.

You might want to think about what your main goal is.  More strength, ASAP?  Stick with the program and take your rest days so you can move to heavier weights sooner.  Mixture of strength and endurance?  Then do some additional workouts, but be aware your lifts may not increase as fast.Why wouldn't it? I actually just got Wii Fit last week and in some situations it could be useful. If it encourages someone to get off the settee and do something active then it's useful. However it's not a great solution. In terms of burning calories, even walking is more effective than most of the exercises, if you can motivate yourself to go for a walk you'd be better off doing thatGod may not have made me pretty, but I can make myself scary.

Was always weak and small growing up thanks to a lot of health issues.  Spent a lot of time in the hospital and always felt like shit.  Doctors always said I would be very limited in physical activities.

Then a few years ago I was sitting in the hospital (1.5 month stay) and said fuck this.  Ordered a power rack, bench and olympic weight set.  Got out of the hospital and started lifting.

That's OK, I still look great. Then baby #2 came and, again, I had to feed my wife highly caloric food and sat around and, plus, was in grad school at this time. By the time my second baby was eight or nine months old, I was up about 25 lbs from before the first kid. Plus I was thirty. I thought "whoa" that's enough. So I worked on losing fat, then getting swole. It was never a big problem. I was never actually fat but I was out of shape enough and that was enough of a problem to me. Flight Milk?  Ok thanks, I was just wondering if I might be missing something chemical or physiological that could account for it.there are some ways to get shorter, i have heard of people doing these and getting about 2 or 3 inches shorter.
do squats everyday. at least 15.
crouch down. try doing it for about 15 to 20 minutes a day.
wearing a heavy backpack. if you put heavy books in a back pack and walk around with it for try 20 minutes at first but once your back gets use to it go up to 30 and bend your knees. p.s also remember to stand up straight or you will get a hunch back.
sleep with your legs curled up. if you can't keep them curled then put a pillow under them.
stay away for red meat, dairy, and fast food.
i have heard people losing 4 inchs of their height doing this. be safe though.&gt; My wife and I started thinking about children, and I don't want my children to remember me as unhealthy or be influenced by my unhealthiness.

That's awesome!  I'm still grateful to my parents.  I never saw either of them smoke, and it wasn't until I was an adult that I saw pictures of them smoking in the 1960s and 1970s.  They quit right before they had my older sister, and I grew up thinking smoking was the most bizarre and unthinkable thing.  It was a very helpful bias to have.  I resolved to do the same thing with eating and weight for my kids, and it was a powerful motivator for me.

(Only until I decided I didn't want kids, but hey, it helped for a while.)
I mean, the machines made me hungry enough to eat my way to 118 if that helps. I used the lightest tick on every dual handed machine, and I was still generally able to rep it out. If I ever felt any pain (which I did at the lateral raises machine and the rows), I would just skip those altogether till I got stronger. That's probably true. I recall reading somewhere that if you pull the bar from an elevated position, it's not really a deadlift anymore. Now it's a rack pull. Then again, with my long ass legs it might not be a terrible idea to start with the bar raised a little. God the smoking. Why did I ever smoke.you'd better start if you're gonna have that weightlifting falirIIFYM tho...yes, very consistent on my diet and exercise except some drinking/snacking on the weekends, which is usually compensated for the next day

one thing that wasn't consistent was my sleep. My sleep hasn't been consistent my whole life, so I don't really look for patterns in it anymore. There might be a strong correlation and I've just ignored it.
This week, I'm doing roasted chicken (olive oil, salt+pepper), roasted brussels sprouts (olive oil, salt+pepper), and quinoa.  Tastes delicious.  Chicken+quinoa are in one container, sprouts are in another.I got tired of looking in the mirror and feeling unattractive. Only the joke's on me, because now I'm fit and athletic, but as Dom has said, "the day you start lifting is the day you become forever small." Did you ever hit a plateau in your first year of bulking where you wouldn't gain any weight?  I'm new to lifting (began 9 months ago) and started off very skinny (f/25/5'3/84lbs).  I'm currently at 96lbs, and it's been hard to reach "the big" 100lbs. I've been small my whole life and have never seen 100's, so for me it's a milestone for me.  Congratulations, keep it up!I initially wanted to get stronger, faster and more powerful for my sport (rugby). Injury forced me to retire last season but I've kept up with my lifting and cardioThat's from 2013! What's happened since?I wasn't telling you to eat cheese.I have WAY too many overweight coworkers. And my concern is that non of them care. We just all jokingly call it the "(insert company name) physique". Where they're joking about it one way, and I and only one other person in a department of forty or so joke about it in a different way. Yes, we are the only two that actually seem to take fitness in our own hands. I got guys in here though claiming they want to be healthy, then they put themselves on a starvation diet, why is that so damn popular? Lastly, that one dude that takes extra donuts " to bring home for my son", you're not fooling anyone dude. Just eat it. /rantMy new years resolution of 2014 was to not eat out for a whole month. I couldn't start in January so I started in February and made nearly the whole month (beside McDonald's once on a trip).

That jump-started my interest in health. I overhauled my diet and made lifestyle changes. I read a lot on the subject, got some tips from my healthy co-workers and started biking to work in the summer and running in the winter. Started at 235 lbs (5' 10" male) and now I'm at 185 lbs! My goal is 165-175.

TLDR: Resolutions and short-term goals can sometimes jumpstart an interest and propel you to success!Why did you bother asking for advice if you were just going to ignore it?

Eat however you want. If you're happy with a large macro range, have at it. But if you want advice on how to split your macros during a bulk, my advice is to cut your ranges down and go for the upper ranges on what you have. That's a fairly large calorie swing you're rocking.Thank you! It seems like a lot to put back to back, Id expect one to suffer a little, not a lot. Id spread them out, or do the more important one first.Thanks, I try to smile a lot more now :) Similar story and stats for me. At 212, I decided to lift seriously. I've been running SL/ICF 5x5 for two full months now, and wow.. great progress, but no movement on weight. I weigh as much as I did two months ago, but I went from untrained to intermediate lifts with noticeable hypertrophy and a hint of vascularity. That means one thing: I've lost fat and gained muscle by eating at maintenance and training hard. Sure, I could have lost fat faster, but that's not my only goal. In addition to lifting, I've done some boxing, yoga, and cardio, but lifting was my focus. I'm also on TRT, so I have a normal but above average testosterone level.

Good luck. You're in the home stretch.I never really ate all too much, but my highest was around 108. I had my king collapse when I was 16, and was hospitalized for 2 weeks. During that time I ate little because if a decreased appetite due to morphine. Left the hospital at 99 pounds and never really came back until I tried. Yeah. A 30s warmup of a muscle plus a 30s stretch is going to be roughly equivalent to a 60s stretch (these are contrived numbers).Wow great jobThose are different people.

&gt; Stretching cold muscles essentially does nothing

This is nonsense. Applying ice to muscles is used in physical therapy to temporarily improve flexibility for various reasons.

Assuming you are using "cold" to mean something other than temperature, stretching un-warmed up muscles simply takes longer to reach maximal ROM, but still results in overall flexibility improvements.A facebook-shared clip of Fit2fat2fit.com. I recognized the story of being not fit and got inspired by the story! Since then I've watched my diet and been in the gym 5 days a week and following his schedule. Also I lost 17 lbs and have much more energy.Please tell me I'm not the only one that now realizes July - November spells JASON...Absolutely. Not the only factor but can be a big one.Just do strong lifts for 12 weeks then evaluate where you are. You'll be amazed at how much muscle it will pack on in a short amount of time with a small number of lifts.

I was tired of being "fat." And when I had the chance after college I changed the way I ate and started working out.

2 years later... body dysmorphia man, body dysmorphia. The fat kid mentality doesn't leave just because you aren't fat anymore.Being fat a few years back plus wanting to be stronger for my own sake.My bench press is stalling and someone recommend you do the weight at 3 sets of 5, then 3 sets of 6 and so on until 10. Right now I'm 3 of 8 and it feels a lot lighter. I'm willing to bet if I tried 10lbs more I could do it. This submission has been removed.

I eat ice cream with no ragrets though.  No source for the study? Because there are sources saying static stretching is not the way to go before a workout.

From [Web MD](http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/how-to-stretch?page=2):
&gt;You should warm up by doing dynamic stretches, which are like your workout but at a lower intensity. A good warm-up before a run could be a brisk walk, walking lunges, leg swings, high steps, or "butt kicks" (slowly jogging forward while kicking toward your rear end).

From [TIME Magazine](http://healthland.time.com/2013/04/08/why-stretching-may-not-help-before-exercise/):
&gt;static stretching  slowly moving muscles until they just start to hurt and holding the stretch briefly  doesnt prevent injuries, and actually impairs strength and speed in some athletes....

&gt;One of the studies from researchers at the University of Zagreb reviewed 104 studies of people who only practiced static stretching as their warm-up and found that stretching reduced muscle strength by 5.5%. The second study looked at fit men who completed basic squats while lifting barbells either with or without stretching beforehand. Those that stretched lifted 8.3% less weight than those who didnt.

I second hill sprints. Brutal but such a good work out14lbsMaybe casually mention to a work buddy what substitute you would be willing to accept? I mean.. they just want to celebrate YOU and of course have a treat so it should be simple to get word around and get them to bring in something you can enjoy too. For my husbands B-day one year I made him a meat loaf "cake" as he doesn't dig sweets. and I totally didn't put in candles while it was still hot and make a melty mess.. those are horrible lies Got any favorites? I'm seeing Blue Diamond has one and if it's anything like their almonds it must be good. Creatine is going to make you maximally stronger a bit longer. So instead of failing at rep 5, you might fail at 6 or 7. Id recommend creatine because it's cheap as shit and it's effective.

BCAAs for most people aren't required. If you're an elite athlete, Id suggest it because the 1% that the BCAAs give you in performance is going to make a big difference. Most people I've talked to who take them don't notice a difference. 5% is pretty much in the margin of error range. These TDEE calculators are only estimates - if you want to do something as exact as 5% you need to be calculating your own intake *exactly* and tracking your results for weeks and calculate it from there. I would do at least 10% over the calculator numbers until you find out more about your own actual TDEE. Looking to this sub for advice honestly The reason not to static stretch before a workout has almost nothing to do with loss of force production. It has everything to do with static stretching being a shitty warmup.

[This review](http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2013/10/07/warm-up/) enunciates the idea that both static and dynamic stretching improve overall flexibility, but only dynamic stretching will improve performance afterwards.

Static stretching isn't "bad", it's just that you can **easily** fill the time with "better". Dude, that's incredible progress.  I'm of a similar build (5"10 and 165lb) from your before pic, also Indian (the Jockeys &amp; the bathroom gave it away) and this is some great motivation for me!

Keep it up!I use Fitness Buddy.Was joke. Not very funny. iluHow did you get to 102 in the first place? Thanks for the input. What do you mean by "hard-gainer"? Does that mean you find it hard to gain weight?walked up 1 flight of stairs and was out of breath and was at my heaviest ever, 196lbs. Decided right then and there to make a permanent change. down to 178 now and way way healthier.I'm the same way. It is why I don't take "cheat" meals or days. Everything I am comfortable eating is in my diet and when I have a sugar packed candy bar or over indulge in fried food... I feel like shit.80 kg may be "childsplay" to you, but you don't know his background or how long he's been at it. I wouldn't call that beginner's weight at all, his beginner weight may have been way lower. When I was a beginner, my coaches had me benching twice a week and doing at least five accessory lifts and my strength increased dramatically, so saying that he's doing too much simply isn't true. 5x5 doesn't work forever, there's a reason why people change their programs and reps and sets. The body adapts to what you do, so doing 5x5 and expecting it to consistently increase your strength doesn't make any sense. After 4-6 weeks, your body will have adapted and you won't be making any more improvements. What you're saying isn't "blunt truth" it's just some typical run-of-the-mill "broscience" that isn't actually true or helpful. His problem is most likely that he's doing the same thing week after week, not that he's doing "too much."I don't believe thats the case, I think thats just for some weird old membership tiers. It would be really bizarre for them to target newcomers with a deal that doesn't include classes, since they're a huge moneymaker for them.Realizing that I hated myself so much that I felt like no one could like me if I hated myself this much.  That and the fact I couldn't even be naked in a closed door room as to have to look at what I've become.  Over the past 7 years I've lost over 80 lbs and still fight the idea that I'm not this disgusting amorphous blob of a person.  I'm still overweight, but not obese (by literal BMI terms), and it's always a fight.  I constantly lose weight, become complacent, gain the weight back and have to start over.  Lately I'm trying to avoid the gain back, and never have to start from 0, that is the key to consistent weight loss.  Never let yourself fall back to step 0 where you have to re-do everything you've done to get your endurance back, it's demoralizing and can de-rail even the best motivated individuals.

Oh and the quality of women in my life that have started coming through since my weight loss has also helped me continue to stay in shape and fight to get better.Batman BeginsOkay Easy: realizing diet is more than 50% of the picture is hard and unless you cut out alchohol or limit it to 1 a week you will not see results quickly.FitNotes on Android for me - has a timer, can copy previous workouts easily &amp; even has a 1RM calculator and all the pretty graphs that can then be exported.Ah yes, I could have easily added this to my reason as well. Except, I asked myself "what type of girl would a guy want to date" and my answer was "someone like Nikki Blakketter" so that's what motivated me hahaIts hard to make strength gainz while cutting man, stick to one thing at a time. And it also sounds like you might have tired to bulk to fast, it is recommend to eat 500cal over TDE, if you just eat like crazy you'll put on too much fat and have to cut sooner. I hate myself, and my body is the easiest thing to change.

But really, I'm a performer, and having a good body is important for my career. Once I got started, I realized how nice it was to actually have control over some part of my life.8-12 is the rep range and it typically means find a weight that you can do 8-12 times for say 3 sets. It may end up looking like this 12, 10, 8. And that is good but don't move up yet.

You will move up in weight once your set is 12 across the board: 12, 12, 12. So after you move up in weight it might look like 10, 9, 8. You will stay at this weight until you can hit 12, 12, 12 again if your prescribed programming is 3x8-12.

Does this make sense now? Think im going to try it out, good to hear you got results! I always focused on my mental development, spent crazy amounts of times focused on my grades in school, got into the best PhD program in Electrical Engineering, and hated it instantly.

That whole time I ignored my physical development, and was ok with it because I was still using my time "constructively".

When grad school let me down I was burnt out and needed a break from career and mental development, so starting working on physical.

There was a breakup in there too as an extra motivator, but I'm not having any luck with girls even after a big improvement, but viewing it as physical development helps keep me going Yeah I'm also thinking if you do it non-consecutive days to throw in some exercises like light or front squat on push day and light bench or dips on leg dayIf only i liked olives.Unsweetened almond milk my friend.  1-2g net carbs per cup.  ;)  keto friendly for sure&gt; I'm sure phrak has the answer to this hot keyed by now but he must not be awake yet.

I really keep meaning to write up a big old Stretching FAQ document.Never once did i complain about the taste of white meat only vegetables. I have no problem with eating chicken/turkey/ what have you all day everyday. I eat it for at least 1 meal and have been doing so for almost 3-4 months. Its certain vegetables. Repeatedly eating something you don't like the taste of isnt going to make it taste any better. Thanks for your input though.&gt; just "going to the gym."

Unless you're a beginner, in which case this is a very good thing.&gt; and make you more prone to injury.

This is the only part that isn't true. Static stretching before exercise has been shown repeatedly to have no change on overall injury rates.I found out I was going to be a father.Yeah,  seriously.  What are we in Iraq? The search term you want to plug into google is "VO2 Max"

The training may or may not have you working off your heart rate, but your end goal is increasing VO2 Max. The rest is just a means to the end.That sounds like the Mafftone formula. http://philmaffetone.com/180-formula

In addition you need speed work at higher intensives.I keep my calories constant, but am not 'hardcore' about my macros. If I am under .8 for protein or .35 for fat when I am planning my day, I will make sure I have something to supplement to get to that minimum and possibly change a food somewhere to keep my calories at 2500 (most days I have a few hundred calories for a snack at night. Candy if I have hit protein/fat, or something else if I am lacking). But when I plug in my planned food, if my protein is above .8/lb, I dont stress about getting to 1 or something. Depends on the flavour, imo.  I got the myprotein without flavour, mix it in water, and use the water drops to add whatever flavour to.  You don't taste anything but that flavouring, and if you mix well there isn't really any additional thickness to the shake.are.. are you retarded? you know multiplication and division happens before addition and subtraction... right??I don't eat cheese and thanks for the input. Considering I'm losing about 5 pounds every 4 weeks, I'd say its around 2100.  I don't really eat back calories after a cardio workout, but I will for a lifting session.4036? Where's yo' brackets man, this is some 1st grade shit right here!ran track in high school, so i was always in decent shape.  after working a desk job for 2 years, i just wasnt happy with what i was seeing in the mirror anymore.
eventually got over the whole "yeah, i'll join the gym eventually" phase and got my ass over there.  beach season is coming up!  read the FAQ and WIKI in the side bar. What? Noobie gains is ambiguous. The term is stupid. Strength comes slower the stronger you are, "noobie gains" are just the beginning of the curve that ends at some arbitrary point where LP stops working. So all that really affects the answer is how strong he is/how efficient he is with the movements. Not every question needs an essay response. Cheeseburgers.  I freaking love cheeseburgers. They're a constant in my life. My activity level varies, but when I get out of the mode of working out to burn off the burgers, to a point where I *need* to eat more burgers to fuel my exercise, man, life is **great**.

Also, I'm just a miserable person when I'm out of shape. My health takes a noticeable hit, I'll be moody, my mental acuity drops, and everything just feels tight and sluggish.  Staying in shape makes me a better person in almost every measurable way.Check out /r/running, I've read a lot of discussion about this there. How are you recording these heart rates? How do you know they're accurate? Apparently determining your max is kind of hard to do, but once you've done that you determine 'zones' which will apply to training. I don't know exactly. I don't have any means of monitoring my heart rate so for now I've been using the rule of thumb to run at a conversational pace.I love Nerd Fitness!  Reading that website 3 years ago is what got me started on going to the gym.He probably had his knees done.Since I was like 12, I wanted to be "thin". I'm 24 now and what really made it click for the first time in 12 years for me was learning about macros and falling in love with the youtube fitness community. I watch these videos for motivation, and macro counting doesn't feel like a diet either!

Edit: I also now understand the importance of strong &gt; skinny which I think was the real motivation.Elevated bar would make it easier to keep straight back.Group mentality plus a fundamental misunderstanding on how to react to someone with a differing and what I thought until now, accepted opinion.

Never underestimate the childish tendencies of redditors.
I mean, on the one hand I appreciate that they made an effort to include me. But on the other hand, I am not interested. I have told them I'm not interested. I don't have a scale here, I'm not going to guess because it's just as easy for me to not eat it.

My comment last time, and this shut them up for a while, was that I save my "splurge" calories for my family events - example: etouffee tomorrow. I've been good all week so that I can eat my mother's cooking, and I'm not going to jeopardize that so that I can eat some watery fruit from walmart.at 80 kg there is no need to do that much work. 80 kg is childsplay.

at this point nobody is going to see this because there are ton of people on r/fit who can't handle blunt truth but when you are a beginner (and 80 kg bench is a beginner) you should be able to progress with a linear progression of JUST 5x5 into the 100s

his form probably sucks, and hes doing too much work for a beginnerYou can see with the arms down photos that he looks better in April but I agree in them two photos it's hard to tell.2 weeks later that's likely no longer water weight from that one meal21 responses and everyone but one person kneejerks about lowering hips while missing the most obvious reason - because your setup is shit. You bend in waist to grab the bar so there's no way in heaven and hell you're gonna straighten your back for pull.

Push hips back as far as possible, bend knees a bit if necessary, grab the bar, sit back so your shoulders are in line with bar, chest up, air into belly and pull. High school sports. Mostly football. Only football I should say. My sophomore year we got a new coach who was a former D-1 football player and bodybuilder. After that, I never looked back. I didn't end up going to college because I was too lazy for that, and ended up joining the military. I still workout so I'm fit enough for intramural sports or the occasional pick up basketball game. I guess sports got me started and continues to motivate me to be fit you could say. Its a paid service, but I once used [Eat This Much](https://www.eatthismuch.com/). For only $7-9USD/month I found it pretty good, the only reason I stopped was I found a lot of the ingredients they listed weren't available in Australia where I live.Add to that...sodiumYou look so much happier in the last two photos. =)I am also a WiiFit junkie!  When I first started losing &amp; had a drs visit (annual, routine stuff), my dr asked what I was doing differently.  When I said Wii, she was surprised but as since started suggesting it to patients w/my problem (bone density issues); the balance stuff is esp. great for me.Depends on what exercise you're doing and how fast you're trying to cutHigh levels of stress that caused health issues.  I've always been skinny, but lost a lot of weight dealing with the stress and a hernia surgery. I decided to move to a new state, shake up my life, and started getting in shape. It's the same scale that I've used for years.  Generally weigh myself 3 times a day: morning after shower/drying off, afternoon and before bed.  As far as calories I count *everything*.  If I'm not sure of the calorie count, I always round up.  If anything the calorie count is exaggerated on the high end.  I'm pretty consistent with this stuff, that's why I'm perplexed.butt nutters?Thanks for the advice! I know my lifts suck :( I've also been stuck cutting most of the time which is also a reason. I tried to bulk and add strength twice, and just gained too much fat and too little strength both times. I'm really starting to think lack of enough protein has been the problem all along. Thanks again for the advice!I started doing limber 11 this week, that frog stretch gets me some strange looks. I mean, it's always someone's birthday, or there's a holiday, so in a way, I get it.

My birthday is going to be this month. It's going to be super awkward, because I will not eat any cake if they buy one. I've turned down cake for almost a year now, so this should not come as a shock to anyone. But inevitably, there will be exasperated sighs as they say, "But we bought this FOR YOU!"

Yeah, without my consent and actually against my express wishes. So no, you actually bought it for yourself and pretended it was for me so you could eat it without feeling guilty about buying an entire cake for no real purpose.What the hodge twins are getting at here is that at lower intensity your body utilises a larger percentage of energy from fats than carbs (or glycogen stores). Which is great if you have a ton of muscles and want to preserve mass at all costs as depleted muscle glycogen causes muscle catabolism.

Higher intensity will utilise the fast releasing glycogen stores in the muscles (your carbs) more than the slow to utilise fat energy.

Therefore of you walked for 1 minute you would burn less overall calories due to low intensity. But of those calories more would be from fat.

Alternatively on a 1 minute hard run you will burn more overall calories, however a larger percentage will come from carbs (glycogen stores in the muscle)

So if your goal is fat loss stick to the working harder! Unless you are at the elite level this probably isnt worth worrying about. Get on the treadmill and work your ass off!

Felt weak and unattractive. Wanted to look better, to be stronger, to be attractive. Started at 118 pounds at 5"8, one year later I was 157 pounds. Much stronger, have muscles, have pretty girlfriend. Mission accomplished.

My only regret is that I didn't start sooner.
Graduated college and realized I wasn't happy with myself. I got a gym membership in October after I graduated, fucked around a lot and never really followed a program. Two years or so later I'm following a program and eating better than I ever have, although not 100% clean, a pretty solid balance of fruits, veggies, and all that other stuff. I usually feel pretty horrified, but not sick.  I do get more selective, though, which is counterintuitive.  If I've consistently been eating crap, I can eat any old crap, and it all tastes great.  If I've been eating clean, healthy food, then when I regress I notice if e.g. fried chicken or french fries have been fried in oil that wasn't fresh, or if pizza is crap.
Is dependant on one's anatomical build. Some pull very low, some pull so high it looks like straight leg deadlift.My mother-in-law.  My husband and I were living with her about 2-3 years ago and she wanted a gym buddy.  She paid for my membership at this awesome powerlifting gym close to the house.  We started out on just the machines for the first few months, and the gym owner eventually introduced me to compound movements like squats and deadlifts.  Fell in love with lifting because it made me feel awesome, as opposed to cardio where I always felt like sh*t.A smattering of olives works well to flavor up the standard fit fair food.Got sick of being the smallest and weakest of my friends Ah Talenti This submission has been removed.

Violation:

## [Rule 5: Asking for medical or injury advice is not allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_5._asking_for_medical_or_injury_advice_is_not_allowed)

&gt;If you're sick, hurt, or injured you should be getting help and/or advice somewhere else - preferably from a doctor. While people in Fittit might have similar conditions as you, not a single person will be able to examine you personally or understand your specific situation, and it's very hard to validate credentials over the internet.

[/r/Fitness Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules) | [/r/Fitness Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/wiki/index) | [reddit's rules](/wiki/rules) | [reddit wiki](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/index) | [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette)This is so true.They all have classes, but AFAIK you can't go to the classes if you have the $19.99/month membership.I respectfully disagree. Truly reaching a level of overtraining where the body cannot handle anymore and stalls/breaks down is a lot harder to reach than most people think. I'm a female and on chest day, I'll bench, do pause sets on bench, incline or decline bench, dumbbell press, three-way cable flies, and dips, and even then I won't hit "overtraining." I'll be tired and sore the next day, sure, but I'm not going to stall just because I did accessory lifts. The body constantly adapts to increasing loads that we put on it, so I highly doubt that his accessory lifts are what is causing his bench to stall.
To OP, I would suggest changing up what you do. As I just said, the body adapts. Every time I stall, I find it's because I've gotten comfortable in a routine and haven't switched it up lately. When my bench stalls, I implement pause sets on flat bench. So when I have the bar at my chest, I hold it there to a count of five and then focus on the explosive moment back up. I drop the weight significantly because these burn really bad, and when I hit about 10 reps with a pause I then do two normal reps. You could also try a drop set at the end of your normal flat bench routine. Another thing you should look into is completely new accessory lifts or simply changing your sets and reps. If you're doing 4x8, try 12-10-8 or even 15-12-10-8-6. The latter one has always been great for me, the first two longer sets activate the muscle and start me off with a good burn, and then the last three shorter sets are great for going heavier for muscle growth. Those things have helped me go from benching maybe 65 lbs like every other girl in the gym to 145 lbs, hopefully they work for you.We're not talking about shit we're talking about white meat, vegetables, and citrus fruits, things humans were made to eat.  It sounds like all you want to eat is burgers, hotdogs, french fries, pizza, and assorted gas station food which is pretty much always going to have a negative impact.Quit smoking and got fat.

I'm getting married on October. This summer we will spend a total of 24 days on/at the beach. I have been working out since last August. 2 weeks out and almost ready for my first day in Mexico!Yeah think I'll go back to my iso 100 and isopure since it does not have creatine and all that extra stuff.

It's been a couple weeks, but you're right, the potential for water to hold carbs is there so it may just take longer for me.Whoaaa... You made serious progress, 102 lbs at 5'10? 130 lbs looks a hell of a lot healthier on you, keep it up!Its entirely up to you. If you were going the other way (bulkingcutting) its recommended that you eat at maintenance first for a week for two, but this is just for your own sanity. The more you eat, the more gainz you make, but this comes with fat as well.

Enjoy those burgers!Shroomtech Sport made 30 miles (cycling) feel like 20. My gas tank just felt bigger without any sort of physical stimulation. It was a little pricey though, and I don't compete or anything so I only tried the one bottle.

I feel like Onnit sells good products, just marked up a bit too much for my budget.I yo-yo'd between 180-220 lbs since 8th grade. I've always been active (kayaking, hiking, etc) but not active enough to keep the weight off once I stop whatever crash diet I was on.

This past summer I was a councilor at Camp Quest and was at my highest weight of 250 lbs. One of the campers even told me after a particularly intense game of capture the flag that "I mean this only as a compliment but... for a big buy you're super fast."

It was nice to hear, but I didn't want to be the guy who is a lot stronger than he looks... I want to be the guy that is exactly as strong as he looks... and looks like he can bench a house.

Once I got back from a week at camp I took some baby steps to curb my diet, and once i was down about 10 lbs I started lifting in December. I'm down only about 20 lbs in total but I'm very pleased with how much muscle mass i've put on &amp; what large strength gains I've made. Goal is to be at 200 lbs by camp this summer and to be able to curl a camper. This submission has been removed.

I'm not the one who originally asked, but I'm going to try it out nonetheless! I proudly mix my whey isolate with water only and it tastes magically delicious.Dr Ellis is a keto proponent so very much low carb.  Of courses fat is burned in day to day low energy situations but its no use in high intensity situations.  For that you need glucose.  There is a balance where all your energy needs are optimized.  Its up to you to find it.The main focus of pre-workouts is the caffeine. Caffeine powder is very cheap, adding a small amount to your pre-gym protein shake will do the same job as these tablets for a fraction of the cost.You're looking at different serving sizes of oats.I thought to myself, "The kind of girls I want to date (and one I eventually want to marry), what kind of guys are they attracted to? I need to become that guy." In my head, that guy is fit and strong (not including other important things), so I started working out for the girls in the future who I'm going to meet. Let's face it, we're all vain to a degree with people we find attractive, we all objectify people based on their looks, and I want women to find me hot.This comment is way too ambiguous. I was always in sports, but never knew about nutrition and hydration, etc etc. Joining the military and exploring the interwebs really brought me into it. Now that I'm out, I do it for the gir....myself.Teddy grahams with milk is my nightly snack. Every night, like clockwork. Them carbs put me to sleep like a baby.Interdasting.- 2 Cups whole milk
- protein powder
- 1 banana
- 2-3 tbsp peanut butter
- optional granola/oats

Comes out to 1000-1300 calories. I keep mine at 1000 so it's easier to get down. Just drink it over an hour in the morning.I've been eating vegetarian on Mondays &amp; Tuesdays and other random days.  I'm 285lbs 6'3" 27 y.o.
I had a couple sips of a chocolate shake last Friday. I could taste the onset of diabetes.   Paused the movie I was watching put the shake in the freezer and walked to the bar (12 blocks).  Felt better when I got a bit of that sugar out.   I can't hardly eat red  meat anymore and I love burgers and steak. It just makes me so tired.  Something snapped in me over the last couple weeks for the better I'm sure. I think my body is just telling me that's not nutritious quit eating it.  You never know anything is wrong if you never look at it from the outside.
Yeah I drink plenty of water thanks!Your fat and protein intake shouldn't change much, if you were eating adequate amounts during your cut. Therefore, the additional 1000 kcals should primarily come from carbs. I like to also up my intake of unsaturated fats during a bulk, since they're calorie dense,  "healthy" and delicious (nuts and nut butters).Me to!! I can't eat junk food anymore.
I can, but in 2 hours I'm either puking, or rolling on the ground in pain.
It still taste good, but omg the pain. It's terrible.
My husband thought I was joking until one day I REALLY wanted some pizza. Ate three slices, by the time he was in bed, I was sitting in front of the toilet. Even the next morning my stomach was still pretty messed up. Had to eat light foods for the rest of the day.

It's blessing and curse lol ( o  o)Milk is expensive water is free from any tap. Trying to bulk my wallet bro.Pizza and burgers have a lot of carbs.

Carbs cause water retention

Most of that weight should drop off within a few daysFirst of all, cut your ranges down and go for the upper ranges on what you have. That's a fairly large calorie swing you're rocking.

Second of all, you can fill your excess calories with pretty much anything, most people suggest carbs.These guys need to try out for ninja warrior. holy crap. Beyond a good back movement (rows or pull ups) for 3x4-8, I think 2 sets each of 2-3 accessories is fine. More OHP. Deload, and do 4x6 instead of 3x5. If you can get the bar off of your deltoids easily but struggle with the lockout, do tricep work at like 3x8-10. Close Grip bench is awesome3 cups milk

2 bananas

1 cup oats

1 cup Greek yogurt

7 tablespoons peanut butter

1800 caloriesI like Strong set up similar and you can create your own workouts. I also feel like someone here made it cause it references/fitness in the FaQ You can see through experience that consistency is enough to make gains, and as long as you progressively overload they will continue. I think programs make it a little easier to do since they've determined how to do these things already.

I don't think you *have* to work out on the same days in order to do SL or other programs. Just adapt their principles and template to what works for you. I've done GSLP which is similar to SL; you only squat twice a week. And if I was busy on a work out day I'd just do it the following day instead. Consistency.Lesson: don't eat because it just causes troubleI think current wisdom is dynamic stretching before, static stretching after.

That being said, this shit isn't actually current wisdom--ballet dancers and gymnasts have been doing this forever.  I used to be a competitive rock climber, and we'd end our 2-3 hour workouts with a solid 20 minutes of stretching, because flexibility was a goal in and of itself--I used to be able to do the whole Van-Damme split between chairs thing for a few seconds before I felt my taint splitting.  Watch a ballet class that's at the top tier like a Bolshoi--they start off with dynamic stretching and super basic legwork exercises, literally pliets and toe pointing and stuff despite these people being the best of the best, and after the class when they're all warmed up, then they do bar exercise stretches.I saw the promo picture for Arrow, then I lifted up my shirt and looked for my own abs and couldn't find them.  So I started my Oliver Queen workout plan, and I'm about 1 year into my five year goal.  I shaved the beard after six months because it was stealing my food, and some of my gainz.  It's not just exercise, I started learning martial arts, I'm going to try to get into the competitive archery league around here, and I'm going to learn at least one other language with at least the fluency of a drunk six year old.

David Belle has been a long term inspiration for me though, that guy can use his body in ways I didn't even think were possible.  I was especially impressed to see him in Brick Mansions, ten years later and looking not a bit worse for it.

I'm making progress.  Had at least one girl stop and stare at me, and say I was looking pretty good.Protein is king, its what rebuilds your muscles. Not enough protein = longer muscle recovery. If you are working out muscles that haven't recovered don't expect to make gainz - expect injuries.

You should get 1g of protein per pound of body weight. This means 180g per day for you. [This is in the FAQ.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_diet_details)

I don't know how much you work out but you should have definitely progressed more than you have, a 2 plate DL isn't great for someone who has been working out for 1.5 years. Sorry, don't mean to be a dick, but the good news is you can change all this!

Best thing to do is download the MyFitnessPal App if you haven't already and track all your protein. To get your protein, the most common ways are lots of chicken and invest in some whey, [and here is a list of some other ideas.](http://www.healthaliciousness.com/articles/foods-highest-in-protein.php) I dunno if Fitness recommends it but, when I find I haven't had my protein dose for the day I use fast food burgers to get me over the line. Cheap, convenient and they have heaps of protein. This is obviously a bad idea if you're cutting though.Im not trolling. Just worried that people will see this guy's form, think "only upperback is rounding so its cool" and then go do scared cat deadlifts and wonder why they get injured.

But who cares&gt; Stretching is all about relaxing and slowly getting your brain used to the fact that it can safely allow such and such muscle to extend more without causing any injuries.

That's kind of the point of PNF stretching. Flexing tires out the muscle and hampers its ability to contract against the desired motion.Is it just me or do you also feel weak af when putting them on lol?! Worth the struggle tho...I'm cutting around 1500 calories. Don't complain about hunger on 3200.Increase by 250 calories/day every week until you're gaining a pound a week.When they run for the elevator.. and then you have to listen to them gasping for 19 floors. It's both annoying and amusing at the same time.I want to be as strong as the mountain.I've noticed it very much depends on specifically what I order. A whopper will leave me tied in knots but one of those new A1 bacon cheeseburgers was fine.InsecurityOn the flip side, all the kids I knew in high school who played hours and hours of DDR were obese.  Proof that no matter how much exercise you get, diet still matters.Switch from semi-skimmed to whole milk. Add in half and half as well. Half a cup of peanut butter. And a little honey. Plus the other stuff you're using. That'll get you to around 1500-2000 calories.You're probably eating more than you think, you're not weighing yourself under the same conditions each time (time of day, before/after bathroom use, etc.) or your scale has a large margin of error.

Like lifting weight over your head. It's mainly anything placing extra weight or pressure on your spine. Unsupported forward trunk flexion or any kind of twisting ab exercises too. Just look up contraindicated exercise with osteoporosis. I'll have to try that. I love things that taste like other things when they're mixed together.

Not that it's super healthy, but candy corn and peanuts taste just like PayDay bars when you eat them together. It's awesome.I'm trying to get in the mindset that hungry is good, hungry is progress, hungry is happy.  Full and stuffed is the old me.

That's interesting, though.  You've been consistent in your diet, right?  But your body is not consistent in how it feels.  Good to know.PNF is something I learned from the first book on flexibility I ever read. The science behind it makes sense and the technique is effective. Ultimately, I've only employed it on stretches where I feel like I'm at a plateau, like the side splits. It helps to eek out those last few inches.First of all, yeah, that second reading was way off.

Second of all, find a more accurate one and then just use that as a guideline. Don't trust it implicitly, find out for yourself.Anyone on an EC stack? I'm feeling pretty good two weeks in, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for some help on their cut.Puberty... The gainzzzz were real Yeah, I agree. When it comes to knees, or any other ailment for that matter, its best to not take advice from Reddit (not that people may not know what they're talking about, but it's ludicrous and irresponsible for someone to diagnosis and give his father advice). Get him to see a doctor and let him make that call. Zack here. Can confirm.This.

I started running last year and lasted quite a while before knee pain (IT-Band Syndrome) kicked in.  Got my form sorted out and it's all gone.

If he has been doing a lot of walking then he probably isn't running but using his walking form which puts a lot more stress on the knees/hips.  Awesome video! Definitely makes me want to step into Olympic lifts more instead of the standard Deadlift/Squat/BenchThanks, would this work even on non consecutive days? Like push monday, pull thursday, leg friday?Just to throw a few more points in for the discussion, there is actually nothing wrong with flexing the muscle. I am on my phone right now so can't link a good source, but google post isometric relaxation. It's an advanced stretching technique that is genuinely quiet effective, however only if you know how to use it properly.

Just remember, breathing and holding the stretch for more than 20-30 seconds is crucial in retraining the stretch reflex, less than that and the muscle is just essentially waiting till you stop!

&gt; Got give this chicken and broccoli flavour some how.

No, you don't. For anyone else reading: It's perfectly acceptable to eat food plain, particularly if you're struggling with calories. Not everything *has* to be slathered in sauce to be edible. And after eating it for a while you'll adjust and be fine with it.

*However* if you want to pour sauce on it and it fits in your diet, that's perfectly fine to. No, adding hot sauce to your meals won't have any major negative effects (besides the obvious ones).

I don't mean to be a dickbag or argue semantics, but I see the mentality a lot of people trying to lose weight who can't do it, who just constantly load up their "healthy" food with garbage because "Well I *can't* eat broccoli without cheese!"

Yeah, you can, and it's okay if you do. It's okay if you don't, too.Looks like a rip off site designed to sell vitamins through Amazon. What a crock of shit article. I don't know where you got your vitamin information, but it appears you used the bull the vitamin info sellers put out, and not information discrediting most all of the supplements you can buy on Amazon and other companies. I don't like this site at all. Testimonials are a dime a dozen.Yeah I wouldn't worry about it, benching will probably start to slow down and squat will keep trucking. Just ride it out and let the gains be with youby who?I got this feeling when I had pizza.

Felt like shit hours later into my workout.

I could taste the pizza. 3x5 leg extensionscool, thanks. Can someone help me with calorie math?  I want to pre-measure out my meals for a week, so I'm making one of my favorite slow-cooker recipes that I can make in bulk:  Salsa chicken with beans on rice.

I don't have the ingredients right now, so I'd just like input on my thought process.  I use a full bag of frozen chicken breasts (thawed), half a jug of Carlita salsa, one pound of dried beans (soaked for 24+ hours), and one packet of taco seasoning.  I then cook two cups of rice and serve the chicken over that.

(I'm going to use my own spices instead of the taco seasoning next time, the beans retain a firm texture--which I don't mind--and I think the salt is to blame.  I also have some canned tomatoes to substitute for the salsa to cut out more salt.  FYI the firm texture is gone when reheated, which is every meal but the first.)

So, if I want to figure out how many calories are in a meal, I will just add up the calories in the bag of chicken, half of the calories in the salsa, the pound of beans, and the rice.  I'll have the weights of chicken and salsa in ounces, but I'll have to weigh the beans after soaking and the rice after cooking.  Total calories divided by total weight will give me Cal/lb ratio, then I just weigh my food and multiply by my ratio.

It's a lot of work, IMO.  I just want to do it once and try and start a good habit for at least a week.

Holy crap I need a food scale.  I have one I used to use when I smoked herbs but that's too small, right?  I'm sure someone's recommended a food scale here, I'll have to go look for that.I've had friends who use creatine and they were noticeably bigger after they started it. Probably affects everyone differently though.Still has 12g carbs / cup. n00b question..what's TCM ?&gt;find how many calories your burning per day(BMR).

Use your TDEE, not BMR.I will say that this is partially true. When I initially started getting fit, I didn't even think about calories or exercise plans. I basically just messed around at the gym a few times a week, eliminated a lot of my opportunities to boredom eat, and cut back on ice cream and frozen burritos. Just doing this, I lost 50lbs in a few months. But I eventually hit a wall and had to refine my methods.

On the other hand, though, I do realize that a lot of people will fail doing it this way because their understanding of what healthy food is might be flawed, and they're overestimating how effective their workouts are.Also, timing relative to workout doesn't matter. I would also add that it isn't a prescription, it's a supplement. You should be tracking your macros and determine if you're missing enough protein that a supplement is required. If you already get enough, then it *might* be considered wasteful, but certainly not harmful.Yeah I mean it'd make sense to switch to ppl now, maybe for push do heavy bench 3x5, lighter ohp 3x8-12, db ohp drop set, incline db bench 3x8-12, db flies 3x8-12, skull crushers, tricep pushdowns, maybe throw in some front squats?

Pull

Pendlay row, bb supinated grip row, lat pull down, pull/chin ups, light deadlift, face pulls

Legs

Heavy squats, calf raises, pause squats, whatever you wantI've always been into fitness from a young age.  At 12 I moved up from the kids ski team (Nancy Greene) into a serious Alpine ski racing club and that was the start of it.  By 14 I had several coaches, trainers, and more.  Training daily, several hours a day in the gym and countless days on the mountain.  Age 17 is when I got into long distance running and loved running marathons as a compliment to skiing, by that point I was with Alpine Canada.

I haven't skied competitively in 10 years now and have hit some real low points with my fitness and self esteem mostly because of long lasting injuries and rehabilitation but I've always seen it as a core component to my life and well being.  I started drinking protein with milk back in the days when it wouldn't mix very well in water, and never looked back.You didn't notice that on gas pump inspectuon stickers already?  Hmm.Cottage cheese, cinnamon, and Stevia (sorry three ingredients) tastes a lot.like cannoli fillingI wonder if almonds and yogurt counts as two ingredients?  It's a pretty good combo, at least for me.Lentils.

Addition: I find it pretty easy to eat over 100g protein on a vegetarian diet, and there really isn't a *need* for protein powder if you plan it right.

For someone your size, I wouldn't go for more than a 500 kcal deficit. Weight loss of .5kg/week is considered the safest amount one should aim for. This is a conservative amount and used to avoid potential nutrient deficiencies. &gt; But skim milk has a good amount of protein for its calories.

Yeah, but water has *no* calories. If all you want is efficient protein intake for as few calories as possible, just take it with water. If you can fit skim milk into your diet/macros, great, but not everyone can or wants to.

It's really not that big a deal to take it with water. It's less like a tasty shake and more just something you put in your body every day.I produce a projectile vomit reaction after eating taco bell now man don't complain about free fruit! the only fruits in our meetings are the employees :(Lifting for grills My niece. When she was born I was a overweight and doing anything with her would exhaust me within minutes. Now I can throw her around all day.Do you not have classes at yours? Mine has classes running most of the time I'm there.That's actually really awesome that someone pointed this out!
I used it when I weighed 280lbs, dropped down to 190 lbs. After a year of using it! I felt more recognition, coming from a Damn computer (trainers with no identity, but yet I missed my no face gal trainer.. Lol) than coming from a live one. I wouldn't dare go without a spotter! But yeah, maybe I could do different sets/reps on monday versus thursday, that sounds like a good idea.Since we are all sharing out shake mixes, here's my variation.

* 1 Cup Fat Free Milk
* 1 Cup of berries (usually blueberries or strawberries)
* 1 Cup of the same Oats everyone else uses apparently lol
* 1 Scoop of whatever flavor protein I have
* 1 Scoop Creatine
* Enough Peanut Butter to get the taste/consistency right
* If I am running low on either berries or milk, I'll add yogurt

You then got used to feeling awesome.  Then you ate something that makes you feel crummy, and it's way worse because you're not used to it anymore.

Just keep eating healthy :-)looks good, but you shouldn't breathe in the hole.

Keep tight throughout the whole liftSo if you're cutting should you stop taking creatine to look more leaner?I'm in jersey.Why the fuck is there so much cake in offices?It is just clicking of joints. Your tendons are sliding over one another, some snapping across bones. It should be relatively harmless. You'll find ROMs that do this for every joint- elbow, hip, knee. It is typically in movements you dont need to load real heavy for, since it will cause sheering under heavier loads). It is benign though.I was a prominent snowboarder/wakeboarder with ambitions on pro status.  I was twice the party animal as I was a rider.  Years went by and I was sitting around at 25 years old with every ounce of skill gone looking and feeling like a piece of shit!  A friend suggested Crossfit.  5 years later I ride better than I did when I was 18-20 years old with no plans to every fuck up that bad again.  Now I stay with a strict olympic lifting program.

If you are truthfully weighing all your food and and logging it in grams, then you need to just give it more time. Weight loss isn't always linear. Lol it's just that it comes up all the time "how can you drink protein with water?!" and I'm like "well by not being a baby". I should have saved this for rant wednesday Nah, I am sure he is tank-bread third-generation genetic wonder :) Because how else could the Chinese beat us, that's the only explanation :o)Also, last thing. If 2500 cal is to much what should my goal be. M 28 semi active&gt;Another huge one is people think "hey I'm overweight, I better start running". NO NO NO NO!!! That is the worst thing you can do.

I know someone who is overweight and is starting to run in order to lose weight. She's doing a couch to 5K program. I want to tell her that running isn't good at the moment, but I have no idea how to do that without being an "unsupportive asshole."Went from being really busy and in a relationship to being single and having a lot more free time.2000 calories basically in vegetables? I feel like there's something huge you're missing. Do you track your calories? It's the god damn calf raise machine. My nemesis.When I was 6'4" and weighed 160 lbs (72 kg). I was very lanky and skinny and wanted to bulk up for basketball. I wanted to dunk a basketball and be stronger so I started lifting three days a week. Now I hardly play ball and lift a lot. I have found that hydration has done a whole lot for me.  Or maybe the hydration coincided with some other stuff that has reduced muscle soreness, but I'm not complaining.

Generally speaking, altering one or two workouts probably isn't going to have a catastrophic impact on your progress.  In fact, especially when you're new, a few light days are recommended and can help avoid injury.  This is important because it seems like tendon/ligament issues pop up a lot more than muscle issues, and tendons take longer to recover from stress.  Sometimes on the order of weeks rather than days.

Unless you do something like take an entire month off, you probably won't see too many negative effects.i do joe francos limber 11 plus a few shoulder warm ups before i start and usually on my off days. my injury rate has SERIOUSLY declined. I do it about 30 min before i start, haven't had any issues with this static stretching stuff, I think it only matters if you do your static stretch and immediately get under a bar. Usually i do different variations of sets like 3 sets of 10 or at 10-8-6 reps. Also try doing very small increments on the 2nd or 3rd set and then bring it back down.  If possible get a spotter, it really helps overcoming the stall.Congratulations on your journey!
Being foolish in the gym and injuring yourself. I learned the hard way by something as foolish as taking a loaded squat bar down a rung. Sprained my wrist and kept me from upperbody lifting for a month. Nothing worse than having the motivation and will power but physically not being able to make progress.

Be deliberate, think things through and never be afraid to ask for help.Dad got me a jacket that was the perfect length but too wide. Instead of returning it I was determined to make it fit. I ended up just doing arms and shoulders but it got me started in the gym.&gt;I'm not understanding the difference between carbs and calories completely although it is a distinct one

Carbohydrates are a macronutrient. An element of nutrition in food. It's counterparts are fat and protein.

Calories are the units of energy in food. Units used to measure the amount of energy your body can attain from it.

Carbs are measured in weight, calories are measured in energy. All food is calories. Not everything contains carbs.Just got tired being fat. I was a fat kid all the way through high school. College actually assisted me in dropping a lot of weight and then I started hitting the gym my sophomore year; then I got into weight lifting in 2013, and then, like, proper weight lifting this past year.

I was at 250 at my worst, despite marching band and shit, and now I'm at 160. It wasn't a drastic change in a year, but slow incremental changes over time.

At the very least I wanted to justify that goddamned Reese's Cup. If I'm gonna eat like a fatass I'm gonna fucking earn it.I'm not sure what your schedule is like, but if you are only running for 20 and not seeing the results you want, run for more!

I know it may be intimidating, but you should also begin lifting weights in addition to just working on cardiovascular strength. How beneficial are supplements such as creatine and BCAAs? I'm very new to the supplement side of things and would like to know the opinions of some others. Lesson: don't eat healthy foods if you want to be able to enjoy greasy junk! I wasn't implying that, but IMO milk improves the taste of any protein.I can try that but I was always told never to eat less than 1200 calories a dayMy knees and ankles have cracked since I was like 7. I've never been able to sneak up on people. It's never really been a problem except when I'm trying to murder people.I log everything correctly and I never eat back exercise calories
Fats are still essential to your diet. I keep track of my macros and don't go over 80g of fat per day.

That is always an option though. (   ) being a fat piece of shit

edit: to be clear, im still a fat piece of shit, just significantly smaller than when i first startedKettlebell :) a 16kg is cheap and it will definitely challenge your HR while strengthening every muscle in your body.Honestly, I never had that 'moment'. For me I always wanted to be in shape but each attempt proved fruitless. There was not magic formula for motivation in my head, I kept trying different routes and figuring things out slowly. Finally the last attempt worked. I had slowly built up to it and figured out what works for me.

Some can jump into it with both feet and stick with it. For me it was slow progression that slowly turned into a lifestyle.Was deployed. A couple buddies dragged me to the gym. Fell in love with the iron. So I guess the answer to your question is peer pressureHave a look on this subreddit's sidebar and you will find a section on goal setting. Even if you don't feel too serious about training try to think of what you envision your future physical self to be. It will definitely help motivate and give you direction.I'm going through something similar. My bench has stalled around 240lb 1 RM. The last time this happened, I switched up rep schemes (high rep low weight) and basically just mixed it up until I broke through the plateau. Going through that again right now. Yeah, I went from 180 to ~172 in about a week of not taking it.vigorously with lemon pledgeI recommend training chest just one day a week because variation is the key to get out of a stall, if you find that you can't push more weight out of a lift then try doing a different variation of that lift such as do bench press at the last part of your workout my friend. -Tips from a personal trainer.I have no actual knowledge of this kind of stuff but "Ignited Hyper-Thermogenesis for Physique Partitioning Training" makes it sound like utter bollocks.Stumbled on this one, its really good. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZed23EEdsIt's a lot about consistency, like everything else I guess. I've made a lot of progress over a few years but in terms of commitment we're talking about around 30min-1h30 stretching at least 5-6 times a week.

Now the past 6 months I haven't been able to do as much and I've made little to no progress since then and I'm now trying to get it back into my daily routine. There is no need to stretch for 1h straight thought - one thing that works well is to spread it over the day: say 15min stretch when you wake up (and this will make you feel great for the rest of the day!), 15min stretch after each physical activity, 15min stretch at night, and a few minutes there and there during the day!My dad passed away from CHF.  Heart disease is documented on both sides of the family, but my dad had become increasingly unhealthy and overweight in recent years.  This combined with the birth of my son a few months before his death, made me want to be sure I had energy and strength to play with him for a long time coming.  I felt I was out of shape, and this became very apparent when I started to lift.I don't want to be up and dying and regret that I never found out the full potential of my own body. It just kind of clicked one day.Whole milk when bulking, skim milk when cutting. Can't stand the taste of watery chocolate.Maybe he put 76 cms and 170 kgs lolAlso be careful of free form amino acids for the same reason as above. The product you showed has taurine which is not needed in humans (though it may have additional performance benefits). This also contains nitrogen and is counted as protein. Typically glycine and taurine are added to pad the label. I'm a little jealous of that. If I finish off the day with as much Taco Bell I can put down, everything's normal. Guilt?  Maybe. But my belly is cast iron. Nothing phases it. I don't have a good reason for it, but I feel the same way.  I can't even finish a can of soda anymore.  I still eat junk food, but when I do i get pretty bad indigestion. First: Sounds like an intense workout.  I've thrown up when pushing myself hard both running and lifting - it happens.  Hell, for crossfitters it's a rite of passage.

Second.  Aside from overall intensity and low rest periods, I don't see what your trainer was trying to do.  It's good to push hard, but intentionally bringing you to muscle failure isn't really the best way to train.Do not listen to people telling you not to static stretch before a workout.  They mean well, but it is based off of a study that does not apply to practical workouts.

Static stretching does inhibit performance -immediately- after the stretches, but that goes away very quickly.  Static stretching can be an important aspect of your pre-workout routine.

Here's a couple of videos by Thrall that talks about pre-workout stretching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH11j4kSQ8E

I believe that the static stretching section starts at abou 8:40 on the one above this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaWGUcjQdWI

Can you tell me your routine for them height gains?I use the app. It chimes at 1:30 and I usually step back in the rack at 2min. On other exercises I wait up to 3 min if it's hard and 5 min if I failed a set. nice ~~username~~ memeHere, found it! "hold-relax PNF" What do you think?

http://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/pnf-stretching#2Thank you very much!Why not nix the coconut oil if you're cutting? All of the calories are from 13g fat and 0 protein.Same here.  I haven't stretched in months before a weight lifting session.  I just start with low weights and high reps to get my blood flowing and joints loosened up.

I do a little bit of stretching before I play basketball though.  Didn't mean for that to come across that way haha. I was suggesting to questions everything in order to understand it better. Google and references checking should be your two best friends where this is concerned.While from a practical standpoint this is true, very few people are aware that down-regulation of muscle phosphocreatine levels actually does occur after excessive loading and may not return to baseline even after 30 days of cessation. Outside dosing can also actually prevent uptake to an extent after extended periods of time.

In reality, an optimal dose based on research would be 5g a day for one month as a "loading" protocol followed by 3g on workout days only or something like 3 on 3 off if you train 5-7 days a week.

Edit

Why the down votes with no counter points? I will post research when I get home, but this idea is fairly well established and anyone with an education in the field would understand why this dosage protocol is superior. This is r/fitness so I understand that whatever is not part of the usual copy paste circle jerky is often down voted and not many people have formal education in the nutrition/exercise science field. But the downvote button shouldn't just be "I disagree but I don't know why"Good going buddy.Cross country, basketball and baseball. I also played baseball in college for two seasons.Thank you very much! During the first session (not proper training) we had, he taught me the correct forms of the aforementioned barbell exercises, lol I'm in love with them, I never had the confidence to do deadlifts previously, on Tuesday I tried them and really enjoyed it!
Honestly ss is the first real program that I did and it really helped me a lot starting out but it isn't perfect and the inconsistent pressing frequency week to week is one of the things I think isnt too great.  If you want to consistently better at pressing you need to press more or at least get more volume with the muscles involved. Honestly I would recommend benching and pressing every workout and alternating the order each day, adding weight to the first press exercise of the day and using the second for more volume and form practice. Add in an equivalent amount of some kind of pulling accessory for shoulder health.  Doing this will get you more practice and help with overall upper body development. [Jamba Juice recipes](http://www.makedrinks.org/jamba-juice-recipes/) are a great treat, though the fruit tends to contribute a fair amount of sugar if that's something you're concerned about. Add vanilla or chocolate whey to any of them.

My personal favorite shake is:

- 1 cup ice
- 1 scoop whey
- 1/2 cup soy milk
- 2 oz silken tofu

The whey gives it flavor, tofu makes it creamy (melted ice cream consistency), and ice lightens it up.Let's say someone's protein and calories are set correctly for a bulk. Will the way their remaining calories are split between carbs and fats affect body composition or does it not matter?

And in a Spider Man comic.Hey look, I found the person thinks what they do is great and thinks other things are worse.My protein comes from salmon,  white meat chicken, hamburger paties, and optimum nutrition shakethe best (worst) part is on lunch when they're eating and breathing heavily. I can never tell if the act of eating is that taxing to them, or if they're nearing orgasm because it's feeding time again.


In all seriousness, I love my coworkers. They're funny people and generally nice to be around. I just wish they cared enough about themselves to not be approaching morbid obesity.


inb4 health problems, not their fault, etc., it's definitely their fault. I see them have a soda at 8am, another at 9:15, then hot chocolate, then sweet tea at lunch, another soda at 2, and that's only while they're at work. The protein I buy doesn't taste gross with water. Clif Bar - SUMO'S PROTEIN BARLoads of exercise coupled with a  large calorie deficit.Pretty much nothing. My friend started going to the gym and would bring protein shakes etc to the train station. He wouldn't shut the fuck up about it so I decided on a whim to just try it out as the gym was mega cheap.

He stopped going and I've carried on ever since. Now I'm the one that can't shut the fuck up.It's a mix of breakup, too much spare time, and admitting that my bucket list was full of adventurous stuff that I'm nowhere near fit enough to begin training for let alone accomplish. thanks for the reply. yeah, I don't have much options in the city at a decent price :( someone told me about blink, looking into it tooI think I felt that sickness all the time, but conveniently ignored it. After having healthy diet for a while, the effect is more pronounced because of the difference and I saw that with many people who maintain a good physique - they don't eat junk food citing that it will make them feel bloated.And nutter butters. You really don't ever have to worry about water retention except to drink more water. It's not exactly harmful. Plus it affects everyone different. I don't notice any difference strengthwise or bloatedness whether I use creatine or not.I used to do it with instant coffee with fair success wasn't amazing, but I enjoyed it in the mornings. Some people suggest making the coffee, cooling it off, and then adding the whey.


Also, stay the hell away from cookies and cream. Absolutely horrible flavor.Mostly vegetables that I get at lunch with my meal. Also the occasional pb&amp;jwhich one is yours, if it is okay to ask?Vanilla almond milk and ice ice baby.I am taking this here 1 scoop a day.http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/platinum-hydrobuilder.html

It says 1 scoop 5g of creatine I didn't get it because of the creatine tbh I noticed it after I have been using isopure and iso 100 for 5 months wanted to try something new.

I suppose I can go back after I finish this only has 20 servings and I'll watch what I get later on.If you haven't tried this already, add a couple of oz of silken tofu to your next protein shake. It makes it wonderfully creamy (and flavored whey masks any flavor from the tofu).

50 grams/1.7 oz of tofu has 2.5g of fat (most of which is polyunsaturated), 4g of protein, 1 carb, and about 30% of the RDA of calcium and iron.Huh how interesting! I was really active in high school, played on the baseball team, lifted year round, etc. but it all went to shit in college (too much beer and pizza). I was around 210 in high school, mostly muscle, some fat. I didn't have a six pack. I ballooned to 260 by the time I graduated. When I was interviewing for jobs I felt so terrible and uncomfortable in my suit I knew I needed to change. So I did. Eventually was down to 180lbs about 2 years after graduating. I work with athletes and being fit although isnt a huge part of my job it is an aspect so i am basically surrounded by it and being a former athlete I get bored with not doing something so thats basically it(   )Yep, same. ON double rich chocolate and whole milk tastes like a damn chocolate milkshake. "I lost some weight" - 1802 points.

Health reasons.  I worked out regularly in HS but stopped after graduation.  Gained some significant weight from boozing and eating like crap for a few years.  Friend had a heart attack in his mid 20s and that showed me that I really needed to start taking care of myself.  I have come from benching the bar, and deadlifting/squatting maybe around 90-100lbs.

I eat 300-500cals over my tdee.

I don't really have any long term goals, I don't know what is really reasonable, I just kind of go with it.

I'd like to be able to cut for next summer though.For those of you who get giant-ass bags of individually cryo-vac'ed frozen chiken, salmon, beef, etc from Costco... how do you calculate all the calories you're getting?

For example, the serving size on the bag of salmon is listed as 6 oz or 1 package, which is typically exactly what a frozen piece of the individually packaged salmon weighs... but when it thaws it is different. Do I trust that "1 Package" thawed, while not always weighing 6 oz will give me everything as advertised?Someone mistook me for a girl that I *knew* was fat. I was pushing 230lb (5'8") at the time. It got me to take a hard look at myself. New research in gut ecosystem (the bacteria and microbes that live in your gut and assist digestion) shows that it's not so much "your body" that adapts but your entire internal population. So people who eat more sugar and starch will have more of a certain type of microbes versus people who eat lots of fruit and veggies and lean food. When you switch from one type of food to another it takes time for the population to adapt (less sugar happy bacterias, more veggie happy ones) and in the meantime your digestion is incomplete and you feel like crap. Look for "gut microbes and diet" and you'll find tons of research and articles. Cheers. (   )I'm sure phrak has the answer to this hot keyed by now but he must not be awake yet.

It's not that static stretching is bad it's just not as good as dynamic stretching. Static stretching is only bad on days you want to do 1 rep maxes.cool, that's helpful. thanks.Try YouTubing or Googling some of these exercises:
- Glute Bridge Raise
- SL Glute Raise
- SL Isometric Squeezes
- Glute Marches
- Clams (theraband)
- Cable Glute Squeeze (ankle brace)
- Back Extension  (GHR)
- Monsters (theraband)
- Scooters (theraband)
High repetitions (10-25). Most are performed at a slow and controlled tempo (404). You can superset these with exercises like squats, deadlifts and wherever else it may fit into your program. If things feel 'tight' look to undertaking a set of mobility exercises during your warm-up period, alongside trigger pointing and foam rolling when it comes to warming down or planned recovery sessions.Nut Butters are the way to go for calories and flavor. A combination of four things.

My wife and I started thinking about children, and I don't want my children to remember me as unhealthy or be influenced by my unhealthiness.

I want to live longer and be healthier for myself and my loved ones.

I want to be a good example so that my loved ones may be motivated to join me and feel comfortable coming to me for help or advice concerning fitness.

Just straight up wanting to look better.I had become fat, gained almost 100lbs over 4 years. I decided that I was going to get to a sub 10% body fat by the end of the year, so far I'm 3 months in and am starting to think about competing in powerlifting meets in a year or two and can't imagine not going to the gym.

Zoning out for 1-2 hours does wonders to avoid feeling stressed.I am spamming too now?Whoa were you just liberated from the Auschwitz concentration camp? Just kidding. Congrats on gaining the weight mate, I think if keep at it you'll make it!I honestly feel better cheating after my workouts. Need calories to build muscle, right? Break out the ice cream.I prefer to think of it as competitive drive rather than body dysmorphia.  I motivate myself with competition so the only acceptable number is the number that makes me the strongest amongst my freinds. I have a 415 bench, my buddy can bench 455 that makes my bench weak because I need to be the strongest.

Saying "the only person you should compair yourselves too is your past self" is all well and good for people who are getting started. However once you actually start taking pride in your lifts it should turn into a bit of competition. Otherwise you end up complacent. No problem man I used to do thirty sets of  biceps in one day then thirty sets of triceps later in the week. We all learn (hopefully) at some point. I like food
I didn't like being fatI thought you said 1 pound of oats at firstBased on this chart, I'm not dehydrated but I could use more water and so I will take to drinking more water. Thank you!
Dammit. Now I want teddy grahams. I had a dislocating knee cap (common in girls and younger women, just happens!) And my doctor told me to strengthen my quads. My boyfriend was doing SS at the time and had me compare his form to the form shown in videos so I had a bit of an interest and idea of what to do.

The gym class I was taking in Cegep at this time was just called 'Fitness' and we basically fucked around in the little gym they had. I noticed the squat rack and after a few classes mustered up the courage to go and use it.
Weight loss is simple. Calories in, Calories out. If you'eating 1200 and not losing weight, drop it down to 1100 or 1000. Try that on for size, re-evaluate, rinse, repeat. I lose weight just fine on birth control. Are you weighing your food with a food scale? Are you logging everything that goes into your mouth in gram amounts in the correct entry on myfitnesspal? Are you eating back exercise calories? Who uses MCT supplements? What's been your experience?Yup! Back exercises to pull the shoulders back, and pectoral stretches to loosen up a tight chest which is one of the key causes of shoulder rounding.

Youtube is your friend for demos!Solid advice, thanks!

I've always followed this kind of relax and stretch advice but don't ever really see progress (I'm sure it's because I just don't do it consistently). I was just hoping the way in my post would have been an alternative? But it does sound a bit reckless now that you mention it..Basically, more squats bro. Body weight to start. Work up from there.Yeah, you're right. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll do beginner routines and see how it goes for now. Thanks a bunch /u/Shitstarlord.1 cup milk

tastes like graham rackersTDEE is your Total Daily Energy Expenditure - so that is what you burn daily which includes all of your activity.  The BMR is the base metabolic rate which is what you would burn if you were awake but didn't move.

Rule of thumb is ~500 less than your TDEE to lose weight.   So go for 2000-2100 and see how you feel and how the weight loss goes.

Good luck! I actually just started taking creatine this morning (so it's not a habit). Just doing some research shows that creatine and coffee might not mix that well, but there seems to be no definitive answer as to what I should take it with. Do you have any idea what creatine is good to mix with?This was mine. Went from 135 while running a substantial amount every day in high school to 165 by the end of college - some muscle, some weight creep, but all fairly well managed because I biked a minimum of four miles a day, walked another 3-5, had a busboy job and was running around for 4-6 hour shifts multiple times a week, and went out dancing 2-3 nights per week for 4 hours at a time.

Then I got a real job. Cake, candy, disposable income for restaurants, and I ballooned to 210. Did Ideal protein, got down to 180. Gained it all back over the course of a year, adding 5 to the original total and leaving me at 215.

The final day at that weight was in August. I've lost 40 pounds since then, and while I'm stagnating at 175, I'm working out through it and will continue to push myself to lose the final 10 pounds. Then I will begin a clean bulk shooting for .5-1 pound per week until I look as fat as I did, and then another cut, and so on. I *will* get to 190 pounds at sub-10% body fat, even if it takes me decades, and no, I don't want any of the fucking fruit you brought for the meeting, I don't care that it's health(ier than the chips and dip you also brought).Just look up absolute motivation. Every single video they put is outstanding!Okay is there something bad about eating raw oats? I effing love raw oats and milk but is there anything bad about that, digestion wise? Maybe this question is better suited for monday...Yeah I just figure if you are doing splits, it is probably alright to switch days this week and then go back to normal next week. I am no expert though, so if someone more knowledgeable comes around, feel free to take their advice over mine. It just makes sense to me to just switch to a different body part today and then do chest on the next workout day since you can't get a full range of motion. Beast mode.

Without seeing your feet and from behind I can't be positive but the bar movement might suggest you're not staying on your heels.

Other than that, everything else looks solid. Again, seeing your feet, and a from the back shot to see how your knees track would give more info.Whenever I eat something "bad" I feel like everything I've done at the gym is ruined.Even though I know it's an act (please please just be an act) the whole gym-bro thing makes this video almost too obnoxious to watch. Which is a shame, because it's all good advice. And because he made me laugh. Yup. Progressing nicely since I deloaded. About 5-10lbs every other lift. Bulking atm, so that's helping me lift heavy. I thought I had slipped into depression on Monday... realized it was just the guilt from eating terribly over the weekend.  My wife and I started out a cheat day on Friday with shrimp and crab dip and a fried crawfish and fried shrimp poboy from a local cajun place.

We didn't have time to cheat the rest of the day and ended up having to skip the gym because we were hurting so badly and on the toilet so much.2 Scoop Whey Protein (~250 Cals)

1 Cup Whole oats (not the garbage packet stuff) (300 Cals)

1 Cup Blueberries (~100 cals)

2 Tbls Natty Peanut Butter (~200 cals)

5g Creatine

8-10 oz. unsweetened almond milk (~30 cals)

Some Ice cubes

Add water for any additional liquid needed

This ends up being about : 20g fat/80g carbs/70g protein and near 900 calories.

EDIT:  For maximum flavor, adding cinnamon makes for killer smoothies.  Makes them taste crazy sweet, and cinnamon is good for your body!  Like 1/2 Tbls takes your shakes to the next level, and keeps you from adding sweeteners.


Spite gainsI don't understand your complaint... They are shredded in this video, so obviously something worked diet-wiseIt would be better than what you are doing now, however the creator states in at link you sent:   This is an intermediate routine , if you are a beginner, which you are, then he advises starting strength or Lyle mcdonalds general bulking. Why do you want to workout every day? Your rest days are extremely important. Those are the days your body is working to repair your torn muscles. So, yes that would be better than your routine now, but , the author explicitly states that it's not optimal for someone like you. If you really can't stand not working out every day then go ahead on the ppl. I would advise three days a week with some LISS OR HIIT cardio on your rest days. Just take 5 scoops every 4th day.Nice, I was looking at that one too. Do you think it might be good mixed with real coffee(that is cold)?I would avoid using a protein powder with creatine in it. The reason being is that protein content on a label is almost always determined by measuring nitrogen content and dividing it by a conversion factor. Any nitrogen containing compound is, therefore, counted as protein.

I believe creatine is 32% nitrogen, and the conversion factor for dairy protein assumes a nitrogen level of 16%. So if there is 5g of creatine in your powder per scoop, it is being counted as 10g on the label unless a specific amino acid analysis from a third party is listed separately (very rare in the supplement industry. I always lifted weights due to football but I never cared about nutrition. I ate whatever and thought I would be good. After I tore me ACL 2 years  and gained about 20 lbs I knew I needed to change. Never was happy with my appearance. Now I'm stronger then what I was playing football and I feel a lot better.

1) Not doing enough research

2) Not watching your diet

If I'd followed these 2 principles I wouldn't have wasted 15 years trying out different workouts but going nowhere. Once I applied them, things fell into place.Right on man well that is what it's all about finding what works best for yourself. If you've been doing it for 3 years I can't argue with that so thanks for the infoHow far have you progressed up until now? What are your goals? What are some other measures you've been keeping track of? (sleep, nutrition etc). That will determine which routine is best for you.

There will be plenty of resources with routines after you can identify what your goals specifically are (S.M.A.R.T terms).

Ok, I was just checking to see if perhaps getting the nutrients in one moment was more effective somehow, but that sounds great.Doctor told you to rest, so just rest.&gt; I don't worry, but the issue then is I don't have accurate calorie counts for that week and so I can't use it for re-calculating my TDEE. I'd need 3 weeks of tracking

mate thats called worrying. did you totally pig out at the bbq? eat a little less this week. did you have a normal feeling meal with maybe a little extra? no big deal.That's definitely normal. I gave up soda and fast foods and stuff like that a few years ago. After a year of not consuming any sort of soda or fast food, we moved across the country. Two consecutive days in a car with my only food option being fast food, I decided to splurge. I spent the rest of that trip curled up in the backseat nursing awful cramps and bloat and stomach pain. Keep eating, bro! 1.) I'm going to be living in an apartment on my campus without a meal plan, so we'll have full kitchen amenities without a grill. I'll probably just fry it over the hot top, thanks for the advice. I know I'll be working on my cooking skills over summer haha.

2.) Alright. I'll continue with the current meal plan for a bit (I've recently just switched to this) and then try it with a lunch instead of snacks. I'll see what works best, but over the week I've been doing this I've felt full, which is the first time since I've started dieting.I do all three these exercises on 4x8. I'm willing to experiment with other things though.Important to note is not to get accusatory, the trainer has reasoning behind these methods. But the "Learn as much as you can" aspect is very important.I just take it dry.Nothing wrong with some competition Peanut butter and graham crackers. Though, it's only good with milk.To add on to this, something that helps me when squatting is to imagine the typical footprint of a person with a good arch, like this: http://www.texasfootdoctor.org/images/footprint(1).jpg

And concentrate on those parts of your feet contacting the ground. Dig those outer edges of the feet into the ground and push.Girls got me there and body dysmorphia kept me there

Yeah, you just keep running. In general you can find areas with less crevasses even in colder places. Sometimes they clear the sidewalk. In general the further you are from a lake the less frozen precipitation gets dumped on the ground.Oh hey! I used to run right past that on my way to the dog park!  Churches don't usually do much for me, but man that building is breathtaking in person.Is the pace 7:30 or 7.3?

If it's 7.3, you're looking at MPH, which would be around 25 minutes per 3 miles.OP, in surprised you're getting so much skepticism and negativity on this. The resulting weight loss from your new eating habits will go very far. Dropping 10 pounds makes a big difference.

Others are telling you that you'll never PR the half after coming off of an injury. Well, I did, and I smashed my prior half PR by over 10 minutes with a prior PR very close to yours. I then went on to PR a marathon less than 2 months later. I credit losing weight for both because my training sure as hell wasn't there. (Do train though if you can.)So, nice.... Isn't running in the snow a different work out too. Your feet kind of slip out from behind you when you are pulling off  from your strike, you have to be conscious of ice under the snow. It is quiet and there are not a lot of people around. GOOD TIMES!
P.S. nice picBeing from Chicago, you just learn to run in the snow. It's tricky, I know people who have really wrecked themselves on icy patches.I'm trying to make the same decision as above. I'm leaning towards the M400 but the lack of vibration is what is holding me back from being 100% on board. I'm working on intervals at the momenet (b210k). I tend to listen to music while running and I'm worried that I won't be able to hear the intervals.
Can you comment on how easy it is to hear intervals etc. whilst out running?

I don't know where you're getting the idea that eating is running magic. I eat a lot of pizza, drink too much beer, and I'm a *lot* faster than you are because I run 50-60 miles per week. Running volume will trump diet every time.

I think you're wildly underestimating the difference between 1:47 and 1:30.  You have similar PRs, he's been running and you haven't. He's going to beat you easily and trying to stay with him will have negative consequences.  8km is nothing compared to 42. You're in for one hell of a ride if you think you can win either of the races.I just went through this. I've been running in one pair of Mizuno Wave Inspire but I need to rotate in another shoes because I'm running a lot. I used to wear Brooks Adrenaline and then went to the Wave Inspire which is less support. I got a pair of Brooks Ravenna 6 in January which is supposed to be comparable to wave inspire with some extra cushioning. They felt great jogging around the store but every second I ran in them or drove to and from my run, I was uncomfortable. I ran 35 miles in them forcing myself to wear them for all my short runs and the pain got worse and I found myself underpronating and running on the sides of my feet. was able to return them and get another pair of Mizuno Wave Inspire.I don't have any advice about your tendinitis...but I definitely agree with that last sentiment. My running partner got diagnosed with a stress fracture at the same time that I got diagnosed with ITBS. She's back to running (and has been for awhile), and I'm still going to PT and barely running at all. It's frustrating...just wanted to sympathize! I hope your injury doesn't linger much longer. Blue running shoes are definitely faster than other colours, though. Fact.Run every day until the race.Glitches usually due to dodgy GPS points which appear like stops in the data. You can email Strava support about things like this, they often they have useful insight.SIt back and enjoy this barefooted guy showing how it's done. It's kind of hypnotic:
[Principles of Natural Running with Dr. Mark Cucuzzella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo)This might be bullshit pseudoscience, but I beleive a good rolling session can cause a kind of tiny benign injury which promotes healing, blood flow, cell repair etc.Well, your not completely wrong. Volume over a total week is very important, but if you go out and do three 8 mile runs over the course of the week you get more benefits than if you did twenty-four 1 mile runs over the course of the week. And running four 10ks a week really only totals up to 40k a week, which is really not enough for any ultra. You expect to be able to cover more than the distance you usually run over the course of a whole week in less than 24 hours? Just because I can go out and run exactly 26.2 miles in a week doesn't mean I can go out and bust out a marathon.ITBs.... foam roll!!!!!! The longer you leave it the worse it getsNew owner of a Polar M400! Love it so far, no problems with the software or syncing - initially it wouldn't sync with my mobile, but restarting seemed to fix it. I haven't used GC, so I can't compare. I'm not sure if Garmin 15 has the activity and sleep tracker like the M400 has? Before I chose the Polar I didn't think much of those features, but now I have it, I like it lots!I'm the same exact way, I'll be running and stop to get my heart rate under control getting a little mad at myself, then I'll look at the mileage and just remember that 8 months ago I had problems running for a minute straight doing C25K.

I'll always remember that video Shay Carl put out and he says "the pain of staying heavy is worse then the pain of change""pets must be delicious"So you have 10-14 weeks to train for a marathon, coming off of injury, and also have to run a PR half marathon at a time where you should either be peaking mileage or tapering.

How can we bet on your friend?

What happens if you win the half marathon but don't run the full marathon?  If this allows you to push or get out of the bet, this would be the best choice.You just described the best part of running. What is with all the sweet pictures in this sub, lately?! Super jealous, not only of the view but the no snow too. How fast are you completing the marathons? I'm following a sort of modified Hansons' plan, but my first marathon I completed in a bit more than 4 hours. I feel like if I don't do those longer runs, then on race day I'll just fall apart, since I'm not as fast and thus need more time on my feet.I ran my first marathon at age 25, and my second about 5 months later at 26. I didn't enjoy training for my second, at all. I ran my third seven years later. It was OK, but I had a lot going on in my life, raising kids and all. I waited 5 more years to run my fourth. That was fall of 2001. I've run over thirty since then.

There's nothing that says you have to run marathons at all to be a real runner. There's also nothing that says that just because you're not enjoying them right now, you won't enjoy them when the time is right.I've gotten this pain with my tendinitis by mine was more shin. I would buy stretch bands and do some ankle exercises. Your ankles could just be weak and need to be strengthened. I've basically been eating 60-70% fresh vegetables/fruits and then 30-40% fish/turkey. I'm not talking about silly fads and nonsense diet choices. I know what healthy food is and I know how my body react to certain types of food. It has nothing to do with some diet.  Actually my 1.47 min time was from when I wasn't running on a regular basis. I believe with the right training, I could get under 1.30. Even with only 2 months of training. I know it will be very difficult, I am not going to deny that. I am not looking for people to tell me I cannot do it. I am looking for people who can help me do it ;)

I also would like to point out, that I've been running A LOT my entire life. For the past 2 years prior to the injury. I would run about 12 km every day, 5 days a week. It feels natural to me, and despite the 4 months break. I felt amazing running the 8 km, both days. I did it in a fast pace, without getting tired or exhausted. The injury itself was not running related. I had an accident a while ago where I cracked my ribs really badly. I also would like to point out that my friend is a smoker and he's not some super athlete. He's a very average type og guy who has been training for 6 months for the race.Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!Being in a warmer climate, would this be something that you would still run through?  Are their other places you can run or would you be stuck on the good old treadmill or indoor track?Eating like a health freak will do nothing for your running compared to running consistently- it's pretty much a non-factor when compared to not running for four months.

Find a half-marathon training plan that you can stick to and start following it. Jack Daniels' Running Formula is a good bet. I looked this up before because I suffer from bad sinus infections and it takes 2 weeks to START losing what you gained. You'll be good! You're supposed to take a little time off before running a marathon anyways. Yes my teammates' parents always bring oranges to races and I always used to eat them but it makes my stomach feel like it's on fire for hours I took a running form class and during it my shins would kill me! I felt like they would snap in half. Turns out I was crossing my arms across my chest when running. They need to not do that cuz it causes your legs to swing out. They need to be at a 90 degree angle pumping straight. I run long distance on a team and usually after a race, whether I did good or bad I'll started crying. If I did good I start crying. If I did bad I start crying. Everybody always thinks I'm hurt but nope. Just having a momentI've never run a marathon, but do like runs in the 20+ mile distance. I run for reasons mostly for me and my well being. The longest race I've ever done was a 10k years back. All the people, and having to stand around waiting for a start just don't do it for me. I like to put my shoes on, and go run.

If you don't want to do it, see if you can transfer the registration... and then just go out and run for fun! I live in the US and ran a half in Mexico (Guadalajara) last spring and I almost did a 10k in Brazil (Campinas) but my trip was rescheduled.  I've started looking for racing opportunities whenever I plan a business trip or vacation.  It was a beautiful sky in the southeastern US last night.  Frigid, clear air and the planetary alignment was brilliant.  I really enjoyed showing &amp; telling to my kids. :)It would scare me for a different reason.  The first time I ever saw a coyote (camping in Wyoming) I was expecting something much closer to fox-size than wolf-size.  I thought it was a wolf!I'm in quincy at the moment and yesterday is the first time
I've seen sidewalks near my home since all this snow started. I've been hitting the treadmill There is no law that says you have to run a marathon. You're not being paid to do it. It's supposed to be fun. If your first marathon wasn't fun, or you just like to file it under "been there, done that", then just do that. Work for whatever you enjoy the most.

Personally, I like long runs, but I'm not tackling a marathon (yet), simply because if I were, I'd want to do it right, and I can't afford to reserve this much time for running. So I stick with half marathons and moderately long trail races, and that's fine. There's also a fat chance that instead of a road marathon, I might just focus more on trails, and go for a 50k instead - the atmosphere at trail races is far more compelling to me than the stampedes that are large road races, and while asphalt is great for running fast, I prefer more diverse terrain for longer runs.So you've been inactive due to injury for 4 months, and you want to beat your pr that (I guess) was set when you were training with more consistency, and you have only 2 months to train.

Sounds hard, and I doubt eating like a health freak makes a difference, but, can you elaborate on that? most of the time that just means buying into silly fads and nonsene diet choices.Well, I'm currently "working my way up", having done a few 5k's, 10k's, a 10-miler, and a 20k trail, and currently training for a half - but the thought behind this isn't so much a checklist, more like "let's see how long I can keep doing this while still having fun". Haven't reached that point yet, and the 20k was by far the most enjoyable race I've done.&gt; Our society is obsessed with the extreme.

Not even that. More like, obsessed with sheepish consensus and simple black-and-white thinking. We have at some point agreed that a marathon is the longest reasonable racing distance; thus, racing anything longer than a marathon is "irresponsible/stupid/crazy/insane", and racing anything shorter is kind of "meh". "Marathon" is synonymous with "crazy long but within reason", by virtue of the sheer masses of people who run one year in year out.

Never mind that every mildly fit average joe can "run" a 7-hour marathon without much training, and that, say, a sub-17 5k is practically impossible for most people.Seems to be somewhat common - my take is that it's either to do with muscles coming loose and feeding back into the mind, unveiling previously suppressed / latent feelings; or it's a matter of hormones - it's not a secret that endurance exercise releases a bunch of hormones, probably something evolutionary like tricking you into enjoying a strenuous activity like running.That sounds reasonable. Curious as to what that amount is, but I'd expect the required amount for running to not be awfully large.Op asked a question about elites, he didn't refer to himself as elite anywhere.The women's XC is always shorter in the UK. The women from my club would prefer the same distance but it's always trotted out that not as many would participate if it was longer, more strain on the body etc. Just waiting for someone to tell me their ovaries will fall out.I'm a new runner and never realized how much shoes made a difference until I got a new pair and cut 3 minutes off my 5k time!
New runners are constantly looking for information on what shoes to buy, I think this is a great article/lesson on the subjectRunner's high, it's weird. Got it a few times but don't really get it any more.Lean proteins, mostly chicken and fish.  The fewer the legs, the better is what I was taught.I can't imagine how an elite would even be able to hide an injury. It would surely show in his/her performance  Yes.  I need to decrease my mpw in order to lose weight.  I can easily gain weight while running 60 mpw.I think a lot of people mistakenly look at race distances as a sort of a checklist. "First I did a 5K, then a 10K, then a half, a full and one day I hope to run an ultra." without really experiencing *racing* the shorter distances as best as they can. They're missing out IMO. That said, I'm still doing a stupid marathon in October. A GPS may be overkill if you are only interesting in a HRM.New pr of 10:36 in the 3200The cheap heart rate monitors do not include a GPS.  Many of us, including me, do not consider a GPS necessary.Awesome view. This snow is a bounty that has turned paved roads into cross country courses with ice and snow barriers, as well as the occasional water pit.This is when you and a buddy pretend you're x-wings and tie fighters and pretend that you're on some Hoth-Death Star Hybrid. During my half marathon this past fall, I started getting choked up at the people coming out to cheer us on like eight miles in. I had longer long runs during training and it didn't happen, but who knows. Running is strange sometimes.indeed. often heel strike is misinterpreted as well. there are a lot of runners who 'heel graze' (or touch) and actually do end up landing mid-foot, not that there is something wrong with heel striking anyhow Wow such texture , many snow , such running
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v2tA7fzugxMAs I mentioned in my other comment, focus on cadence first. The best advice I read said forget trying to fix your foot strike, fix your cadence first and everything else will naturally improve. When  you increase cadence it will feel like more effort initially, you're moving your legs a lot more. However, your stride will shorten and you will stop over extending your leg and prevent heel striking. Also focus on "the lean". Google it if you need some guidance or examples. You want to shift your body weight forward but keep your chest out and stay tall. This, coupled with a quick cadence and short stride, will lead you to land with your foot under your center of gravity with a mid- to fore-foot strike. It will work your calves a lot more as well. Just take it slow and easy while you adjust.

Personally, I worked using a very slight 0.5% incline with a slow pace on a treadmill while I trained. The incline will help prevent heel strike while you are still learning and observing how to move. Also I switched to Kinvara's long ago, the small heel-toe drop helps. Good luck! There are plenty of YouTube videos that can really help. Also I would read the running form guides on fellrnr.comGood ideayou can set the run as a race and it will only record elapsed time.Sexiest landscape ever!!Most of the studies into static stretching are useless because they are badly designed.Most of the research into stretching is useless because they are looking for the wrong thing.

There exists an optimal amount of flexibility.  Too much or too little flexibility is bad.  There does exist some research into the optimal amount of flexibility.  same thing in toronto... its just too dangerous with the weather, not because its slippery for running but because people forget how to drive. i've had too many close calls with cars skidding from just trying to run lightsI run for an ultra but dont plan to do much longer runs than 10km. My thoughts are that its the volume that counts. So now im doing two 10km a week. Later i will do 4. I also run the 10km runs really slow like if it was race day.Did you do the ascent or the marathon? Honestly, the trip up the mountain doesn't worry me as much as the trip back down. That's why the marathon is so daunting. I just don't think my knees could handle all that downhill.That's good news. The altitude is still going to be rough, but not as bad as if you trained at sea level. Even if you live really high up (Leadville, for example), it's going to be hard at 14k.

I live in COS but I've never run the ascent. Best of luck. You're tougher than me, for sure.Fucking hell...that's terrible. I've had drivers swerve at me before, but both times I got a few words in and didn't get yelled at for it. That sounds nerve racking. I live in VT and we actually passed a law maybe 2 years ago that drivers have to give a reasonable amount of room to all pedestrians and they can be hit with a fine if they don't. Hard to enforce, but still nice to know I have some standing if some jerk decides to pull over and lay into me. Stay safe out there.You've been sitting outside taking pictures of other people running?My dad gave me one of these and I've had it in my glove box for years. I might actually use it if it had a ponytail hole.If you purposefully smash someone's window or something sure, but if I happen to be fiddling my keys and you hit the arm with the keys in them? You can't get mad at someone for damaging your car when you hit them.

I'm not saying like reach out and gouge someone's ride, I'm an asshole, but not 100% a dick
5Ks are my jam. Everyone's different. I understand elapsed time. But I never stopped running. I was in a suburban area and garmin connect correctly got the time and distance. But Strava ignored about 2 minutes of time and posted me as stopped with the same data. Usually the aid stations with Gatorade mix it wayyyyy to sweet which wrecks my stomach. I drink water and on occasion a sip of Gatorade. I do take Hammer Nutrition Endurolytes, they are in pill. Non-race long runs I bring Hammer Heed with me for electrolytes. I live in Florida &amp; the beach is nice. But I would love a trail run through there.Ran my first Marathon in Chicago in 2013. After I finished and grabbed my medal, I started to cry. I called my mom to tell her I finished &amp; was so overwhelmed.

Ran a half marathon last weekend and PR'ed (1:45) I was tired at the finished. When I crossed I was emotional for making my goal and pushing myself. Feels good man...+1. From experience, I'd say go with a relatively inexpensive Garmin (maybe the Forerunner 15 -- a good running watch for a newcomer), the heart rate monitors that come with the watches are very good, and you get some fun running metrics in the watch as well.That would scare the shit out of me. I probably wouldn't have minded ever running into those things, but the Navajo culture has pretty pretty much drilled it into me that something horrible will happen.This is one thing I didn't expect about running. I hate being cold, but love running in it.  Even 20 degrees is warm enough for me to pull of the gloves after a bit of a warmup.  +1. Nothing wrong with Strava, just the numbers off of which it calculates your pace.The future is now! What a time to be alive!How do you keep your feet dry?  The hardest part for me is the ice cold water in my shoes. Most of the time it's from weak hips and core muscles, not tight ones. Weak hip muslces are usually the main culprit of the problem.

Was just pointing out, if you want to publish an article please have your facts right. a nice goal for me would be to try for sub elite... but if these injuries continue... f*&amp;k it

It also depends on the race.. for san fran I am sub elite..

http://www.thesfmarathon.com/elite-and-sub-seeded-athletes/that's true, but a lot of the time knee pain is a direct result of tight/weak hips. when the hips aren't working as they should, the knee sometimes gets overworked from trying to compensate I love my 220. It gets the satellites in seconds, the charging clip doesn't suck, it has actual physical buttons, and it's not the size of a dinner plate. responding through pmAlso out running in NH, but where are you? Merrimack has way more snow than that! I was a big fan of the Pegasus a while back, but I've been riding the design changes in the 3 Free line for a few years now, and haven't touched the Pegasuses (Pegasi?) since.are you referring to the difference between the elapsed time and moving time? i think this is intended for people whose runs (or, more likely, rides) include a lot of stop lights. it does feel like cheating. you can turn it off in settings.The orange. Orange juice (as well as dairy and heavy foods) is a known problem for runners. The acidity of it (and thus, of an orange) causes it to take longer to digest and can lead to an upset or nauseous stomach. How do I know this? I once ate toast and OJ before a 5k and sprinted the finish only to vomit in a trash can on the side.Sadly most of the issues with cars have happened during bright daylight with me wearing neon green/yellow.  :(  The bright light might be a good idea on the snowmobile trails though..Especially at night.  I'll check it out.  I'm sure there are some head lamps for runners with pretty high lumens.I'm not sure why OP isn't responding- maybe he can only talk to people who reach out to him first. I can confirm- OP works for a legit shoe company, and the offer is legitimate too. Got my prototypes today. I will try the warm water strategy next time! Thanks!So yea--Here is the real fun part about the laws.  What I left out was that I slapped the window of the minivan as it went by.  I was also running with a friend who is a police officer and I was told that if the mini van driver wanted she could have pressed charges for assault on personal property( dont remember the exact wording but that's the basic idea) .  So - To clarify the awesome laws in NH.  You can come within inches of someone on the road at 35 mph but don't you dare reach out and make contact with the car because you will get arrested. Thanks for the advice!I definitely do this too. I've always assumed it has to do with some combination of endorphins and exhaustion. If I run more than 10 or 11 miles,  chances are I am going to tear up a little towards the end. I'll just add that one of my favorite things about a half or 10-miler race day is getting a big glass of orange juice and breakfast with my friends after. Post a full+ I just want an ice bath, an Advil, and a nap.The other day, my friend who is not a runner asked me what shoes he should wear to make him run faster. Obviously, he was joking. And to his surprise, I had an answer.

It's the shoe that aligns your feet so that they are running straight. The shoe that allows you to push off your toes and balls of your feet at the appropriate angle. The insole that supports your arch the way it needs to be.  The shoe with the toe box large enough for your feet to be comfortable. And a few other things.

Those are the shoes that will make you run faster. And that she was different for you, and for me, and for most everyoneHey do you fashion any metal tracks on your shoes?lol did you just try to call yourself elite? lololololololololololI like to run marathons, but I don't like the 2+ hour training runs, either. That's why I'm a fan of the Hansons' Marathon Method. There's never a run more than 2 hours.

The last two marathons I've run haven't involved a training run longer than 2 hours.I run to be happy. Ultimately, running keeps me healthy. And being healthy makes me happy.

In addition to that, there's the standard things. Being able to see great places, meet great people, eat whatever you want! I consider it an honor to have discovered it and realize what it can do for you. It's definitely become a part of me as wellMaybe just a bigger light? Cars have stopped trying to kill me on my bike since I graduated to 775 lumens. (Actually 1550, but I run it on medium.) 3xU2 was $160 from deepest China &amp; capable of 2/6/12 hour runtime.

Not 100% sure how it would work for a runner, because it's a pretty hefty light head, but there's plenty of others out there too, depending what you're willing to spend.

http://reviews.mtbr.com/2015-lights-shootout
I'm right there with you, &amp; I haven't run a single marathon. They're just not for everyone. I put in the mileage for one, but I'm just not interested. 27 races last year, 24 the year before that, somewhere in the twenties this year also.

Nope.Rock on. Congratulations on your progress. Glad to hear I'm not the only one wearing their heart on a singlet strap.I think a big part of this can be tied to the old adage that "variety is the spice of life".

Marathon training is essentially just a long grind. It's an endurance trial, and the training can sometimes be pretty monotonous. Sure, you've got tempos, progressions, fartleks, etc. But, eh. A bunch of Saturdays in a row at 18-20 can wear, no matter how you slice it. It's pretty easy to get sick of after a while, in my opinion.

I'm about eight weeks out for my third annual "big race", and I'm already looking forward to a summer of nothing but halves and shorter, lots of heavy weight lifting, bike riding, and a jump back into yoga. Spreading out all those activities is so much more appealing than just logging miles every day.I've lost 55 lbs (so far), after being obese for most of my life.  I don't get really emotional about my weightloss... except when I'm running. I feel like a dork, but all of a sudden I get overwhelmed about being *able to run*. Like *"I'm doing this. I'm really doing this!"* And I'll well up with big fat stupid tears.

A little over a year ago, I couldn't even walk across the grocery store without getting winded and having chest pains. I'd love to have a pool. It's above 70 most of the year here. I do have a tub, but I am short and it's a pain to clean it out and fill it.Thanks Strava for the extra 30sec/mile. But I would rather it be accurate.

Anyone else experiencing this? I don't have enough room to sit in the shower. It's so tiny. And I'm too tired and lazy to fill the bath.Does running a 2:54 marathon make someone a sub-elite?There are some people who never enter any races at all.  If you are a runner it is not a requirement that you run races.Hell, if it's not your thing, it's not your thing! Half marathons get a bad rap as a casual long distance kind of run, you still have to be a hell of a runner to go and compete for wins at that distance. Nothing in the world says you always have to striving for longer and longer distances to be a Real Runner ^TM but that's unfortunately how a lot of people count progress.&gt; Are there others here that feel similarly?

Yes

&gt; Why didn't I get hooked?

Because external validation ("look I can run a marathon") is a shitty reason to train day in and day out for 16-18 weeks.

Marathons are an extreme distance.  By (retrograde) definition, essentially.  It's something that very few people are truly suited for.

Personally I think it's a shame that the marathon is considered such a compelling distance by our society, and that "marathon runners" are considered (at least, by normals) superior to other runners.  In reality, there's just as much (or as little) achievement and personal satisfaction to be obtained at the shorter distances.  But most folks don't really see that.  They just see longer = better.  Our society is obsessed with the extreme.

But I don't run for other people, and I don't give a fuck about extrinsic validation or saying "look I can run a marathon!".  I highly recommend not focusing your efforts on impressing others, either in running or with life in general.Y'know, maybe the time just isn't right.  It sounds like you have other stuff you want to do with your life right now, and that is honestly okay.  Not running a second marathon now/this year/whatever doesn't mean you'll never want to do it again.Hell ya. Maybe even carry a center punch if it's that bad in your area. "Oh, you want to clip me? Oops your window popped"I didn't get to run the full this year due to the Army. It broke my streak of 3 consecutive years doing the full. I still did the half but it is these profiles that make me anxious to grab some scalps, when I run Austin in 2016!Thanks, I'll definitely give it a try.
I agree, focusing on form diverts my attention and I feel like I'm less involved during the run.I've been thinking of doing a really short barefoot run (like a mile or something) and trying to see what the difference is. I think a big problem is I tend to step out in front of my body as opposed to landing on my foot.Sweet. Thank you!Roger that. Thanks!People like what they like. Some like marathons. Some don't. Find what you like and run the hell out of it.I started doing this naturally and running more with my calves and it helped immensely.That's what it takes to get to the start of Hill #1.Ok, enemy.Don't call me friend, pal.I agree, solid framing and food formatting. Plus breakdown per-mile are awesome. This is the standard. 10/10 would read again.
I did the ascent for the first time in 2012.  I'd run a handful of halfs, but that was it. I live in the flatish midwest. I ran the full marathon in 2013 and 2014, and I'll run it again this year (I may do the double).

I can't speak highly enough of the race. It's absolutely phenomenal, well run, and the other runners are always great. It's a son of a bitch, but I love doing it.

The first year, I was a 1:50 half guy. I used the Hal Higdon beginner marathon plan to train for it, and I finished in around 3:55. The key is to just keep moving. if the funding is there I would like to do this event this yearIf it's a hard enough workout, I almost always end up sitting in the shower. No shame there, I just let the water wash away my pain for a few minutes.I transitioned slowly, practicing in slow motion. I also changed to flat shoes for a while, which meant landing on the heels was quite unpleasant - that was based on ' barefoot ' running principles. Similar are chi and POSE running. Again,  that's what worked for me, it might be something else for you but it's worth experimenting a bit. Good luck. Marathons aren't for everyone. No shame in that!

I'm a one-and-done marathon guy (for now anyway). Half marathons are my bread and butter.This is why I think a hot tub is a decent investment for a runner

I also once got overheated in the middle of summer while running, I jumped into my sister's small swimming pool for kids - best feeling in the world, I could feel the heat leaving my body so fast, and it felt good instead of how it feels normally "ah im getting cold!"How does one actually implement this, though? I've seen the video that gets posted and tried it, but when I focus on form during a run, I feel like I exert myself and end up hurting myself.Yeah, that happens if you run really really hard. No big deal, just barf it up and carry on. But only if you have been running short times. If longer than 20 miles or so, time to get some electrolytes and fluids into you.One that I have often is, "That felt so easy. Why did I feel like I was struggling?"

Post-run hormones need to kick in sooner.Is this a Nike fest?

Glad it worked for *you* friend.This is incredibly insightful and answers many of the questions I had, and is one of the best running videos I've seen. Many thanks. Cramping is a very individual issue and the evidence linking it to electrolytes is shaky at best. For some people it seems to be the very most important thing. For others, like me, it doesn't seem to matter one single bit.

I do no sodium or potassium supplementing. I rarely add any salt to anything. I dilute my sports drink to 1/3 strength if I drink it. The last time I had a cramp while running was 1988 at mile 17 in a marathon that I hadn't trained for.

Other people get cramps just at the thought of skipping their morning banana.You went to hard.This looks like fun, thanks, I'll give it a try (when I'm over this darn cold). I'm signed up for Boston again this year, and will probably be my last time.I'm sure someone else will have something to talk about with your red nike.

But glad that they worked for you.&gt; (magical shoe does not exist)

Nike Pegasus 29.

Checkmate.
If your only real concern is calorie burn, just call it 100 calories a mile. Or find an estimator online and punch in your weight to get a number. Even calorie numbers with a HR monitor are just estimates.Ok sure, tell that to my red nike racing shoes.

E: /sIf only there was some way to get ahold of some water somehow while in the shower. Always after a marathon. Always.Hmm, I had this happen during a run, half an hour after a meal, maybe longer, I actually stopped my running app, moved to the side of the road, puked and continued my run after that.

Don't eat things that are hard to digest before running, I would guess ;)How long have you been rolling? The first ~week will be rough. After that the tenderness should lessen.Done it in 2011. I live in Michigan at ~600' elevation. It was brutal above the tree line. The problem was, predictably, the elevation. I knew that I couldn't prepare for the elevation so I decided to overdo the hill training and endurance training to try to make up for it. It didn't make up for it at all.

Still worth it.Seriously. Sheesh.I'll give it a shot. Thanks guys!I'll give it a shot. Thanks guys!Damn dude. That choked me up a little.All training programs are general guidelines; they do not have to be strictly adhered to. You need to get your body trained to cope with the effort required to complete a marathon injury free and it's equally important to get your head and emotions into gear.
As long as you can run 75% of the marathon distance 2 weeks prior to the event you'll be able to complete the full distance on the day surrounded by all the good vibes and energy. Keep doing minimal medium to easy training up to 4 days before the event then make sure your body is fully rested. On the day you'll be able to give it all you've got like the well trained runner and not the over-trained fatigued runner.
You could check out http://www.irunningtips.com/running-tips-running-programs-training-for-runners/training-program-generic-marathon-26-2-miles-training-schedule/awesome!!Use one of higdon plans when you can run 15 miles a week comfortably.

For example. A 5k on mon,tues thurs and 5 miles on sunday. That would be a good base to start a higdon novice plan. You have to do some cross training. If you are only going to run four days a week you should work on your core the other two and rest one. Bike ride, swim etc etc. Mostly for redundancy. If one fails would you want to tell a thousand runners their time wasn't recorded? I have that one and it is pretty cool. Nice little gadget. Polar has some inexpensive ones. Very conveniently I live in Pembroke. So thanks! :DThe plan does address this.

Chapter 5 to be specific.

Pages 108-110 to be exact.

Happy running!don't know why this got downvoted. I think the article is good. Maybe people are afraid of the truth? (magical shoe does not exist)Nice jacket. What is it (brand, model, etc.)?

Pros? Cons? Where'd you get it?That's massholes for you... I've been running on a 2 mile stretch of road that has a bike lane. Anywhere else, and I'm a target for drivers apparently. I think you're focusing too much on foot and footstrike.

More often than not, foot and footstrike patterns is "off" because of the posture, not the other way around.

I'd start focusing more on posture and core strengh/stability. And avoiding overstriding (cadence increase is a good tool for that).Ever actually do it? Seems like something that could get you in hot water.Well, are you going to put him on a leash or just let him run around? The sign?Honestly, I haven't been. After a couple miles, I don't really notice the cold anymore. With things over my face, I feel like I can't breathe easily enough. You type and coherently express your thoughts remarkably well for someone's pet.Nothing.Assuming it isn't more serious than muscle tightness (which it doesn't sound like, since you feel fine when running), don't go gentle with the foam roller. Dig deep and slow up and down your calves, it should hurt; I usually put my foam roller under one leg and the other leg on top of the leg that's being foam rolled (and cry).

The purpose of foam rolling/deep tissue massage is to get blood flowing, which helps tightness. The first few times I did it, my calves didn't feel much better and did actually feel a bit worse, but soon enough the tightness almost disappeared. Do it every day, whether you run or not, and that should definitely help, again assuming there's not something more serious causing pain.We've got those in my neighborhood. It makes me worried sometimes when I go out for a run before sunrise.&gt; Abiquiu

Red Rock Park Las VegasCool, I'll get my tissues.Abiquiu?I do a piece of fruit, and vary it daily to keep getting different nutrients in me, right after the run. Do some yoga, take a shower. Protein shake with 1.25 serving of soy milk and 1/2 protein powder. Wait another hour or two, hummus(perfect protein!) with two big bags of veggies to just graze for the next hour or so. Then my reward: turkey avocado sandwich with red cabbage and spring greens and a spinach salad(soy nuts, tomatoes, peppers, carrots, lite poppyseed dressing). I switch the sandwich for beans and rice with some salsa to keep things fresh. Two random pieces of fruit and some almonds tossed in these during the day when I get super munchie.
Tl; dr: eat low salt, low/good fat, high protein foods all day. Dude, just drink the shower water. :DMe too! From NH, transplanted to ATL - it's amazing how fast your body adjusts to warmer weather... In New England, I wouldn't sneeze at 20 degrees, but I woke up this morning and threw a fit because it was TOO COLD TO RUN.

I did end up waiting until it was in the 30's to go, and I did a nice long run... but I comfort myself that I never would have run in temps above 80 in NH, and now I do that all the time. You adapt to your climate - I wish I could be good at BOTH though!Yes, the Kentucky group always has runners in my local races (Birmingham, AL).  I first noticed the trend when all the top finishers were all from the same podunk mountain town.  It's sort of a "thing" here, because we have an Olympic training facility, and some fairly serious elite athletes who get edged out.  One of the local race organizers started doing a separate place group for local runners vs. out-of-towners.  I've also seen notices that say "if you intend to run for prize money, you must contact the race director to sign our financial agreement" and I just KNOW it's the exploitation thing they are trying to cut down on.

Edit:  someone else mentioned this downthread, but here's the club and they are super sketchy http://lmeliterun.ts9.ru/I'm usually too dumb at that point to think anything but "That water feels great on my legs. I wish I could sit for this."Not me, but my brother has twice and says it's definitely one to add to your bucket list. Good luck! Not all running increases cravings.
July 2014, I was 106kg when I started running. It was not easy at first cos my weight couldn't change for like 6weeks, but I was feeling healthier (I ran average of 7km, 3-times a week). I'm always hungry after each runs.
My run then was 1.5km (12mins) running with about 3 minutes walk.

I stopped taking soda &amp; dairy milk in Sept 2014, then I was been able to do 1km (6mins to 7mins) and 10km average in each workout, 2 to 3-times a week. I started feeling less hungry unlike before... by end of November ... I have lost 11kg... I weight 95kg.

Since, November 2014 till January 2015, despite running twice weekly (8km to 10km average) resting 3mins every 2.5km, No craving or hunger was noticed tho, my weight did not changed, but my waist line dropped from 39inch to 35inch...My sexual life improved greatly.  I was extremely happy with myself, but confused with scale still showing me 95kg (I tried different scales)

I had ankle injury Mid-Jan 2015, so I couldn't run for 2-weeks, I resumed running in early Feb, 2015, but with an incredible strength ... I was about to run 5km to 8km NON-STOP... No hunger or cravings,  I dropped 2kg to my surprise!

Even if I don't lose weight again, I have feel in love with running with changes that have occur in my health.

Note:
The only thing that changed in my diet was NO SODA and NO DAIRY MILK.



I can only speak to the areas around Concord, NH - Memorial Field/White Farm, Carter Hill and Beaver Meadow (golf course) are all groomed by volunteers for skate and classic skiing.  All of them also have a smaller amount of multipurpose trails.  There's also snowmobile trails in the area, but I don't know much about them other than where the trailheads that I drive to to run on them are.

I know Gunstock has a bunch of XC+multipurpose trails (they've got a set for fat tire MTBs).  I've heard Bear Brook has groomed trails, but I haven't gone to check those out yet.You have been running for 5 years so I would imagine that you have a decent amount of muscle memory. Your body has its own natural gait, and honestly it may be tough for you to make a bunch of wholesale changes at once.

I personally found that I have my best form when I am doing speedwork and that my form is most likely to break down during my easier runs when I am less focused on it. I would try doing a faster workout with some fast 400s and take note of your form. If everything feels good, then I would just try to replicate that form on your easier runs, and make sure that it does not break down.

This is easier said then done, and you will have to be patient, but that is what worked for me. My form also naturally improved as I increased my mileage, so that may be something to consider as well.

I LOL'd at the don't sweat it...I probably will :PI live/train at ~5300 ft."I really need to eat, but I'll just bask in the warmth for a couple more minutes"

Generally occurs after a hard tempo or long run and usually results in 20 minute showers. If you're not trying to gain weight, don't take extra protein/calories.  If you are trying to gain lean mass, take protein.

I pretty regularly have a big (32oz) smoothie after long runs in the summer, as much to rehydrate as anything, and I use VEGA protein/meal powder, usually chocolate, with some spinach or kale leaves and almond milk.What elevation do you live and train at?I thought about using it, but the marathon had timing strips every 10k so I ended up deciding to leave the phone at home.Holy moly.  I waited until mid-morning when it got up to a balmy 14F.  I overdressed and was miserable. :-/In my case, forefoot is the ball of the foot i.e. closer to the toes. The point is that it means less impact on the body but transition slowly because calf muscles need to adjust. That's what works for me. "I could go for a beer right now."

And before someone else posts it: /r/showerbeer&gt;Normal week is 50-70km

Sounds kinda low if you're hoping for a really strong marathon, but I think you'll be fine as long as you don't go out too fast.That's how it is here in Alberta, Canada right now. Warm yesterday, froze overnight. So much thin ice with several inches of water hiding beneath it, slushy puddles, roads and sidewalks with a nice mix of slush and ice chips, and patches of extremely slick invisible ice. It's an obstacle course out there!Brooks also has, at least for their adrenaline line, an "ASR" shoe with a gore-tex upper and good grip, designed for running in snow.I love the way you casually throw in the "for added realism" bit at the end. :)Many say YakTrax are pretty fragile on pavement. And with city running, I need something that will hold up. So I just wear some of my older running shoes with Due North traction spikes on them. Been using them most of the winter, and they have held up great! Definitely worth the $35 I spent on them. They make every bit of difference between being an outdoor winter runner and a treadmill slug (which makes me lose all motivation).

 http://www.surefoot.net/products_ta.cfm

(I'm in Canada. They carry them at the Running Room, but I'm sure they are available elsewhere, too, if you don't want to order online.)
K, what parks and where. I love groomed XC trails.A running buddy of mine (when I was in San Diego) had been in Chicago.  He used 3/8" hex head screws.  Swore by them.I don't think 100 miles has ever been THE distance in ultrarunning in most parts of the world (the metric parts). The only [ultrarunning world championships](http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/ultra-running/ultra-running) are 100 km and 24 hours for example.If I'm understanding you correctly, forefoot means the middle of the foot, right? I experience shin splints as well; they only occur while running on the treadmill, never when I run outdoors. This is exactly it. The really shady thing are the agents, who exploit the crap out of the runners for money. They race every weekend for a paycheck, and even a hundred bucks from a local 5k isn't bad for 15 minutes of work. I've been to races that write a check to the top finishers at the awards ceremony, and then I'll watch the winners hand the check directly to their agent.

[Here's one of the groups](http://lmeliterun.ts9.ru/) that is near me. It's super sketchy. The agents/managers/whatever you want to call them are former Russian athletes who recruit Kenyans and Ethiopians, travelling around the region every weekend for road races that pay prize money. With all the doping news coming out of Russia (especially Russia) and Kenya, it's hard to believe these groups aren't doping. Considering that none of the races they do drug test and they're not quite good enough to be tested by WADA or another international organization, it's a safe bet that they're doping. Hell, one member of that group had been banned from racing in Mexico for taking PEDs.

As an American who's trying to be competitive, I'm really conflicted. On the one hand, it's super frustrating when you know they're going to show up at every race with prize money and you know they're cheating but there's nothing you can do about it. But on the other hand, they have a right to come here and try to make a living just like any other immigrant. Plus I feel bad that they're so clearly being taken advantage of by their agents.I always find myself frequenting Runners World &amp; Competitor when I'm bored, there's hundreds of articles on running, motivation, health and fitness on both. Lots of interesting reads and information to be picked up when you've got a bit of spare time! lol'dIf I need to supplement my diet I'll add some Sytha-6 to my morning oatmeal.  The old weightlifter's 'Prots &amp; Oats' breakfast.

I also buy egg whites by the gallon and use them quite a bit.I too sweat a lot when I run. Even at night in 60 degree weather. People have told me that they wish they could sweat as much as me. I wouldn't sweat it. You're fine.The lengths are rounded up to the tenth. The grades are rounded up to the nearest whole % because some treadmills at my gym don't have fractional settings. The "recovery" is minimum 1% regardless of actual terrain because treadmill. There is actually a bit of slight downhill in there at points.

I can't find my original numbers that I built this from to confirm, but I think Heartbreak is a little steeper and a little longer than reality to better simulate the frikkin pain at that point.

After the hills, it's all downhill from there. Painful, bitter, agonizing downhill that makes you question your dedication and life choices. I love it.I read this like oh damn let me do this, then i realized i have never ran farther then 8 miles. well, it's JapanThanks for this. I don't train on a treadmill, but I will look for similar hills to use in the runup to Boston.yeah, that about sums it up for me.[Here's a link to an improper gate!](http://cdn.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/broken-gate-1.jpg)Thanks for the advice guys, I did some searching before I read your replies and found the Higdon plans but I've been so dedicated to this plan that I'm a little hesitant to swap in case I lose my steam! I'm going to go for it anyway and switch to higdon in a few weeks when my mileage is at that of his long runs.If I had a treadmill, I'd totally try this!Would help to see a video of your gait. If you are over striding and experiencing dorsiflexion with every stride, this could be attributing to shin pain. Research shortening stride, increasing cadence, and mid/fore-foot striking. I was never athletic as a child. I loved sitting at home playing video games. My frame has always been small so I've never felt like I "needed" to. In my early 20's I decided doing drugs was awesome, which it definitely is not. Trying to get clean, I read somewhere that running was a great way to release endorphins and help your brain stabilize its hormones. So I ran for 5 minutes. The next week I ran 10 minutes. The next day I ran 11 minutes. The next month I got actual running shoes. The next year I ran a little faster. The next few years I trained for half marathons. And now I'm training for a full. But for all these years, I've mostly run because it gets me away from...everything. It's me and the sound of my breathing and my shoes hitting the ground. My thoughts slowly fade and I just exist in the present. Running saved my life and continues to do so. I run to be.I'm going to mix it up and say... PT PT PTUnbelievable I wouldn't worry about it. I sweat loads when I run, here's me just after a workout http://i.imgur.com/0Mhe7Z4.gifSorry link goes to iTunes :(. Homepage is here: http://turf.ly.

We are getting ready to launch Turf.ly from beta! Currently we're hammering out a few final bugs and preparing some marketing materials. So just before we do I'd love to hear what runners think of the following aspects of the game:


 Competition vs Progress vs Exploration (do you get motivation from competition or a sense of progress or a sense of exploration?)

 Social  do you have other running friends you share your runs with and give/get encouragement/kudos with?

 Does the explanation of the game on the homepage make sense? Is it compelling? Which features would make you want to play the game?

Re: Android yes, we'll get to Android as soon as we have got everything figured out on our iPhone version first. Thanks for your patience and please add your name to our Android wait list on the homepage!I don't get why a mid foot strike should make more noise. In my experience an indicator of an efficient gait is its quietness. Am I missing something?The forecast currently says heavy rain,  45mph gusts,  6c average. I'm not a fast runner,  so I'm expecting to be out in it for 2:15. The waterproofs are light weight and I run in them often (it rains a lot here)IMO, post-run is not the time to lose weight. Training wise, it makes a lot of sense to refill your glyco stores; in fact, if there is a time for fast carbs, it is within 45 minutes post-run. I guess the key is to keep your other food intake down, and not go overboard post-run.For me, working through a training program creates as huge calorie deficit and makes me lose weight. I trained for my first marathon and lost 25 pounds. I was however pretty heavy to start with, M 6'0" 235.  And I am currently in a 50 miler training program and have lost and other 10 pounds 5 weeks in. I try to control eating but like other people have stated, you become ravenous after longer runs. Running also puts your metabolism into over drive (EPOC) and you continue burning calories even after you stop running. In summation, running made me lose a ton a weight! It really depends on what kind of watch / phone you want to use to collect the data. Here is a guy's web-site that reviews most if not all GPS watches along with HRM and other sensors. Many HRM come with the watches. I recently bought a non chest strap one (Scosche RHYTHM+) and the CDN price was $90.

tell 'em shady's back too.This sub is so damn down-votey.Something from polar?Yep; same here. Lost 20 kg, then bounced back up by about 2 kg, and now that I'm training for a half, pretty much stuck, although I still seem to be converting some of that fat into muscle, so I've got that going for me...I'm heavy ex-army runner (275lbs) and I run in Brooks Cascadias, Brooks Ravennas, and Nike Lunarglide 6s at the moment. There is no right shoe. Go to a running specific shop and try some on and get fitted.If it's for aesthetic purposes, why don't you try adding strength training or HIIT to your workout instead of just running?On the treadmill, you have very little airflow to evaporate sweat so

* The sweat is much more apparent as it builds up
* There is less evaporative cooling so you're hotter
* So you sweat even more

If you're comparing sweat outdoors to sweat on the treadmill, that's probably it.
I lost a load from running, but was doing 50+ miles a week, then just stuck at the same weight.I love running in the cold because you have to keep going just to keep warm.  The worst part is right after the race when you start to regain feeling in your fingers and legs.  Oh, the burn of thawing out.And Kent State still sucks.You might eat healthy, but you are eating to maintain your current weight level. You need to eat even less if you want to be smaller. Running won't help as much as you'd like, but it doesn't hurt. But it definitely isn't because of running burning **fewer** calories than other activities. Running at a moderate speed can burn 1200 calories an hour. But your muscles want some of those back, so the calorie deficit is a bit tricky to maintain with your training.This is so inspirational in so many levels it's actually making me feel a bit sick.In NH as well with no sidewalks or shoulders. It's my first winter here and I'm looking to buy a treadmill. I'm going crazy.I have a Suunto Ambit 2 HRM.  It works great.  You can customize the data you see, and the online software works really well.  Highly recommended.That looks awesome man, good on you. Haven't had much snow this winter where I live but when it did snow it fell on my running days so I ran it anyways :) Main concern is ice though, had a few close calls so far hahaAbsolutely this. I did the same with great improvement. Usually it is best to increase cadence and shorten your stride. Try it out with some easier runs.I'd recommend seeing a sports medicine specialist.  Everyone always told me I had shin splints and how I could fix them. Took 20 years to find out I had chronic exertional compartment syndrome and that I needed surgery to fix it.Slow your roll, Chief. Give yourself time to grow as a runner before you take on too much.I work at a running store, I really like comparing an analysis/shoe to a prescription. What I see is (probably) what you need now. But 12 months from now? I can't say, so let me check again.About 3:30...There is a short movie about this sort of thing. It's called Chasing Keino, and you can watch it on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/26376622

It focuses on the Sante Fe group that /u/White_Lobster mentioned earlier in comments.Moving to Florida next week, I am so ready to get outside and run as soon as i do.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkzYbbv2eTAWe just set a new record low here.... it got all the way down to 38F!What time is it?I love it! What a helpful, lovely, redundant little robot!
So do you fear the roo?Well, in Ohio's defense, you can't go to a game of the biggest rivalry in College Football, and expect to see "happy" shirts of the away team.

Ah hell, what am I saying. Ohio still sucks.Agreed, I swapped out a lot of my runs over the course of my training for what fit my work/life/training schedule the best. NE, so Akron-Canton area.I went to the Michigan - Ohio State football game a few years ago in Ann Arbor and saw [this image](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1804005/87_49_medium.jpg) on approximately ten million t-shirts.What part of the state are you in? [Meat](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmtyhj2jqo1qbqi3no1_500.jpg).yeah my race was postponed last week, hopefully snowmageddon is over by march 8th.[Enough said](http://i.imgur.com/UxFJS.jpg).&gt; Lol, yay for living in Ohio!

There's another entry for the list of things I never imagined I'd hear anyone say.I know, right.
If it fed me M&amp;Ms, or pizza, then ok, but only on the couch, not when I'm running.I grew up skiing on snowmobile trails in NH. Usually you can hear the snowmobiles coming from about a mile away, and even when they did come up on you they were usually pretty courteous.Same here. Burned 2000 cals in today's run, and think I already took them in. Two things - 1st, psychological, I say to myself 'its my reward, I earned it'. 2nd, the crazy cravings I get.

So I lost 35kg last year, been running like crazy this past 3-4 months and stuck in this weight. I could use some 5kg less, but running at this intensity that would be soooooo difficult to do!I second that. He podcasts with professional ultra marathon runners. You get an inside scoop on things you wouldn't otherwise read elsewhere. His gear reviews are well done as wellI think adding some lifting to your schedule would be beneficial. I drastically changed my body composition through lifting and HIIT four days a week. Obviously prepping for a half makes four days of lifting unreasonable but I think it should be a goal to build muscle. Just make sure you eat to compliment your goals (don't skimp on the protein or lifting will be a waste of time).

And I know you said you eat really well, but have you ever tracked it over a week? When I plateaued I played around with my macros and found I respond better when I have a lower carb intake. Maybe have a look at your macros and play around with it as well.As I recall she was interviewed afterward and was pretty cool about recognizing how funny the whole thing was. The whole thing made me pleased to be a Portlander. =)Definitely try heavy weights. There is always a misconception (for females) that by lifting heavy but less reps, you will get crazy ripped and look like a guy. You can even incorporate it with your training for the half.

Also there is a post I keep saved: http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/07/21/meet-staci-your-new-powerlifting-super-hero/

I think its interesting to see how she does look aesthetically better weighing more. I  will admit that for me losing weight is a goal since I'd like to be faster and well for running, you can be within normal BMI but still "overweight" for runningYes.

1 Missed run won't ruin you and any running is better than no running. So a shortened workout will be less troublesome.

Honestly, don't even run 16 next weekend and run 14 the following, Just squeeze in 10 this weekend and follow your plan as you scheduled (so 10, 10, 14,...).You should be fine.There's websites for that.  They even have pictures and videos :pCool - love those cold runs, feel like superman. Did one two weeks ago in -10C, 21k, fresh snow on the ground, at midnight. Needless to say was the only one around, and enjoyed it.

Surprised I can do that without gloves or head cover. Did take a scarf, and 3 layers clothing.The worst part is during sparing when it gets in my eyes and I can't see my opponent.  When I run I wear a hat that keeps it out of my eyes (outside, don't wear a hat on the treadmill)It was miserable. I probably would never do it again. I had already paid for the race, so I wasn't going to skip it. I wanted my sweet pint glass and hoodie!

You know how you get the tinglies when it's cold out? My hands and feet were literally numb. I could not feel a thing. It was a little terrifying. By about mile 2.5 I was toasty warm though. So I had that going for me, which is nice.From riding trails on my mountain bike, I can confirm that tree lining (even when they're bare) makes a huge difference for snow and ice retention.Why you think so? Seriously (humbly asking). How can I know this?

I try to listen to my body. I stop running and give it a rest if something hurts. During these 3 hours run I am enjoying it all the way. Also work my core (want to do a post with my workout for comments...) 2 or 3 times per week. I am increasing distance slowly (I think... just looked it up - 40-50k weeks in November for example). First 21k was Jan 1st. And not hitting it hard with speed (in part my fear of injury, in part that I enjoy more the long trail runs). And I take easy weeks and longer rests (2, 3 days). Prev week was 44k, week before, 70k.Sweating is good. Either you're out of shape and your body is sweating like crazy trying to keep you cool as you struggle or you're in good shape and your body is sweating like crazy to keep you cool as you kick ass. Or something in between. Don't worry about it.More power to you. I don't know how you do it. I hit the pain threshold at 10F when my throat starts to burn and eyes start to sting.Yeah? Well, it's supposed to be 37F tomorrow! I'm definitely thinking it'll be a shorts and short-sleeve shirt day.Yes. The Cambridge part of the trail is down to the pavement most days, however once you move towards Arlington/Lexington it gets rougher, but still plowed and totally do-able. Beats running on the sidewalks around here anytime!You'll be fine. Good luck!Meat, eggs, and other food daily. I also take whey isolate daily.three layers and a hat.  A hood as well if its windy.  Aside from that, don't dick around in the cold.  Do your stretching inside.  Once you step out and the door closes, you better be running within 5 seconds.Just FYI I'm waiting just a little longer for it to warm up to mid-50s before I head out today.I heel strike fairly severely and I think my flair says it all.  I really don't see why everyone thinks that heel striking is worse than the devil, I honestly don't get it.  As you run more and more miles I believe that your form evolves and changes into the most efficient form it can be. It's been unseasonably warm here. I've been wearing shorts and a singlet lately. FYILol, yay for living in Ohio!

Ran a 5k last weekend at -13F (-27F with windchill). It was hell, but at the same time, it was awesome.I will go with I am in better shape :)&gt; so it's really the type and amount of exercise that I do that's going to help me reach my goal.

No it won't. It will be your diet. It's nutritional discipline that will make the biggest difference.

You say that you know calorie deficit is what makes weight loss but that you already eat fairly healthy. "Fairly healthy" does not equate to weight loss. As you said yourself, you need a calorie deficit. I happen to think that there's more to it than simple adding and subtracting calories, but don't dismiss calorie deficit because you eat healthy. Those are two different things.

From your comments in this thread it sounds like you've already decided that your diet is fine and that you're going to lose 15 pounds without changing it. Good luck.This is my long-term goal.  I want to make other runners in my age group nervous.20 minutes on the dreadmill at a 7 minute/mile pace.  That sub-20 5k in May is looking like it could happen after all!Not for me, for the people he "Coaches" using plans and web content he plagiarized from other sources.How you dare place bacon that far back is beyond me!I notice you say that you are trying to lose 15 pounds, but that you don't have much weight to lose and are already in a healthy weight range. The healthy range for any given height and frame is usually less than 15 lbs difference.

Can I suggest talking to your doctor about your goals and their feasibility? From there you can work with a nutritionist to make sure your diet is well balanced, and a find a trainer or consult the internet develop a weekly fitness program that combines cardio and strength. Just make sure you check in with a health care professional and make sure that you aren't trying to drop too much.

There's nothing wrong with shooting for aesthetics, but it's not necessarily losing weight that's going to get you the look you want. It's getting fit. That generally means adding muscle. It's likely that if you want more definition and tone your weight will stay the same or maybe even increase.

Not sure of your gender but I recommend checking out [r/xxfitness](http://reddit.com/r/xxfitness).


Edit: TyposOne place I found is around Fresh Pond. They usually keep the loop pretty clear. Also the ranger station has a bubbler, bathrooms, and a place to warm up if need be. The ranger station is open during normal business hours I believe (like 8-5)You can do it. You're running longs and training on the terrain you'll be running the races on. Fuck yeah you can do it.How about telling us about the kind of running shoe you want people to test.Till they magically get enough people to do it.

Or, you know, they give up and try a different place.I'd say the best diet and exercise plan is one you can stick to.  Running is great but if you find yourself avoiding it after a week or two, then it's not the right one for you.  Same with cycling, weightlifting, rowing, etc.  As someone else said, consistency is key so find something you like and make it a habit.I have read that you sweat **more** the better shape you're in. If you google some form of that phrase, you find articles saying it's true and some saying it's false. I'm no scientist, but I know I'm in pretty good shape and I sweat like crazy if I'm working out inside without good air circulation.It's not a joke.  there will be two people wearing this during the race.Awesome!  The whole way?  Cambridge to Bedford?I. can't. even.You keep mentioning not overweight, which is part of the problem, the body *wants* to keep that extra fat storage (beer belly is common with a runner's "body"). Loosing 50 lbs from 300 to 250 is a hell of a lot easier than loosing 5 lbs at 150 with &lt;20% body fat.

As you already know, calorie deficit is the only thing that will make you loose weight. At a non-overweight weight that can end up being as drastic as a 1000-1300 calorie intake a day, which is a very small amount of food.

To second that advice, strength training/lifting will help a lot with body image, but there's a caveat: you might realize you won't loose gross weight, and might even gain a bit, muscle is a lot more dense than fat. You might lose 3-4 pounds of fat but gaining 1" on your chest might add 5 lbs.Good advice here. Logging everything into MFP + running has equaled weight loss for me.

OP, I too was fifteen pounds over where I wanted to be *yet* was within the norm for my height and weight when I began losing weight. I just wasn't comfortable there, however. I get what you're saying. Obligatory Portland snow runners falling down . vidoThose people working there must be bananas! I got an even better idea.

People who are successful and have sex constantly describe their sex adventures to virgins who can't get laid.The 30s are the 29s with a different upper.  'New' 29s are still available on ebay believe it or not, although the numbers of them in my size (men's us11) is finally starting to dwindle.Try [this book](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861209892) from your local library.Thanks, will do! Im a big YouTube fan, so this is great! Hopefully :)Wasn't planning on it. Bad experience?Slow your roll, Chief. Give yourself time to grow as a runner before you take on too much. Since you asked, I run for myself. I'm a similar weight/height and typically take 3/4 a scoop of Optimum Nutrition Whey protein after some runs. I was using it after each run, but started to cut back to taking it only after significant workouts, so speed or long runs. if you're feeling stalker-ish... do some google searches for the winners of local halfs, you'll find out a few of them are sponsored/professional.The post holing is a good point.  Last night I was punching through in the open field...even on a track that had been ridden on daily.  Once in the woods it tends to be much more packed.  I have a pair of Dion running snowshoes that I'll probably use from now on until we get a decent melt and refreeze.  This powdery snow only packs so much. Just don't give "Coach" Matt Johnson from Runner Academy any money. I changed from heel strike to a forefoot strike and that solved a similar problem. Consider changing your technique to a gentler one,  whatever this means in your case. Water if over 2 hrs or if it is extra hot out. Otherwise just wait until getting home. How many times are you going to post this?There are volunteers that groom the parks for XC skiing around me. It's a lot less nerve wracking than dealing with angry winter drivers, icy shoulders and snowmobile trails (I worry about postholing more than anything else on those from past experience).

Which is a long winded way of saying not all groomed paths in public areas are going to be multi-use. I'm in Mass.  Every time I try to run outside, I almost get hit by cars....I hate the treadmill, but at least I know its safe...As you already acknowledged, weight loss will come from a calorie deficit.  You want to achieve this calorie deficit by increasing your calorie expenditure while keeping your calorie intake constant.

That strategy can work, and running is a fine way of achieving the first part (increasing calorie expenditure).  As others have mentioned, running burns a comparable number of calories to other sustained aerobic exercise at the same level of intensity.

The issue that you are likely to encounter is with the second part of the plan, keeping calorie intake constant.  You keep stating that this won't be a problem because you eat healthy.  The fact that you are making this statement concerns me because I think that is a sign that it *will* be a problem.

Say you go out and burn 500 calories by running 4 miles, or whatever.  You can very easily eat 500 additional calories between that run and your next run, while still eating strictly healthy foods.  If you don't know exactly how many calories you were consuming while maintaining your weight and not running, how are you going to be sure you are eating the same number once you start running?

Your appetite *will* increase as you increase mileage, so focusing solely on food selection will likely allow you to increase calorie intake while still convincing yourself that your diet is not the problem (that's what I meant above when I said your statement concerns me).

You have to have some way of accounting for your calorie intake so you can be sure that you are controlling it.  Optimally this would mean studiously counting calories eaten and burned.  If you do this with maximal honesty, you will almost certainly be successful.  It really sucks to count calories, or write down everything you eat, or whatever other approximation of counting you want to use.  But ultimately you need to do something like this, because your every biological impulse will be to compensate for the additional calorie burn with additional eating.
Too much water can actually be a problem. Over-hydration is a real problem and can be extremely harmful.For ice, google "screw shoes". I'd suggest the 3/8" variety in an older pair of running shoes. They make a clicking sound on pavement but you can run on anything icy. I've never slipped but when I'm wearing them I tend to run 8ish or greater pace.After reading this I'm starting to wonder...why is weight so important? Especially for aesthetic purposes, weight loss can be bad. Muscle weighs more than fat because its more dense. The heaviest I've ever weighed was probably the most "ripped" I've ever been (I'm a guy). Instead of focusing on weight, if you really want a good body go for a more toned look. That means you may very well gain a few pounds but it will all be muscle.

If you aren't a runner and if you are already eating healthy and you start running, I can see this going one of two ways.
     1. You start running and keep eating                healthy foods. You gain weight as your legs build muscle and, as a result, you start eating less and less calories in order to stop the weight gain. You soon become extremely tired throughout the day and you almost pass out if you haven't eaten in a while. You become unattractively skeleton-like and you end up having an extremely unhealthy lifestyle.
     2. You start running, keep eating healthy, and increase your calorie intake to support your running. You gain weight as your legs build muscle but you embrace that. Soon, you weigh more but your body becomes toned and you reach that aesthetic goal.

I worry when I hear someone say they want to lose weight for aesthetic purposes. It usually means that someone will go overboard and do more harm than good. The fact that you want to lose 15 pounds and you are already average weight worries me. If its for health purposes, great! If its for purely aesthetic purposes, worrisome. Be careful.I'm not in the USA, but thanks ;)yeah, love those motorists that actually move closer to you and the text'ers. I need that shoulder to jump out of the way. I've actually found I feel more focused on speed work on the treadmill. Not sure if it'll translate to the roads but we'll see come spring.Overweight  adjective
1.
**weighing too much** or more than is considered normal, proper, etc.:

Look it doesn't matter what the "normal" range is, if you need to lose weight, which it sounds like you do, then you are overweight for your specific body.

But this sounds like a really sensitive subject for you, so it is no big deal.

(typos, Redditing on my phone is terrible)If aesthetics are your only concern, I would think the simplest method would be to eat less food. I know you said you eat healthy, which is great, but weight loss isn't about being healthy - it's about caloric deficit. If you don't want to eat less, then start running and eat the same amount you're eating now. The more you run, the more weight you'll lose until you're body starts to shut down, at which point you'll either have to eat more r run less.Snow running has to be my absolute favorite. I just started doing it this season, and my lord it is fantastical.  There's like no one out, and the crunch just makes it so cozy. I also do it at night, with a headlamp, and that's been great too with the soft glow coming up from the snow. Unfortunately we've been in the mid-thirties these two weeks, and the wonderfulness has gone away :/Its [perfect](http://i.imgur.com/WE0xoO9.jpg).I think running is an extremely efficient way to lose weight. Its the only thing that ever worked for me. But, as many have pointed out, it does have its drawbacks. Overweight definition:
adj.adjective - Weighing more than is normal, necessary, or allowed, especially having more body weight than is considered normal or healthy for one's age or build.

My weight is normal and healthy, therefore I am not overweight. Wanting to be thinner and being overweight are NOT the same thing. I have no patience for purposeful ignorance.[?](http://bigcatrescue.org/images/tigerphotos/WhiteTigerDeformed3.jpg)I would definitely recommend checking out Ginger Runner on YouTube. He puts together excellent race videos, great reviews, and also has a live show on Monday nights where he interviews runners or talks about his recent races. Really great content and very entertaining. He definitely leans more towards the ultra marathon side of the spectrum but should appeal to most runners.So you would say that your weight is... over what you want it to be?

Hmmm... I wonder what word you would use to describe that.  [runningintheusa](http://www.runningintheusa.com) - The motivation you need is your next race.Glad to see a comment from someone who understands wanting to lose weight for aesthetic purposes. I am not trying to lose weight because I'm overweight; I'm trying to lose weight to get my body down to the shape and size **I** want.

I've tried weight lifting before, but not super heavy workouts. Maybe I'll try that. I definitely want to keep running because I don't want to just give up my goal of the half, but it sounds less and less likely that I'll hit my weight loss goal while training for the race.

And thanks for that tip! I can definitely use post-run meal suggestions.&gt; And yes, I know weight loss results from a calorie deficit, but I already eat fairly healthy (which is why my weight loss goal is hard as it is), so it's really the type and amount of exercise that I do that's going to help me reach my goal.

You still have to eat even less. Join myfitnesspal. LOG EVERYTHING. Get a quantifiable grapple of what you are really putting in. If you don't know you are consuming 1,750 calories a day how do you know 1 hour on the Arc trainer is enough? Once you know that, you'll have an good idea of both:

 * What food to cut back on
 * How much exercise you should add

Under assume calorie output when counting exercise and over assume portion size when counting food.You brave, brave soul.


My body doesn't work properly in the cold. So uncomfortable.What do you mean by "give my legs a break"?

You're looking at almost 2.5mm of difference in heel drop between your regular shoes and the Adrenalines, that's going to make a big difference. If you're looking to move to the Adrenalines long-term, you might want to find something halfway between these two as a transition.

They are **very** different shoes. Here are the specs:

http://www.runnersworld.com/shoe/puma-faas-300-v3-mens

http://www.runnersworld.com/shoe/brooks-adrenaline-gts-13-mensAs I have said in another comment, I am not 15 pounds overweight!

I want to lose 15 pounds **for aesthetic purposes.** I am well within the healthy/normal weight range for my height and age. Please read more carefully and stop assuming that I am overweight.It seems like you could benefit from strong lifts. For weight loss, diet &gt;&gt; strength training &gt;&gt; cardio. I run because I enjoy running and I'll also throw in some weight lifting - squats 3X5, deadlifts 2X5, bench press 3X5, etc. I'm also about 10 lbs from where I'd like to be (aesthetically that is) and you can probably guess it's a slow slow process. I'm happy if I can just go down a lb a month. Running does burn a lot of calories but as some other people have mentioned, you might just end up eating it back. I have noticed eating protein helps with cravings - carton of egg whites, cheese, and chicken is my go-to post run meal.Well if you are 15lbs overweight than you are not eating healthy.

Eating too much is unhealthy, which is your problem- or was your problem anywayI didn't address the issue of how I got up to those distances. It sounds like you've got the right idea. Many suggest that you should only increase your weekly mileage by 10%, although it's a nice round number that doesn't really have any research to back it up.

I have found the best way to improve is to sign up for a race and find a training plan to follow. A good training plan will give you a nice mixture of running and rest, these notions being slightly different based on the level of runner for which the plan is prescribed. For a new runner, there may not be quality workouts (speed work/hill work), but only easy runs, as your body is getting used to putting in the miles, and the rest may be days off, including easier weeks.

I don't know what your goal is, or how far you're currently running, but a lot of people like the half marathon distance, and a lot of people like Hal Higdon's training plans. The nice thing about Hals plans is that he has several levels of experience from which to choose. If you use a well-made training plan, you won't have to worry about coming up with the distances: the plan will have everything you need.

http://www.halhigdon.com/training/Hello fellow Granite State runner! Did you take part in the Fat Tuesday 5k the other day?Sure, if you watch what you eat. I could easily eat back the 1500 or so calories I burn doing a half marathon.Gotcha. Good to know. :)  I've been thinking about getting a fitness watch to help me track my progress and such.Hahaha oh boy. The holidays get the best of us sometimes :)the treadmills I use have no fans to send a breeze so there's that.  Hopefully when it warms up outside I will find out if changes or not.  Its not horrible that I sweat,  just seems to be more than I am used to.  At least I am getting a good run in, that's what counts.Animals. Yes, which is why I'm asking if the hours and miles of half marathon training will be a good weight loss tool.Not at all. I purposely have been timing it so I can, frankly, get everything out before about 7:00-7:15.... Thank you so much! See you in 3 weeks!I'm not overweight at all lol. When did I ever say that? I am absolutely within the normal weight range for my height and age. Hence why I said it'll be hard to lose 15 pounds. It's simply for aesthetic reasons of my own that I want to lose weight.

And I do all types of exercise (running, arc trainer, elliptical, boot camp, body pump, rowing, obstacle course training, etc.), so I'm pretty motivated regardless of the workout style. I'm just trying to burn the most calories.when running I am wearing running shorts and a proper running shirt (non cotton - moisture wicking) -  I wear proper running shirts after learning what cotton shirts do to your nipples after sweating and rubbing against the fabric.

when TKD, its a full uniform with (or without gear)Not everyone burns 100 calories per mile. That's a rough estimate just about everyone can use. Burning calories is all about your heart rate. Period. The higher your heart rate, the faster you burn calories.Yeah. I was in between marathons and had gone from carbo loading to...well...just plain loading. Didn't help that my first marathon was November 30 and I had all of December (the holidays) to go for the second one...$1000 is probably a good week.  But probably pretty easy to find a couple of $200-$500 purses.&gt; So if your heart rate on the Arc Trainer is the same as your heart rate while running, theoretically you should burn about the same amount of calories in the same amount of time.

That's what I thought. But I've also heard that everyone's body is pretty consistent at burning ~100 calories per mile they run. So those two theories contradict each other. If the former is true, then great! But if the latter is it'll be really hard to lose any weight until I really get to that higher mileage.I find my hunger/mileage has several levels.  My hunger levels won't change for a bit, then I will hit a new level of mileage and want to eat everything.  That hunger level will stay constant again for awhile, then repeat at some new mileage level.You don't have to change your diet. You only have to change your portions.I'm heavy (245lbs now, formerly &gt;300) but I also wear custom orthotics. I can also run in hiking boots though so maybe I'm biased....

I use a neutral shoe, ASICS Gel-Nimbus 16 with my orthotics. They are amazing and there's tons of room for my wide feet. That said, your feet may feel better in a different shoes and no matter what you buy, get an actual running shoe as opposed to a training shoe. Yeah, my diet is pretty solid. It's the aerobic exercise I'm more concerned with, and whether running will provide me with the desired goals.The best exercise for losing weight is the one you will do.

Even if exercise B is more efficient than exercise A, it doesn't matter if you simply won't do B.  Run, lift, prance, whatever.

Also, sorry, but if you are 15 lbs. overweight than your diet needs work, either in quality or quantity.  No way around that one.It depends on how much running you do. Really, the best way to lose weight and raise metabolism is to watch your diet and to lift heavy weights. Running is only worth it as a weight loss technique if you're willing to put in the hours and miles.

that's the thing though, as I stated in my OP. I eat pretty healthy as it is...I'd say significantly better than the average person, so I'm not going to see anything drastic by changing my diet unless I go *totally* no (simple) carbs or something else totally unreasonable to sustain (in my life).

I rarely drink soda. I hardly drink coffee. I occasionally drink alcohol. And I eat a diet with a fair amount of protein and a low amount of simple cars. I drink tons of water each day. I stay away from processed foods and haven't been through a drive through in years. I can keep myself in check at the dining table; it's the workouts that I want to use to drive the change.An excellent question! I only wish I could provide a better answer than I'm going to give: my coach tells me what to do.

Here, however, I'll try to break it down a little bit. The numbers are so odd because I train according to time and heart rate, not distance. I usually have very little notion of how far I've run in a week, because I've learned to be worried about time instead.

Those runs that are 5.5 or 5.4 miles? Those are 45 minute easy runs, keeping my heart rate below 140. This number will vary for other people, depending on how old you are, what your maximum heart rate is (directly related to age), and what your threshold rate is. My coach came up with 140 for my easy runs based on my threshold pace, which he periodically has me measure with time trial runs.

The 14.2 miles? 2 hours at 9 minute run easy/1 minute walk intervals. He has me walk on some longer runs to keep my average heart rate down. An interesting side-note: I haven't run longer than 2 hours for more than 2 years, even when training for marathons. My coach builds volume, and keeps me tired throughout the week, rather than have me do 20 or 22 mile training runs, which are common for marathoners. I actually prefer the 2 hour method. I ran a 2:59 without ever going beyond 16 miles in training. (This is similar to the Hanson's Marathon Method).

I ended up doing about 7.5 miles yesterday after the 5.4 in the morning. 45 minutes easy in the morning, and hour easy in the evening. This was a workout I split in two. It was supposed to be a 90 minute run, but I didn't have time to do it all at once.

The 11 miles of hills? That's an odd one. 15 minute warm up, and then 7 minutes up the hill, 3 minutes down, 4 times. This makes me go higher and higher, and so I have to run extra to get back to my starting point. It's a weird workout. Thankfully, I've got some nice long hills in my area.

Aside from the hills, there isn't a lot of quality that I listed in my examples. In general, you want about 80% of your runs to be easy. Often my weeks look something like this:

M: easy
T: hills
W: easy
H: intervals
F: easy
S: easy
S: long

You want the easy miles to build your base, but you want them to be genuinely easy, so that you have enough juice to really push your hard days. A lot of runners run too hard on their easy days (and part of the reason why my coach makes me take walk breaks sometimes).Try something with protein. It'll fill you up, while eating lesslooks like my highschool in the White Mountains. I bought a pair of "Yak Traks Run" in January. The "Run" variety have hardened spikes on the forefoot that are anchored in plastic. The packaging is pretty clear that they are not for use on anything but pure ice and snow. I, however, run on a surface similar to the OP's picture. 2 of the 5 spikes on each foot folded after about two runs. I've tried to straighten them, but the plastic is weakened too much. Additionally I run with Vivobarefoot shoes, so I can feel the Yak Traks and they don't feel great. Just wanted to share my experience. They may be a fine product for use with different equipment in a different environment/Nope. Meant to share a picture of my icicle covered face from the run. Apparently pics get automatically removed. Seems like a douchey post without the picture attached. Gotcha. Well do you have any suggestions for smart post run snacks? I'm usually a fan of bananas, Clif bars, and/or veggies after I work out.

And is it bad to do other forms of aerobic activity or strength training during my rest days for training for the half? I really want to hit my goal while training for this race.You go! Props. I'm too much of a wuss to run out when it's really bad.Yeah I guess you're right. I did.

Thanks. Have a nice day. Eek. Yeah, I definitely don't want that to happen :/And here I am wanting to test size 11.5 shoes. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Unless you're counting calories and know how much protein you're actually getting versus how much you need, I wouldn't take any.


Protein that isn't used gets turned into energy so you're just eating extra calories if your muscles don't actually need to protein.


Edit: [A brief article on the subject](http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/how-our-bodies-use-protein)&gt;Running makes you hungrier.

I gained 8 lbs running ~30 miles per week because I stopped being smart about eating and kinda just ate everything. I've since lost it but...yikes...it was scary.Running is a pretty efficient way to burn calories, [compared to other forms of exercise](http://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-activities). On the other hand, diet has a bigger impact. It is hard to outrun a bad diet, and many people overcompensate by eating too much after running.

In my personal experience, running can certainly help to lose weight, provided it is coupled with an appropriate diet.Oh very nice! I did not know about that sub yet. I'm not as excited to read about the elite athletes as I am about the average Joe, but I see they have a bunch of other posts too. Thanks!When I'm walking I usually have a pen or something in my hand, I've been clipped too many times already and I've decided recently that if you're close enough that you hit me, and you happen to gouge the hell out of your car in the process, that's not my problem. I'm glad you're ok, people SUCK.Interesting. I had no idea, but I guess I never had to worry about it. If I got lapped running the mile on a 400 meter track, things would have been going very poorly for me.Good on ya for getting out, I know I've been lazy the last few weeks. How are you covering up your face? Anything below 15F and 15 minutes in my nose is frozen and pale white along with my cheeks, any uncovered ears, and hands (even with gloves. curse my poor surface circulation) and my lungs start to get that weird cool numbness in them that I know is a sign of something awful. Suggestions?

Water during easy runs and Nuun when it's very warm out or I plan on sweating a lot. I quite like Nuun as it doesn't make me nauseous, whereas most anything with sugar in it does.I strap Yaktrax RUN on road shoes, but only if actually running on snow. They'll shred if you run on the pavement with them for more than the occasional step. I'll wear a Brooks Cascadia (softer but grippy trail shoe) if it's a good mix of road and snow.

I'm lucky enough to have some extremely low traffic roads near me that get pretty well cleared. Running in town right now pisses both runners and drivers off. You need to lose the weight at the dining table and consider exercise as a means of getting healthy (stronger, better cardiovascular system, whatever).

Running is a great way to engage your core and build cardio.  Weightlifting (powerlifting -- deadlifts, squats, presses) is a great way to increase metabolism and build muscle.  The most important thing is that you 1) are consistent, 2) count calories and eat an appropriately balanced diet.
Running burns a fuckload of calories, but there are three problems that will typically hinder weight loss:

1. There is a limit to how much running your body can handle per week, and that limit gives you less calorie burn than other forms of aerobic exercise - even a relatively untrained person can easily spend 2-3 hours per day on a bicycle at mild effort levels, but even just 5 hours of running *per week* is something you need to work up to.
2. Running makes you hungrier, especially if you keep increasing your training volume. And more often than not, satisfying the post-run cravings completely cancels out anything you may have burned - I, for one, can easily stuff myself with way more than 800 kcal worth of bananas, sandwiches, cake, beer, or whatever gets in my way, after a 10k run.
3. If you train hard, you need to provide your body with the building blocks for recovery and adaptation, otherwise you'll hamper improvement and recovery, and might even increase your injury risk. But getting the required nutrients on a calorie deficit is usually somewhat problematic.GC is no panacea, so don't buy a Garmin product just for the sake of having access to it. (You'll be disappointed.) I just use it as a gateway to get my data to Strava. I've never had a mid-run issue with the FR220 that I've been using for quite some time now, but I don't think it's beyond the scope of reason to think that just about any piece of electronics can take a dump on you for no good reason.If you're used to a minimal shoe, a middle of the road support shoe will definitely feel weird. I like /r/advancedrunning. They tend to have more articles about the pros than this sub.Shin splints? If not:

Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

Try toe taps, and heel lifts, and other similar exercises.As long as you aren't feeling any ill effects otherwise, I wouldn't worry about how much you're sweating. Just make sure to hydrate and stuff. Are you wearing particularly non-breathable fabrics? I've noticed that I sweat considerably more in certain shirts.Oh they do..I tend to run at night and the trail I run on doesn't have sections to carry tons of speed.  I look for their lights and try to keep my ears listening.   I have always heard them in plenty of time.  The other thing is most of the parks are multi-use so they know there might be folks on ski's or snowshoes.  The cars in my town..especially my road, people are horrible.  One guy wouldn't budge one time and I had to dive behind a  telephone pole - I throw my hands up and he stops the car and starts screaming at me like it was my fault.   Oh ..and the time a guy who lives near me ... He blew a stop sign while I was running through an intersection and I asked him to please stop and he said  "GO FUCK YOURSELF , I'LL RIP YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT"   -  So yea...  I've met the local snowmobile trail crews and have helped them clear blowdowns in the past so I'd rather be killed by them, at least they might feel bad.
Burning calories while running is all about your body size/age and your heart rate. So if your heart rate on the Arc Trainer is the same as your heart rate while running, theoretically you should burn about the same amount of calories in the same amount of time.

If you eat healthy, weight loss should not be difficult. There are a ton of filling foods, and a ton of foods that are low in calories. You can lose all the weight you want without running a single mile.

Get a calorie counter (I like My Fitness Pal), track your calories and lose weight.If your hip bones are actually grinding against one another, I don't think you'd be walking a whole lot. Regardless, get to the doctor doctor doctor.I used it with a fairly new FR220 and a fairly old iPhone during last year's SF Marathon and had no issue following a ~3:40 race. I was fully charged going in and had maybe 70% phone battery left and plenty on the watch. I wouldn't worry about battery, provided your phone isn't super old and/or running a million other things in the background.What I wear when it's near zero to 5-10 below: Standard baselayer top then a thermal baselayer top. Thermal bib tights and windbreaker pants over them. Then a Pearl Izumi Elite Barrier jacket. I think any other thermal winter breathable jacket will work, but this is what I use. Wool socks. Chemical toe warmers (no chemicals in them). They are thin and stick to your socks to keep from shifting around. I wear them on top of my toes. Winter modded running shoes - sheet metal screw in the soles for traction and duct tape over the toe areas. Full winter ski type gloves and a beanie hat. Both can be taken on and off while running if it gets too hot or cold. I don't do a face mask, but I am always sure to put on lip balm before heading out.

On a side note, if you use strava on an iPhone, it could shut itself off in sub zero temps if you don't keep it in a pocket that that keeps it fairly insulated. Redditor for 5 months, but still a sick burn.  Thanks.The snow's never bothered me, I actually enjoy running in it. 5 years ago I was running in -25F windchills with no problem, but I'm apparently getting soft as I get older.Icebugs have metal studs in the soles that are good for running in snow/ice.  Salomon Speedcross is also a good option - I especially like the goretex upper to help keep feet a big warmer and dryer.  Any trail runner will have a more aggressive tread and be more effective in the snow than regular shoes.  YakTraks are another option, though I haven't found them to hold up very well (the rubber starts splitting after a run or two).Snowmobile trails don't scare you? I would think they are even less likely to expect someone on foot than a car.I went on the road last weekend.  A lady in a minivan thought I shouldn't be on the road and she didn't move over at all.   Felt the side mirror brush me.  Screw people ..I'm sticking to the snow mobile trails...Went out last night and had to do the first quarter mile in waist high snow.  Once on the snowmobile trails only need spikes, just really hard getting there.  :)I do know its a good post-run drink. It contains more potassium than a banana.You could always go to a running specialty store, tell them what your old shoes were and tell them that you were looking for more support. Then tell them you tried the Adrenalines and wanted to feel the road more... Maybe they can suggest a happy medium. Some stores even let you run outside in front of the store for a bit to try out the shoes.I'm a type 1 and also run (you can find me on smashrun, strava, garmin connect, just search for sidetone).
I like to use energy cakes to keep my blood sugar level above 160 during my runs. They are made of oatmeal and syrup and come in different flavours (www.energycake.com - it's in German, but you can see what the cake looks like).

I have to admit I'm getting a bit sick of oatmeal now, but its the only thing I have found that keeps my blood sugar high enough during long runs.
I first tried using those energy gels, but the glucose is released into the bloodstream too fast, and I found I had to drink around 3 gels for 10km, and sometimes I would still be hypo at the end.

You are going to need to test your blood several times during a half, I would suggest every 6 to 8km (4 to 5 miles), perhaps more often in the last part of the race - as you know, you might not notice that you are hypo as the symptoms are disguised by the exercise.

I forgot to mention, I use a pump which means I can reduce or increase my insulin intake pretty much on the fly. Are you are using injections?It's weird how mild it's been this year. I mean, split shorts and a singlet in February? Every day? Crazy. And it's going to stay this way for another week at least? Looks like I need to get all the shorts out. It makes sense that it would drain your battery quicker. It's constantly sending information to your phone, and your phone is constantly sending information.

You could always get a small battery charger for your phone and tuck it away.Picked up a used FR 620 for $250 off ebay with the HRM and strap.  Data is awesome!Hey. Not all of us can live in the tropics. Some of us can only afford a small shack in the wilderness of the Alaskan frontier.

Quit your braggin.Cool, thank you!Nice, thanks!You sweat to cool your body off. The hotter you are, the more you sweat. So, if you're inside, you'll probably sweat more than when you're outside. If it's hot, you'll probably sweat more than when it's cold. If you're out of shape, you'll probably sweat more than if you were in shape.Hahaha I actually have the opposite issue, I feel the road a lot less with the Adrenalines... And I don't think I like that. :( I bought them wanting a more supportive shoe but I guess I shouldn't have tried to fix something that's not broken? Oh well.I've been running on the Minuteman Bike Trail in Cambridge/Arlington a few times a week and they've been doing a pretty good job of keeping up with the plowing!Damn you.  I was going to use the temperatures here in the ATL (27 right now (-2.7C) as an excuse to not run today.  You have now guilted me into getting out.

Subnote: original New Englander who used to regardless.  Now my blood is thinned after so many years in the South: I was walking the dog in 30 degree (-1 C) weather in a parka with gloves on a couple of nights ago and my hands were numb when I finished.  Embarrassing: that used to be sweater weather in Maine.

**Update**:  Did go out.  It wasn't too bad, up to 30 when I left.  Still cold now that I'm back.  And to think that in a few months it's going to be 90 (32,2C) in a few months.Just got back from my 9 miler with a windchill of  -16* in Ohio!Beef.

Quinoa.

Ham.
BACON.Ah I was thinking monthly. They can really find a $1000 purse on a weekly basis? I wouldn't know. It's been unseasonably warm here lately with more mild temps in the forecast so I don't really know. Ahhh that's good to know. Yea I think it's my feet, read lots of positive reviews before I bought them. My usual shoe is much lighter/minimal, but I was hoping I'll get used to it. No actual pain with the Adrenalines, just feels... off. Cold.  If temps hit 20*F it literally feels wonderful outside.  For most of Feb temps have been single digits to low teens with wind chills making it feel negative temps.  That is from where I live about 30 minutes north of Concord.  I was more worried about the different levels for me.  I don't recall ever sweating this much during my long runs in the past.  The only thing that has changed is my age.Nope, my usual shoes (puma faas 300) are more on the lightweight/minimal-ish side. Sounds pretty silly now, but I thought having a more supportive shoe would give my legs a break. :/  https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=winter&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq#wiki_winter_gear_.28at_or_below_freezing.29Hey Op, any rec you can make on shoes built for snow? I run outside year round, even this morning at -1, but there has been a lot of snow this year (unusual for Baltimore). Cold is no problem for me but wet/slippery definitely is. Just curious what trail shoes other runners turn to in this.I drink lots of water when I am running and feel no ill effects at then end. I don't find a lot of salt on my skin so I am not losing any minerals to the sweating (normally when I run outdoors, I eat those electrolyte jelly beans to keep the levels up but not when I am on the treadmill)Well, I know when I am sparing in TKD, I am wearing my uniform and gear and that doesn't breathe at all.

I guess I will find out when I do my first outside run in the coming weeks.Awesome!  Thanks so much for the info!  I think I'm ready to purchase!
Looks like ankle injuries that lay you up for a month, only to reveal that the fall screwed up your knee worse than your ankle.  But maybe that's just my luck.Its indoors so I am just wearing shorts and a running shirt, the same what I would wear outside on a warm day.Well Im not too worried about convenience over watch functionality.  I like the possibilities with the polar watch as well.  The software was my main concern.  So I'm assuming you are using a polar?  How has it held up are you happy with it? Why does your daughter look like a cat with down syndrome?I don't worry about it unless I'm going to be out there for over two-3 hours, then I carry electrolyte pills.Good for you dude. I am getting out once a week for my long run no matter what (I'm in Boston.)  Usually the Charles is ok from the Museum to the BU wooden bridge, but a few weeks ago I started further up the path near Watertown, and had to bail out onto the roads in Allston/Brighton.  It was an interesting 12 miles of almost getting killed on the streets.

Going 13 miles tomorrow morning - 7 degrees and ice?  Fuck it, I'm a runner.I agree. I am not a fan of Gatorade when running.Sierra Nevada Nooner = great recovery drinkIt was the worst!!! LA MARATHONERS took to social media and let the world know lol

But it was terrible, it was about ever 4 miles and sometimes 6!!!!That's no fun. I'm surprised that so many people say "Gatorade" here, as I often feel that is the thing that gives me a bit of bloat. Additionally, Nuun has no added sugar, which helps avoid the blood sugar spikes/crashes of Gatorade.Actually feel more hydrated then when im using gatorade, water, Nuuns or other sports drinks and mixes. I know some people may say they have not seen any difference with using it but, I have been using it almost a year and the benefits I love.

When drinking it and running 20+ miles on the street, I have never crapped once. When I forgot my coconut water for my last marathon, I drank water and gatorade from the satation, with  non caffeine gel pack and I cramped up after mile 17 atleast 2 times per mile. by the way, im a health nut and I know I ate well a week before the race, but im no scientist :)

IT WAS THE WORST

I just look at it this way. Its an inhanced water that does the job for me.

I think you should try it out!They should be about every ~2-3 miles.  I'd definitely hit up the race director about that. I can only imagine the problems I'd encounter.I still LOL when I watch that.  Filmed right down the street from me.  Sorry she got hurt...but omg irony that it happened after her comments.Kinda just depends on how much you value the watch hardware over the more convenient way to get your data to your website of choice.This video never gets old I like the flavor of the Nuun's but they seem to make me bloated. :( Usually just water but only really bother carrying any over about 15-20 miles. In ultras I tend to get a cup of coke at checkpoints later in the race5K PR 23:57!How do you stop from getting cramps with just drinking water? Are you taking anything else to supplement your sodium intake?No problem. Im  still curious as to what you might be able to tell me about coconut water compared to regular water though!&gt; Tecate

HAHAHAIf the 30s are like the 27s I might have to check those out next. and save like 50 bucks because its an older model. But Im not due for a new pair for a little while. Thanks for the info though! Always good to meet a fellow Pegasus fan :)Oh great, I didn't realize that. I Ran the L.A. Marathon last year and the gatorades stations for some reason were far and between. Many runners complained about this after the fact. I never had that many cramps in my life!I sweat so damn much its ridiculous. The only thing I worry about is how much water I lose over my run and if I'm loosing a lot of electrolytes. I think if you lose more than 2% body weight your dehydrating so I would worry about that. I like what /u/TehCreedy had to say. I ran my first Half Marathon last weekend after completing the Hal Higdon Novice 2 program, and it was a fantastic run. I ran track and CC throughout high school so I do have some experience running but I hadn't been at it regularly for the last 3 years or so. I really felt like the Higdon program was the perfect way to get back into running. Happy training!I ran in that mess this morning.  It was miserable, like running on 2" thick partially crushed ice cubes.  Power to you, but I'm gonna stick with treadmills when it's anything but plain snow.AWESOME ! Thanks for the great shareI take food. &gt;  Of course, it helps that there are no fans when I am running on the treadmill to cool me down.

That makes a pretty huge difference.  In addition to it just being hotter, you might be sweating the same amount, but it's just not able to evaporate.&gt; Tailwind

I have to check that out! Thanx!
I trained for my first marathon with it and I forgot it in my hotel!!! So now im mixing it with Gatorade in some of my bottlesYou could be overdressing on your winter runs.

Sweating more can also mean you are more fit.I thought about using Cytomax but never got around to using it. Will try it out!nope, don't think its like hyperhidrosis.  Its just more than I am used too when running.  Of course, it helps that there are no fans when I am running on the treadmill to cool me down.They do have other jobs.

And I question making $1000/week "easily" at a restaurant, especially for someone who likely doesn't speak great English and doesn't fill out a uniform.Braver man than, I, fellow Granite Stater.  My lungs can't take it below 35 or so...But if you're over here you could easily make that working in a restaurant, but I guess maybe they have other jobs too.Unless you have trouble meeting your protein needs from your regular food, you don't really need to "take" any. I was the same way 2 years ago, you'll wind up going more and more.  Keep up the good work.Ran in the Austin Half Marathon last weekend.  2nd fastest time ever.  Only beaten by the 3M Half Marathon (which is a much easier course). Unless you're sweating a bunch sitting around watching TV, can't say I'd worry about it.  Surely creaky hip flexors!
Yep: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!31s feel a lot like the 29s. I don't know all the technical details, but the Zoom plate is thinner than the basic Air unit for a more responsive low to the ground feel with equal cushioning.

Even though most reviews said the 29s were the same as before, I thought they were noticeably different (better for me personally) than the 27s and 28s. Also, the 30s seemed to return to what the 27s and 28s felt like. I don't know the numbers or specs, just how they rode for me.

31s are more like the 29s, but I personally like the 29s more. I had stocked up on them at one point and was happy to discover a brand-new pair that I didn't know I still had, so I've made them my marathon race shoes. I had hoped that the 31s would feel the same, but not quite. Maybe the 32s.

Definitely try the new ones before deciding. Many people said the 29s weren't any different, but it was pretty significant for me. Probably the small changes were just exactly what my mechanics needed.There is no "normal" amount of sweat. Everyone is different.Maybe hip flexors?

Bus seriously: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!Absolutely could have run it faster. I think probably low to mid 2:5x's. I never really put in a race effort, actually that's about my long run pace although it felt easier at the time since I didn't have any workouts in my legs.

This is technically my 3rd. I tried one on mile training 2 years back. Bonked really hard and death marched it in. I never really recovered, then tried to run Chicago when I was starting to feel fresh. Hammy locked up, stepped off the course at like mile 21.Tecate sport beverage.I would disagree on the latter part. Running IS fun. I learned that a while back and I also learned that some runs are glorious and some are horrible but over the course of logging 2000 miles you come to love the hobby itself. But I find that things tend to work better for me when I feel like I am making some sort of progress and there is indication of self improvement. I know that doesn't go for everyone though. But for me goals are important.Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!Yeah, I hear you about focusing on the health aspect. Funnily enough that's whats taken the steam out of my running lately. I have started going to the gym more and cutting back on my runs to fight injury and develop other neglected areas. But I can't find the same joy in the gym that I found on the trails! Good luck on your upcoming marathon!Nothing. Gatorade when I'm doing intervalsThat's what they do, race a few times per month. Halfs are pretty easy to recover from, so they get flooded with talent. Couple hundred here, maybe a grand or two there. The faster guys usually go to Europe and run the track circuit, great money.

Sometimes they get appearance fees, hotel and travel also can get covered by the race director. They get bonuses for performance from their sponsor and maybe a stipend.

You'd be amazed at how far something like 10k goes when you live in a shared space and have no expenses except eating. A lot of expenses subsidized and even eating is cheap when you all eat the same thing and buy in bulk. If you grow up poor, you know how to live poor. And doing so over here is a lot more lavish than over there.

I wish I knew more about it too, it's a crazy lifestyle.Do you think you could have run it faster? I looked at your strava and I'm either a LOT farther from a 3hr marathon than I thought or you could have held closer to 6:30 for the race.


How many marathons have you done?All very good suggestions. Triathlons are out because I can't swim but off road and ultras sound pretty exciting.&gt; Aren't Adrenalines mainly motion-control/support shoes?

They are.Yeah good suggestion on the shorter races. I have been thinking of doing that for a while and also try to work on my mile time. I don't think I did the marathon to say I did it, I did it to go further than any distance I had run before and I actually enjoyed the training by itself.Marathons: Water + Honey Stinger Gels;  Or just straight Gatorade (technically the best all around option during a marathon since it's stocked and provided for you and contains most of everything you'll need)

Ultras: TailwindOntario runner here: It also helps prepare the boys for post-collegiate a lot better than the 5k does in the US. its not uncommon for freshman to mix it up in the OUA/CIS as opposed to in the NCAAYeah, thanks for the response. I guess I just need to remind myself how much I enjoyed running even before I started training for any races. I think I got too caught up in goals last year and need to just go back to running for the fun of it for a while.The 220 appeals a lot actually...In Ontario, boys run 7k and girls run 5kOne Nuun Energy tab (the cherry-limeade sort) dropped into a 22-oz bottle of water is what I drink. It seems to do pretty well, but trying to do this plus gels is a bit of a logistical problem. I am interested in trying Tailwind for that reason.I will second the Garmin 220. Awesome watch with all the features that I need and you can get it for $200-250.I dunno if polar has auto-sync with anything else, but you can export your run and upload it anywhere you want.  Takes an extra 30 seconds or whatever, but doesn't bother me much.

You'll find issues with any brand if you look hard enough.  I've seen a lot of garmin issues, but some of that is likely because they're the most common brand.You are missing the fact that the per capita income of Kenya is under $1000.

These runners are living well below the poverty line in the US so they can send money back.  They pool a bunch of resources with other runners to get cheap housing and whatnot.  They enter these small races because they can win money with training level work, so they can enter another one the next week (or the next day sometimes).  They work as a group to avoid flooding one particular race.  They get comped entries as often as possible.

There are a couple in the DC/NOVA area.  There is also one in Kentucky (near Bowling Green I believe).  There are probably a couple other scattered about.
Its a joke, a clever marketing ploy by Dole, who i think are a fruit manufacturer. Or at least that's what i took from it. Can you imagine a world where there is smart tech in everything?!?You probably don't need to go from 7 minutes/mile to 15+ minutes/mile to cover 25% more distance. 8-10 minutes/mile will probably suffice to get you fully aerobic for the full distance.If you don't have a prescription for that, then [you took the legal equivalent of cocaine.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act#Schedule_II_drugs)

Shitheads like you make it harder for people who actually need that drug to function.

**You need to be in jail.**

If you can produce a prescription, then you are ok and it also won't give you any real edge in the race.TehCreedy's advice makes a lot of sense.

I've always been more prone to injury and felt less confident about how much I can run when I try to use a plan that dictates how far I need to go for each workout.  If I just run without a plan and try to push myself to increase distances I do much better.

You have 5 months to increase your long run from 5 miles to 13.1 miles.  If you just focus on steady mileage and let go of the plan it might be easier.  Or if you need a plan it might help to compare some of the free plans that are online.  In general, the best all around watch for running only is the Garmin 220.  If you want a touch screen, additional metrics, and wifi -- then the 620.  Depending on how fast your 10mi runs are (mine tend to be just over an hour), you should be able to get a few days out of the battery.

That said the Fenix 3 (not really reviewed or battle tested) or the Ambit 2 or 3 are also solid watches that offer some stuff these don't have, namely battery life.I love running in the snow. Its when it starts thawing and refreezing and you get black ice on the roads it's a bit of a pain. There are a handful of Kenyans in Santa Fe who regularly show up to races here in CO and show us how it's done. Interesting article:

http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/more-sports/running/20091205-New-Mexico-man-helps-Kenyan-runners-7419.ece

How much can they really make off smaller races though? The rock n roll half in Dallas only pays out 1000 to the overall winner. You'd have to win several of those every month... am I missing something?You're right thank you all. To be honest it was more of an emotional drive which fueled me if anything. It is a stimulant though which is a cause for my guilt. I did feel its effects early in the race (slightly faster start than normal). The elite women's group is what really kept me going the last 6 miles ;)I've been on the treadmill to because the roads around me seem to unsafe with uncleared shoulders. Even driving feels unsafe at corners because you can see beyond the drifts without inching out.

However, I do have an outdoor race on Sunday. I'm really hoping freezing rain doesn't postpone it because I'm looking forward to running on the roads. I'd happily pay for no cars!

Edit - Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnddddd cancelled. Treadmill it is! Off to jail you go! You'll get no less than 10 years for such serious cheating. I read the whole thing... what?Really? That's awesome, I thought you did. I'll change the blogpost! Thanks!!Do you run on a treadmill?

Sounds to me like you are fatiguing the anterior tibialis.  One big cause is over dorsiflexion (keeping the toe of the foot pulled up toward the knee) and trying to keep the foot from slapping the ground - and for me personally I only experience this on a treadmill for some reason.  When you run try to concentrate on relaxing your footfall.I drink water. Sometimes I make a very natural mix of orange juice, water, honey and a tiny bit of salt. It's a healthy replacement for a sports energy drink (which usually contain a ton of refined sugar). I got the idea years ago from the '4 feet running' podcast. [Here is the blog post with the recipe.](http://4feetrunning.blogspot.nl/2010_06_01_archive.html) They also have a recipe for a gel on there.

I would like to try coconut water. I drink it from time to time when I'm not running. can you tell  me what the benifits are from drinking it during a run compared to drinking water?I ran a half with some Tailwind and really liked that a lot. Gatoraid and the like made me feel awful, bad stomach problems.Yup, probably saved him 60 seconds, max.I have this unreasonable notion in my head that if I were to run, say, 1 mile a day for a month, that once I try to bump it up it would be even harder than if I were to quickly get up to a longer distance. I'm not sure if this is because of a lack of patience or just an actual misunderstanding of how trainibg works. So you're saying that doing that may actually be a good idea?Even if it's low impact. [Be careful out there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2tA7fzugxM)Is anyone paying you? You paid to enter, take whatever you want (within reason), you're under no obligation to anyone but yourself. Mainer here, cheers mate! It topped 20 degrees yesterday, heat waaaaaave. I actually currently have 29s. They feel very different from the 27s I had before this. If the current model is even more different...I might have to switch shoes ;) Can you tell me what the difference is between Air and Zoom?Winter has been like that for me as well. I am always grateful when I'm half way done with my jog. My body starts feeling like a furnance and that cold wind starts becoming a pleasureNothing except during extra long runs when I drink gatorade.You can find it in the sewing section in places like walmart or hobby lobby. Good luck!I highly doubt Adderall fueled you to run 20 minutes faster physically. Don't feel bad. I'm a long way from being in danger of becoming an ultra runner!Are you prescribed Adderall? Does Adderall make that much of a difference? I used to take Adderall and the only difference I notice between then and now is that my heart feels less like it will explode and I'm a lot less thirsty.I drink water on runs.  For long distance races I'll drink what ever sports drink they have at the water stations.

Keep the old adage in mind: Nothing New on Race Day!

If you train with coconut water, you should probably race with coconut water.  But it'll be hard to bring enough for a whole marathon and they won't be serving that at water stations.Love it! I miss Vermont for this reason. I have a treadmill but I'd run outside in that weather in heartbeat. I am currently in MA and there isn't anywhere safe to run with the snow+traffic+uncleared sidewalks. My uterus might fall out!Water

Maybe a little sports drink if it's really hot out.Once you go race belt you will never pin again. :)My winter has looked the same with -20~ temps to boot and the running is fine imo. People look for excuses to be lazy.There are a lot of them. A lot. Not just Kenyan or Ethiopian, but there are Americans doing this too. Do you remember Christian Hesch? Here is a guy that got caught cheating, but he was banking about 45k floating around catching small races.

I know some of the runners from Zacatecas, one of them told me his story. Basically he discovered he was good at running, got involved with some monster group. They ran them until they broke, whoever was left they approached with "agents" who would setup their international travel/races. These guys take a huge cut of their purse and often encourage them to run back to back. They run them until they burn out and then pickup the survivors of the new group they are running back home. My friend is just cashing as many checks as he an and trying to send his money back home. His goals are purely financial, he doesn't care about PRs or competing on the world stage.

The hard part for these guys is that there is no money in it in Kenya. Way too much talent, so they have to hook up with someone who can get them races outside the country. You'd be appalled at how these guys get treated, often flown in hours before the race, no hotel room, no translator. I heard that sometimes Mexico will take a hefty tax off their winnings too, but it's still cheaper than living in the states. They race up and down Latin America too.

I don't know of any good pieces on it specifically referring to Kenyans, but here is a great one on the [American group in Flagstaff.](http://www.runnersworld.com/elite-runners/they-might-be-ryans). It's funny to compare the two groups, talent wise they are pretty similar and so is their lifestyle. But the Americans have options - they can get day jobs or choose another career path. They are there chasing a dream, the East Africans are chasing paper.

Don't get me wrong, not all of them have such a sad story. Some of these groups basically mirror a Hudson Elite or Hanson's type program. Runners really trying to take it to the next level. But there are a lot of young kids who get taken advantage of too.Water or an EFS mix. I rarely drink during runs. When I do it's a ~2:1 water:sports drink mix. Usually Powerade or Cytomax.

Find out what the race is going to provide (probably Gatorade?) and make sure to train with that a bit. Unless you're going to carry your own coconut water the whole way. Couch to 5k is a great app to get you started. The build-up to the 5k was just the right amount to keep me from being discouraged when I started to run out of steam. thought you hated tomatoesPegasus 31 went to Zoom from Air which is probably why you're feeling the road a lot more. Plus a little less drop. I like it, and it's still the good old Pegasus, but it *is* a little different.

I still think the Pegasus 29 is the Best Shoe Ever.It will probably be fine. But if you were doing 15 I don't see why you'd go with 18-20 after a layoff. I'd recommend doing 15 this week and if it goes well (which it probably will) do the 18-20 next week.Minimal impact. Get healthy. You just started your taper a little early, is all. Do your taper like normal. Do **not** try to "make up" any work during the taper. You'll be fine.Don't worry about things like fartlek and hill training. They are not not necessary for a beginner like you.

I tried My Asics for my first half marathon and it did get me over the finish line. However, when I look back at the plan, it was just not that good. In a way that it describes you to run very long pace runs. For instance, the 17km pace runs at the end of June and July are completely useless for beginners and I'm surprised not more people end up injured with these plans.

I would recommend Hal Higdon plans for first time half marathoners. Novice 1 is a very comfortable plan that will get you to the finish line for sure.

Pretty much the only workout I use regularly from the My Asics plan is the 'Build-up' or progression run. No watch will go 3-4 days with GPS on the entire time.  The closest you'll get is the Suunto Ambit 3 Peak, which is an amazing (but expensive) watch.  Most ultra runners go that route.That looks wonderful actually.  I miss NH (and their ability to clear snow off at record pace)I meant to get in on the Kickstarter or whatever it was they did but forgot and missed. I'm going to order some now and try them out.That looks really nice. I'd love to run through that.

What have the temperatures been like out there? As always, the "never change anything on race day" mantra applies.You will be fine I've been out for 2 weeks before and had race 3 weeks later as well. Really no effect on my time and I was able to get back into training pretty quick. You don't lose as much fitness as you think. ;)Well, Im sure you're right. But maybe not in the forecasted conditions. If OP is used to running with X amount of clothing in those conditions, OP probably should go with what OP knows.

FWIW, I'm a "less is better" when it comes to racing. Especially in the rain where wet clothes weigh you down. But who knows about OP. Mile 6 of a half marathon is a bad time to wish you'd worn more, is all.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnQ_mp9TzZYDid she say to stretch cold muscles, or to stretch before you run? Because those aren't the same things.Depends on the windbreaker, I have some I wouldn't do it in, and some I've done it in plenty of times.
That's the norm in Britain, segregated sports classes, surprised it isn't worldwide? Making girls have to compete with boys who are physically stronger is both unfair and dangerous...Glad someone is getting out there. I've stayed indoors on the treadmill for the entire month of February. I'd get out there but the shoulders of roads are non-existent in my town (also in NH) and it just seems unsafe. So glad I bought a treadmill right before all this snow.I love my RaceDots.

They don't slip. They haven't messed with the chip timing.

They do weight a little. You will notice them for a little bit, but you get used to them after a while.Maybe I'm a nerd, but I still wouldn't want to put little holes in my windbreakers.  The fabric is pretty delicate.I think the squishy sounds as he bit into the tomatoes were a great touch. Definitely making me believe I need one of these machines for my runs.It's different in the UK, girls run the same distance as the boys age group below them. I believe on track they're not allowed to run 400m, 800m or 1500m for an extra age group to guys too, and they still run 1500m sc instead of 2000m sc at u20 level.Naturally everyone is different but check out the brooks beast 14
True, nothing new on race day, I'd just think that OP has run in a windbreaker previously...Or shoestrings from old running shoes? A lot depends on issues other than just mass, but a good general recommendation for a heavy person's shoe is the Brooks Dyad. It's a neutral shoe with a ton of cushioning. I'm a little heavier than you and have been using the Dyad as I ease back into a running routine. I'm happy with it.Tempted to grab some of these. I normally use a race belt but I wonder if I'd like these even more.Depends on the runner. OP wrote

&gt; Which for me means wet weather gear.

so changing up would mean trying something new on race day. Which is a huge no-no.I want to share a quote made by a professional Australian runner in regards to a similar question:

&gt;
For the Kenyans, running is a livelihood. If youre a good runner and you can win a few hundred euro in a road race somewhere, thats more viable than working all year for a few dollars a day. For them thats why they run.

        I'm not saying that is the only reason, but it's an extremely harrowing thing to read.  It makes you think just how lucky we are to be able to be able to just run without the financial pressure of helping your family survive



If you trained properly, your time off for sickness this close to your race shouldn't effect you much/if any. You'll get better before the race and have a bit of time to get in the rest of your taper. You'll be fine.Use a race belt like triathletes. I do that for almost every race.Give it a try. Err on the side of caution. Only drink if you're thirsty. Don't try to "stay ahead of thirst." Re-hydrate fully after the workout and throughout the day.

Everyone is different, and I think I drink less than most, but I don't normally drink anything even on 20 mile training runs. Especially in the winter. Not saying you should do that, but just noting that it doesn't kill me.

In the end, just do it however helps you run your best.yep!If you think there's a lot of complaining around you about the weather, stay away from this sub. Apparently grown ass men and women go full on potato when the temps drop and it's mass hysteria if there is snow and ice in the forecast.Well, cars might explode. http://youtu.be/oUXj5bZcNaYA half marathon should be attainable at a reasonable effort throughout, so unless we're talking SEVERE conditions, with around-freezing temps and STRONG winds, I'd say drop the waterproof and go with a windbreaker of some sort.http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2014/11/winter-gadget-recommendations.html

If you want the tldr, that article has the guy's picks based on budget and use.  I suspect you'd be happy with the FR15 or TomTom.I am matched with a cute boy via the IR4 Siblings: The Unsung Hero's group. I can post messages to him on FB, send him swag and other things, and just be his buddy. He brother is ill and this gives him an opportunity to have his own thing and not necessarily have to be in the shadow of his brother's illness. I hope you like it. It doesn't cost anything, unless you do the virtual races, and there is no time commitment beyond what you are already running. Let me know if you sign up!My temperament is too phlegmatic to run long distances :'(oh no, I probably get about 8-ish hours of actual tracking time before it needs to be recharged. If I didn't use the GPS function, I'd imagine I could go for weeks without charging. Thanks!

Is that 3-4 days with the GPS on all the time?Started running again four weeks ago. Sticking with c25k. Enjoying the slower pace - think I took it too quickly last time.Hey fellow LA Marathon runner! I'm so excited for this year's race!!
I ran last year and am running again this year. I saw a lot of people eating their breakfasts at the start line area last year. If you eat something packable I'd say pack it in.
Sorry to make this be about poop, but, I'm going to make it be about poop. The one thing you might want to consider is if you need your breakfast to trigger the urge to go in the morning... If you do, 3 hours at Dodger Stadium is obviously enough time, but if you're finicky about using the portapotty or stadium toilets it might be something to consider. 7 sisters is a gnarly 12 mile trail race I think in Amherst.If they already sent the shoes, and you can't go try shoes on, you have those shoes now, and that's kinda that.  They might work, or they might be crazy uncomfortable.

Run in them and see if they work.If you were regularly doing long runs in the 15 mile range then doing 18 after a two week break will be fine, anyone that says different is wrong. If 15 miles was your one time longest run ever, then no don't try it.[This guy has reviewed pretty much every gps watch known to man! Very helpful site!](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/product-reviews) I have a Garmin FR10 and really enjoy it. Only draw back is that I have to charge it every 3-4 days.Mississippi just changed girls from 4K to 5K last year! you're right I should have mentioned I have depression also and this doesn't help lol  it's just hard to live a super active life and then not be able to grocery shop without pain. I am in awe of people that have physical disabilities born with or accident induced and keep going and stay positive. The thought of what they've had to go through definitely keeps me going. I've always put them on my shorts, so I can easily change top layers if needed along the way.I do get swelling on the anterior side sometimes especially when it's really bad so it maybe. The test does sound scary haha but I'm in the process of getting a referral to Mayo in Rochester where they have a department for CCS and if it isn't this then maybe they'll be able to tell me what it is. I just have another week of hoop jumping before I can get a referral. Thanks for your comment. I just was wondering if anyone has had an experience like mine. Thanks!I don't buy the argument that "running around a loop and doing the exact same thing over and over again" is boring and thus an excuse not to watch track. NASCAR is the exact same thing -- except races are 3 hours instead of 14 minutes -- and yet somehow that's popular.No just regular shorts over a base layer pants. I've always warn them number on my chest until now.  I'll give this a go (with elastic chest strap as a backup)thank you for your comment. That's the weird part about my condition is that I don't have those other symptoms and yep it's not exercise induced in the normal sense. This did all start from exercising but yeah I'm definitely not a normal case if this is what it is. thanks again! I've got a 22 mile training run this weekend. It's going to be fucking brutal on those trails. Negative temps, rock hard frozen mud pits, ice, snow, and a lot of restrictive extra layers. I don't want to do it but I'm not going to be getting any better by making excuses due to the weather. Everyone here has already said it but you just got to suck it up and do it. Dress appropriately, hydrate accordingly, and put in the miles. Remember that somebody else, somewhere else is training to beat you if you don't give it your all. I had string in mind,  but elastic is a idea. &gt; Im extremely depressed about this because Ive been trying to heal for over seven months now and nothing has helped.

You have no reason to be depressed right now.  If you get a positive diagnosis for CCS, that's huge.  The treatment is known, straightforward, and very effective.  Your days of trying everything and getting no relief will be over.You shouldn't ever feel like you have to 'break in' a running shoe. If it's not comfortable from the get-go then it's not for you. Usually they just find a way to place 1 or 2 slightly shorter trails. My home course in high school had a 1K loop through some woods. The guys ran it twice, the girls ran it once and the rest of the course was the same.Indiana is 4K girls, 5K boys in high school. 3K for everyone in 6,7,8th grade.i think it's only a few years old. it's a very hilly course. very.

where's/what's 7 sisters?I bought a product called RaceDots. Same concept. I love them! It was slightly concerning to see that split, I hadn't thought about what my 5k would be.I experienced the same thing last November. I ran a 50 miler and as I crossed the line around 8pm I stopped to take in the experience and went back to the hotel for the night. The next morning we woke up and left town and on the way out we were catching the tail end of the 100 mile runners who were just making the 30 hour cut off time. I still think back to how surreal it was. I had eaten dinner, showered, slept, woke up and packed, got breakfast, drove across town and these people were still out there, shuffling like they were 20 hours ago when I left the course. I don't know about anybody else, but I will be one of those people some day. Our races just went like [this](http://www.davenportschools.org/central/files/2012/11/pvmap5K-4K-.pdf), mostly the same but a small difference to make a 4k instead. I'm pretty sure most of the dotted line should be over the solid line, and the girls just skipped that loop on the bottom left.Maybe I'm finicky but I knew after my first mile and a half that my shoes weren't going to work. I put ~20 more miles on them while I figured out what to do and order different shoes.

Once I was back in my regulars it was like heaven the first step I took.Thanks. The mental aspect is tough for me since I'm not used to running for more than a few minutes. I was certainly delirious, after the race I started laughing about something and started laughing so hard I almost broke into tears. Weird.

As for goals for Boston, I'm not sure yet. 15 months is a long time, but I probably won't get into my marathon segment until the winter. Goal for the spring/summer is to get my 5k down under 16 again, I'm probably in 16 mid shape presently. Maybe low 2:40's?It was only two weeks. The chances of you losing a great amount of the fitness you had built up didn't just disappear over night (or 14 days). If you were running a comfortable 15 miles when you stopped, you are more than capable of doing 18-20. Just because other people got injured doesn't mean you will. Take it slow, listen to your body, rest when you have to, and stop when you need to. You want to do a long run after a 2 week break that's longer than what you could comfortably do before? Pass.

You might be fine with a shorter run, 10-13 miles. But pushing farther on 2 weeks of rest is a bad idea.Glad you enjoyed it.This is a great move. Though as the pic in the article shows, 4K has not hindered the Wayzata girls team from national success. I am for making it an NFHS rule to be at least 3 miles (if not 5K) for both genders in all states.  Ha cheers. Appreciate it.Thanks!Gracias!Haha thanks. Yeah, apparently I hit 20 in 61st, 23.1 in 51st, and finished 38th. Felt good to take some names.Been averaging about 30km a week. Generally a 10k, a couple of 7k and one or two 5k or less. Sometimes I do a longer one,  maybe 15km or so,  about once a month.

My shorter runs are usually speed training,  and my longer runs are usually slower paced with close attention paid to form I do have access to a treadmill, but I dread the idea of running on one for 2+ hours...I can barely make it through 1 hour.Hopefully the next step is to end gendered races.That would be a one way ticket to injury personally. It's happened to me before.I agree with you, on both points.  Firstly, staying active throughout the day does wonders for recovery (and for people who are susceptible to DOMS &amp; muscle soreness, things like yoga and pilates are especially good).  Secondly, duh?  What in the world were they thinking drawing the conclusion they did.

The internet is such a bullshit place these days, with all these Gawker/Buzzfeed linkbait type sites that pay authors by the article &amp; by the number of clicks.  I see so many ridiculous questions in this forum -- and practically every other forum that isn't so niche as to self-select for experts -- and I blame mass internet media for a lot of it.  Sure, you'll always have newbies, but they can either be like that greycavalier guy yesterday who knows nothing but is just super-enthusiastic ... or they can be like others who pretend to know everything because they "read it online".  I'm not sure whether the internet is making us smarter or dumber, but I'm leaning toward the latter.  If you define intelligence as the ability to learn rather than the volume of facts you know, then we're absolutely getting stupider.

Ok, rant off, sorry about that.  I'll close with something useful: tips on reading scientific papers:

http://violentmetaphors.com/2013/08/25/how-to-read-and-understand-a-scientific-paper-2/

http://web.stanford.edu/~siegelr/readingsci.htm

The high school I moved to in year 9 did 300 m races for girls, 400 m for boys. Same with the inter-school competitions that school participated in.

I had always thought it was weird.I run the first mile in a new shoe on the treadmill at the running store. I leave with the shoes if they feel great. I use calf sleeves and they have helped.

I got some of these to try out after my wife said they were helping her recover faster. I had bilateral calf muscles strains after a 15k in December. I took a few weeks off and wore these every day, even when I slept. Before I was 100% healed I started running again and wore them while I ran. I recovered faster.

Now that I am 100% healed I wear them for a few hours after I run. Since I have a garmin I am able to see my time before and after wearing the sleeves. I am running more weekly miles than I have in the past four years, without injury. The only downside is that I learned I could not run with them because after a bit they started to cause a weird anterior shin pain. pain went away when I stopped running with them.

They work, placebo or real I do not care.

it seems too high.
If you have not run regularly before, your HR should be 180-28 (your_age). [It](http://content.bandzoogle.com/users/cippianhotmail/files/Want_Speed_Slow_Down_2007.pdf) seems legit for me.It's not a matter of concern as far as your cardiac health goes.

However, as an occasional runner, you probably should try going very, very slow on your runs. That is, since you don't have a base of miles, running fast and getting out of breath isn't really helping your fitness much, and it might be making you prone to a running injury.

Run slower, enjoy the scenery. When you run more slowly, and more comfortably, you end up being able to run more miles. And guess what happens when you run more miles? You get faster, without even trying much to get faster.

When it comes to building a running base, "no pain, no gain" is baloney. Instead, try: "no pain? thanks!"That gave me tingles. A lot of people use the ["Maffetone Method"](http://philmaffetone.com/180-formula). He has a simple formula for determining a good aerobic/sub-lactate-threshold heart rate range for you. If you're interested in building a fully-aerobic base, then it's a nice, simple way to start.

Regardless of the method you use, chances are that you'll find that your new paces will feel a bit slow if you want to keep your heart rate in the appropriate aerobic range. That's normal, and it gets better as you put in more aerobic miles.

Edit: fixed the linkI've run two 100 milers, and I still feel like a newbie as far as ultra running goes (I've only finished 4 ultra events and been doing it for less than a year since my first event). I'd consider the defining attribute isn't just checking the boxes of the various race distances, but instead the time spent within the sport. Someone who's only run 50k and 50 mile races but has run many races over many years is definitely more of an ultra runner than I am

Also, anyone who racks up triple digits in time events gets a pass as well (100+ for 24 or 48 hours, or racking up 200+ in a 72+ hour event). That's like an auto qualification as an ultrarunner in my mind. This happens to me too. Or at least...it doesn't quite freeze, but it gets too cold for my liking and doesn't feel nice to drink it. So what I do is I put warm water into the bottles. By the time I need it, they're at a nice temperature to drink.Hadn't heard about these. I'm in Cambridge, but maybe I'll be out there. I'm running 7 sisters a couple weeks before this * If the shoe is very similar to one I know I'm comfortable with: 10 miles or less. Basically, you should know almost right away with these. There's very little need to "break in" decent shoes in 2015.
* If the shoe is causing me any pain or hotspots whatsoever: immediate return. No hesitation.
* If the shoe is significantly more or less minimal/maximal or has a different heel drop than what I am used to, I'll give it 40-50 easy miles to see if I adjust well to the different style, or if the shoe's just not for me. Again, actual pain = immediate return.

Edit: Aren't Adrenalines mainly motion-control/support shoes? Do you normally require/use motion control shoes (do you overpronate)?You need to learn how to juggle. In Australia boys run 6km and girls run 4km.I also ran high school CC in MN (boy) what was really weird was that the freshman girls raced 3K, the JV and V girls raced 4K and all the boys raced 5K.Pardon the colloquial names for these... but here's what my running group usually does:

zombie walk, knee lifts (straight up), knee lifts (with rotation, to stretch your hips), toe walks (toes in and toes out), cherry pickers, and strides.I have actually witnessed thunder snow twice in Michigan when I was younger, much smaller snowfall and they were both daytime. Weird phenomenon.By now you should definitely feel comfortable in them. I'm on my 3rd pair of of that model (11, 12 &amp; now 13) and each has felt perfect for me on the first run.

Not every shoe is for every runner. What do you usually wear? #####&amp;#009;

The odds are good that your local running or triathlete shops carry them.Yea I've seen people use those too. Or even an elastic band or string around their waist, attached to the bib. That would be a cheap and easy DIY alternative.Mens Roller Derby is played by the womens rules. Just an interesting point.Hi there. I battled a long term illness too. Before getting sick I was running 10 k's and even did a half marathon. When i started to recover from being sick...I could not even walk to the end of the street without feeling dizzy and needing to sit down. But like you, I slowly increased distance and intensity. I did a Couch to 5k program, then a 5k to 10k program...and now Im about to start a half marathon training schedule again.

You can achieve anything...though sometimes you just gotta be ok with going at your own pace. In my case it means taking a whole lot longer to build up to the distances than what is considered 'normal'. But that's ok.

My advice would be...find a training plan that fits you. Modify it to your own needs if you need to. Check out www.halhigdon.com and click on 'training' for a lot of free training plans. I like his plans so far, though I do incorporate walk breaks here and there (like he suggests too). And I definitely need a rest day in between the running days.Also...fill an ipod or your phone with fun music or podcasts (about running!) to make your runs even more fun. Or find a running buddy in your area. Get an app to track your distances and speed (like nike+ or runkeeper) or get a GPS watch if you feel like making the investment. I had surgery to fix my compartment syndrome in August; a mere 20 years after the problems started :(   Mine was in the anterior and lateral compartments which are the ones that are in the front and side on the outer side of the leg.

I could trigger the pain just by walking, but usually only when I was walking hard like uphill or fast like you would trying to catch a plane.  But like Turtleyay, I wouldn't have pain unless I went and did something to trigger it. I wouldn't have pain without exercise.  I can remember being fine playing tennis or half court basketball, but walking a mile uphill to get home meant spending 10 minutes lying on my bed waiting for the pain to go away.

If its CCS then when suffering pain the affected compartment should be swollen, but because its trapped in too small of a compartment and can't expand it will instead be full of pressure.  That part of your leg should feel firmer than when at rest (and haven't felt pain for a while).

One thing about CCS is that there is a very reliable test you can have done; they did it to me to confirm my diagnosis. Basically, they take syringe with a saline solution in it, stick it into the compartment and measure the back pressure.  For me they did it 3 times per compartment. First was to get a baseline measurement. Then I walked on a treadmill until I was good and hurting. They took measurements again and then again after 5 minutes. The test may sound scary but its not that bad; the compartment syndrome itself hurt more than the needles.Will your pants/shorts be waterproofs too? If not, attach the bib to your shorts on your thigh - much better for all occassions actually.Im curious about this too. What's different about it?

I have been buying the Nike Pegasus series for years. The most recent pair I got was 'different' in that they felt less sturdy...more soft and it felt like I was feeling the road a lot more, if that makes sense. I hated it at first, but got used to it after about 10 runs or so. It takes the shoes a few runs to form around the shapes of your feet. Plus the shoes might just vary a bit from what you're used to. What shoes did you have before the Brooks Adrenaline's? What made you decide to buy them? Im assuming you tried them on in the store. What made you like them?I've discovered it is better to warm up your muscles by moving them through their full range of motion instead of stretchingSomething like [these](http://www.amazon.co.uk/raceBIBup-Strong-Magnet-Cycling-Running/dp/B00KAL0NBK/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424431839&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=running+magnets) should do the trick nicely.Thanks for the advice!Agreed. On his website, don't click on the app like squares...those lead to paid training plans. There are free training plans if you click on 'training' and then find your distance.How is it "pretty different"? What is your other pair of shoes?This is a topic runners and athletes in general cant seem to agree on. Some think you should always stretch before a run, others think you should never stretch cold muscles. Even research varies.

I personally dont stretch cold. I usually just walk briskly for a few minutes and then I start my run. I definitely stretch after the run though. By then my muscles are warm and it helps to not feel so stiff and sore the next day. I do know runners who jog for a few minutes, then stretch, and then go into their actual run. That makes sense if you like to stretch. But I don't really see the benefit of that. My personal opinion is: never stretch cold muscles. It's like stretching out a really cold rubber band. It'll crack and snap rather than stretch.In addition to what the other replier said:

Wet the sensors before you put it on. If you don't do this, you might get a bad reading. It is not uncommon that it will read your cadence instead if you don't. Also make sure to place it correctly on your chest, tight enough that it will not slip down.

Garmin suggest washing the band after every 7 runs. Make sure you unclip the actual monitor before you place it in the washing machine. I think I will just continue to juggle my seven tomatoes, thank you. I don't race, but I usually run in the Trkenschanzpark. Honestly you probably don't need to worry about it- if you're thirsty, drink. If not, go run without drinking first. There's no point stretching before/after a run. Make stretching a routine of your week instead, reduce muscular tightness in your body.She's refusing the leeches, she's hysterical!Bro you can't stay on the couch for 6+ hours? Amateur. Iv am on week 7 of Hal Higdon novice 2 (2 weeks out from my half marathon and 9 from my full)

This week calls for 29 miles (4,7,4,14)

While the plan mazes out at 36mpw it would be a hard jump to go from 18mpw to this week.

 (Last week was a step-back week at 21mpw,  the week before was 24, this week is 29 and I am feeling it)

I haven't completed (or attempted) a full marathon yet, so I can't advise thereSlow down, dude. Going all-out every day is only going to wear you out, but there won't be much training benefit. Slow down to a comfortable pace, and then start increasing mileage. Do a truckload of easy miles for a few months, then see how fast you can run if you push. Incidentally, easy pace running also makes cold weather more tolerable, if only because you're not panting as heavily.If you know your resting HR and your max HR you can calculate your HR-zones. Once you've done that, you can look up HR based training plans. Garmin has some good HR-based training plans on their [website](http://connect.garmin.com).

If you don't know your HR zones you could check out this [reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/2whz3b/first_time_running_with_a_gps_watch_and_a_hrm_is/coraq54) I just made under another post.

Good luck!&gt; Doing stretching before is better than never doing stretching.

Debatable... AFAIK, research so far says that stretching increases range of motion, but there is no conclusive evidence that links increased range of motion to reduced injury rate or increased running performance.It's really hard to say if this is normal or abnormal based on the information you provided. Everybody's HR is different: for some people 140 bpm (or even lower) is an easy run, while for others it maybe 160 bpm or higher. Your HR zones are influenced by your overall fitness but also by things as your genetics.

You should check out what your HR-zones for training are. For this you'll need your resting HR and your maximum HR.

To find out your resting HR put on your hrm strap and your watch and lie down on the couch and do nothing for about 30 minutes. There are different ways to find out your max HR, like by doing a test at a physician or by doing some high effort excercices: [source](http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/how-use-heart-rate-monitor?page=single)

1. Be sure you're well rested, well hydrated, and well warmed up.

2. Run hard and fast for 2 to 3 minutes. Jog back to your starting point. Repeat two more times, running a little harder and faster each time. On the third and last repeat, pretend you're running an Olympic race.

3. Check your heart rate during and immediately after the last repeat. The highest number you see is your maximum heart rate (MHR).


Once you've got this data, you can fill it in on websites like [these](http://www.runningforfitness.org/calc/heart-rate-calculators/hrzone). Those websites will calculate what your HR-zones are.

Good luck!
For example. my aerobic zone is between 161-178 BPM. I have a fairly high max hr of 210 though. If you're looking for an app, you can download a calendar app on windows 8 that syncs with outlook, gmail, etc. I'm following Hanson's marathon method now and I have found it really helpful to schedule all my runs into the app with pace requirements in the notes, which syncs up to google calendar on my phone. Then I can see what I have coming up for the week/month/etc on the go and make plans accordingly.Can you fit 8.5 in Brooks? US8.5?1. Build a base until about 4-5 months before the race. Plenty of easy miles, master consistency and not getting injured, gently increase mileage, do strength training to avoid injury later. 10% rule is a decent starting point, but "Listen to your body" trumps that. Maybe get in the habit of doing a weekly long run already. And sort out form issues. Running every day is doable, but I recommend adding a few rest days to allow for better recovery and to avoid overtraining and injury. 4-5 days / week seems ideal to me, but find out what works best for you.
2. Find a suitable training plan that picks you up at your level. First week of the plan should look roughly like your typical week at that time. Higdon is recommended a lot, Daniels is good almost by definition. If you know your theory, you could also roll your own, but then, why not benefit from the collective wisdom that is readily available. Since you're only getting back right now, it's probably good to go with a "Novice" kind of plan that doesn't have too much speedwork.
3. Follow the plan, but again, "Listen to your body" trumps the plan. It helps to know some basic training physiology theory so that you know how to adapt your plan in case it doesn't work out for whatever reasons.totally agreed.  Luckily, I was D3 so I got to stick with the good ol' 8k all the way through nats.Pretty new to running, ex-fatty here. Ran 7km in 35 min on Sunday, 7.5km in 35 on  Monday, 8km in 40 on Thursday (yesterday). I wanted to finish at least 20 this week, and I did, but now I'm pumped to go again tonight! You are what makes the internet great.Thanks for responding! I guess what it truly comes down to is the fitness aspect. I want to be the healthiest person I know (which, granted, doesn't take much, but still) and know that I may not be good at much, but if anything is ever chasing me and someone else that I'll be able to outrun them. But I guess that's where the problem lies. That's not a very specific goal. And I do love breaking PR, to the point that I think that's why I get worn out because I push myself harder and harder every day I run and can't maintain patience. If I had someone to run with me and/or a nicer setup (not just on a treadmill with a white wall in front of me) to run on it might would be easier. I have tried running outside but my lungs can't take that when it's below 45 or the wind is blowing, so that causes an issue.

And you mentioned time, so would you recommend spending a certain amount of time a day running instead of telling myself "time to run 1.5 miles" and then killing myself to get it done ASAP?I'd like to add that women's D1 cross country stays at 6k all the way through nationals. I'm not quite sure why the guys change distance as it really changes the entire race. I believe there really aren't any 10k races except regional championships and nationals (at least for my team). I know I dislike the distance change and so does my coach, it's a tough trying to add another mile and a quarter at the pace we're running but we aren't able to race that distance until the end. It's like training the entire season to run a mile as fast as you can, then when you get to the finals it changes to a mile and a half, a race you really aren't prepared for. I dunno, I say stick with one distance and go.Oh puke.Not to get super Zen about it, but without a destination, every path you take is the right one. Which is to say that no, you're not doing anything wrong in your current approach, but that's mostly because you're not running for a particular reason. What that reason ends up being, however, is entirely up to you. Do you want to go accomplish a goal distance? PR on a regular basis? Just get and stay fit? Only you know, homie.

That said, some basic guidelines are easy. Varying distances should only come when you're adding in a long run, which you shouldn't do until you're consistently running 30 minutes, 3 times a week. Then start adding little bits at a time to a run on the weekend, and hey presto, you've got a long run and two easy runs during the week. Then there's workouts and additional easy runs and recovery runs, etc etc. Really the Order of Operations link on the sidebar says it much more eloquently. I would also advise against running every day to start out with, only because that can lead to injury if you're not ready to handle that workload. Keep running. Duck, dodge, pirouette, do a fucking handspring over the creep; don't slow down; stare the creepazoid in the eye as you go over, under, around, or *through* him. You nuts that advise running with a 17.5 oz can of Raid strapped to your ankle fuckin' crack me up. Do you ever actually get out of Mom's basement?  Also, wasp spray is prohibited from use "other than directed by federal (US) law" ie, on humans. Great way to end up standing in front of a judge. "Well, your Honor, he made a menacing gesture. What could I do but blind him for life?"  Politics!  LOLHey, congratulations!

Really good write up, you captured the essence of getting a little delirious really well. You had me rooting for you not to blow up.

Please do more race reports! Especially when you run Boston. Any early time goals for that after how this felt?This just reminds me of things like Kathrine Switzer and the Olympics of yesteryear.  Don't be afraid of the turn out of runners etc... you may be hit with lower numbers for a couple of years but it will be QUICKLY forgotten that you ever used to run shorter to begin with.  Running is a sport focus on the individual (largely) and anyone paying too close attention to what has happened in the past may become too afraid to blaze a new future.

It should be MANDATED in the essence of equality that all competitors from all states run the same distance.Everyone's gut is different during a run, I'd say just experiment and see what works well for you! Good luck!I ran a 50 miler last year which ran concurrent with a 25 mi and 100 mi race. By the time I finished it was going on midnight and I was so over running. I felt great but damn did I just want to go get a shower and go to bed. As I sat down to chill out for a bit and scoff down a boat load of calories a guy sat down next to me who was running the 100 and he was just half way done. It was freaking surreal. I would be in my hotel showering, sleeping, and probably waking up the next morning for my flight... possibly getting to the airport and leaving before this guy was going to finish. Don't get me wrong I'm proud as hell of what I accomplished but damn that's hardcore.Hi! New here, just browsing through some post and saw this. Where do these specific numbers come from? I've been running but doing the same distance every day and then upping that distance a half mile every week and seem to wear out quickly. I'd love to learn more about how you got up to those numbers. Since you have only run in a one set of shoes, you will not know if a different type will be better or worse.Doing stretching before is better than never doing stretching.  But, stretching before is the worst time to do it.Slow down.As soon as I saw 21:37 on the first 5k, i knew this was seriousVery fun. I think it's more scenic than anything.  As for running on concrete, there are Ragnar trails that you can sign up for if you prefer that. Although I do think it's running in a very large circle a few times as opposed to a different starting point vs end point.
Nice! I like exploring the city too. I'm about 5 days late but what the hell.

No, she didn't have anything left.Look up Hal Higdon training plans.  Some of my best performance I've done nothing more than walking from my car to the start line.  Never really got into the whole warm up or stretching before a run, I just run.I do get shin splints but it's just a form issue I'm working on and lack of running for many years.  Lunarglide 6 is listed on Nike's site for stability/over pronators so I assume that's why my parents chose that.Im also a runner in Ontario and the set up makes perfect sense. Makes the race more enjoyable for midget boys and girls and helps progress as the years go. Hello and welcome!

I'm the type of person who doesn't run/train for races very often, so my running is rooted in my routine that I have established. I do it because it keeps my physical, mental, and emotional health in check, and have been running regularly for 10+ years.

I run 4 days per week, on average: three mornings per week while my toddler is at school, and once on the weekend, while she is out with grandpa. My usual minimum distance for a run is 10 km, usual maximum is around 20 km. In reasonable weather, I can get a 5th run in if I take the jogging stroller out with me. I actually enjoy being able to do that, because I don't have to watch the clock as much- we can just go, and I don't have to worry about getting back to pick her up from school or be home by the time Grandpa drops her off. My girl and I have done a few decent 18-22 km runs together. Sure, that requires stopping a couple times along the way to give her a snack or let her play at the playground for a few minutes. But we love exploring the city and making a day out of it together!A 10k is definitely something you can achieve.   Try it out and see if you like the atmosphere.   They can be a bit of fun!!Nice!Thank-you! My cities own Marathon, the Brisbane Marathon, is only 10 kilometers however. Definitely achievable!!Lunarglide will give a little support for your pronation but not a ton. Its an alright shoe as long as you don't have shin splints or injuries of the like.Monday and Friday: About 2 miles on the treadmill
Saturday: Run outside on a trail. It's 3 miles, but I can run 2 and walk the rest.Phil Wharton's active flexibility is a great routine for stretching, warming up and injury prevention. His website is really informative check it out.Well a marathon is 26.2 miles.  Maybe try a 10k or half marathon first to see if you are interested in running that distance.  Some people get bored so if its not your thing don't worry.  If you are interested there are plenty of training programs online that can point you in the right direction.  You are doing great though!Women get everything easier.  Especially in military fitness tests. Wow..that's amazing. You have my respect for your efforts in running. I wish you luck in raising your children! :)Incredible! Same with meNot able to until my 5 months out here are over.That's actually regulation. If you get overlapped, you are supposed to automatically go to the second lane- at least in track.As anyone will tell you, go to a running store and have them watch you run. To be fair, running isn't too entertaining.  I could definitely understand a person who is really into running to be able to watch a mile-5k race because we understand the physical toll and training that that person must be going through and we really look up to that.

But to the layman, and really most people, its more or less just running out of the loop and doing the same exact thing over and over again. IMO, the 400 is the most entertaining to watchI had CCS. I won't try to diagnose you but I can provide a little insight in how it felt for me.

It started as just normal calf tightness. Then it progressed to a burning calf pain 8-10 min into every run. The calf pain grew steadily worse and worse until my calves were burning when I went up stairs or did anything that was remotely "exercise." My feet would often get numb and have pins and needles. I had surgery to fix it and it worked completely.

The thing about exercise induced compartment syndrome is that it is, well, exercise induced. If you are having pain without exercise, I'm not sure that this is the cause.

I would be happy to answer any questions you have. As someone currently struggling with a new mystery injury, I know this can be tough.
Kansas has yet to make the switch... I'm from Ontario, and the way it goes is 3k, 4k, 5k for girls (grade nine, grade ten, grades eleven and twelve) but for boys it goes 5k, 6k, 7k. I just always understood it was for times sake.I'd pack it in. If you have a routine that works, both gastronomically and chronologically, I wouldn't mess with it.I've read that light warm ups are enough to get your muscles moving, and stretching extends the muscles beyond what they would do in a regular run. So basically, no stretching is necessary.


My physiotherapist said that light stretching can help you detect strained muscles and might make you think twice about attempting a PR that day. Either way, I was warned against running without some kind of warm up and even walking for 5 mins is better than nothing.
Alwaysi know nothing about form, but holy crap she makes that look effortless.Absolutely incredible performance, and this coupled with her indoor 1500 WR last year certainly makes her a favorite for the 2015 World Championships if she can translate these performances outdoors. To put this into perspective, she went through the 2 mile mark (in the 5000) faster than Jenny Simpson did last week when Simpson set the indoor 2 mile American record.

The Dibaba family has to get the title for the "greatest running family of all time":

- The oldest of the three, Ejegayehu Dibaba has an Olympic silver medal in the 10000 m

- Middle sister Tirunesh Dibaba has 3 Olympic gold medals (5000, 2x10000 m) and 2 Olympic bronze medals, and was the first woman to do the 5000/10000 gold medal double ('08 Beijing), and is also the current (overall) world record holder in the 5000 m. She's also married to Sileshi Sihine who has 2 Olympic silver medals (and a number of World Championship silver medals... thanks to a certain Kenenisa Bekele).

- Cousin Derartu Tulu has 2 Olympic gold medals and a bronze medal (10000 m)

- Finally, now we see Genzebe Dibaba break both the indoor 1500 m and 5000 m records at the age of 24. I suspect we'll be seeing many more medals and records quite soon. Strangest race premium ever.I have a pair and wear them on runs when it is cold out. It's a compromise between keeping the legs "somewhat" warm and being able to move my legs without the restrictions that I feel come with running in tights.Hey I appreciate the response. But there can be pain, like if I'm jogging for a little while I will definitely have to stop and start walking. Also I did some calf raises today to check out what it felt like it and within 5 I felt it feeling tight, sorta sore, little pain. But it is not excruciating. I'm just nervous that on a 25 mile hike it might get shitty. I loved reading this!Me and a few friends signed up for one of these. We did the one in Tennessee that ran along the edge of the smokey mountains. We decided to do it as an ultra team and our driver backed out. Easily easily the most difficult thing I've ever done, (36 miles over 6 legs about 5 hours apart). Super underestimated the difficulty. Didn't help that it was about 20 degrees colder than average and we were not prepared. We've talked about teaming up again to do the Florida Keys one.

As a proud Kentuckian I should mention the Bourbon Chase, which I did this year for the first time. Takes you through central Kentucky with most of the major exchanges at various bourbon distilleries, which give you free tastings. Had a great time this year even though the weather was pretty bad. "If the inside of your knee is where the trouble is, you need to roll on your abductor."

Dude, your abductors are no where near the inside of your knee. That's a good idea, walking at the water stations would be a good way to keep the distance manageable mentally...  Ie only half a mile til the next water station vs 8 miles to go!Also: [another take on 'em](http://mmatrainingbible.com/2012/08/21/the-truth-about-gas-mask-training/) - spoiler alert: still bullshit. Looks fine to me. My goal, when running with HRM is to lower down heart rate while increasing the intensity of the workout.Seriously, the first result on Google: [they're absolute bullshit](http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/the-truth-about-hypoxic-training-and-oxygen-reducing-masks). C'mon, Victor Conte was the first pitchman for 'em.Agree - it is fascinating that they aren't limited by the aerobic system. It's clear her lungs could handle more, they just aren't the limiting factor - her leg muscles are.Update:
Session #7 (been ~2 weeks) - 5.04 miles in ~1:06 (13:14 pace), ave HR 134
Always on the same course - still have to walk on (most of) the uphills to keep HR below 139.  Still feels weird "running" so slow as cars go by, really want to speed up but I'm getting better at accepting the slow pace. Going to give this a good 12 week test.  Pace is pretty subjective. It may be easier to measure with a heart rate monitor, but the problem there is knowing what your maximum is if you're not used to running.

One rule of thumb is that you should be able to hold a conversation while running an easy pace. Remembering what it's like to run faster, this may seem like a shuffle to you.That would be my fear.  Either running farther than necessary or even worse, taking a short cut by accident and getting disqualified. In Ontario there is still a big difference in distances for gender and age.
Gr 9 girls run 3k
Gr 10 girls run 4k
Gr 11/12 girls run 5k
Gr 9 boys run 5k
Gr 10 boys run 6k
Gr 11/12 boys in 7k

This means that girls always run 2k less than boys their same age, and 11/12 boys run over twice what a grade 9 girl does. Haha. Thanks for the suggestion. I will need to experiment with that -- in other words, I will probably need to start drinking water before I head out for a run.Alright. I think I'll do the run/walk and keep pushing myself to run farther each day. I get that feeling sometimes when I'm marathon training because I find myself unable to try for PRs [other than the upcoming marathon] usually because the weekly load is so high.  I end up just being thankful for slow, easy runs and looking forward to my next workout... and always dreading long runs, because, well, they're long and boring.   2014 was my first year of semi-serious running and I had similar results as you (first half was 1:56, second was 1:38).  I ran a "casual" marathon, for which I was woefully unprepared due to ITBS and international business trips, and am currently training for my second (next month), but I lost all of December with a broken toe and am only now getting back to where I was at the end of November.  It's demoralizing.


I keep motivated with the thought that, even if I'm not PRing all the time or running nearly as fast as the next guy, I am doing the right thing for my long term health.  As for goals, I seem to go in waves where I set a long distance goal, then get fed up with all the running and decide to take advantage of the cardio base to afterward focus on shorter distance (5k or 10k) speed.I haven't ran for about 3 years nowHaha. That's very possible. I have been playing it safe to carry water with me on every run, just in case. :)I normally start drinking water during the warm up phase (instead of drinking before I head out for a run). But you could be right--I may not need water on every run. I might need to experiment with it.Suck it up and do it anyway. You might not get ideal conditions during your race. So, if it rains during your goal race you'll think, "well, this is easier to deal with than wintery mix. I got this".Running is fun.  I think your problem is that you have not yet learned this fact.  Goals are totally unnecessary.I usually carry it on every run, although most of the time I don't finish the water I brought with me. My weekday runs range from 6-9 miles and weekend runs are currently at 13-14 miles. I usually drink water during warm up, cool down and the short recovery jog in between the 1-2 mile hill repeats. I like to bring water with me, just in case I am thirsty.The higher your fitness level the faster your recovery.  I run in the mornings after dropping the kids at school.  My normal daily loop is 7.5mi and my "normal" long run when I'm not in marathon training is 12-15 miles.  I *am* in marathon training right now, and I'm doing two workouts per week, usually one that's intervals and one that is either hill repeats or a tempo run.  On those days, I try to get in 4-6 miles *very* easy in the morning.  The workouts are at night.  I hate long runs, and I try not to have to do them solo.

I've averaged close to 50mpw when life doesn't get in the way, and about 40mpw overall (my kids are 4 and 6 and my wife works outside the home -- life frequently gets in the way), and I run 5-6 days/wk, 7 if I'm lucky.Nice post!  You are what I aspire to be in a couple years. :)I'm on day 150. Easy days are super-important. 4 days a week I run 3-4 miles at a really easy pace--for me, these days aren't exactly a rest day, but two of them in a row sort of feel like one..  I never push myself on these runs, and I often force myself to slow down. These days don't really put much strain on me and are also helpful in terms of building up my long-term aerobic base.  I do one long run (also at easy pace, of course) and then I have two workouts. Honestly, I think the workouts help a lot, because they provide some variation in the training, so I'm not just running at the same slow pace all the time.

The other thing that is helping is that every 4th week is about 80% of previous volume (for example, the last 3 weeks were 36 mpw, and this week is gonna be about 29 miles). These cut back weeks have been really helpful for me, sometimes, they come right when I'm starting to get a bit worn down (the December cut week was like that). After a week of reduced intensity, I'm super-ready for the next week of running!

Lowest mileage day: 1.5 miles (day 20) and I've had 4 sub-3 mile days.  Total mileage: 616 (28.75mpw, average). Longest run: 9 miles.  I'm very strict about limiting my long runs to 25% of my weekly mileage.Slow enough that you don't feel like death. 7 min miles are pretty darn quick if you haven't been running.I have heard the HRM are erratic when they need a new battery that's why I asked. That heart rate looks fine then.&gt; I ran cross country through middle school and ran track my first half of highschool. Back then I could easily jog for an hour or two and not get too tired. I got lazy though and now

When is "now"? 5 years later? 25 years later?What do you think a good pace is for me then? I've been keeping a 7 minute mile pretty consistently but I just feel like death around the 3/4 markIt is very difficult to slow yourself down. I have to be focused on my pace or I go to fast. There are usually some 6ks before nationals, though strictly speaking there is no standard distance for season races. Our guys' team sometimes ran races as short as 4k mid-season." never said April is winter"

Um, you Literally just said it was:

"Winter has another two months left here..."A few leeches ought to sort them out.What amazes me about world class runners is that they aren't completely out of breath and energy after they cross the finish line. Yes was a hard one, first time measuring my heart, that's why I was worried about it...Good to heard that it's normal, no was not an easy run, it's a hills zone, the second pic shows the elevation gain 92 m. I basically agree. Despite the shorter distance, the top 10/20/50 women end up more spread out by the finish. There's more disparity in women's running, an easily verifiable fact, and you simply don't need as much distance. Also, female runners run less mpw on average (even when training for the same distance in track), so it makes sense they'd be more suited for a shorter distance. The women's distances at track nationals are usually less entertaining to me because they aren't close races - some get lapped and still end up with all-American placings.

I am fine with running the same distances, it probably makes it easier on the course designers, but don't have a problem either way.Don't go out too hard!

I was in your position. When I started running again, it was frustrating that I couldn't go very far. I was going too fast.

You may even consider a run/walk routine, like Jeff Galloway advocates, to get into it again. My coach still has me do some runs as run/walk combos, and I'm a pretty decent runner.I agree. Max heart rate varies with age and from person to person, but my easy runs are about 140, too. Granted, it actually took a lot of practice and discipline for such slow runs to feel natural to me. Like many people, left to my own devices, I'd run my easy runs too hard.Hey District XI here too. What school?Today was day 150 of my streak.Going off what the other posters said, just make sure to dress appropriately and have a good attitude going into it. These kind of runs test you just as much mentally as they do physically, and completing them can help you take the next step in your training. About a year ago I did a 15-miler through NYC (Manhattan and Brooklyn) during snow / sleet, and I still think back to this run as motivation going into hard workouts.

Also, although this gets a lot of flak on this sub, you could do this run indoors if the weather is really bad (assuming running inside is an option). It's not worth taking a fall and getting injured or even going much slower than target pace, just so you can say that you completed a run in inclement / dangerous weather. At my school the boys run 10k and the girls run 5k. I think this is silly because the girls are just as capable of running 10k as the guys. Was this a hard run? Were you pushing yourself? I am new to running with a HRM. But, a easy run puts me at low 140s BPM. Pace will vary between people based on individual fitness.Younger girls at Milaca ran 2 miles, it's a weird meetI agree with Mjern ditch static stretching they are abnormal movements and keep brisk walking it and light jog get all that lactic acid broken up and blood pumping to the muscles. You are way overestimating your odds of dehydration, especially when it's this cold out. Gut. It. Out.That's a perfectly fine heart rate, just too high if you're just going for an easy run. Slow it down. You should be able to speak in at least sentence fragments when running at easy pace.Yes. You probably want more miles to run a good half. More total miles and longer long runs. But with the race only a few weeks away you're pretty much set with what you've got.You probably don't really need the water during the run, especially in the cold. Everyone is different, but it seems to me that most runners overdrink by a fair amount.No not before. Not static stretching. At least not without a decent warm-up jog first. Studies have shown that it hurts performance and doesn't seem to do anything to help.  Some people do dynamic warm-ups before they run, but I don't bother with that either unless something is very tight. (For reference, I think I last did it in July or August.)How far do you go that you think you need a Camelbak?Post of the week. We need more of this. So much fun to read. Congratulations on an awesome race!TexasYeah, brain is bait fuzzy from running in negative temps here. Sorry. Shaving time off a 13.1? simple is beautiful. thanks!You shouldn't have to take your hydration pack or any other water with you on every run. Especially in the cold- your body doesn't need constant hydration.Yes.  The video is designed for someone not interested in running.I don't worry about shit.

I don't really track mileage (sometimes I use badger miles, but I mostly train by minutes).  In peak training I would guess 70-90.  Right now it's less though.

Mostly just run easy 30-40 minutes in the morning, and then do a "real" run (45-60 min) in the evening most days.  90 min long run on Sunday (always do only one run on Sunday, hence 7-13 instead of 7-14).  It's pretty simple.

I don't like running for longer than an hour and a half or so.  Maybe to my detriment.  But I just don't enjoy it.  So I don't do it!Jersey?if you actually don't have the time, I would run the shorter runs quicker, probably alternating hard work / recovery days. If it is just a matter of preference, you should just increase your mileage. If you worked up to ~50 mpw with 1 tempo run/week, you'd have massive improvement in a few months.Good call.What a great post! Congratulations! I signed up to run my first half marathon at the end of April, and I am so nervous/excited. I had been running 6-7 miles for the last couple of years as well, and participated in a relay a year and a half ago, but 13 straight seemed crazy. You finished with a great time, too. I have no idea what sort of time frame I am looking at, but I am excited to just finally do it. Thanks for sharing!You don't worry about overuse? How many miles per week?good idea! thanks.Thanks!Glad to know other people werent totally inactive during "no run" times and it was okay.  I hate sitting still.

Thanks for your advice.!  Blow the water back through the tube after you drink.I'd recommend grabbing "The Stick" if you need to roll on the go.I started running again in the beginning of January after a long break (four months, though I was barely reaching three miles before). I am finally starting to tack on miles, and it really feels good. I had the simple goal of doing 5k distance in under ten minutes per mile. Did it a couple weeks ago and was pretty tired. It helped motivate me that much more, meeting a simple goal, and I've been running more often and upping my mileage In a healthy but steady fashion.

Today I ran 5km at about 9:10/mile, and despite feeling spent I really felt pretty good. Running finally feels like it's getting easier. It's always been a chore that I wanted to like, and I feel like I've finally broken a barrier. I'll be up to about 14mi this week with a long run of 4.5mi, and I'm pumped.uhhh...there is such a thing as bad weather. Do you want to run in [thundersnow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsOJTfBIs4)?Just beware of any recommendation for inserts.  You *may* need them, but it is *highly* unlikely.Ok, but wouldn't it be irrational of me to just take the word of one random guy on the internet who says "they're bullshit" than the 500 people who actually give detailed reviews?

It sounds like they don't recreate altitude conditions, but do limit your oxygen intake and help you adapt to higher altitudes quicker than if you don't use them.

If you have any solid evidence or studies that prove they're bullshit beyond just *stating* that, then I'd be genuinely interested to see it.Not everyone is American. It's available in Canada. I would recommend looking into ultra's, some off road running and definitely triathlons. Triathlons really keep you engaged and even more so if you have a weakness like swimming you can really focus on that and stay motivated cause its very challenging. Good luck!People do not run marathons for the health benefits.The masks are bullshitjust because people are idiots and rate them highly doesn't mean they do anything. They don't create altitude conditions and they have no real benefit (again, unless you really want to look like Bane).Yeah, I am totally insane!It's insanely uncommonlike less than 1%.7-13 times per week!? Wow, that's crazy.I want to like this, because "healthy runners walk" is something that I'm totally on board with.  I think that the 2 miles per day that I walk my dogs has a huge impact on active recovery, walk breaks during training have helped me build up mileage quickly after periods of non-training, and I think &gt;3hr marathoners can benefit from taking walk breaks during racing.

But, alas, logic prevails.  My personal rule: whenever I read an article that is based on the results of a study, the first thing I do is **read the study**, or at least read the abstract.  Luckily, with this one, the full-text is available: http://www.jssm.org/vol11/n3/17/v11n3-17pdf.pdf

So in reality, they studied two groups, one that trained **ONLY ON THE WEEKENDS** and one that trained five days per week, interval training 4 days, and continuous running one day.  In addition, their interval training was high intensity, not the galloway method.

Guess what? Training 5 days per week is better than training only on the weekends.

No matter what you do, I'm pretty sure that 5 days per week of running is better than 5 consecutive days sitting on your ass.

The real goal of the study was to compare the effectiveness of training after work (they actually called the 5-day group the "after work" group) versus being a weekend-warrior.  It had nothing to do with whether walking during marathons is more effective than not.

The article's conclusion is not supported by the study that it is based on.  This is yet another case where pop articles based on scientific research completely betray the research that they claim to purport, much like the recent infamous "strenuous jogging" articles.If you have a gift card, check out the fly knit lunar. They're just about to bring out an updated version that should be great. Both versions so far have been wonderful and I'd highly recommend them. thanks for the tips. I was actually going to stop by fleet feet next week. A friend told me that they can help you look at your gait and running form. With such low mileage, it'll benefit you more to just run more. Speed will come naturally.You could mess around with Triathlons or adventure racing or something along those lines. Changing things up might help with injury prevention?I think a lot of this stems from the fact that most people simply don't care about running. Its sad, but just compare your local Friday night football game attendance to a Track and Field meet.I think you should try a 5k or 10k.

A lot of people think marathons are cool because of the stigma around them, but shorter races are a lot more fun. To me, it sounds like you ran those marathons because you wanted to say you ran a marathon, and now you have and there's nothing else to do. Mix it up!Pro-tip. If you aren't used to run/walking, don't randomly decide to do it for a marathon. In perhaps the worst decision of my running career, I decided to go for my marathon PR of 3:30 while running with a Galloway method pace group. So instead of my usual, "run 4 or so miles at a 7:55 pace, take a walk break for 15 seconds to drink/eat something, then kick back in", I found myself running at a 7:20 pace for 4 minutes, then walking for 30 seconds....for 26 miles. The first 20 miles went ok, then the muscles on the top of my knee cramped up so bad I had to walk the last 4.5 miles stiff-legged. Bad idea.I thought EC stack was illegal?That would be approximately nobody here.Why is it common for your chip not to be read on either?Physical Therapist! Physical Therapist! Physical Therapist!The video shows some of the problems with running today:

* Inane useless commentary.
* They assume we would be too bored to watch an entire 14 minute race and they need to shorten the video.
* While the runner is on world record pace, they cut away to show some no name pole vaulters.
* Stadium more than half empty for a world record performance.
"And maybe you all just don't give a fuck and hate any post that doesn't shave time off your run. I like running for the quiet time, community, and endorphins I get to experience. To each their own."

Actually there are weekly stickied threads devoted to posts like that:

No need to act like a petulant childI mean I knew the times and such were split, I just mean that it was the same course here, I should have said gendered running courses. Trying to picture my highschool having a "boys only" course and a "girls only" course is weird in my head.Sounds great! I know my city does have a yearly marathon. Maybe I'll consider joining it soon :)/r/fitness is just about the furthest thing from a general health forum you can get.A marathon is 26.2 miles or 42km.

Other common distances for road races are 5km (3.1 miles), 10km (6.2 miles), and half marathon (13.1 miles or 21km).  And there are plenty of races out there that have inbetween distances.

Training for a peak performance at shorter distances can be just as exhilirating, and have just as much of an impact on fitness/conditioning, as training for longer distances can.  Don't jump to the longest distance just because you think it's more "hardcore" (if you naturally like longer distances, that's A-OK though).

I've done all distances, and my personal favorite is the 1 mile, but as a recreational adult runner, it is more difficult to find mile races unless you live in specific areas with good "all-comers" track meet series, so I mostly end up running 5k road races.

To answer your original question, I run 7-13 times per week, 4-16 miles in distance, am not a professional (I think there's only one regular poster here who could be considered a true professional).

As far as this:

&gt; And if so, what amount of running would you say would be sufficient?

I will revert to my smartass heritage and answer your question with a question.  Sufficient for what?That's a single specific instance, and I bet you're getting right back at it and maybe even planned it as a rest day. Someone who can't find a couple hours a week (and let's be serious, it doesn't take much time to train for a 2:30 half marathon) for something clearly doesn't prioritize it.Glorious!Tightness (there is no pain?) is not tendonosis (it may lead to tendonitis/paratenonitis, which may lead to tendonosis).

It's good that you're on top of this early, and I would recommend taking action to relieve the tightness.  IMO that means: stretching an deep tissue massage.  While you can't really take a foam roller backpacking, you can still do the stretches and manual massage of the calf muscles.

I don't think that there's any real risk with taking the backpacking trip.

I would not cease activity just for tightness.I want one!The terrain I run in is usually roads (some of them with cracks), concrete paths (with occasional puddles of water/dirt etc), and grass areas out the front of properties which I run beside. I really don't mind running through grass or forest though...it makes my imagination think I'm on some sort of mission or quest..exploring through unknown territory..fighting to survive! &gt;:E

Also, in terms of goals...not sure. Even though if you were to look at me, you would say I'm thin, or well toned..I still want to get that exercise and training. Maybe I could join an endurance race/marathon soon. Do you know how much distance those usually cover?

Thank-you for the welcome :DI usually do 6-10 kilometers twice a week on weekdays and 15 kilometers and more during weekends.

It's different when preparing for a race. The pace is faster, the distance is longer, and there are more runs.That's bloody fantastic! I usually run every second day because I practice Aikido on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and since I have a high metabolism and a more lightweight body in terms of fat and muscle, I need more time to rest and recharge.Wow, a Milaca reference on reddit... didn't expect that one. I assume you hit up the unclaimed freight store after? Running makes me feel good and focuses my mind. Even on the days when i don't feel like it, it makes my mental state positive after so i go out anyway and take it easy.

If you aren't enjoying running then try something else. Cycling or swimming have merits.Welcome!

6-7 times a week.

3-6-9 miles in distance.

Not a professional.

All the running. I never understand people who say this. For instance, I didn't run yesterday cause I just had a huge test that I was studying all night for. Running is still a priority of mine, just cause I want to get A's doesn't mean I'm not a "real runner." Congrats! And that was a fun read.Yup, they're redundant mats. If your chip doesn't read on one, it'll read on the other (ideally). Welcome!  We are so excited to have you here!  As for me: I'm off my feet with a partially torn Achilles.   From a non running related incident.  Lol.  I used to run about 50+ miles a week but will be building my base up as soon as I get the all clear.  But no matter.  The great thing about this community is that whether you run 1 miles or 100 miles you are welcome!   What are your goals?  What terrain do you run in?Welcome!

Answering your question, "How often and how far do you run?" is not straight-forward for everybody, myself included. A lot of people, like you, just enjoy running for the sake of running, and have their routine. This is great! There are many others, like me, who like to race. Preparing for races means my mileage and intensity vary not only by season, but from week to week, and run to run. Also, to throw another wrench into the answer, I race varying distances and I also do triathlons, so it depends on what type of race I have coming up.

Last week I ran 11 miles of hills on Tuesday, 5.5 miles easy on Thursday, 6 miles on Saturday, and 14.2 miles on Sunday. This week will be different. I did 5.4 miles on Tuesday, 5.4 miles this morning, and I'll go do another 6 or 7 in and hour. This is ignoring the bike and swim training I'm also doing at the moment.Changing things up helps. In late December I set a goal for a new mile PR. I'm training for my first 5K in April (I've done two marathons, several halfs and 10Ks and a couple different distance trail races but realized I've never done a 5K) and a Fall marathon. So I've got different training and race scenarios lined up throughout the year to look forward to and that keeps getting me out there. My tip is to wear the right clothes, grab a couple of friends, and do the run. If that doesn't work for you, then find a sport/exercise that you enjoy, and do that instead.I thought it was a joke saying that girls are slow and /U/slacksonslacks was a coach figure saying "about time now!"

Sorry if this is the same thing what you were saying.Oh wow!! Thank you for this!! I'm going to check it out!Oh hey fellow Iowa Stater! Go Cyclones :)This is great news! two states that I have lived in have changed one right after the other (IA, MN) I always wondered why it was a thing back when I ran XC. I ran 5ks outside of school, and thought it was just odd.True, it was advertised as a 25K, and we weren't all expecting 33K, but we all have to start somewhere right?

It was seeing the 50 and 100K'ers do their thing that got me thinking...Now get a pair of Newtons. I'd rather run with a burrito in each hand to be honest.District 7 here!You'll get a new 5K PR next year. That's something, right?33k isn't really an ultra run.

You can get factory refurbished 610's on eBay for cheap. That's where I got mine. They come with a 1 year warranty.This is a bit embarrassing for Minnesota to have separate standards like this. It's good they're taking steps towards the right direction though.

In the Austin marathon recently, the winner won by about 3 miles. That's not a very competitive race and therefore the finish wasn't very interesting. Oh wait, that was the men and doesn't demonstrate my clear sexism so disregard that. You can go from a 5k to half in 5 months. That's plenty of time. Your goals just need to be realistic.I don't know if you noticed, but I never argued the validity of using competitiveness to justify the shorter distance. I have just been continually pointing out that you aren't actually disputing it.Great write-up, congrats on the sub-3 (and then some)!It was just changed to 5k in Wisconsin this year also. I started being active like 4 months ago, but I was doing mostly incline fat burn. I just recently put a goal to run and did 5k right off the bat basically. I run basically two days in a row and rest one.

I'm a little free for all, often stop a long distance run to do a sprint and what not. I don't know if that's good, I just went with the flow. I'd say I run about 15 miles per week counting warm-ups. I can set a goal or whatever, that's what I was planning. I just don't know if 10k with good speed is better and more motivating than half marathon. Because 10k is easily feasible for this summer. Cool So maybe start the program like normal (I have about a month and a little more of leeway) and if I get sick or injured repeat a week for a bit.  Or if I'm struggling to get through it, repeat the week?  That seems like a good plan since life gets in the way, illness, work, etc.About 5 or 6 extra weeks.Other people may have actual tips, but I just flat-out enjoy running. Even if I weren't insanely competitive and even if I didn't live to get up for races, I'd still have a blast getting out and stretching my legs. It's important to keep in mind that this activity is objectively ludicrous, but enjoyable for its own sake too.So, motivation can only come from yourself. You have to determine why you want to run. If you can't, find something else!

Personally, I'm always out to break my PR's. Only recently I've come to the point where I have to put in more quality workouts instead of quantity.

I set one goal for many years down the road, and a couple for each year to get to my main goal. Sorta like stepping stones.

If you're injured and have to take time off, you have to realize that your times are going to slip. You won't be as fast as you were. It happens. It happened to me this past September. I'm about where I was last spring. Did it suck? Hell yeah it does. Am I still putting in the miles? Hell yeah I am.Waiting for ideal conditions to do your long runs makes you soft. Suck it up, buttercup.i have argued that the finishing time obviously scales with distance, but that "competitiveness" is an idiotic and disingenuous measure by which to decide whether to change the race distance, especially when such lousy criteria is predicated on what would be a literally negligible change in the distribution of finishing times. I have pointed out that the 5k distance has no effect in racing elsewhere, and that this objection amounts to every other defense of sexism in sports. you are just wasting your time and making yourself look stupid with these peripheral quibbles masquerading as valid objections. I dont know if you've noticed, but this is a discussion about changing the women's race from 4k to 5k, the fact that mens and women's finishing time distributions scale with distance run, has literally no bearing on this discussion except insofar as someone above introduced it as criteria for his intractable notion of "competitiveness", which demonstrates its stupidity blatantly in this discussion, since by the same criteria men ought never to race a 5k either. Yeah, base. How many miles are you running per week, and how long have you been running?

You say you just graduated c25k. How long ago? How much running have you done since? If you think it's safe to do your run, you can either accept that it'll be cold, wet and uncomfortable for 16 miles, or you can cut it short.  Only "trick" I can think of is to plan your route so you can quickly change clothes halfway through so you're back to being dryish for at least a little while.  Might make you feel a little better, but it's not going to be magic.

If it helps, think of what will happen if it's cold and wet on race day, you'll know you've run similar runs in similar conditions, and won't need to worry.I'm a girls high school runner in MN! Yeah, overall I'm glad they decided to increase the distance - girls are as capable of running 5k as guys are. My only complaint: I've only ever run 4ks, so next year I won't be able to directly compare my times to previous seasons' races. My goal for half would be to finish it.

Your base?

I was running at a constant 5.3mph. It was pretty slow basically. I'm going to try tomorrow a realistic run. At full speed I can do a 9;20 min mile. No, I'm working later in the day.Can you do two 8-mile runs?I have a friend, doesn't have a reddit, but is interested! Fine, then look at the results of 100m vs 200m. Over a number of races, the differences will always increase with race distance. You are most certainly wrong to think otherwise. I challenge you to prove me wrong. Women's hockey also bans checking. I remember watching an Olympic game and there was a really great - and clean, if it was a men's game - hit along the boards.

Then she got a 2 minute penalty. I couldn't believe how ridiculous that was. that would make sense. Thanks!One thing frequently overlooked in regards to the placebo effect is if it works, don't knock it. I frequently wear compression sleeves or socks on long runs. It seems to offer a mild benefit--I don't care if it's all in my head. I haven't been diagnosed by a doctor, but I diagnosed myself with hip flexor problems.  I've had problems for years, but it's only prevented me from running twice.  Once was due to severe soreness, and the other was the weak hip flexor changing my gait and causing my current stress fracture.

I began  a strengthening/stretching routine about a month ago.  I haven't been running since as I am also waiting for my stress fracture to heal.  I personally can feel a difference with it, and am hoping the routine can take care of it for the future.Comparing between orders of magnitude different race distances, and extrapolating that difference to a literally negligable increase between distances of the same order of magnitude is just more disingenuous and uninformed nonsense in service of your apparent ideological bent

Haha! Sorry. Not my intention.How many extra weeks do you have?  It looks like week 4 of Novice1 is roughly comparable to week 1 of Novice2.  So you could do the first 4 weeks of Novice1 and then start Novice2, which should take you into mid-August.  If you need a couple extra weeks you could just repeat a week or two in the middle of the program.What would your goal be for the half?

What's your base like now?

What's your 5k time? I can see the arguments for shorter women's races at the college or international level, but I don't think there are very many good reasons to have any varsity HS race, girls or boys, less than 5k/3 miles.That's pretty darn impressive. Only two outdoor 5000s have ever been run faster than that? Wow.Not sure if it's for chip timing. It might just be used to cover cords, so runners don't trip over them.There is a difference between psychological addiction and physical dependency.  Anyone taking a drug that interacts with the sympathetic nervous system like ephedrine does for a long enough period of time _will_ become dependent on it to some extent, regardless of whether they think they have an addictive personality or not.

If you seriously think you have adhd issues, you should look into getting that treated legitamately.  There are several drugs other than ritalin out there, including at least one that is very, very similar to ephedrine.  Build a better base now,

Select a training plan that takes advantage of the better base,

Run a better race.A guy from my high school got #1 in the nation at the XC national championships several years ago Does anybody use a ball strike? Or is the mid strike the proven best strike? Just wondering.I stayed at the Best Western Bridgeview Mtr Inn. It's pretty basic, despite the price. That said it was on the cheaper end of available hotels and was totally fine.

It was good for getting to the race start, with the bus pick-up.

The only issue is, if you are not planning on having a car it's a bit of a trek to get to the expo and even find somewhere to eat. You can catch a bus across the street from the hotel, but public transport is not great there. The people in the hotel also seemed to think to using public transport was the craziest thing they had ever heard. When i said the word bus, the person at check-in had this look of utter confusion on their face!Are you going to be run/walking? It seems like some sort of walk breaks every mile or every water station or whatever might be beneficial. And that would have the added bonus of making the pace of the running sections slightly less slow for you.Yeah, men's lacrosse and women's lacrosse are two COMPLETELY different games."Hmmm, I wonder if a guy will win this race. "Did you think boys and girls all raced together?Finally! I can't even describe how much of a pain it's been trying to hold onto 7 tomatoes during longer runs.I don't know anything about high altitude training, but based on the reviews, is it really snake oil?

The majority of 500 people rated it 5 stars, and those who didn't seemed to only complain about the fit rather than the effectiveness.What is the time difference between the before and the after?  How long did you work with the trainer to improve to this point?  Also, at this point, are you still actively thinking about your form, or has muscle memory set in yet?Well I guess it didn't take that much to dissuade me.

Other than the fact that I can't actually study because I'm too fucking jittery, not from the ephedrine but from my second dose of caffeine. It's crazy how much I remember it not doing anything, but I've been a caffeine addict since I'm 15, now 24. Nothing a good desintox can't change. I'll stick to my small green tea.


On a side note, is it possible to go from around 5 miles to a half marathon in 5 months? Or should I aim for a fast 10k?I started running the same time you did! I haven't run for three months, but I signed up for a half in may and I have no choice but to start again. Kills me that I lost my speed, but I've managed the three milers fine so far.

Good luck getting back on track, buddy!Unpopular anecdote but I've seen far more women pass out or face medical emergencies during these events than men, and I expect that to only increase with the distance.

Women may not have the same amount of muscle mass but what really makes them so much worse than male runners is the poor training they receive and the even worse diets they partake in.Check out the bridge to 10k program. wotdang I wear a 9.5 :-(Without knowing your particular circumstances, it'll also benefit you to get a bit lighter, but that's not always just about running. Great minds think a like. I pour the bacon fat on my steamed veggies...gotta save the fat.I mean, it's a fair assumption to say I ate more, but I simply started drinking soda again. That and dessert/candy is fucking everywhere in this house. I simply didn't buy that crap.

I think I'll keep going without EC stack but idk I often have a net calorie amount of like frigging 500 and I still ain't losing weight. It's getting ridiculous.

I average 600 calories burned on the treadmill a day and eat around 1500 calories. I've gotten pretty good at estimates but I guess I am not. I'm at ISU and our women always run 6k at least on our course.  I don't know if it's an Iowa thing or a Big XII thing.  Our run club (not the university team) went to U of I (their actual men's team) and ran a 4k so maybe there's no consistency at all.Fuckin crushed it, mate. Not totally textbook, but you clearly did a good enough job of reeling yourself back in to go a-scalpin' in the last few miles!You gained back 50 lbs because you ate more. You can't blame it on their cooking or because EC was stopped or on any other life factors. This has everything to do with portion control and diet than it does EC stack.

But to answer your question, if you are going to start back up on the EC stack after running and are insistent about it becoming part of your diet again, I'd introduce it once you are back in shape enough to where you were before while using it. At that point, you'll do one of two things, realize you don't really need it, or start off by slowly implementing into your routine.  So it won't snow in April? Where do I make that bet? Never said April is winter.&gt;Didn't realize I was engaging in formal debate

Ha ha! /r/running...come for the shoes, stay for the formal debate (bring a snack).Yeah. I ran in the street for a few good stretches. When I do snowy trail running I use Yak tracks to get a better footing. But I wouldn't wear them unless it's 100% snow/ice. I feel like the asphalt would do a number on them. Yikes! I'm pretty sure if women run for 5k they will produce too much yellow bile, sending their humors out of balance and making them more susceptible to demonic possession.I do a lot of barefoot running in the warm months to try and iron out my form.  I tried it on a treadmill a few months ago... I just could not get it to translate.  Do not recommend.The guilty pic (#3) was at mile 11 and I hadn't even really hit my fastest pace at that point so I can't even use fatigue as an excuse.

I've really tried to focus on leaning into my stride and making sure my foot lands under me the last couple years.  I guess this pic just proves that I still slip from time to time.

The hard part is that I have to think about good form whereas my "relaxed" and natural form is a combo of all three pics.I know proper diet, but being back at my parents place I do eat most of their cooking. Since I came back I got back on 50 pounds. I did know I was doing bad but I was in a bad place. 6k for women, 10k for men in championship races, but 8k most of the time in the regular seasonYeah, when I first saw the title, I thought maybe the robot was designed to throw tomatoes at you if you weren't keeping a certain speed.You've got lots of space for improvement with a yearly distance total of 1200km (I know you said 'minimum', but it's all that I've got to go on).  That's about 24 km per week...just run more and run faster and you'll see improvements in your race times!  At 50 km/week, 70 kw/week, etc. you'll see lots of benefits, especially if you run some of those miles hard and fast!

The distance required to properly train for a marathon would probably help your shorter distance racing as well, so making that jump could be a double benefit (complete a marathon, get faster at your preferred distances)!According to research, under regular dose it is not of any cardiovascular risks. I am the same weight as you. I dedicate as much time as I can to running and my weight fluctuates greatly from day to day, week to week. I might put in a few 50 mile weeks and gain weight, I might only have a 20 mile week and drop 6-8 lbs. If weight loss is what you are tying to achieve, the only proper way to do it is through diet. We all struggle with eating but using EC truly is not going to get you over the hump after this long.

The problem here is, is that you say you'll drop the EC once you get to 190 but by that point, you'll have more than likely already mentally sealed the deal that it was the EC that did it, when really it was your diet. It's a perpetual cycle of risk vs. reward. The things I've read and heard about EC and ECA are unbalanced and tilt more to the negative side.

I don't know how much you know about nutrition but there are quite a few good books out there (Matt Fitzgerald's - Racing Weight comes to mind first), that are designed to get you to understand how important nutrition and your weight are when doing endurance sports.

I've got a brother who was on ECA stack for years and it wrecked his endocrin system. He's now been off it for a year and just starting to get back to normal after a few different health issues which from what I understand are linked directly to the amounts of  Ephed he ingested. Originally he did it for weight loss, and it worked, but then he continued because, "Hey it got me to this point, I will just keep using it to get better!" and that was a mistake. You stare at the watch the whole race.I am a plus sized runner, and they have helped me tremedously. Previously my calve muscles would splay outward on the downstrike. After several miles of that, sometimes they just didn't want to bounce back. It would lead to pain, and occasional cramping. I started wearing compression sleeves, and now have much less pain, and have found a more effective stride. Some slight corrections:  Men's DIII is 8k across the board including championships.  DI post-season races will often be 10k leading up to nats.  Women will often race 5k or 6k in DIII, with nats being 6k.  Don't really know about DI women, or DII in general.Amen, do what you got to do to keep on the roads6k for women, 8k for men, but men race 10k in the XC national championship (also stupid).&gt;They actually work as a recovery aid though, don't they?

I feel like they do.In walking your foot lands in front of you and pulls your forward. Running is different. Running is like jumping on one foot at a time in place, but you lean your body forward so your feet propel you forward with each strike against the ground. Well... I sort of hit a really bad downer. I've been stuck at around 212 since December and I feel like I've been doing fairly good on my diet and better than ever on running.

I was using EC stack and stopped. Since then I stopped losing weight.

I don't view EC stack as something bad is the thing. It's not really harmful and it's helped me plenty in the past.
I've used it again for 2 days and I can say that my appetite is suppressed and I'm feeling better about my goal. In the same spirit, I know it's not something you attain and then stop, eating properly and exercising is a life thing, I'll sure drop EC stack when I get around 190.

You think it's a bad idea? I'm well open to suggestions and criticism, as my perception of EC stack isn't really that we'll researched and/or set in stone. I had to Google EC Stack. Please stop using it and look at your diet instead. Trust me. I used to weigh more than 50 lbs heavier than I do now, and I've kept it off for several years now.For the athletes as well. The better athletes will still stay closer to everyone, making the fields closer throughout. I think both ways are good, as if they start longer earlier when the athletes (hopefully!) build up to 10k's they'll be better equiped! So i think there really is no right or wrong answer (my opinion!) :)Sorry no 11'sI ran in PIAA District III. I was surprised that some states only had 4K for girls XC.Yeah I didn't know other states even HAD gendered running teams. Weird.There are papers that say they do, but I honestly don't know if I've noticed a difference.  I keep telling myself to only wear one at a time to compare...&gt; If the last KM is just serving an opportunity for the person out front to further lengthen their lead, that's not ideal.

Yes it is, it's a race.  It also gives an extra K for the girls in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. place to try to reel her in.Is it 8K and 10K?Sounds like you need a race on the calendar for motivation, so sign up for something, and after that (or before it), sign up for something else. I'm usually signed up for at least three running events of varying distances at a time. Whats the main reason for you to be using EC stack? Is it for the caffeine bump or weightloss? Typically it's only productive in those who are already obese looking to lose weight but now that you are down 100lbs, is it still necessary?

Edit-

For those curious EC stack is a combination formula containing Ephedrine and Caffeine.

As PhilthyCasual said, it's really not worth the risks of using something to get that much of a boost when proper diet and training can do the same thing. I am down 60 lbs from when I first started and even being a caffeine junky I'd never really try EC. There are too many negative side effects to the ephedrine. What is the average difference in the times for a 100m race vs a 100km race?If you read what I wrote, you'll notice I never took a side.  All I said, and continue to say, is that if you want to demonstrate that MichaelFerg is wrong, you have to address the point he made. If you want to say he's wrong and don't mention any reason why or address what he said, you're not really adding anything.This is...total unsurprising. I never wear them running because the one time I did, I didn't notice a difference...and I want to keep them clean so I can sleep in them. At $50 a pop I can't afford to have fresh ones every night, and I do notice a difference if I go to long without sleeping in them. Second this.  I run on these trails everyday and they are the perfect way to avoid traffic and meet hobos. Not sure if the second point is a plus for you.

Also north of the city on platte (~3 miles past commons park west) starts to get nice and smelly (industrial stuff).   From a fellow Badger,

It's going to start getting warm before April. Stop misrepresenting. You're not that hardcore.It's a torment!Taking a week off won't harm your fitness level, whereas taking six months off if it gets injured would.I wonder if there would be some extreme point at which they would help. Like if there is a running comparable to the shirts worn by competitive bench-pressers which actually increase the resistance that their arms apply to the weight.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_shirtMy understanding is that they do help with recovery, through precisely the same mechanism as massage does.My experience with bad batteries is the monitor starts and stops, rather than becoming erratic.  I have twice received bad batteries with new heart rate monitors.  YMMV.Make one of these that peels kiwis and dispenses strawberries and you've got yourself a customer!Are running with tomatoes a thing? I don't know but I think I would love to see someone with a "fuel belt" filled with tomatoes or this thing.

It even has its own [hype video](http://youtu.be/RtM3x3rCK9M) that is even more confusing...

Why are all these women eating bananas?  Who is this Japanese man staring at banana-eaters?  Why is there so much T&amp;A on a tomato video?

Yes.  But, you will need this stuff with any HR monitor you get.  Water is insufficient.I can help with strides. They're important to do before and after a run or race. Find a field or a track and take your shoes off (or don't, i like to take them off) and do about 100m sprinting. Not 100% sprint more like 85% if you catch my drift. Glad to help!  There are no healthy or unhealthy foods.  There are only healthy or unhealthy diets.Its still different in the NCAAYes.  This looks more like a diet for someone trying to lose weight.Definitely some 3mi and some 5K when I ran. One year a course changed and the finish line was moved back for the extra .1. Mid-80s.Thankyou :)forerunner 220 is the one I have, but I think I might have that option also... I'll have to play around with it.  yup, agree!I saw you guys! Loved the shirts by the way. Congrats! And awesome videoAt my local high school they are running a 5K, but the local newspaper is annoying reporting the races as a 3 mile race.Want to incorporate tomatoes into running?

Step 1: add weight to runner

Step 2: make it top heavy

Step 3: Add a silly face

Call him every day. Call him twice a day. Call your mother twice a day. He's being a jerk. A sprained ankle for 3 months? Little off topic but sounds like you can use some meditation or group sports. This.

Wow, some of you need to relax. Winter has another 2 months left here in Wisconsin. January and February are particularly cold, with snow through March and April. Didn't think this post would piss so many of you off.Haha, it was a built in game on the treadmill screen.Well I like this article, thanks for posting!This is HSXC, first place doesn't win for the school- fifth place does. In scoring it doesn't matter if first place wins by :15 or 3:15, it's a 1. But if your 5th team member is 12th or 50th overall pushes back other racers. If your team &amp; coach wants to win, they don't want 1st place or their 5th team member sandbagging.

It's not a good idea to underestimate the competitiveness of people who sign up voluntarily to compete.Twister after a Ragnar? I'm calling BS. :)&gt; Though college girls still run 6k instead of 8/10k.

When I was in college (lo these many years ago, early 2000's), women ran a 5k at nearly all "normal" races, and *maybe* a 6k at the regional championships or nationals; I don't think anybody from our team qualified, and I certainly never went, so I'm not sure.  Is/was that no longer the case?A) you indicated in another post that 4:30/km is on the limit of comfortable, based on that I think you might be able to race a 5k in the 20:50-21:20 range. In this case, I'ld say on all but one of your runs during the week slow it down to 4:45/km.

B) Carrying water isn't recommended, *but getting hydrated beforehand is important*. The reason for this is because you are still running well under 90 minutes, but now running more than 40 minutes. Based on your indicated pace, you will be running 10k in no more than 50 minutes, still way below the proper hydration threshold.

C) You might not need the extra rest day, but I'ld actually recommend adding 1-2 days per week at 5:00-5:30/km pace on top of increasing some of your current runs at 4:30-4:45/km pace. This is what runners refer to as "active recovery" in which you are going fast enough to work your cardiovascular system, but slow enough in which you can recover within a few hours (after a month of introducing this). In this sense, even run at 6:00/k if you have to slow down a bit further.

How I would start the increase of distance:

Day of Week | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
--------------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
Week 1 | 5k (4:45/k) | 3k (5:30/k) | 5k (4:30/k) | 5k (4:45/k) | 3k (5:30/k) | 7k (4:45/k) | OFF
Week 2 | 5k (4:45/k) | 3k (5:30/k) | 6k (4:30/k) | 5k (4:45/k) |  3k (5:30/k) | 8k (4:45/k) | OFF
Week 3 | 6k (4:45/k) | 4k (5:30/k) | 6k (4:30/k) | 5k (4:45/k) | 4k (5:30/k) | 9k (4:45/k) | OFF
Week 4 | 6k (4:45/k) | 4k (5:30/k) | 7k (4:30/k) | 6k (4:45/k) | 4k (5:30/k) | 10k (4:45/k) | OFF
Week 5 | 7k (4:45/k) | 5k (5:30/k) | 7k (4:30/k) | 6k (4:45/k) | 5k (5:30/k) | 11k (4:45/k) | OFF
Week 6 | 7k (4:45/k) | 5k (5;30/k) | 8k (4:30/k) | 7k (4:45/k) | 5k (5:30/k) | 12k (4:45/k) | OFFSudoku while running on a treadmill? that's impressive.I signed up for my first race ever!  I've been running off and on since high school track and cross country, but this will be my first real race since then.  It's a 10K and I'm not entirely sure what to expect.  I just went for a pretty good 2 miles and got finished around 13 min.  I could have run a little more, but not 4.4 more.  I have 7 weeks, so I'm super stoked to see what I can do!Oh, Tim Noakes working on updating his "Lore of Running" book with changes in the "what to eat section".Suck my dick,  don't hate manI don't know what kind of watch you have, but my Garmin 620 has a virtual pacer that can yell at me if I'm going too fast or too slow.  No thinking or paying attention required, so you can focus on providing encouragement or whatever else a pacer does.Sounds like me too!  Cool. I only eat bacon for breakfast with my eggs and veggies, lunch (chicken with veggies) and dinner (red meat / fish with veggies). No cheese unless it's goat cheese and that's used sparingly. I usually have at least 2-3 servings of veggies per meal. Throw in some nuts / nut butter / avocado and that's it.Np baby ;) Yes...but that statement means absolutely nothing in the context here.  Competitiveness is within the division.  I'm gonna assume by the lack of capital letters that any explanation of debate or logic here is going to fall upon deaf ears.Now this is a dank meme Sounds about right. My calves cramped in 3 of the 4 marathons I have run. The only time I didn't cramp was when I ran with compression socks. Maybe they helped, but I know my success was more likely due to other variables working in my favor. I try to convince myself that they do work so I can get some placebo effect at a minimum. impressive half marathon time! That's awesome. Like everyone's saying, just go for some runs and see how things go... Also, if you feel like you're forcing yourself to run, then just don't run and find something else you enjoywomen compete against other women.
Sorry you dont seem to get implication.

the same women would run a slightly longer distance and be at the same distribution of finishes.

shorter distances do not result in tighter races (see: CC in those states not stuck in the 50s)

"more exciting races" is just another gesture at that disingenuous defense of sexism in sports.

Hope that helps. Didn't realize I was engaging in formal debate, and in an audience of people incapable of understanding subtext.

Edit: the comment about shorter race lengths resulting in a tighter distribution of finish times that you so eagerly accept is demonstrably not the case, if you knew anything about women's CC. Your blind acceptance of that as "fact" prevents you from actually seeing this comment for what it is.

Next edit: since apparently there is someone in this thread hell-bent on misconstruing everything I say and twisting it in bad faith, let me add an addendum to the point about shorter distances and tighter races. It was (I think CLEARLY) in the context of this discussion, where "shorter" is a relative term picking out 4k versus 5k, two races of the same distance order of magnitude. Obviously the distribution of finishes tends to scale with order of magnitude, that is, were a race is 100 meters, the distribution spans from seconds to miliseconds while a Xkm race would span seconds to minutes. The nutrition piece was in the back of my mind as well.  I'm halfway through the book "Eat and Run" by Scott Jurek.  I am the same in that gels/chews do not work well for me!  I have been making gradual progress in nutrition figuring out what is working and what is not, but this is a piece I need to research more.  Thank You!Ran a 14.2 mile train run in -7 windchill weather.**EP-uhO!**

I see what you did there. And chuckles were had.Purely from a debate standpoint, you didn't make your point very well.  He said the difference was competitiveness and you say you've never heard of different distances.  If, in fact, the women's division is less competitive than the men then the raw difference in finish times would probably be smaller if the race is shorter. He is almost certainly right about that.  To refute him, and show him as plainly untrue, you would need to address the competitiveness issue.thanks so much, this was the sort of nuts and bolts information I was hoping for in posting my question.  That's insane!! Awesome job!I'm trying hard with the being mean too- I yell at my parents a lot (yay teen angst/ hormones), so I'm trying to stop that. My sister has done "running challenges," like a month of running, or running every day between thanksgiving and chrismas. This is just a good time to run because it's not hot outside (florida sucks in the summer) and I like to think of God while I run.
9 months is awesome! I'm sure you could make it to a full yearPerfect! I wasn't sure how many more miles I should consider training for 32 miles versus 26!  I do have a marathon planned for early May and planning on the 50K distance the end of August.  Thank You!I normally do my long training runs around 8:00, but my club has me pace everything from 8:30 to 10:00.  I know it sounds odd, but the slower paces are actually MORE difficult past a certain point.  I really can't stress enough that you are going to have to use your watch a lot.  To slow down even more, work on a forefoot strike and a cadence that feels really quick.  Keep your feet underneath your body (it'll feel a little like you are jogging in place).  And make sure you stay consistent...no one wants a pacer who gets to .90 miles, goes "oh shit" and pumps the brakes over and over.Maybe try a headlamp?Who?I don't have any real advice to add, but I remember in HS doing some training runs on one of our xc courses and seeing a dad and his daughter (probably around 6-7yrs old) running together. It's something that has stuck with me through the years and I think it's great that you guys are both doing some fitness together!I love it.  I wake up at 4:30 and go about 4 miles.  I'm a teacher and my days start at 7 and usually go til about 5 or 6, so I can't really run after school.  Getting going in the morning feels great and boosts my mood.

I usually wake up with a glass of water and a banana.  Don't know if that's right or not, but it's what I do.  I've just recently gotten into running in the mornings before work. I get up at 6, eat half of a clif bar and half a pack of shot bloks, run from 6:15-7:45, then shower and get to work by 9. The first mile is usually pretty groggy, but then I wake up and just enjoy the peace. I live downtown in a mid sized city, so I love experiencing it before the daily chaos. I used to guide cave tours and we used "baby giraffe" to describe people who seemed to struggle with basic walking.I appreciated the picture-in-picture of the current record synchronized with this one.  Makes it more of a race!Ahhh.... Im European :-| Record possibly invalidated by poor camera work.  He's completely out of the frame for a total of 5 seconds during the back stretch on the 3rd lap.  I doubt he puked, but there's no way to tell now.  Running is a high impact sport and because of your weight you're putting a lot of stress on your joints. If your knee is hurting you could supplement in some low-impact exercises. For example, you could do some swimming or biking. Ellipticals are popular at the gym, but I for one cannot for the life of me use those because I get too bored.

When your knee feels better you can get back to running after having lost no fitness whatsoever. If your knee continues to hurt while doing low-impact exercises then you know something's wrong.I can't let myself lose sleep to train. Call me underdedicated, but I'll just tell you that's not a wordWhile more information is needed before suggesting any medical tips, I would recommend rotating what endurance exercises you do in a week. For example switching in cycling and swimming.

I may lose the shower, that area is being remodeled.  If that happens, I'm going to get a cute little pixie haircut so that I can wash my hair in a bathroom sink.  Not ideal, but I don't know what else to do.  Yeah. You can see a ton of foam / beer come out of beer #3 when it hits the ground.

If you are going to claim that you beet a record like this by 0.75 seconds, you need to make sure it stands up to scrutiny.I'd err on the side of caution, especially if it's a kind of pain that you are not familiar with; as long as it gets better with running and not worse, you're probably good to run, but if running makes it worse, rest. Mid- to long term, you'll want to find out what the underlying problem is; the most likely candidates are running form, muscle imbalance, general lack of muscle strength, and being overweight. The latter is probably more an aggravating factor than the actual cause, but it's still a good idea to tackle your diet and see if you can lose some weight, because losing fat makes running dramatically easier.What running experience do you have? Unless it includes training for 50+ mile races I'd say this is a terrible idea and you will not finish.It kind of depends upon the coffee itself - not all blends have the same amount of caffeine, and if you have an unusual amount of caffeine *for you*, it can be something you'll notice on the run in your heart and breathing rate.

There are benefits from antioxidants in the beans and possible adverse effects from long-term high-caffeine exposure on blood pressure.
If you are at day 3, don't do any exercises or stretching of this area.  Rest only.1.  Probably possible for two spots, if you time it right and they are basically the first half and the end.  Three would be really pushing it; you'd need to be watching a relatively slow (for boston) runner (close to 4-hour finish).  Four times is right out.

2.  Trains are a real crapshoot.  It's just the Green line that goes close to the course, and guess who else has the same idea as you?  Literally every other spectator.  They are pakt like sardines on all the in-bound (i.e. towards Copley) trains.  There may or may not be room on any train; if you're going to take one, get on as far out as possible, maybe it hasn't filled up yet.

3.  Wear sunscreen, enjoy yourself, cheer for everybody.  Probably the best way to get around would be by bike on roads that parallel (lol parallel streets in Boston?!) the course.  I'd study maps, plan out your approach.

The main flaw in their plan IMHO is assuming there will be room alongside the course at 20 miles.  The closer you get to the finish the more spectators there are, and if it's nice weather it'll be packed.

Good luck!It's pretty irritating. I too think it's one of the only photos they have access to but I also think it shows him with that pensive, painful look you often have (unintentionally) when you run. They are trying to show him as troubled so here's a pic of him running. I saw another pic where he was in front of the golden gate bridge, smiling, but how confusing that would be for some people to grasp. How could an unhappy person seem happy in a photo(that's sarcasm)? I dont know, just some thoughts.Relay for Life is an overnight event right?

How much running are you doing now?I wake up between 4-4:30, drink a coffee and read some news or whatever for a good 40 minutes, no food, then I go out for a run.  I find I can pretty much run indefinitely during these morning hours, usually I restrict myself to ~5km, but sometimes I'll go ~10km.

I absolutely love running in the morning.  I love being awake in the morning in general.  I don't like the feeling of waking up just to go to work, starting the day for yourself makes a huge difference toward not feeling like a slave.

As for the running, I have no idea why, but it's only in these pre-dawn hours I can run non-stop without being exhausted or gasping for breath.  It's just enjoyable and relaxing, there isn't much I enjoy more to be honest.I dunno man, I see a lot of beer coming out as the bottles hit the ground. I'll need to consider this one for a while.So you go to bed at like 8pm then?I experienced this, too!  I run to and from work, and I also work 12+ hour shifts.  My work is pretty busy, I'm on my feet for a large portion of my shift.  And yet, my run to work is always about 30-60 seconds per mile slower than my run home.  Even when I do the hill route on the way home.  I don't know if I'm just warmed up, or if it's because I've eaten a good meal a couple of hours before my run home, or if I'm just so freaking excited to get home to go to bed!Often, it's the only time of day that I have to get the miles in that I need. I hate it. I have to dodge sleepy drivers, skunks, startled deer, and dogs. Still, one can adjust. And I've found there's something cathartic about finishing a tough run in the wee hours that makes whatever I have the rest of the day seem a bit easier.

If there are other times in the day that work better, great. It's like shoes. What works for me may not work for you, but it's all good in the end. Oh ok! That was something I've always been curious about.Lol I know but everyone was talking about how awesome it is to run in the morning so I wanted to hear the other side. I was feeling lonely :)Oh no, /u/incster, this thread is completely different. This isn't a thread for early risers, this is a thread for the procrastinators!Trying that next week!
I generally just wear shorts and a tshirt. Getting cold is motivation to enjoy the running sections over the walking.I use 10k Runner. It can be programmed to beep at change of interval or to talk to you to say "start running or slow down and walk". It also posts a notification on your phone at each change. I also couple my runs with Runkeeper which can be programmed to tell you distance average pace and current pace (there may be more these are just ones I use).  You can also make your own intervals on Runkeeper and it will tell you a lot info. You don't have to have to pay for Runkeeper and one can find running programs online to use to create the custom runs on Runkeeper. I frequently get persistent side stitches when running. It seems to be much worse when I run on a treadmill than outdoors, interestingly. I haven't yet worked out why.I started running around 250 lbs (5'10). I had a fair amount of pressure, but no injuries. I think running at that weight is a little dangerous, but I probably wouldn't advise you not to. C25K at that weight is fine. However, being a marathon runner/half runner at 260 is begging for a permanent injury. My advice would be

1. Don't run until your knee feels fine.
2. Go see a doctor if it continues to give you pain and ask his advice.
3. Get fitted for running shoes (at an actual running store) that fit your needs
4. Work on losing weight and continuing to run at the same time if there is no pain.

If you plan to take up/continue running as a hobby, it is in your best interest to lose a significant amount of weight. I read somewhere that running can expend a force of up to six times your bodyweight on your knees. Best of luck!I love quiet early morning runs because I live in a very densely populated area in NoVA.

I roll out of bed around 4, whenever I wake up. Brush my teeth, throw on the clothes/shoes, grab the dog and I'm gone. No eating, sometimes restroom before. It's wide open rail trails and streets with nobody else around.Well, it's from 10am -  7pm :-). I'm an optometrist. It has it's pros and cons with these work hours, but the job is awesome. This is asked [quite often](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=morning+running&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), including at least once [today](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/316h2o/you_who_run_in_the_early_mornings_before_work_how/).If I thought I had to run as soon as I got out of bed, I wouldn't get out of bed. I usually run around midday. That's when the sun is up and the weather is about as warm as it's going to get, breakfast has digested but I'm not yet hungry again, and I'm feeling awake. It's also a good break between morning work and afternoon work.Thanks for the suggestion. What I'm seeing on the website looks promising, but for some reason I can't connect to the App Store right now. I'll take a closer look at it when it comes back up. &gt; But I'm excited you're looking into fitness and well-being together as a family!

We've actually been working towards it since about January.  We started with a basic stretching routine for a couple of months.  I added in running a few weeks ago and he's wanted to join me since and now I'm adding in a bodyweight routine which is a little easier than a running routine to get him into.I also can't bring myself to run in the mornings, even on the weekends. When it's the summer, I can *maybe* run at 8am to avoid the heat but no way I'd be able to get up at 6am for a long run.i, like others have mentioned, also love feeling so accomplished and energized before even getting to work! in the winter i ran in the PM because i was on an indoor track that is near my work and i didn't get my act together enough to go in the AM. i found PM running more difficult: i had to make sure i was getting so much food during the day and properly digested to be able to run well in the evening. in the morning, whether i ate a salad the night before or a huge greasy dinner with so much dessert, it doesn't seem to effect my morning run because all the digestion has happened. i like that a lot.

i also love the feeling of accomplishment before work!!! that's what really motivates me. that and i just run better in the AM then PM. my time is better, i feel better, etc.

my routine these days-- i'm really efficient in the mornings, thoguh i'll have to adjust as i have been increasing miles steadily (around 14 miles/week now-- aiming for 25-30 miles/week for the summer).

* wake up between 630-645am

* i keep my garmin by the window and i'll turn it on to get the GPS loaded so i'm not waiting forever when i WANT to be running (best tip ive found on reddit)

* head to bathroom, do things, put in contacts

* change into running clothes which i put on my dresser the night before

* lace up shoes, try and get some movement into body just by swinging arms, shaking legs out.

* put on some kind of belt to hold keys and phone, maybe have some water if i'm parched but usually i just have a few sips and that's fine

* out the door by 7am (yes this only takes 15-30 min!!!! streamlined!!!!)

* brisk 5 min walk in which i'm super groggy while trying to find my running playlist

* open up nike run or half marathon app or start garmin or whatever combo of tech i feel like using that day

* usually i run for like 30-45 minutes on weekdays, depending on where i end up ill cooldown for 5-10 min walking, but i really try to be back in the door by 8am

* i don't leave for work until 915, so i usually apply for a job or two, hop in shower around 845, out by 855, dry off, make smoothie still in towel, get dressed and get ready while drinking it, throw some stuff together for lunch and out the door by 915.I'm a biologist doing research at a school of medicine and I drink coffee like crazy. Coffee is known to be an extremely potent mutagen (see linked video below), which causes people to worry about its ability to increase you odds of getting cancer. The thing about biology is, it is extremely complex, and the question "is coffee good for you?" does not have a straightforward answer. It is definitely a potent mutagen, so it might marginally increase your odds of colon cancer. But other studies have been published showing its possible influence in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's/dementia/Parkinson's or its positive effects in your liver, etc...This is why, if you google "is coffee good for me" you can get reputable sources saying "yes" and "no".

Personally, I take the perspective that I really enjoy coffee and the health risks are clearly quite low compared to many other things, so I will take my chances. This video is exceptionally clear discussion of the [mutagenic effects of coffee (and other burnt foods) and how it is found via the Ames test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxE9sYatPAs)...I like the video because it provides a really realistic perspective about mutagens from one of the country's best physicists.

**Edit**: [Here is a good executive summary from a reputable source](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/coffee/) which basically says drink coffee if you want to. Since I'm fairly new to distance running (longer than 6 miles) you described what as become my worst nightmare. It's only a matter of time.I had a run recent get ruined by one of these. It was lower-abdomen. It also kicked in around mile 2.5 after the fastest first 2 miles I'd ever put in -- in my opinion, it happened because I pushed too hard too fast too early in the run. I ended up walking the last 2 miles of the 6-miler than day because it hurt so bad, and now I'm paranoid about it coming back but it hasn't.

It sounds like similar experiences, except I haven't had any recurrences. Are you supplementing your running with core workouts? Or have you noticed any changes in your gait that could be using different muscles/burning energy differently?I am actually qualified for both positions and am in need of a job, will send a PM.Pretty sure it's Dean Karnazes or Scott Jurek.I'm still quite big (6'2", 243lb and dropping fast!) and usually any knee pain I might experience during my runs goes away quickly after I stop. I don't usually have much knee pain though. If I experienced lasting pain in my knees though, I would go see my local Sports Med Doc who happens to run Ultras, and they are pretty much the only person I trust.


I was over 300lbs when I started running (I was already actively cross training, skiing and hiking a ton though) and I never had many issues so don't assume yours are directly related to your weight. Also, well done and keep at it!I've tried doing morning runs, but I get to work around 7:30 (and most of my coworkers are already in by then so it already feels late) and the sun just doesn't come up soon enough for me to make that work. My area doesn't have a lot of streetlights to minimize light pollution and the area immediately surrounding my apartment complex has bad quality sidewalks (potholes, tree roots growing up underneath causing large undulations, etc.) so it just seemed too dangerous. The park nearby where I run on evenings and weekends is only open during daylight hours and doesn't have any lighting either.

The few runs I tried in the morning didn't go well because I was worried about tripping or twisting an ankle and was preoccupied about getting to work late. It's too bad, because I'm a morning person and I'd really like to have made it work. I love it. It gives me that much more time during the day to feel accomplished.

I don't eat first unless it's going to be really long (&gt;10 miles). Then I reward myself with a nice breakfast at work.I already knew runners were crazy ... with the running and all. This is super helpful! Thank you! I got a compression sock, which helps and make me more conscious of how it's positioned when I'm resting. I don't have a boot on hand so I'd like to avoid buying/renting one just yet.

Stationary bike and elliptical are both things I have access to, so this is good news. Reddit, I love you.I'm the same way! I have tried running in the mornings but I can't just pull myself together. My mind also feels tight (can't focus, etc) along with the rest of my body - it's so frustrating. But at the end of a 12 hour shift I can go run 3 miles no problem?! What is wrong with me lolNon-scientific truth: it's even better if you drink a cold beer in a hot shower. Shower beers for life!My day is fancier just by being reminded that San Pellegrino is a thing. Thank you!Same here. I don't eat or drink anything before a run unless it's my long run day, so I'm usually still only half awake when I start running. It's nice to feel my energy and alertness increase as I progress through my run. I usually wake up by 4:45, get out the door by 5AM, and get back around 6AM. This gives me enough time to shower, eat and prep my toddler for daycare.

It's really nice to have my run out of the way early so I can relax the rest of the day. Running on empty in the early morning also really helped with weight loss.I usually do Dunkin' Donuts on race morning, but I had to settle for McD's before the Central Park Marathon last year. It just didn't measure up to the Dunkin'.

I didn't get the McGriddle though, maybe that was the problem.Hicham El Guerrouj, who wouldda known....  thanks google.
no interest in drinking it beforehand-- the run itself wakes me up. i wake up, put my garmin near a window to get the GPS loaded, bathroom, change into running clothes, find keys, and am out the door with barely a sip of water for a 5 min walk and then running begins. yeah the first 1/2 mile to 1 mile are slow and lethargic but i wake up on the run.

so much coffee had afterwards.If I didn't run in the mornings, I probably wouldn't run, simple as that. I'm most motivated to do it first thing in the day, even if it means waking up earlier than normal.

Generally my runs are anywhere from 3-8 miles on the weekdays, depending on what kind of race I'm training for, so you're really talking about 25-70 minutes for me.  I usually get up at 5 on my run days (Maybe 4:30 if I have an 8 miler to do), which lets me get back and showered by 6-6:30, which is usually when our daughter is waking up.


I love it, I love having it done with, makes me feel like I've accomplished something right off the bat, and I just like how I feel the rest of the day when I've already gone for a run.

Since most of my runs are 5 miles or less I usually don't eat anything, I'll just drink some water beforehand if anything.  If I'm going to be more in the 7-8 mile range I might have a banana or eat a cliff bar before hand, but not too much.I love it that I know the name of the beer mile record holder, but not the real mile record holder.Any caffeine makes me nearly shit myself during a run even if I poop before it. I guess I just don't mix well with caffeine.Looking for someone with an undergrad in biochem and a PhD in physical chemistry, who's been teaching analytical chemistry for 7 years?

/asking for a friend who *really* misses San DiegoYou just told the story of my life.For me, a high intensity run makes me groggy for the next hour or so. It's like my body wants a nap to recover. But lower intensity runs definitely wake me up.Yes, small biotech (~25 employees) in San DiegoI do run with a pack though.....to carry wallet, phone, keys, anything I forgot to leave the night before, etcHonestly, because of that photo I view all of you as potential suicidal pilot killers now.I leave clothes &amp; everything at the office the night before. I leave my truck and have my wife pick me up.

I keep all of my breakfast stuff &amp; protein mix at the office as well. I go in the bathroom &amp; wash off at the sink. I leave a towel &amp; washrag at work the days I'm going to runCoffee has been shown (up to two cups a day) to have a variety of health benefits from increased circulation to better heart health.

For runners a cup of coffee (or its caffeine equivalent) has been linked to better performance. It can also help with recovery.

Biologists are not doctors or pharmacists or even the folks who would conduct such clinical research on athletes. Tell him to shove it.

(I'm on my mobile or I'd link to studies)It might be the only photo they have permission to use, too.  I don't know precisely who you ask for that (if needed) - family, presumably - and for all we know they tried to pick a "good" picture of him.re: beer after running... http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/10/scientists-suggest-beer-after-workout/
BEING GODDAMN INJURED.Formerly Obese (now just fat) runner here.

Started at 6'0" - 278#. From my experience, there are pains that are serious and pains that you can work your way through. I had a similar thing when I started, but if it's a kinda dull pain - it tended to go away when I ran. So maybe try taking it very easy and maybe try a half mile and see how you feel. I was honestly surprised by what my body could do on days when I felt like absolute crap. Just pay attention to the signals your body is sending you. When I look back at my runkeeper stuff from a few years ago, I had a *very* slow start. Now, I'm training for my second marathon and hopefully my first ultra in December!

As well, here are a couple of things - if you think it could be your shoes, go to a running specialty store and have them check you out. If you think it's serious enough - ask your doctor.

That's just my experience, but I hope it helps.Yes... just remember the big rule: if you feel, even slightly, like you might have to go before your run, you MIGHT not be able to hold it for your whole run.

I was only like 1/4 mile from my house when I finally gave in and found a tree... that's how bad it was.Well, I'm the female. I'd still probably make sure I'd had my coffee though.

"There's no way I'm going to the hospital, I haven't had my coffee yet!"If you follow it up with some cold water, it makes things go even faster.We're going to need a little more information. Did it start hurting while you were running, or afterward? Also, where on your knee does it hurt?Same. Plus an occasional San Pellegrino if I'm feeling particularly European. It might have just been me, but I found swimming made it worse (the position of the foot when kicking). I do, however, second rolling and ice. Another thing that really helped get my P-F under control was wearing a boot at night or if I was parked on the couch for a few hours watching TV. It is amazing what holding the foot in a single right-angle position for even one night would do to the pain the next day. Good luck, it's a frustratingly painful problem to have.

[Edit to actually respond to the question asked: I used the elliptical and stationary bikes a fair amount and also rowed when it was unbearably painful.]My boss calls that "The JT's" - joggers trots. The abbreviation allows us to talk about it in a work environment.The obvious answer (to me at least) is to get yourself out to the beach (just go west on Miramar/La Jolla Village Drive or Carmel Valley Road (I think that was the name of it... kind of a pot-hole haven back in the day, but it kept out the riff raff) and run barefoot along the waves.  And I have envy. It's snowing out my window. Out of curiosity, is this a biotech/pharmaceutical company in California?YES! This was bothering the crap out of me too...Fellow lurker and 6 foot 200+ lbs. gentleman here.  I used to run all of the time, around then I sat around 200 lbs.  Got married, slacked off and had fun and found myself sitting at 234, the most I've ever weighed in my life.  The wife and I started a diet last month, which included a lot of cardio.  I bought some nice Brooks which have enticed me to run more, so I've been running nearly everyday for the last month.  I've lost 15 lbs. and have worked my way up to running 4.5 miles without stopping.

With that being said, congratulations!  I know the feeling of success, and it feel fantastic.  There's really nothing like it.  And if there were a running club for 6 foot 200+ pound dudes then count me in!During marathon training... Wake up at 4:45am, start my run at 5:00am, Run 10-13 miles, get home shower, take child to day care, go to work by 8.

I love running before work because it gets it over with and out of the way.  You get used to it just like anything else.  Now, I prefer to run 5-6 miles at around 6 or 6:30.  Finish by 7:30, quick shower, and then work.  But the key to doing that is to not have children.It's probably his Facebook picture and they don't have access to anything else. It's irrationally irritating to me too though... You're not alone. I tell myself that a marathon is like running two half-marathons in a row.Agreed... it's probably fine in moderation (I drink 1 cup / workday typically), but if you get to the point where "you can't do anything until you've had your coffee" there's probably a problem there.

BTW your comment reminded me of this comic:

*Honey! My water just broke!*

*Get in the car we can stop at Starbucks on the way!*What about software trainers? Do you need any of those?My girlfriend isn't much of a runner so I have experience with planning routes out that accommodate her abilities and mine at the same time when I do drag her with me. After a while, your son will realize that that same route he does with dad is easier and you'll start seeing progress. It just takes time like anything else. Most importantly, the thing that matters the most is that he's going to look back and remember the time he spent with you running and not the struggle of doing it so no matter what, enjoy the moment.I run early. Don't eat before hand. I actually prefer it during the warmer months. control F, type running. boom!

that's pretty gross!  i have never experienced this and i hope i never do :) I'll just follow your username instead As far as strategy goes, the first mile, just stick with your goal pace, and run your own race. When you get to the 5th lap, start to think about making moves. Look at where you are in the pack and where you want to be. Position yourself to overtake anyone you want to pass and make your initial move to where you want to be in the pack towards the end of the 5th lap or beginning of the 6th. Hold on to that position until the  final 800m, during that time, keep looking at where you are and where you want to be. When you hit the last 800, begin your "kick." You will almost assuredly have slowed down a bit in the 5th and 6th laps, even if you stuck to the same position within the pack, because it just naturally happens. So when you start your 'kick' you shouldn't sprint the last 800m, but rather try to go faster than your goal pace for the first 400m (I.e. if you're goal is 11 minutes, try to run an 80 for your 7th lap.) and in the final 400m, put everything you have into one final push towards the finish line. And that's about it. They are probably only using it because:

1. It's a photo they can easily get access to
2. The media loves repetition
3. It's showing him doing something that a lot of 'normal' people do to give us a sense of "Oh my gawd, but he didn't look like a killer" kinda feelings.


And then there's probably some conspiracy theorists trying to link this event, that photo, and the act of terrorism and running must go hand in hand and therefore runners=terrorists. Stay on couch, watch tv! Zen Labs C25k. It notifies you at your intervals.It didn't slow me down. Didn't make me faster either.

When I did my first half, I had been doing the beginner routine over at /r/bodyweightfitness for about 4 months, then switched over to StrongLifts 5x5 (bad Idea, but that I'd see two months later...) for a month or so, and I quite liked my time.

All in all, I've become more aware of my body tension, which is nice, and I haven't had ankle and knee problems or shin splints, which is awesome. (Of course, I've also had to drop some mileage, so make of that what you will)My 9-year-old niece as run several 5k's with her dad. He's an experienced distance runner (former military and former marathoner) and Hailey asked if she could start jogging with him when she was 7 or so. They started off slow and short, and worked up to longer distances and faster paces.

I think the biggest thing is making sure it's fun, optional and never pushing too far. Learn where the line is between healthy limit-pushing and overworking his growing body. But I'm excited you're looking into fitness and well-being together as a family!I lived in a small village in rural Japan for several years. I never saw another runner, but I did see a lot of people out for a stroll :)Does your work have showers or something...?  This has always made me curious when it comes to run commutes.What irritates me more is how the media always show pictures of the co-pilot for people to remember and not the pilot who was a heroI hear you. I get up at 5 and have a 60 minute commute to be at work at 7, so adding a run in the morning = 4am wakeup. booooooooo :(&gt; Wake up at ~4:15

Nope.You need more upvotes for this.  My usual running route goes right past a local park (it's my 2mi marker) and if I do it opposite my normal direction it's located at almost exactly the point where he would peter out. I have one 4 oz. espresso with my oatmeal 1 hour before my AM weekend long run. Weekdays I run during the evening so coffee isn't an issue.
I also use 20 mg caffeinated GU energy gels. Do you leave spare clothes at your workplace, or do you run with a pack on?Ask this guy, he runs at 4am: [Nude jogger draws ire of Montreal neighbours](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/nude-jogger-draws-ire-of-montreal-neighbours-1.2999973)been there. done that. not funSOMEBODY made a poor life choice... ;)There's also studies saying 4+ cups a day cuts colon cancer and prostate cancer by a significant amount.

I think the lesson is "Coffee may do things to you. but we don't know what those things are"I used to avoid coffee for this reason, but then I realized I'd cut so much out of my diet that really isn't terrible and I was sick of eschewing so many minor indulgences.  If I'm not drinking soda or juice and regularly abstain from sugary/overly salty foods and desserts, I think I can live with a coffee, even if it has caffeine.  Other than that, I only drink water or post-run chocolate milk.

So I recently added this to my mornings.  My big concern was that I'd get so used to it that anything I used to bolster performance on an off-day would be upset, but so far it has been a net gain.  I've gotten a more nuanced pallet for it and I do look forward to it in my mornings, where I just naturally drag ass.  I don't feel dependent on it, though, and I think for most people that's just hyperbole.

*I could quit if I wanted to.*

(Two cups a day, one cream.)I've heard wonderful things about rolling -- I've heard everything from a lacrosse/tennis ball to a cold water bottle. Doing the calf stretches. I'm glad to hear bike is okay. And THANK YOU for referencing those other threads -- I probably should have done that before starting a new thread :/ I'm still new at this Reddit tomfoolery.I think it takes an especially patient kid to like running as much as they like the *idea* of running with dad. Most 9 year old kids like running around and playing, but distance running isn't really that.

That said, why not give it a shot? Maybe he'll like it! I bet you'll both enjoy the time together. I'm guessing the BIL had negative things to say about drinking a pot and a half. It sounds excessive to me, and like anything else, coffee should be consumed in moderation.I feel ya. Coffee 1-1.5 hours before my run, an empty belly, and a good energized run. I normally do my weekday runs over my lunch breaks, though, so morning coffee fits into that routine well. My long runs on the weekends vary so coffee isn't always a factor in those. I do see a marked improvement in my energy levels, though!What's gross is when you have a poopmergency during your run and you have to go into the woods behind a big tree and drop a load because otherwise it will explode in your shorts.

That's only happened to me once, though, and it was clearly a learning experience.I wake up at 5:30, run for an hour-ish, and take a 30 min power nap before workCross training --&gt; bike and swimming

Ice your foot, do calve raises, foam roll/use a baseball or tennis ball at work while just sitting

I use overdrive app which is free through my library not 100% the greatest selection but so far I have been able to find enough to listen to. I listen to mostly fiction (fantasy/scifi) and it makes me want to go run because I want to listen to more haha Just a mathematician.  :(That was a pretty clutch third beer.What's so bad about running slow every once in a while? He won't be stopping so often in a couple of weeks. There was an article here a week ago or so about an 8 year old kid running a 33 mile ultra so it's not like kids aren't capable of running. They will catch up soon. its not gross, its 100% true! Hahaha, actually yes!  We're looking for biochemists and neuropharmacologistsTreat his running as if he were starting in martial arts. You don't just throw a kid into advanced, intense lessons right off the bat. You gotta start him off easy with the basics. Do some fairly short runs with him at his own pace. Push him a little but not too much. Let him set the tone. Make sure he's got good shoes, a safe place to run and work into it.

If you want to take him with you on *your* runs, plan out a course where should he stop to walk or quit all together, he'd be safe alone. Maybe a looping course around your neighborhood that goes by your home or a small trail at the local park where he can wait by the car for you to finish your laps. There's a friend of mine who has two treadmills at home and his daughter runs with him side by side so that's an option too. Best of both worlds, you get your own pace, the kid gets theirs, and you're both happy. I don't drink it before I run, but mostly because of my medication.

I have ADHD so I take adderall daily. Taking my medicine or a secondary stimulant right before a run = 195bpm and the general feeling that my heart is going to crawl out of my chest like a chestburster in Alien.

Even without the meds, coffee and exercise tend to make me feel lightheaded and slightly out of breathTop comment about poop? Top comment about poop.I'm not sure if it supplements my work, but I definitely feel energized all day.  I used to get really sleepy around ~2pm and since I started running I feel quite energetic throughout the day, even if I slept poorly.  &gt; My brother in-law however seems to think it is the worst thing man can ever consume. He's a biologist too so he's not just parroting non-sense... I don't think.

FWIW, I did biochem research for years and I drink like a pot a day.  And, honestly, like 90% of med school and grad students are highly addicted to caffeine.

&gt; indirectly contributing to the torture and death of millions of kittens.

Those kittens started the conflict and have no right to complain now that they've reaped the whirlwind.Haha yeah, I'm usually asleep by 9pm.  That's driven as-much by my early-morning-running as it is by my toddler's bedtime (~8pm).I run as soon as a wake up, it usually is a 30 minute run. I like running in the morning, it wakes me up and gets me hungry for breakfast. Espresso is awesome!I dunno, man....both countries are serious beer-drinking countries, but Australia ranks 11th in the world per-capita while Canada is a lowly 25th (get your shit together, Canada). And when it comes to running, I'm sorry to say the land of Kangaroos and other Australian things far outpaces Canada. Australia has faster world records in every distance event save for the 10K, and even that is only 1 second faster.

Sorry Canada, I'm with the Aussies here.I say if you like your routine with coffee and it isn't affect your running - why change it? Everyone's body is different, and just because one biologist says it's a bad thing, it does not mean it's a bad thing for you.

Anyway, coffee is love. I like to make a cup from my french press half an hour to an hour before my long run. It seems to warm me up and get me excited for the run. I haven't had to deal with any crashing mid run or dehydration - I drink a LOT of water constantly throughout the day anyway.I would be interesting in your brother-in-laws findings and why he thinks it's the worse thing a man could drink.

Also, please report back if he also drinks soda. He kindve did, but only like half way or so.FUCKING AUSTRALIA. It's time to shine again, Canada. This is *our* sport.Another "nobody cares" answer. Wear what's comfy.

Often I plan my runs so they end somewhere where I need to do errands and then walk/take the train home with my hands full of grocery bags or something. Nobody bats an eye.Coffee is the only thing that keeps me awake if I run before (or to) work. I both the mile and 2-mile. I also had a long break after cross country season. Best advice I have is to find a running partner. I run with a team mate who has a similar pace and it helps us push each other (I go out faster at the start, he finishes faster).
Oh man i've been looking for something like this for a long time. Thanks for posting that!I recall an incident at a local marathon 3 years ago where some lady crapped herself about 1k from the finish line.  The next year I saw someone with a sign reading "if you haven't shit your pants yet, you're already a winner"I did a realay race when I was in school.  I went first since I was the best and didn't want to be stuck behind slow so I handed  it over and waited  and the finish the next guy handed it off to the 3 third guy. The third guy was running and felt the need to crap as he was running  past  a public  toilet and ran in and took a crap and never finished the race Also biologist is a very broad term that just means he studied living things. For all we know he could specialize in the study of tree frogs. 160km is too far.  Don't do thisJust don't try to "phase" through a semi after reading this, it might hurt.This is Reddit. People have pooped everywhere.I started with a quarter cup of cereal with a splash of non-dairy milk and worked my way up. On a race day I'll have a small bowl of cereal, some peanut butter toast and a banana two hours before gun time and be fine. There are some foods I need to avoid...yoghurt and dried fruits both cause what the running mags call 'distress'.I should have known better putting in that 62+ mile week at the end of March while trying to keep a run streak. Dammit.I'm continually amazed by his performance.

I also wonder how fast someone could do an indoor beer 800 with 200 m chugging. I can easily run 800m. It only takes me 4 or 5 minutes.Has anyone really pooped while they're running? Besides Raab himself?Definitely didn't put the beers upside-down over his head to show that they were empty....I dunno about this "record".....I have mixed feelings about it. I'm a new runner so my experience may not be the most reliable but the few morning runs that I've gone on I always had coffee before hand and never made it as far as my afternoon/evening runs. I get too jittery and my muscles don't seem to work as well.

I keep finding myself comparing it to my career as a musician and the same thing happens. More jitters, more sweat, less hydration and worse performance, but maybe I'm just stiff in the am.
People walk around in running clothes sometimes. No one notices and no one cares. I sometimes stop by my local grocery store at the end of a long run, I'm very confident no one looks at me and thinks, "look how out of shape this fuckin' guy is". The studies I've seen tend to show negative effects kicking in at 4+ cups a day.I'm in the same boat (college student with not enough time to read). A few weeks ago, I started listening to audiobooks while running and commuting to class too. I love it! Check out smart audiobook player if you're looking for a new player. I torrent my books and play them through that. I listen to some books on quantam physics by Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking. If that's a bit of a bore, I'm listening to Revolution by Russell Brand right now. Normally don't go for these kind of books but I just saw Brand's name and grabbed it. It's really made me take a step back and think about some things. (And he's got a great narrative style).I know the feels. January-March I averaged over 110 miles a month. Last year, I only had 3 months total over 100 miles. I have a half in 3 weeks, and I just got planter fasciitis. Wonderful memories.I walk/hike frequently during long runs. I do everything in my running clothes. I bring a hooded wind shell (packs in my pocket and only a few ounces) to put on if I start to get cold and I'm not ready to start running again. I only look silly to people I don't care about. I ran the steeple in college just so I'd never have to do the 800.  The last one I ever ran was part of a 4x800 team (our B-squad relay team) my soph year.  Good riddance.I can't run with coffee in my system. It causes issues with acid reflux, and...er, digestive acceleration. Nothing gives me acid reflux like coffee and running combined. What's worse is that after doing it for a while, I started having acid reflux with everything. I had to cut all caffeine and eat a GERD diet for three months until I healed up. Never again!

It's bad for you if you're the kind of person who puts tons of sugar and cream in your coffee (guilty). However, if you drink it black and in moderation, it's ultimately good for you. Okay, so the acids aren't the best for your teeth, but the same goes for strawberries. Caffeine may contribute to osteoporosis in women, but if you're working out, then you're already significantly lowering your risk. It's full of antioxidants, cleans your colon, it's good for your liver, and it decreases your risk of colon cancer.  In general, coffee is fairly good for you. In terms of performance, I think that depends on the individual.

I should also say that I don't drink it every day anymore, because I don't like being addicted to caffeine. I like being able to get up and get on with my day without coffee. I only drink it on the weekends or with friends.Well, it's JV...Can I ask, if you're doing all that, what time do you go to bed?I love coffee or redbull before a run, definitely helps but make sure you factor in some bathroom time before the start of the race Be sure to use a mug with a tight lid so you don't burn your hand while running. /sHonestly, any advice is going to be pretty difficult to put into practice.  I think the best thing you can do is talk to your fellow racers, find somebody who you think is about as fast as you (or a little faster, if nothing else; based on performance in other events and cross), and try and run with them.  Then look at your splits afterwards and think about how you felt during the race and learn from it.

Good luck, it's not a bad race, I'm sure you'll do fine.My wife and I run 3 miles before work every morning. We love it and honestly I wouldn't have gotten into running if I didn't do this. We adapted by going to bed a little bit earlier the night before. I don't eat before the run - I'll just brush my teeth, wash my face, and have a glass of water. We wake up at 5:30, get to the park by 5:45, and are usually home by 6:45 which is when we would normally otherwise wake up for work.Nice counterpoint to those who claimed that the [Mary Cain article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/magazine/mary-cain-is-growing-up-fast.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;bicmp=AD&amp;bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&amp;bicmst=1409232722000&amp;bicmet=1419773522000&amp;_r=1) contained language that would never be directed towards boys

When I coached high schoool track and cross country, we'd have some Ultimate Frisbee days just to make it fun. Drink enough to feel awake and go #2 but not enough to upset the stomach and feel like battery acid is pumping through your veins.Do you feel that running early supplements your work? In other words, do you feel more energized and ready to go at work? Do you feel run down by the end of the day? When I raced it my coach and I set splits before the race and treated it like a work out with a kick for the last 300its getting there at the moment, you still mainly see westerners running, vietnamese people tend to go on morning walks from what I observe. but overall there is definitely an increase in locals running as well now.I love run commuting ! Runs 355 days apart:

Not max effort on either, but around a 6 on a PRE scale both times.Coffee has, much like running, become almost a hobby for me. I don't own a place where I can roast my own beans yet, but I always buy whole bean, pay close attention to the grind, and usually use either my aeropress or french press to make coffee.

Needless to say, I'm almost always drinking coffee before a run. This is pretty much a map of my drinks throughout the day, with iced tea in the middle sometimes. &gt;Now that I live in the city I hate walking in my running clothes, because it looks like I have no conditon.

In the nicest way possible: no one gives a shit.  If you live in a city, you're going to see a ton of people who you don't know, and don't know you.  If one of them thinks you look silly for wearing shorts, chances are good you'll never see them again, and that they'll forget about it as soon as you go by.Exactly.  One cup and I am SET.How popular is recreational running in Vietnam? Just curious!Transitioning to mornings runs have been awesome. I like sticking to trails in the morning, so far I've seen a bobcat, some elk and lots of deer. I've run into 3 bears while fishing in the morning before, so I'm expecting to see those too.Ph.D. scientist here too, I study human physiology...there are both positive and negatives surrounding coffee, my take on this is that with moderation that the joy of enjoying a cup or two of coffee is something that is overall a good thing, barring other health issues (like I would avoid coffee in pregnancy, etc.).

For running specifically, I would try to be aware that you will need to perhaps hydrate a bit more since caffeine is a diuretic and also that the caffeine can interrupt sleep quality, which is important for everyone to get, including especially athletes to rest and restore.

I myself am the same as you, I will have 1-2 cups per day in the morning (I run in the evening) and it is something which I enjoy greatly.

You may also be aware that caffeine is a stimulant that is used to enhance race performance, and so in this way of thinking you should be aware that some gels include caffeine to give a pick-me-up during a race (this is more of a PSA so that people can look for this in their gels and either avoid or seek them out according to preference). I actually look at my gels before a race so that I can be sure that I won't get a caffeine high (which can lead to a crash) from what I have in my stock, I try to stick to a total of about 100 mg of caffeine in my gels and fill in the rest with decaf ones, which is about the amount of a cup of coffee. Like it, love it, gotta have it. (I do try to keep my caffeine intake relatively low on long run days bc I want to maintain a lower HR.)I drink a lot of coffee. Because of my phobia of puking whole I run I usually wait about a half hour after my last cup and drink water. Not sure if that even does anything but it makes me feel better.As a once in a while drink I bet you find it to be much more effective.Not to hate but this doesn't really apply to any of my times as a high schooler ( when I was running in high school) because they do significantly less miles than you do in college so if you run a 16:00 5k I was running a much faster mile than it is saying and two mile but  slower half marathon idk. If it were me I wouldn't use this unless your running 60+ miles a week

Edit: this being said, it matches my college times pretty well. Just careful how you use it depending on who you areHow did the body weight fitness impact on your running?

I'm thinking about entering a few half marathons coming up whilst also starting some body weight stuff to improve my strength and core but I'm not sure if this is going to be a bit too much for someone still trying to lose 10 pounds. I've got a 50k in two weeks, I'm on day #122 of a run streak, I've trained the hardest I've ever trained for a race and now, today, my fucking birthday, my foot hurts. I need a voodoo shaman stat!I'm a fairly regular coffee drinker, and I pretty much always have a cup before races or early morning runs. No apparent detriment, though I can't claim anecdotal evidence that it improves anything either.

As far as it apparently stimulating peristalsis, I always make sure to take a restroom break before any run regardless, so no harm there. My biggest problem is that my muscles feel too tight to run first thing in the morning. No matter how much I stretch, I just feel tight when I'm out running. I feel a lot better running after being up for a few hours.I don't know what you mean by "no condition" but it sounds like something you just need to get over.  General rule of thumb is to wear weather appropriate clothing that you're comfortable in.I do my tiny middleaged bits of running (5km max these days) straight out of bed around 6am, via bathroom. I would love to drink something before I go but seriously, the NOISE of it sloshing inside me is unbearable, so I never do. Never eat either. I'm lucky to live a mile from a beautiful seafront, so I get some amazing dawn views, very little traffic and lovely birdsong. Breakfast and bath at home. That's not a bug, that's a featureI have recently changed my coffee intake and it's helped my running in an indirect way.  I now drink one cup of regular (caffeinated) coffee in the morning.  I don't take in any caffeine after that and I am sleeping SOOO much better.  I used to have an afternoon cup of coffee.  Even though I tried never to have it after 3 pm, it was definitely affecting my sleep.&gt; Too much coffee can leave you dehydrated.

I wish people would stop saying this.I drink coffee before I run, just like I do before anything else I do, including going to bed at night. ;-)

Also, [caffeine is shown to help endurance sports due to fat metabolization](http://www.rice.edu/~jenky/sports/caffeine.html), so there's that tooI love the quietness of the streets, the fresh silent part of the day, and being done with early. After a week or so of doing it, it became second nature. The only thing you ever need to worry about is the first step, the one out of bed. You do that one, the rest is easy.

I never eat anything before a morning run, unless it's for 5 or more miles, then it's a banana and power bar, with 1/2 serving of gatorade.And that is why I eat simple stuff for dinner the day before I do morning runs. Coffee is a post workout thing for me.I love to run in the morning, I get up at 4:15 and I am out the door by 4:30, I don't eat or drink anything before a run.  I like the fact that then it is done and I go to work then head home and don't have to do anything else for the rest of the dayBeen here switch shoes/ get new shoes. Helps so much. If you have to just take that two or three days off. Also whenever you can run on the side of the road. If you need to just run laps around the inside of your track on the grass or your school soccer fieldAbsolutely agree. Opt for socializing and put a "checkmark" for the day. You can go for a long run the next day or two*.

*Just stay alert and make sure that socializing activities do not start to take a bigger share of your time than running :DI do it here in Vietnam and its amazing seeing the sun rise and street vendors set up shop while you run. plus i love getting to work knowing I aready have my workout done, it puts me in a much better and more relaxed mood and tbh I feel like I have much more energy and feel less tired during the day&gt; drive to work, which is right by the beach

Are you, uh, is your company hiring?goddamn that smoothie sounds delicious!Waffles make me shit.

I also really like shitting in the woods on runs. Some call me weirdI drink about 3/4 pot of coffee per day (sometimes only a cup and sometimes more).  When I run, my typical pre-run meal is two packets of oatmeal, a heaping scoop of peanut butter and a cup of coffee.

If you have been drinking it and it hasn't messed with your running too much, or doesn't destroy your body during a run, it's safe for you to use before/after/during a run.

I personally like to try to force myself to eat things before runs/bike rides because if I can stomach it during training/exercise, I can stomach it (and more importantly, my normal nutrition) a lot easier during races.Former 4 year high school and 4 year college runner- don't do pace calculator go off your current workouts/ shape your in. Have you been doing any goal pace workouts? If so start at that pace.

Try and run even splits not go out fast. Many times in high school you will know or recognize people in your district that run roughly the same pace as you or that you can gauge yourself off. &lt;--- always helped me

Ask your coach. He is doing your Workout and may have an idea.

Also- just get in there and race. Find a pace you like and run with a pack. Stick on some girls shoulder and see where the race takes you! Good luck I'm not a regular coffee drinker so I don't have much experience running with coffee. I have read, however, that it is a poor idea to train with excessive amounts of caffeine. Caffeine is a performance enhancing drug and can alter your training runs significantly. I've read that it is better to avoid caffeine while training and consume 100-200 mg on race day.Loool you got me thereI run in the mornings during the summer. Once fall and winter comes, it's just too dark out to go before work. I do run with my husband and a friend, so it's not about being alone in the dark. But there aren't many areas around here with good street lighting, so once the winter hit we were dodging pot holes in the dark. I can't wait to start going before work again!! Plus, in the summer, the mornings are the only time where the humidity and heat won't be tortuous.

I will say though that I'm definitely a morning person. I already get up by at least 6am every morning, and I'm in bed by 9:30pm. So it's not too big of a stretch to get up at 5 or 5:30am for a run/workout! Consider 300 miles as a reminder. I change out earlier if my knees hurt a little or if I see excessive wear on the sole.Everyone in this thread is being tactful, and this is the nub of it.

**Coffee makes you poop, poop before you run so you don't poop while you're running.**

Failing a ncaa drug test because of caffeine for a engineering finalI would agree that water is the best stuff for your body. In my opinion, that while you get a short-term buff from coffee, there is a trade off in the long-term.
From my personal experience: coffee helps me to boost a single run, but after the run and the next day I feel weaker, which leads to drinking a pre-run coffee again. Once I brake that circle and stay with water for a couple of days - I don't need that coffee buff even in the morning.
So - yeah, coffee helps, and yes - it is a drug.What are some studies that show that coffee is bad for you?Coffee messes with my system too much. I try to avoid it anytime within four hours of when I run. The few times that I broke the rule, I ended up cutting my run short because I either had to go to the bathroom or got some nasty cramps. For me, it's just easier to avoid it.I've avoided coffee for this same reason.  It's the most socially acceptable drug addiction to have.  But because it's acceptable, the people who don't drink coffee are the wierdos.  Not to say I never drink it, but only for work seminars or conference calls (i.e. times when I would like to fall asleep, but MUST NOT).  Daily usage just to feel normal is not appealing in any sense.

I'm also not so competitive that I'm looking for every edge over my competition; I don't wear racing flats and I only hydrate mid-run if it's longer than a half.  I definitely know a lot of people who don't run (and even MORE people who don't bike) without having coffee an hour or two beforehand; I prefer not to have to schedule a stop at Dunkin' on the way to every race though..
Coffee/caffeine tends to come and go as a trendy thing to hate and accuse of causing cancer, blah blah blah. I'm surprised that an educated scientist would be so anti-coffee.

It's totally fine and can even be good for you. Everyone has different tolerance to caffeine, so as long as you aren't drinking enough to get nauseous/cold sweats/headaches, you should be fine.

Anecdotally, my dad is an extremely serious and competitive marathoner and wouldn't think of skipping his daily pot of coffee.I just tell people that it's like running two 400s in a row.I don't need coffee to do my morning workouts and prefer not to, but in the winter I'll give myself a small cup (literally less than one measured cup, not a mug) to overcome the dark and cold, although sometimes I'll use hot water with lemon instead. I will reward myself with a cup mixed with protein powder as recovery treat after a workout instead. Here's what I've noticed:

* Since I mostly don't drink coffee other than that single daily cup, it makes taking in caffeine on race day way more effective
* I can't drink coffee before an intervals or other high intensity workout; it makes my heart feel like it's fluttering. I have no actual heart issues, been to the doctor already for that.
* Caffeine seems to help me more with endurance than with speed. I don't feel as dead after a long workout or race (4+ hours) if I take strategic small amounts of caffeine, but my speed seems no different
* Coffee on an empty stomach combined with exercise can occasionally make me nauseatedI've worn them for a [race](http://i.imgur.com/faMYCBH.png), and for hashing. I wear a pair of compression shorts underneath (pushed up so they don't show). After about 5 miles, I have to pull the compression shorts down because the denim inevitably starts to rub the wrong way.What worked for me was rolling back a firm deadline for the last caffeine. I used to have a cup of tea before bed! I started by saying 'nothing after 6' and then went back to after 3, after 1, after 11, and now I have just the one cup in the morning. I find the less I have it the less I crave it (after some intense withdrawal the first week at my current barely caffeinated level). I really do think it was keeping me from sleeping properly (and feeding into a cycle that way...I was tired, so I drank more caffeine, so I didn't sleep well, and so on).Finally hurt something so badly I can't run right now. :( been trying to back off mileage and stuff before the half I ran last weekend, but my hip simply refused to cooperate, even with reduced mileage leading up to the race.

Xray is negative for overt fracture and it certainly feels like soft tissue, but I'm not sure I trust the urgent care PAs opinion. Will ask for referral after we get back from Easter break but in the mean time, I see everyone around me getting psyched by the beautiful weather. I wanna be out there too.

I feel like a moron too, cuz I was afraid this was gonna happen but I ran anyway. Have another 10k on the 18th that if I don't run I forfeit a race series and another essentially half in September. I'm scared.I have tried it. I know so many people who say, "It's so great, it wakes me up before I head into work!"

I'm convinced these people are freaks, because every time I try to do it I get to work and almost PTFO face down on my desk. Also, I wake up at 6:00-6:30 every morning already.I'm exactly the same way. I see. Thanks that makes sense. Dang shoes looking all fine on the outside and getting rotten on the inside.Wow, work at 10am then in bed at noon? I want your job! ;)I get up, have a cup or so of black coffee, go to the bathroom, and eat about an ounce of cheese or 2 oz of meat while drinking a small shake. I run and work out. Then I have a piece of fruit with the remainder of the shake while I'm on my way to work.

If I don't I get nauseous while runningI mean, it's not a literal replacement from a running fitness standpoint... but that's fine. If you're someone that's in the habit of running 15 milers on Sundays, missing a run and hiking 20 miles isn't going to be a bad thing in any way.I knew I was a better person for listening to Blur instead.Read that whole article for a single sentence...

I'm out the door at 5am, takes a bit to get going some days. I drink about half a glass of water as I get ready. Drink the rest when I get back. When I started running I would eat breakfast first then head out. I found I would get stomach cramps when I started running faster.I usually drink coffee for morning runs when I feel unmotivated. I usually drink two cups, sit down, get jittery, spend about an hour adding to my running playlist, run out of ideas, get very depressed, black out and then come to back home drooling in my chair with a new distance record on Nike+. I think I enjoy running post-coffee, I just don't remember doing it.Coffee doesn't cause dehydration. [It's a myth.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084154) Studies haven't looked at the effects of large volumes of coffee, but moderate intake doesn't have any negative effect on hydration status.Mom??? You gotta want to do it, but it's possible!Depending on the day / study, coffee wards off cancer, causes cancer, decreases heart disease risk, increases heart disease risk, etc...

I'm just going to enjoy my two cups a day and see what happens. agreed. even though it takes some effort, and I feel like an old man getting up while it's still dark out, there is nothing cooler than watching the sun come up while I'm running. it's pretty flat where I live, and the way the sky looks during sunrise is something to behold.I get up at quarter to 6, get dressed, then head off. I like the peacefulness of it all! I usually have muesli when I get back home. I keep my morning runs relatively short at 3-4 miles. Here's just my experience. I like running in the morning, for obvious reasons since there are less people around to step in your way. I also like the fresh cooler air.

However, I only once ran without eating something before and the run was really tough on me. I would literally drag me through the run and felt like I severely lacked energy. So now, I have to eat some plain toast or something before. Yeah, I drink a lot of coffee at home and at work. Too much actually.You should post it on the LR forums, some of the people on there literally know everythingI love it, but it gives me the shits. yeah you're right. I didn't even think to change the seconds.I run to work Tuesday, Wednesday &amp; Thursday (it's about 6 miles).

I get up at 5am &amp; am out the door by 5:30am.
I drink a little water before I leave, but that's it. I eat 4 packs of oatmeal after I get to the office &amp; change.


I do my weekend runs in the morning as well, but don't start until 6 or 6:30am.
I drink a small cup of coffee before every morning run. Sometimes I run into the issue others have mentioned of not waiting at home to poop before heading out, but that has been the only issue as far as I can tell.

I also don't drink (another, pre-run) coffee if I'm running any time after early morning. I really only drink it in the first place because I'll have a terrible headache if I don't, so it's more of a don't-disturb-the-routine thing than a strategy.

I haven't noticed any negative effects. It helps me poop and it helps me feel alert, fresh, and energized.Yup. I usually go to bed at about 12pm. But I hope that will change if I wake up earlier :) http://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=running+morning&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=allI get up between 4:30 and 5 on running mornings, do between three and six miles fasted state. I don't eat until lunchtime (I start at 12:30 with a big bag of carrot sticks). I have a cup of green tea before I go out. Back home by 6, shower and cup of regular tea, out of the house by 6:45, maybe a half-hour nap on the train. Home again at 8 at night, and in bed by 10:30, asleep by 11. It's not ideal, but it's the only way I could get the miles in. I don't drink alcohol or have caffeine after that one cup of regular tea,and I find that I sleep much better at night, even getting such an early start, and don't feel slow or tired during the day but I realise not everyone may be so keen to give up coffee and beer!It can be kind of rough at first, but your body adapts pretty well to it.  I also always run after lifting.

 I didn't really follow the whole SL program since I used to lift a bit before (didn't start with just an empty bar and made higher jumps in the beginning).  I just like using the app since I always lose my notebooks.

I It really helps improve workout performance. Peer reviewed studies support this, and I personally find it to be true. But the problem is it gives me bad, bad heartburn when I drink it before intense workouts or long runs. The heartburn usually lasts the rest of the day. I've even had it last three days once. I wondered if I had given myself peptic ulcers. All this after drinking one 8oz cup. I don't really coffee or caffeine to begin with so I get some of those negative symptoms even after a tiny amount- heartburn, upset stomach, and the jitters. My solution was to cut out the coffee and take a 5 hour energy only before races to get the benefits of caffeine without the heartburn. That works best for me.Sounds great, and very delicious! I should add that I'm usually asleep by 9pm.  You probably stay up a little later than that :)Impressive! I go to work at 10am so I should be able to accomplish something similar.Coffee before, water during, beer after. Hydration is important!May be. Just because he is a biologist does not mean that he knows everything about every thing in detail!Love coffee, drink about 2 or 3 cups in the morning before breakfast then workout.  Works great. Might be just the time of the day thing. In the afternoon, you might be a bit tired after the whole day. Also, if it's something that you are not used to, this will cause a bit of struggle in the beginning.This is great! Thank you so much for this! I'm going to do those exercises to try abs strengthen all my weak bits :3 I love the feeling of gradually waking-up during my run.  Usually my first ~3-4 miles are pretty slow and groggy but then I start to get-into it and pick-up-the-pace.  By the time I get home I'm usually going at a good pace and feeling great.

I love the feeling of being at work at 8am and knowing that I already ran 10 miles and everyone else is still groggy or isn't even there yet.

It gives me a subtle sense of accomplishment that lasts through the day, even if everything else at work goes to hell.

My routine:

 * Wake up at ~4:15
 * Drink coffee, move bowels, read internet
 * Eat two toaster waffles
 * Let wife shower (we have a toddler)
 * Out the door by ~5:15-5:30
 * Back home by ~6:30, shower, etc
 * On the way to work by 7

Once or twice a week I'll do a mid-week long-run where I'll get in the car at ~5:15 and drive to work, which is right by the beach.  Then I can run 10+ miles, shower at work, and still make it to the office by ~7:30-8am.God dammit I wish I could work out before work. I already get up at 5:30 to go to work though.I've never had a problem with running and coffee consumption. I drink at least a pot a day, often two. I also drink a ton of water so no, I'm not dehydrated.I love the early morning runs. It's great knowing that my run is already done and the rest of the day would be no big deal! It's nice and peaceful even in the busy city. During the winter, I used to see the sun rise during my runs and it's a sight worth waking up for.
I take a while to properly wake up. So I allow myself an hour before running for that.

I don't eat before my runs usually. Just a cup of coffee and water. Sometimes, I'd have a few bites of some multigrain bread. Before my long weekend runs, I eat one Luna bar so that I don't bonk out. ... April Fools!I'm 6'0ft and 190lbs, I'm thinking maybe I should get a second pair to start breaking in now. The only reason I'm asking is that I've suddenly started to get hip pain out of the blue, on both sides. Before I got good running shoes my hips were always sore, since my Nike "running" shoes had no cushion before.He's just parroting nonsense: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/21/its-official-americans-should-drink-more-coffee/ , http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Caffeine .I run at around 3AM...it's super quiet, minus deer, owls, and foxes in my suburban neighborhood.  I usually eat a half pack of Honey Stinger Chews and head out the door.  My route typically features a port-a-potty 2 miles in, in case of need.

I wake up around mile 2 as well, which is nice.  That said when I do a full week of these I'm pretty much a zombie on 4-5 hours of sleep a night.  The beautiful part of it is the quiet.  Absolutely no one is out there but me, my headlamp, the animals, and occasionally the newspaper drop off folks (who are extremely nice).I've completely cut caffeine out of my life. In fact all I drink is water. Everytime I see some study that coffee is actually good for you then I question my decision but another study usually follows stating the opposite. I figure that caffeine is the #1 drug and is used by the majority of people on this planet so I take the positive studies with a grain of salt.

Studies and facts aside the truth is I don't like the idea of being dependent on any one substance. Time and time again you will hear, "I can't do anything until I've had my coffee", or something similar. That kind of dependency is just not something I desire to have in my life.

Needless to say, I do my runs without.

Ancedotally speaking, I've been drinking only water since the beginning of the year and just recently my pace has been improving like crazy (5 months in). I usually hydrate the night before.The length of this amazingly written article deserves global recognition. There are essentially no risks for a normal person having multiple servings of coffee per day.

If sides like anxiety or insomnia aren't present there is no worry about larger health risks.

Coffee can be quite beneficial, in fact.

I stopped it entirely for a couple months while starting meds for ADHD and now have it in the morning before running (with my meds after exercise) and it's fantastic. I'm surprised your brother in law had so much negative advice about coffee, it seems like I've heard so much in the past few years that coffee is fantastic for prostate health and a few other benefits that are hard to google from my phone. Haha this is what I came in to say. Make sure that evacuations have been completed before you go out. I love to see the town wake up. It's nice to have the streets emptier than they otherwise would be. Sometimes I make the local coffee shop my destination &amp; walk home from there. &amp; yes, after a few days you get used to the early rise. Going to bed a little earlier helps. :)More news of the event http://dohanews.co/qatar-marathon-organizers-apologize-after-runners-lament-event-setup/I find myself using walk breaks on my longer runs and try to do some of my shorter ones continuous - but keep those continuous ones nice and slow. The point isn't to get faster from one run to the next. Run/Walk can be a very effective strategy for getting faster, to a point, because it allows you to run faster during the run intervals because of the break. And that point definitely includes 10k in under an hour.

Some days will just be harder than others (you didn't sleep well, are fighting off some minor bug, etc). I ran the same route last night as I did the week before (which is a long one for me), but I had a much harder time of it and ended up walking a lot by the end. I wasn't feeling great the day before so maybe something was lingering, or maybe I just went out too fast.. I have a piping hot cup always before my morning run. I don't like to run with a full colon.

I know thats gross but you all know what I'm talking about.Stretch/foam roll your calves!!! My shins are always worse when my calves are tight from hills or whatever. I have just starting running before sunrise this week. All I have before is a cup of coffee. It seems to work. I am also not running very long about 40 minutes.

I have a smoothie with greens, yogurt, avocado, fruit and cashew milk when I get home or if I have time a bacon, feta, squash omelette.

 I like it because I run with a friend and it makes the rest of the day better knowing my run is already done!

Plus as we head into the summer I think it will be necessary to run early to avoid the humidity!!Training for a marathon and planning to run ultras after that. I ran the marathon but injuries have stopped me from taking on any ultras. I have to be somewhat cautious with coffee and running, even as a daily and sometimes bidaily drinker of it. I already run into 'running encouraged digestive acceleration' and coffee too close to a run can lead to the impromptu creation of relay stations in forested regions and available stores. Absolutely love having a few cups of coffee after a longer run or to warm up after a cold run though. A small coffee before a run is a nice pick me up. Especially if I'm going out after an early shift. Maybe it its all in my head but that's fine by me.
I can only drink it before short runs though because I have a budgie bladder and coffee is a diuretic.Weird, I'm the complete opposite.  I try and wake up for 4:30am every day.  When I do, I end up going out for a run after a coffee.  I can easily run for an hour before stopping, not because I need to, but because I need to get on with the rest of my day.

When for whatever reason I don't wake up early, and push my run into the afternoon, I'm a wreck after 20 minutes and every step is a struggle.

I still haven't figured out what the reason for this is.  It's not the coffee though, if I run before the coffee it's pretty much the same deal only I'm less coherent.

I wonder what causes this discrepancy.Coffee is magic. Part of my pre-race breakfast, pre-long run breakfast, and pre-life breakfast. My biggest problem with coffee and running:

I can't wake up or do anything without coffee, but if I get myself a coffee and sit down i'm liable to get bogged down with something or just drink too much coffee and not go for a run.

I'm currently striving to run before coffee but I tell you what, my morning runs are a damn sight harder and less efficient than afternoon runs.haha great!It's a bonus rest day/cross training. Enjoy!just out of curiosity, why did you have to learn to eat mid run?Coffee is fine in moderation. Too much coffee can leave you dehydrated. A cup or two can give you a nice boost. That's the general feeling I've gotten from past posts on this topic, as well as my own experience. I went for moderate amounts of complex carbs, but I always had some simple carbs after running (raisins, grape juice etc). I don't know if this really qualified as carb backloading, but it certainly felt better, it probably didn't aid weight loss per se, but it helped me to stay active consistently.
(Of course, they still had to fit in my calorie goal.)

Generally, my "diet" could be best summarized: "High protein, don't worry about fat, cut carbs to make your calorie goal, eat real food."

Every once in a while I "cheated" by eating at (eyeballed) maintenance and throwing all macro considerations out of the window, crisps, chips, pizza, heck I've had a full Mc Doalds Menu and still lost weight.
(In fact, after those cheat days I always was lighter than before, probably water that got flushed out of the system)

My biggest recommendations: Relax. You will lose weight when you consistently eat under maintenance and exercise on top of it.The only sustenance a growing robot needs are the sweat and tears of humanity serving their robot overlords.Aah cool thats pretty slickOr 101000001010111111001 ms in the more typical parlance for computers.Dont worry about it i took last weeks long run off because I had plans and it hasnt effected my performance i prob needed the rest.Yer i used to get cramps before running if i had eaten and also if i had food after a long run my stomach would feel like crap. But after putting in a lot of running after 6 months i can eat anything before running and during running.I started small. I started with a quarter of a banana and now I'm able to down two bananas two seconds before I go for my run. Cramps were abundant at the start but I'm handling them much better now. Find out what works for you. A few weeks back, I thought I had a steel stomach and decided to eat a fat dinner right before a speed workout. It was quite the slow workout. ChapStick &amp; chewing gum help my mouth from feeling so dry&gt; Today I did a 5 mile trail run with about 380ft elevation gain in 57 minutes. I feel like I'm, getting worse and I'm so discouraged!

That's just the elevation gain. It slows us all down.

&gt; Generally due to time constraints I only run about 3-4 miles each time I run and I generally run 5 times per week.

That's fine.

&gt; I am trying to do a 10k at the end of May in under an hour-- I feel like it would be very helpful to be able to run at least a 5k without stopping in order to reach my goal but I'm not sure what to do differently!

That's correct. Being able to run 5k without stopping will help in running a better 10k.

&gt; Do you just force yourself to keep going? (I am assuming this is mostly mental, although sometimes my hip does hurt-- and I ice, roll and stretch when I get home)

Yes. You force yourself to keep going. It's all mental. Small pains are common and every runner has them. A rough rule of thumb to evaluate their seriousness : do the symptoms improve by the time you do your next training. If that's not the case, consult a professional.

&gt; Do you track it and force yourself to run .1 extra mile each time?

This is a common beginner mistake. _I will run .1 mile extra every training session, I can do that._ No, you can't because you won't be running 36.5 miles every day by the end of the year, will you? (Also commonly heard with speed, I will run 1 second faster every time will still not bring you a WR)

You need to increment your training load when you are ready, not increment to get ready. You increment to get ready for the step after that. So basically, increment in larger steps so you can accurately gauge if you are ready for that load. For example, you are ready to run 40 minutes in one go once you are able to confidently start a 30 minute session and know you will be able to finish it without having to walk. That's how you overcome mental barriers. Set benchmarks beforehand and once you meet the benchmark, you execute a plan that you've set beforehand as well.

The reason you need larger increments is because it is impossible to say between a 9.4 and a 9.5km long run if the former was easier because it was shorter and you are not ready for the latter or maybe because you slept just a bit better the night before. Between 8 and 10k on the other hand, the step is large enough to say that's very likely not the form of the day but really me being in a better overall shape.If you want to get good at running, run.

If you want to get good at riding, ride.

If you want to get good at rowing, row.

Notice a trend? You cant workout all week never running and expect your weekend runs to improve in leaps and bounds. If you want to get good at something you need to train for that thing. There is something to be said for cross training, but that's not what this is.

If you just want good cardiovascular health, keep it up you're doing well. If you want to improve your running times, rethink your training. Girl Talk - All Day&gt; 3.2m

That's 5.1499 Km.&gt; Would the hike be sufficient to "replace" my distance run?

No.Sorry, I do not recognize anybody on this photo, - but it's definitely a nice one :)If you're not specifically training for something don't over-sacrifice your social life. A hike is still good exercise, socialising keeps you sane.

Enjoy your life. total distance or total time imho. don't fret pace or inability to achieve weekly distances and just get out there and run. forcing yourself can booster your endurance but also aggravate injuries further. its a fine line thats tricky to establish and is something most people can't figure out until well in their running years. hell, being injury free is something that gets pretty rare... and is something you have to cherish


walk/run is something a lot of marathoners do, as routine in training or during the marathon races themselves... i know one woman who walk/runs a sub 3hr. don't ever be discouraged about not keeping a running pace. before you know it you'll start achieving goals and it won't seem like a big deal anymore. for a new runner 3.2m without stopping is really goodIn 2013 he ran a 50km ultra. Here is his result http://imgur.com/uldGVeJ

[Source](http://squamish50.ca/results/)DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DO THATHi!  This kind of reply would be better suited for the weekly accomplishment thread!Recommendation on where to start with hardcore history?Well you know the answer better than anyone here as to which you should choose. This is simply about priorities.

The hike doesn't replace the run in terms of fitness-building but this is less of a concern because you're not training for anything specifically.First of all I would suggest also posting this in the advanced running subreddit. It's more competition oriented and you might get more quality advice.

Secondly, you should provide some more details about your training and your previous performance at 3200m.  /u/kenvara's advice about the race effort calculator is good. I'll also reiterate the point that others have made; the first mile should be comfortable compared to what you're used to when racing the mile or 1500m.
Sorry dude, I wouldn't run it. I'm a runner and had jaw surgery and 7 days post-op I felt like I could do anything because my mind was back to being lucid. But then your body is super weak from the surgery alone and will continue to be weak from the liquid diet, there's not much you can do other than accept it. Realistically it's 10-12 weeks before your jaw will be able to sustain any type of heavy activity. Which is about the same timeframe after a broken bone, because after all, your jaw was broken (intentionally).

I had single upper jaw surgery and was on a liquid diet for a month, then soft diet for another month (soft diet meaning soup with noodles, I could barely open my jaw), and after those 2 months I tried to run and it was really uncomfortable and had to stop. Also I had a quick recovery and it was only one jaw, you've got two so I'd be extra careful. Ensure, Boost, Smoothies, Protein shakes. I did some exercise bands/body weight exercises to stay at least somewhat warm. About 3 months post-op is when I felt comfortable to run again.

Take your time recovering, you'll be back doing everything you used to do soon enough.Happy april fool's everyone! Reverted now.Sgrimley :)Yeah, it hurts like hell, but there's just something so satisfying about racing the 800.  I rather miss HS track.You're the bomb.com thanksThanks so much you guys are great, I'll be sure to do that. I definitely want to stay healthy for the upcoming marathon.A bit of a confession here. I used to get an upset stomach if I even ate a cracker an hour before a run. Most of this was a *mental* thing. I thought that my stomach would get upset and it would because I was too worried about it. While training for my first marathon and having depleted energy levels, I experimented with gels. They went down smoothly, didn't upset my stomach, and gave me the boost that I needed. My fatigue outweighed my worry and from then on I was able to build up a bigger tolerance for sustenance during runs.

Now I bring everything from nuts to cookies on my longer trail runs with no cramps or stomach issues.

My advice...start with easily digestible foods and slowly work then into your runs.

Oh and don't worry about it :)It's not the outside that takes a beating, it is the cushioning foam inside the shoe that compresses.A rule of thumb I use is if the shoe is over 6 months old or 350-400 miles, I take it out of my shoe rotation. Yes, everyday start doing shin splint exercises.  Can't speak for your shoes though.  Shin splints are one way to quickly destroy your last season as a high schooler so take them seriously and do what you need toas klethra said, it depends. Type of cushioning, your weight, miles you put on.
What is your weight?Get some xtenex elastic laces. They have these bumps so you set each eyelet to the exact pressure you want and you never tie your shoes again. I used to have this happen all the time.

The other thing it could be is compartment syndrome, but try changing your shoelaces first. If that doesn't help go see a doctor. That's 21:56 in more typical parlance.It sounds like your podiatrist knows his stuff (go figure). follow his advice over ours. It may be a little harder for you to get into it, but we'll be rooting for you.If you're not already, do toe raises to strengthen the muscle in front of your shins. Icing after a meet might also be helpful. There's a possibility that your shoes are wearing out, but I couldn't tell you without seeing them and seeing you run in them. Talk to your coach about this and see if he/she can help you out.Depends on several things: how many pairs of shoes do you cycle between/how often do you run? What surfaces do you run on? Are you generally prone to or resistant to injury?

It really depends on both the shoe and the athlete. I've had pairs last me for upwards of 800 miles, and I've had pairs blow out on under 300. If you start to feel pain after running that you know is from the shoes (easier to tell if you have multiple pairs), then that's a good indicator to retire them. If you can still run well, and the shoes are holding up, don't ditch them just because of an arbitrary number. Hope that helps.noIf you're not in a training cycle, just go for the hike. It's great to keep up your mileage and all, but skipping one long run isn't gonna dent your progress.The other day I listened to 80% of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes during a long run. Only way I can listen is at double speed, so it wasn't all that impressive, but I felt good almost making it through an entire book.It's not a replacement so much as an alternative. If you're not training for something specific, go enjoy the hike and run next weekend.Organize then by couples based on their fitness level. Do reps of 400 relays, meaning while one member do a lap the other recover. More reps for the more fit. Around 4 is fine.Dude! You should read this book called 'Born to Run.'  You'll never look at running the same again. Be social. You can pick up the miles later.I actually appreciate all the detail; they give anecdotes more validity. I think I'll try a structured approach by incorporating banana slices pre run and increase them by 1 per stitch free run.That's awesome that it turned around for you so well! Don't mind some of these crazy fools enjoying their day, but posts like this usually belong in the Sunday achievement threads. Congrats on the run! I do most of my runs immediately after waking up, but I started to eat before long runs when I was training for my first marathon. It takes some experimenting around, but I have found that a piece of wheat toast with honey and a banana sits well in my stomach. I also realized that food was causing less stitches/discomfort than fluids were, so if you stay well hydrated rather than drinking right before your runs, that may help too. Obviously, everyone will differ, but try experimenting around with some light foods that don't normally cause you any discomfort. Also, I have found that for me at least, I can handle runs up to 16 miles on an empty stomach. With increasing fitness, your body may be able to go awhile on a morning run without food. Now I have something to refer to when someone asks me why the 800 hurts so much. Thanks!When I started running I would do it in the morning before eating anything. If I tried to run any other time even remotely close to a meal, it was a miserable time.

Then I started running further and further and I had to learn to drink mid run. Then I had to learn to eat mid run. I started with gels and experimented with just about everything else (including those frozen pb&amp;j sandwiches from Smuckers).

Next thing I know, I'm able to run after a light meal. In fact that's what becomes most convenient for me. With the added benefit that I discover a meal consisting of veggies and fruits is a lot easier to run after than a meat based meal. So I ended up eating healthier too.

I'm back to mostly running on an empty stomach. I'm rebuilding my base after continuously suffering injuries by building up my distance too fast (for my body). But I do find that something like a banana shortly before a run does seem to positively affect my run.

The point of all my rambling about my own experiences is to tell you to maybe try fueling mid run. See if that helps you to get used to running with something in your gut. Then maybe work up to having a light meal with easily digestible foods before a run.  I didn't use to care for bananas too much but now they are my pre and often times, post run snack. It wasn't a replacement for me.  But then again I need the long runs all the way up until 7 days before The race.Get lost you botist!Ha, my first that was:  "Is...is he *grading* his workouts?"

But then I, you know, read the whole comment.Sure.  There a woman who runs a local marathon in jeans. Seen her do it more than one year.It's funny how the amount if material used in clothes doesn't change much, just the placement on the body over time. We have to cover the navel, better go as high up the thigh as possible. We have this low rise trend, but we can be longer on the inseam. Then again, maybe not. Who knows.You might want to start by finding an equivalent effort pace calculator. I use [this one](http://www.runbayou.com/jackd.htm), it's pretty good. I race for a divison 1 school, and this is the backbone of our training plan. This will tell you what you should get if you put the same effort in as you would for your pr mile or 5k. After that, just figure out your splits and train towards hitting them. A key here is to not put in what you think you can do, but to put it what you've already done. If you train at that pace and that effort, you'll get faster, and then can start moving your paces around in workouts. Any highschool coach worth their salt knows this.

As for the race itself, just go out on pace. Don't go crazy. Compared to a mile, it should feel slow and easy for the first mile. If you stay relaxed and focused, you should do ok. Always start with jogging. Take it out nice and slow. 2x10 minutes maybe. If some kids want to speed up that's fine but don't push the slower ones too much. Once you've done just jogging time for a couple weeks, then you could probably move into sprints or drills and stuff like thatAre you sure those are runners and not porn stars?Dude you're wasting that Gu if you're drinking it. It's way more bioavailable as a suppository. I ran this trail and it was really nice! Lots of ups and downs, great views of the lake.
The trail is easy to follow. I wouldn't recommend it after a rain storm as it's almost all the way a dirt path and the downhills look like they'd get slippery. It's a great workout.Whats wrong with the shoes?I  cross country and long distance track as well, don't take the first mile too fast and take a look at your cross country splits to see what you normally run for your first two miles and use that as a baseline.I lost a 20 when I pulled my iPod out of my pocket on a night time run. Did not realize it until my wife came home from a walk the next morning all excited because she found a twenty dollar bill.I used to get terrible side stitches (not necessarily just from eating and drinking before runs, but it sure didn't help). As my fitness improved they've gone away, and now I can eat right before runs without issues. There's hope! That's what I think. Of its indeed a orienteering race then that's a bit different but I can walk that fast.OK, it's April Fool's Day, haha, make fun of Vibrams, sure. But must shorts over tights also fall prey to your scathing mockery? Is nothing sacred?!Run the first mile as hard as you can, then hang on for the 2nd oneHa! That's me in the middle. Good times and GREAT memories! Thanks for posting!If your goal is to build endurance, focus on total time spent in aerobic activity (e.g. walking uphill and very slow jogging both count).  It's the duration that matters, not the intensity.  Taking a walking break might not count towards your total, but it will allow you to continue running, increasing the total aerobic time.

These are the kinds of things you want to see a physiotherapist about in an effort to strengthen the relevant muscles and gristle. Fact is you likely won't be breaking any records, but if you stay smart on how you build up mileage and take care of the little things to keep yourself healthy, there's no reason you can't fashion yourself into a runner if that's something you want to do.No idea, but holy shit dat bulge!

I tried monitoring my stride on the foot in question. The more I tried correcting the more it snowballed and eventually just fell asleep and my foot would have that sandy sensation.
I'm one of those few that actually use compression during long runs because it helps with it tremendously. You can say what you'd like about the science and placebo this and that. All I know is that since I started using compression, my foot hasn't fallen asleep even once. I used them on my last half and I ran a new PB. Only a matter of time before a WRThis appeals to me because I'd also like to start weightlifting after this half marathon and run just three days a week.

I'll look into the book, thanks! Actually haven't worn them with compression socks- just bare feet, tights, and a pair of basketball shorts over them. How do they feel with compression socks?carboload.Yup!Can confirmThe URL of the /r/science link is pretty great.

"Fast Food Is Just As Effective As Exercise"If you do end up following the plan I suggested then I would focus on getting upto and a little above the necessary week one mileage, no speed or quality workouts necessary until you start the planI was told to rest it until there was no pain, period. Soreness is something I usually associate with muscles, though, not bones...so it depends what you mean by soreness. If you mean faint, residual pain, I'd be very careful, and definitely stop running if it gets any worse. Stress fractures are a frustrating injury that you have to be patient with.I ran DCM 2010 as well and Barcelona 2011. I then had an injury-illness-injury streak that lasted about 3 years in total, so haven't done anything longer than a half marathon or Olympic-distance triathlon since then. Maybe this year, but I'll see how things go.

I highly recommend DCM as a first one by the way - the support is fantastic, there will be a lot of people around you pretty much now matter how fast/slow/indifferent you are and you're training through the summer for it which is easier than training for a spring marathon (imho). Thanks, just what I need :)On tip that i haven't seen here, befriend the Blerch First; read the FAQ (link in the sidebar), there's a ton of useful information there.

Then:

&gt; how often should I run each week? and for how long?

As often and as long as you can stomach without wearing yourself out. How much that is is highly personal, but for an absolute beginner, 3-4 runs per week are probably best. Duration should be where you are now, but build up gently in order to get to 15k.

&gt; what can my diet consist of to provide energy to run but stimulate fat burn?

No diet will stimulate fat burn. If you eat at a calorie deficit (i.e., eat less than your body needs), you will lose weight, and under normal circumstances, this will translate to fat loss. A very harsh calorie deficit causes the body to dig into glycogen stores and muscle tissue, and slow down healing and recovery, so you don't want that; large quantities of fat are unhealthy for more reasons than calories alone; refined sugars and other "fast" carbs are problematic because they make you hungrier; but other than that, it basically boils down to "eat fewer calories".

&gt; is it really possible to get skinny again just through running?

Yes and no - yes, running burns plenty of calories, and some fat will be converted into muscle; but no, running alone combined with unrestricted food intake will probably make you fatter, not skinnier. Most of the skinny runners you see spend quite a lot of thought on their diet; running doesn't magically make them skinny, and it's not just the calorie burn. It's a result of a few lifestyle adjustments for the purpose of running - if you eat healthier, you'll perform better; if you lose fat, you can run faster more easily. Also, running is a great substitute for binge eating.

&gt; I live in a cold state, so I've been training on treadmills over winter - will it be easier or harder when I move outside?

Treadmill and real running are different beasts, and whichever you've been doing a lot tends to be easier. So most likely, running outside is going to feel harder than the treadmill until you get used to it again.&gt; "Maintaining a heel-toe pattern while running barefoot or in a minimalist shoe may lead to more frequent injuries."

&gt;Duh.

Good for you! I just started running in the Bikila EVOs and I love them.Have you found SL to be too much legs or did you get used to it after awhile?  I started recently and find my legs are completely blown up the day after Squat/DL day.  Might just be a noob problem though.did you find eating carbs at certain times of day or before or after running helped with the weight loss? if so what would you recommend?
being 150 lb again sounds like exactly what I want. I've never wanted to be big and muscly. small and lean is what I'm shooting for.
thanks for your input!I'm pretty sure I have this condition, every time I go out drinking this happens.&gt; the idea that you should only run at tempo pace is utterly ridiculous.

And it is a straw man argument, because I agree, which is why I said, "if you are not doing sufficient milage, or not working at tempo, you wont find many gains in your cardio." You quoted this yourself, above.

&gt; Running lots of mileage in the aerobic zone (sub-tempo) doesn't cause overtraining &gt; injuries once the runner has adapted to the volume, because a runner can
&gt; recovery from an easy effort quite quickly.

Also agree. My point is that I doubt he has adapted to a 7 mile distance. Many people cannot run 7 miles in a single outing but can comfortable run 2x3.5 mile runs a few days apart. Do you disagree? I know plenty of fellow runners who clock in 10-20 miles a week but would be uncomfortable running that all at one time. I run ~40 miles a week but have certainly never even remotely attempted such a distance in a single push. This past weekend I went running with a friend, he found a energy bar that appeared sealed so he ate it. Does that count? Same study has been quoted elsewhere, with an equally "duh" conclusion.

Basically, all this study really says is that if you've been doing something in a certain way for decades, doing it differently is going to be hard.I transitioned (to vffs) when 31.

Edit: Also, why are all these tests on treadmills? Hell, if there is one, is filled with treadmills.So I'm new to running and pretty much exercise in general (22/M btw).  I started running and can pretty much only do a mile max without stopping.  I feel like I get winded kind of fast.  Quick question, how much would a 25 mile bike ride help me improve running exactly?  Are a lot of the same muscles used?  Just my 2 cents, treating every day as a race is a quick way to burn out or get injured. I'd recommend 1-2 hard days each week, and the rest easy, maybe medium. You'll find it easier to push yourself on the hard days, and you'll enjoy the easy days a lot. Reddit or Facebook are great ways to turn a hard day into an easy day, though YMMV. Just make sure to go easy on the queries, save those for workout days.Hello :)

I'm a current collegiate athlete who runs for a D3 program and who someday wants to coach a high school team when I'm retired. In my spare time I like to devise training programs (I am for the most part self-coached).

As a new runner I would highly suggest you start a basic core strengthening program. Nothing major. Just like 10-20 minute routine a day. It will go a long way towards preventing injury.

Here is a routine you can follow. You should be able to handle it!
https://www.digitalrunning.com/1035/myrtl-routine/  (try and throw in some of your own core exercises as well)

I would suggest trying to make it as long as possible without walking. This may mean slowing down. I would try to work your way up to 3 miles without stopping on a consistent basis. If you can do that you should be able to complete your 10k.

I don't know If I'm leaving anything out....

Reply if you want anymore advice :)Just run. When you want to stop, if it's not because of injury slow down a bit and push through. Most of it is mental.

Freshman year of high school I couldn't run a mile for soccer tryouts. 4 years later, lots of running slowly, over and over and over, I was finally doing miles.

Just run and your body will adept. You can do it. Nope!

If he tells you to rest, then ask again here because redditors on /r/running can give you better advice anyways. And that advice is that it's normal, so just run through the pain.Now I know how fast and how far I should be able to run to save myself from robots.Hmm being a runner sets you up for a lot of muscle tightness if your not doing the right stretches. Ricebasket has some good tips there but you also want to look at your core ENDURANCE. Its not just about going to the gym and doing more sit-ups. If you want to run pain free you need to train your core to be able to stabilize the spine the way it should. As you continue to run your core naturally becomes more and more relaxed which usually causes runners to get into this over extended position which pinches down on the discs in the lower back...this article will help a lot with the endurance training aspect of your core. http://fitness4backpain.com/how-to-build-core-endurance-to-relieve-back-pain/

hope it helps!It's simple - if you can't run the distance you want, you're running too fast.

I think most of us hit this dilemma at one point or another - we want to run longer but we don't want to sacrifice our pace because we feel slow, or that, if we slow down to a 10:30 pace for longer distances (e.g., 5+ miles), we'll end up running 5k's at 10:30 too, which would be, as you put it, getting worse.

My strategy for dealing with this is to just alternate between shorter faster runs and longer, slower runs.  It keeps things fresh and helps eliminate this paranoia that if I train for the Army 10 miler I won't screw my 5k times by running at 2.5 minutes slower.
I just started running again in March after a stress fracture. Based on where I'm at now, I'm hoping to run about 90 miles in April, using the 10% rule to build myself up, and leave myself in a decent position to run Ragnar Cape Cod in early May.

To keep myself healthy, I plan on continuing my currently ambitious cross training program. I'm running four days a week, taking two spin classes a week, one barre class and one pilates class. The pilates builds up my core, barre targets the smaller muscles around the hips and thighs that keep my IT band happy. Spin classes are just great cardio/cross training for non-running days. No problem :) I'm sure that at your current level, if you stick to adequate training and avoid injuries, this is a completely achievable goal. Good luck! Taking that much time off won't kill your real fitness, but it will kill any sharpness you've gained from consistent training. Takes time for muscles to get used to running and the first couple days can be rough. Keep your runs easy for the next few days and do some strides to wake your muscles up. Hide them either on top of my door frame at my house or on one of the tires on my car22 minutes? Automod's got me beat.

I'm not going to survive the robot revolution, am I. Really? Because that's Kent Brockman's traitorous glee. So you'll be super visible and never have to worry about rusting?I track it on my phone and the idea of stopping before I'm done is not an option. If I need to slow down I'll slow down but I can't stop until I'm back at my vehicle or on my front deck.I tried different levels of tightness and they all seem to be unrelated to me feet going numb, it's almost inevitablethanks, I'll definitely check them out!This happends to me all the time, and it's because i'm too lazy to tie my shoes like i'm supposed to. This results in my laces stopping the bloodflow, and therefor the 'numbness'. I bought this thing called 'locklaces', and they helped immensely. They're pretty cheap, go and look 'em up.

Best of luck! :)That's impressive! Do you still run it? I'm running the DCM this October, my first!That's brilliant though! Great time for a first marathon! Mine is this October and I'm not expecting to be able to walk afterwards either :)That's awesome! :D You'll smash it! My first is this October too :DDefinitely easier to breathe in cooler weather. Not sure why though! I'm no scientist :DNope. But my first half will be this August and my first marathon this October :DBig misconception!The biggest take away when it comes to training the core, is you always want to have an endurance over strength focus. As a runner your pushing your body to great lengths to continue the mileage you have set out. Simply running more will help but you can speed it up by training the core for endurance. It's not simply doing more core exercises for longer periods of time. It's doing specific exercises for a more controlled fatigue-less period of time...if that make sense....This article explains the endurance training aspect a little better http://fitness4backpain.com/how-to-build-core-endurance-to-relieve-back-pain/

Your ultimate goal isn't really to relieve back pain but it is to train your core effectively. If you follow the status quo of core training it will let you down I promise.

Hope this helps? If you are hitting a wall while trying to add distance while running, I suggest running with a partner or a club. There are these notches where it's quite easy to get hung up and stop. For me it was 6 miles and 10 miles.

Yea stronglifts, starting strength, etc etc.  Any of those basic programs are a good start. I've been to Frozen Head State Park. The terrain there is no joke, I could easily see designing a killer ultra there.I'm glad you didn't get frazzled in your pre-race routine. Otherwise all of your training could have been for nothing. I'll have to keep that in mind for my next work race. Currently scoping out the race schedule (aka - unemployed).Autobot why do you run? amazing news! good luck and keep us posted!!"uhh yeah, boss? I'm going to be sick in October....*cough cough*" lolThanks! It was such a different experience in comparison to my regular runs - so it was exhilarating. I'm sure if I was hitting those winds every time I ran, I would be a lot less enthused. Either way, I'm not going to let high winds and hills stop me - even if that means running in place.this.

also, this is slightly more controversial, but i keep my easy days easy and hard days hard, so lift on your non-days offHi Mr Automoderator sir,
 Mr Grylls shows the best way to rehydrate in this video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtIG4TuVnvgI ran outside in the nasty weather all winter and my PB 5 mile at the end of January was 42:22. When I went for a new PB at the beginning of March was 36:29. If you want to get faster there's no substitute for running more. Glad to be of service :)This made me laugh, thank you for that. A very straight-to-the-point mindset. slooowwwwww dooowwnnnnnn.

a 5k in 27:01 is excellent for a relatively new runner. but you probably need to take a breather because you're pushing yourself too hard. running is more enjoyable when you aren't out of breath and desperately needing to stop to catch your lungs up with your body.

I was convinced I needed to run &lt;9 min/mile when I got back into running last summer. I wore myself out way too quickly and would end up needing to stop much sooner than I intended. now I run VERY comfortably at about 10:30/mi including up very steep hills at which I once scoffed.

just take it easy. eventually your body will want to speed up and you'll be comfortable at 9 min miles again. only then, you won't need a break. &gt; Will this effect last forever or will it stagnate?

It will definitely last forever. I guess only time will tell what mistakes we've made. As soon as I did it I regretted pushing it.I ran a bunch of 5ks this year and friends would ask me how the marathons were going.  I always sighed and tried to explain, usually fruitlessly.  Yeah, sorry, /u/spectralblr is correct.  Overtraining and related injuries come from doing too much too fast.  While you are correct that lowing quantity can help, that would be completely negated by increasing the quality.

It is not simple physics of the number of steps taken.  If a runner is suffering from stress fractures and related things, increasing the effort of their runs is going to make things worse.  That is when form goes to shit and those things come into play more.  Also, if those are the issues, you need to strengthen those bones which is done by lower effort running.

If over-training becomes an issue (unlikely in someone running 7 miles a week), the first step is to reduce effort but maintain volume.This is pretty much what it's like everyday except actual users are submitting these topics. Not even close! My friend runs about a 13 min mile and she's never been last. My thing is I can slow down I just can't stop. So sometimes I'm down to over 12. I've only been running since August so I know I still have a long ways to go to get faster. But it'll happen. Terra ahumada?I run 5 days and lift three a week.

First, I can't decide if having the same weather in the end of March as you had at the end of January is a good thing or a bad thing... I know it would be horrible for me - January sucks.

From your other posts, it sounds like this five mile running is taking ~1 hour.  So you have improved something like from just over 12 minutes/mile to just under?  This is important because not all improvement is equal.  A beginner going fairly slow should be able to take off bigger chunks than someone going faster.  12 minute miles are on the back end of the bell curve.

At this pace, 6% is pretty small improvement.  I would expect more improvement over 2 months if the runner was making improvement a goal.

The cross training is a great supplement, but it is not a replacement.  If you want to improve as a runner, you have to run.

But I guess to answer your direct question - the effect will not last forever, nothing does; but at this level, it will likely continue for a significant period of time before you stagnate.Ohh, it is healthy-runner.comHi! Welcome to runnit! You're going to love it here.

We saw you coming and have collected answers to your question **[right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/)**.

Welcome!Spectralblr is 100% correct.  You made a couple of flatly incorrect statements in your advice:

&gt;  because it is ultimately more a function of number of steps that causes those sorts of injuries

Overtraining isn't a matter of a runner taking too many steps per week.  Overtraining injuries are generally caused by one of two things: runners increasing their volume of work faster than their body can adapt to the increased stress (i.e. the 10% rule, which is the smart part of the advice you gave) and runners doing high intensity work too frequently, so that their body is not able to recover between high intensity sessions.

Running lots of mileage in the aerobic zone (sub-tempo) doesn't cause overtraining injuries once the runner has adapted to the volume, because a runner can recovery from an easy effort quite quickly.

&gt; In general if you are not doing sufficient milage, or not working at tempo, you wont find many gains in your cardio. You burn calories, but it is not working on cardiovascular fitness.

Again, this is just wrong.  Crack open a copy of *Daniels Running Formula* or *Advanced Marathoning* or any other conventional running book and you will find an easy to follow explanation of all the adaptations triggered by low intensity cardiovascular work.  These adaptations account for the majority of what makes someone a fast distance runner, and therefore a high volume of easy running is the backbone of almost all orthodox training programs.  Of course, what is easy for one runner isn't easy for another, but the idea that you should only run at tempo pace is utterly ridiculous.Wait a second... did you run the An Ras Mor 5k, wearing that same suit?  I think I was standing right next to you, and then talked to you afterwards, too!  (I can tell you're standing right near the intersection of Windsor and Main here)

PS - I'll take that banana.[Run on your hands](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/310k9a/any_hand_runners_here/)Exactly this. Learning to control your breathing is so helpful. It will help you to carry on further without feeling like you need to stop.I pushed #thebutton an now I'm having doubts about my existence.[Help] /u/AutoModerator Oh boy this subreddit today. But but but I really actually 100 percent [SERIOUS!] want to know about lifting plans that people follow while keeping running their priority..... *slumps off to wait until tomorrow*the thought did cross my mind...Color me impressed. Seriously.

I live above 8,500 ft, and that's about our regular sustained wind. When I started running regularly last August, I had a helluva time trudging through that - but to be fair, I'm asthmatic and winds like that can kind of feel like they're "stealing" the air from your lungs. Then through the winter those sort of winds bring ice crystals with 'em - it feels like bee stings on my delicate (read: whiny) girl-cheeks.

Nice work!Weight loss is something like 80% caloric intake, 20% exercise.

Make fruit and veggies a focus in your meals, with grains and meat being sides (instead of the other way around, as is per usual).  Watch dips and salad dressings, they add a lot of calories and fat quickly.  Choose less processed options, and always choose items like brown rice over white, whole wheat over white, etc.  Choose oatmeal over breakfast cereal, for example, or steel cut oats over rolled oats.  You don't need to make drastic changes, gradual ones are great, too.

Run 3-4 days a week, and do something else 2 days a week.  Strength training, yoga, biking, swimming:  something different than running, to improve your health and prevent running injuries.  Signing up for some class that meets 2x a week would be great.  I'm not one for classes, so I do workouts at home.  I personally like to do some yoga/stretching, and then I have about 30 cards with a different exercise written on each one:  squats, lunges, bicep curls, burpees, plank, donkey kicks, you get the idea.  I shuffle them and pick 3-8 (depending upon my time available) and do those chosen exercises 3-5 times.

Moving outside will just be...different.  I find that being outside is easier for me.  I can't run more than 2-3 miles continuously on the treadmill before I want to jump off a bridge.  I love running outside, even in really crappy weather.

Good luck!  I've been running for about a 8 months or more now, and I've lost around 25# and am now running 20+ miles a week.  The weight didn't melt off like I expected it to, but once I started being mindful of my diet, I found that a slow steady weightless is occurring.The same way I run from my emotions.SPIbelt
This video is really helpful:  [Principles of Natural Running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo)

Also, strengthening your hips and core can help correct imbalances that affect your form.  These workouts have helped my running a lot:

- http://strengthrunning.com/2012/01/the-standard-core-routine-video-demonstration/

I set aside two weeks a month for a bit of a mix up.  I do two longish runs (one sixteen, one half), and two other days are intervals + crosstraining.  As I said in another thread, this helps with my ankles and knees, and keeps me from getting bored.

The other two weeks I keep those two long runs, add two six-milers, and ideally another three-miler if I have the time.  I originally got into fitness via lifting so I definitely plan for rest days.  My next week is a 3.89 mile increase to finally getting over the forty-mile hump, so it's doable.

The general wisdom here to accomplish low intensity/high volume is to have shorter distances over more days, but I just have a lot of trouble fitting that into my schedule while balancing work/relationship stuff, so I stack my runs and try to provide some space between a longer run and the next workout.  Edit - I also lift so obviously that informs my schedule.

If I could shorten them and spread them out, I definitely think no/few rest days is doable, though, and you might just (a) be getting used to running so much, or; (b) need to scale back your mileage and then work up by 10% each week while ensuring each increase is still comfortable (barring the "good" kind of soreness, etc. that inevitably occurs when you're that active.)Good advice.  Stretch an 18 week plan to about 24 weeks.  Specificity of training is important, so if it's a hilly 50K, run as many hills as you can in training.  Get your on-the-run nutrition dialed in.

Back to back long runs on the weekend are helpful.  Check out Byron Powell's book or Hal Koerner's book for training plans and loads of general advice.
I believe you are missing my point.

Over-training causes a large portion of running injuries. My first piece of advice for anyone who complaining of injury is to reduce mileage. The simple reason is physics: by reducing the number of steps you take, you are significantly reducing the impact on your body. The force for each step does not vary greatly based on speed, but obviously varies linearly with each step.

As you imply, diagnosing the cause of injuries are important as well, which is precisely why I asked what was hurting.

Regardless, I stand by my original statement, which is, given that d0dgerrabbit is running only 7 miles a week in a single long run, that the distance he is running is too long/far. I would not recommend running 7 miles and then nothing all week. I would break that into shorter runs, and then gradually add mileage to those runs over time if no injuries develop.I'm fairly sure OP is trolling anyway.For now, slow down and keep going. Don't worry about time.GIVE IT TO THE SCALE!!!Good luck. It's just a button, it shouldn't be that hard to ignore. I mean, I for one, haven't stared, transfixed, at a button and a timer, just watching it go from 59 to 60 over and over again...brb, gotta check the buttonYeah, I came from Michigan to run it last year I would absolutely recommend that race. The temperature change from here to there killed me. I was pacing to run it in about 3:40 but ended up over 4 because i was dying the last 10k.I actually just went to /r/thebutton a couple minutes ago for the first time, and I'm browsing through. Waste of time or no? Real talk: can I get through today's race without obsessing with this button?Literally EVERY alternative is better than telling someone who says they get hurt a lot than telling them to run less and run harder. Focusing on strengthening weak spots, slowing down, and improving form and efficiency are all viable options. It's not trolling to notice that your advice is terrible.  Oh man, I can't believe I forgot to talk about shoes! I picked up a pair of Sandro Moscolonis from my local Men's Wearhouse about 10 years ago, and I haven't looked back. I don't wear them for every race, but I do when the VP is in town!

The guys at Men's Wearhouse put me in an office chair and had me sit there while they video taped my feet. Then they played it back in slow motion and sold me these shoes, along with a suit. This was when I was getting ready to run a Wedding race that one of my college friends was organizing. I kicked ass in that race, but didn't do a report.Hi Spectralblr -- I'm not going to give this a serious reply unless you suggest a better alternative. Otherwise your post comes off as troll'ing.I don't see anything about being obsessed with pushing a button, which makes me think this work race report is inaccurate.It's a bucket list for a reason, why live if you can't aim for lofty goals? Force yourself to keep going! Quitting (or stopping) is contagious and it is easy to give into it if whenever you feel tired you stop. If you can do over 3 miles without stopping, I would keep pushing it each week to run an extra quarter mile (2-3 minutes) longer than your previous run. Best thing you can do is keep it!That injury avoidance advice is just about the worst I've ever heard. Sounds like a recipe for an endless spiral into low mileage, high effort runs that gain little or nothing. Which, ironically, is exactly what the OP's response to injury was. Start with Ice Cream.The HS team I coach is on a Jack Daniels hybrid but in all honesty you have to push yourself to that zone where your body says stop and then push yourself a little harder. My advice is to keep running mile races. You body needs to get use to the pain.
I've been participating on the Rat Race for few years now. But there are this couple Joneses in my club who take it really seriously and I just can't keep up with them :/I will take a rest day once a week and swap out a run for a bike or swim or even pick-up basketball. Its nice on the mind and- besides the basketball- nice on the legs.
That was my first thought. The average human WALKS at a pace of 20 min/mi. I know the elevation changes are huge, it's difficult to navigate, and sleep deprivation will get to you, but just walking at an "average pace" and sleeping for 8 hours each night yields 50 hours. we need to destroy this thingNice! Can't wait to hear more. What kind of shoes are best for this type of race? I will. Now that the first week is over, it's a pretty gradual increase until week 12 when it moves to full on marathon training.Truthfully this doesn't say anything of value or that we didn't really already know. First of all, "recovey" is a hard to define blanket term. In this sense, they are using it to to mean "an ability to bounce back and perform two workouts in somewhat rapid succession". Basically, these athletes eat, have enough time to digest, and then work out again. In this case, glucose (sugar) is going to be the main thing you want if the only variable you care about is performance during the second workout.

However, in a more long term sense of training and recovery, you are not going to want these sugar and carb bombs but a more balanced approach to you macronutrients. Things like Gatorade and Cliff Bars are already known for being basically calorie dumps and full of sugars. A Gatorade is not much healthier than a soda. So, they're replacing unhealthy foods with unhealthy foods and pretending that their "supplements" listed are staples of athlete's diets, when they are actually more so emergency additives for special circumstances.

Athletes eat Cliff Bars and drink Gatorade because they can give you a blast of sugar to refuel you and are easy to digest, so they are great for refueling during a competition or a game, but are not as great during typical training because of their high calorie and sugar levels. Giving the athletes two hours to digest the fast foods negates the only advantage over the fast foods that the supplements actually have, digestibility.

In short, none of those "supplements" are viewed as healthy and part of an athlete's regular diet. They're just comparing two different types of unhealthy foods in a study that's designed to get the result that they want and then using general terms to describe something that is more specific and something we basically already knew.There are lots of Marathons with a net elevation loss that people flock to for a PR. So yes, they're *easier* but not *easy*.So 22 min? Not too bad! I have the same sentiments about trail running. The race I did was called the Twisted Ankle Trail Run, and if you're not paying attention to every step you could be in trouble.  The post above mentioned not focusing on speed or time, which I do to a fault sometimes.  I didn't think this is really an ultra seeing as it's only a few more miles than a full marathon.  The mental aspect of it is going to be the hardest part I think.  this is desecrating the sanctity of races&gt; Locked down this subreddit

[Yay!](https://bunkstrutts.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/robot-dance_gif-anime-090820.gif)I really like Japanese food, but Thai is tasty as well.

What does this have to do with running?Even at the marathon I ran in Mexico, they didn't serve Mexican food for the pre-race dinner. Definitely, we all had to start somewhere!

Some days, I have to DNS Sitting at the Office, and I do exactly what you're doing, except sometimes instead of pizza, I work in some ramen. In fact, two days a week, that's exactly what I do (usually Saturday and Sunday). Rest days are important!

As for training, a degree in Early Childhood Education is excellent preparation for working with adults in an office environment. The spreadsheet thing is something I picked up a little later. I started with just basic formulas (IF, SUM, AVERAGE, DATE), worked up to VLOOKUP, and now I'm throwing down INDEX and MATCH like a pro. If you can master some of the text parsing formulas, like LEFT, RIGHT, MID, and work them into your INDIRECTS, with plenty of nesting, that's just gravy. If that routine gets a bit boring, throw in some conditional formatting and pivot tables.

Take it slow of course. These worksheets can get pretty big, and if you find anything too repetitive, don't be afraid to learn how to create some macros. Good luck!Are your shoes tied to tight?Can you tell us more about your training background? I'm trying to get to where you are on Sitting at the Office distance, though I might be a little better on Sitting on the Couch After Work Eating Pizza and Watch Netflix distance so I want to hear how you got to where you are.What about banana flavored Gu? Will the AutoModerator know the difference?It sounds like you're already at least somewhat familiar with running trails, but this is something that I have in the past and sometimes continue to struggle with: I've run roads for years and thousands of miles. I've trained myself for so long to lock into autopilot mode on roads and knock out consistent splits for mile after mile. When switching over to trails, the terrain demands that you sometimes fly downhill, walk uphill, jog some flat parts, jump over some trees, wade through a river, etc. Having a brain that's trained to always maintain the same pace makes it almost feel wrong to constantly be jumping all over the place, often leading me to burn out early on longer trail runs while foolishly running uphill early on. I'd get in as much training as feasibly possible on trails and variable terrain.

And, since this is your first one, I'd just focus on finishing. Throw the time goals out the window and just focus on having a positive experience.Philthy casuals!I have a 10 mile race coming up on 4/11. I am hoping to get it done in 1:25 (8:30/mile pace). I ran 6.7 miles at a 8:20/mile pace on friday. I'm gonna try 10 miles today. I am hoping to keep up with the 8:30 pace during the race. If so, maybe I can do a half marathon at this pace and get a PR later this month on 4/25. My current half marathon PR is 1:52:08.What do you mean by 'very-high speed', though?

My low speed runs are 8 min/mile, but that is because I'm in decent shape and that is below my lactate threshold. For some that might be 'high speed'. Personally, I've found that the key is checking your peak heart rate. If you can talk during the run, you are certainly not running sufficiently at tempo-- up the pace.

I'm curious though: you said you are injury prone: what are the injuries typically like? A classic issue with runners at the start is over-training, which leads to stress fractures, shin splints, etc.

I've found the best way to reduce over-training related injuries is to drop the milage and increase the tempo, because it is ultimately more a function of number of steps that causes those sorts of injuries (e.g. the force of impact might vary by 30%, but that wont make up for 200% the number of steps).

As a rule of thumb, one should not increase milage week-to-week by more than 10%. The fact that you have a single hour run each week sounds *very* long to me, if you are only running 7 miles in a week. The reason is most likely because your body is more rested from running less, you've basically done a tapper on accident. This will not only not last forever but your "performance" will begin to decline and go lower than where you started most likely.There's something about your username that just unnerves me a little. I keep on thinking [canned chicken](http://blogs.houstonpress.com/eating/chicken.jpg) every time I read your username.Wow, thanks for all the tips!  Some needs rest days. Others do not. If you are tired do not hesitate to take a rest day.

Running every day it is something you need to train for. You cannot just go from running 3 times a week to running every day. Start by adding a day and get used to it. Add another in a month time or so.

I for one needs a rest day every week to keep me from burning out.Yes. The level of running fitness that can be gained via 2.5 hours/week of biking, swimming, and rowing is low.

Welcome!
10/10

11/10 with rice. A better question is: what are you doing incorrectly with the running that you are doing in the gym?

I'm guessing it is HIT in the gym, and too leisurely runs. Are you tracking your heart rate during the run versus the gym? What is your pace for the runs?

In general if you are not doing sufficient milage, or not working at tempo, you wont find many gains in your cardio. You burn calories, but it is not working on cardiovascular fitness.Hi automoderator, welcome in the community! Congratulations on your accomplishment, but we have a weekly accomplishment for stuff like this.Do you guys take any rest days? For instance I have been running every day for the past 3 weeks and I feel like I am getting tired a lot more easily the past few runs so I don't know if it's because I haven't taken a day off or if it's something else.

Also if you do take days off do you do a different style of cardio?run more milesWalkman sport MP3 is what you're looking for. If you're trying to run a 10k, there are a lot training programs that will tell you what to do each day. I found this very helpful when training for my half marathon; it was much easier to stick to a structured plan, rather than saying "oh, I'm just run everyday until I can do it." There are also training plans for 5k.  You don't have to stick to these plans to the letter, adjust them based on how your feeling, but try your best to stay on course.Why keep the banana and the car separate when you can [have them in the same package](http://imgur.com/gallery/bDgYzwx)?Silly AutoMod, that's no banana.

You happen to be holding in your hand the newest development in the world of foam rolling. Specially sized to fit in your pocket, so you can stop in the middle of your Gallowalked 5k to make sure you roll out your calves to avoid tightness.

Another use include being used as a passable baton, so you can run your 5k as a relay.

And if it's cold, you can stuff the banana down your tights to impress all the people on the couch that you are currently lapping.

Also, it actually is a banana, so you can eat it after doing the aforementioned things.I had a 4th met fracture near my cuboid. I wore a boot for 5 weeks and then just walked around for another 3 before starting to run. As i'm transitioning from NB1400s to Vibram fivefingers, my runs are pretty short and very easy as I am also going by my HR in low zone 2 to ensure easy pace. This is my 4th week only at 1.5 miles (3 x this week). I've felt no pain in my foot at all. The podiatrist said, I may feel pain /sensitivity on top of the foot near fracture for up to 9 months as each person is different.

To reach these goals:  run more, make sure I get a long run *and* and moderately lengthen run in, and actually just do two days a week of yoga and strength training.

If I reach those goals, I'll probably be happy with that for a month or two, then ramp up the mileage again.If you hurry you can finish the b210k today.

For example, try having some M&amp;Ms at the 2pm mark.  It's probably too late for today but it's something you might want to think about if you do this race again.Oh, I forgot about your other questions!

I've been running this race every weekday for the last few months, and I treat every day as a race. I really think that's the best way to train, unless someone has some other recommendation for me. I'm all ears!

I think you're totally ready for Monday! Here's the thing about Sitting at the Office. The hardest part really is finding an Office that wants you to Sit in it. And you know how people say, "It doesn't get easier, you just get tougher"? Well I think it's more like, "It gets easier, and you get older. But sometimes it gets a lot harder. But either way, you get older."I have been very fortunate in that I haven't lost anyone since I started running, but I have run through some depression.

The beginning went pretty smoothly - no leg pain, felt like I was on wheels - until about two hours in.  That's when the familiar rumblings started, a movement of the second kind.  (The FiberOne bar at the start was a risky choice, I know.)  I panicked and considered going behind the nearest plant but relied on my course knowledge to find an actual toilet just 30 feet away.  It felt like an eternity but crisis was averted... for now.

Anyway, keep us updated.  The Rat Race is one of my favorites (though I feel they need to up the prize money).This is brilliant!

She's great, but meetings always slow me down. It's something I have to work on. Donuts seem to make them go faster.

I'm hoping to keep the same pace until about 2, which I think is a natural low point for me every day. But that will allow me to reserve energy for the 3:30 meeting, when I really have to be on point. Other than that, really just improvising, for the most part.I always send a "Meeting Time Verification" email within a few hours of start time just to seal the deal. It's been useful.

Honestly, just getting through the day and finishing would be an accomplishment.

However, I have set an "A" goal for this afternoon's meeting. I need to describe what it is our team does to the VP, and I'd like to hit a time goal of 30 minutes on that. What might throw a wrench in the works is whether he shows up on time to the meeting. Since it's his last one of the day, that's really up in the air at this point.

As an aside, I also have a few queries to run, and some new queries I want to build. This is a "B" goal. Just getting through the day is the "C" goal.I can't wait to try this!What are your splits?

Can you talk a little about your goals for this event? What would you like to accomplish?The longer runs hit you a different way. You're going to have mental/emotional ups and downs and your legs are going to get tired. My advice is to center your training on long runs. Even if you don't go fast or as far as you want, ramp up to practice running for 5 hours. It's expected in ultras that most people use a run/walk strategy, so try to find a good system that works for you. Practice running on tired legs - do an 8 mile pace run on a Friday night, then get up and do a 15 mile slow run first thing Saturday morning.

Depending on your pace, you may not have needed any food during your runs, but if you get into ultras, that will change. Practice eating and drinking now to know what works for your body so that, with luck, you won't feel sick on race day.

If you can, try to volunteer at an aid station for an ultra and see what the runners are doing there. It's way different than shorter distances and even marathons.

Practice on the course at least a couple times, if possible, so you know exactly what to expect. Also you can use these to plan out walking strategies.

Stair and hill workouts will help a great deal with strength training. If the course has hills, then hill and stair train like crazy. It makes a huge difference.

The longer runs aren't just physical. You need to train and be prepared to use your legs, heart, and lungs that much. But you also need to *train* your mind to deal with the endurance, the doubt, and the mood swings, and train your digestive system to work with you. To one degree or another, they go hand-in-hand, but it's totally understandable to want to get faster before making the jump to a marathon. The distance is no joke.I've ran into the same experience. My girlfriend's mom wanted to make us a big dinner the night before an important race so once she found out I was running 12 hours later, the menu changed from Chinese to Pizza (because *carbs*?) Didn't matter, PR'd anyways. I'm not really following a plan right now, but I've borrowed some ideas from Bill Pierce, et al., *Run Less, Run Faster*, which recommends three weekly runs (intervals, tempo, and long) combined with cross-training to improve speed and endurance while minimizing the risk of injury.

I cycle, and got back into running for cross-training, so I'm not interested in plans that have more than three runs a week, given that I also ride 3-4 days a week and do the occasional hike.For dinner before RR100, I suggested that we (my girlfriend, her sister, her sister's husband and me, the only one racing) go out for texas BBQ.

My girlfriend proceeded to ask if that was a good idea for a pre-race dinner and then in the immediate next sentence suggested Mexican food. I have no idea how that thought process worked.

Went with BBQ, it was good, and I had a good race.Step 1: Peel banana.

So to answer your question, NO, my training does not take a hit when our child is sick because it's important for me to stay sane in order to take care of my family and that means I need to run.

It's like having one of those gel inserts, but even better, because you can absorb energy through your feet.Find a regular marathon training plan and adjust it accordingly. Allow extra weeks to repeat some workouts and allow extra weeks for recovery should you get hurt before the race. The sooner you start training the better. When adjusting the planned mileage, make sure that your long runs typically increase by a few miles. Take it slow and easy. It's your first ultra, you are suppose to have fun.

Welcome!Will do!I have a 15k on Saturday and a half marathon on the 26th. I've been following a training program to increase my weekly mileage. My times have dropped since a hip injury and bronchitis in January, which was followed immediately by a 10 day vacation where I barely ran. Since then, I've been battling with overtime at work and lazy eating -- still running, just slower. Starting on Monday morning, I've been eating cleaner, less snacking at night, way more water and less diet soda, less salt on my food. My longest training run was 10 miles on January 1st at 9:20/mi., my longest run since was 9 miles on Saturday at 9:45/mi. and it left me beat. I wanted to do my half under 2 hours but it's doubtful now. At this point, I'm just going to continue focusing on a healthy diet lifestyle and stop making excuses about that, and otherwise, just keep running.

After I reach those goals, I'm just going to keep running. With nicer weather finally, I want to run at least 5 days per week. I have a 5 mile run I'm registered for in late May, but nothing else scheduled. Personally, my focus is shifting on a career change and moving, so I'm going to keep running, but I'm not going to be training for anything specific. I just want to run longer distances at faster speeds more comfortably. No specific goals.The irony is I got you to seem arrogant in that reply.

It's Wheating that I'm questioning more than Rowland by the way, not that his steeple PR is relevant lol.Please post accomplishments in the weekly accomplishments thread.The banana is ringing! Answer it!!!!I thought you had treads!Do you use a HR monitor and just check on it every few minutes or so? Check yo' inbox!I've yet to take the pre-race McD's challenge so I'll just stick to my usual oat meal or rice.Awesome keep it up!

Today was my 5th day in a row of z2. Tomorrow I think I'll do some z4 1/2 mile intervals to spice it up.Even before. I had a McGriddle, Hashbrown and coffee going into a six hour race and felt amazing!This is so great! Welcome to the motherfucking show.First you need to slow down. Go back to bed. Regardless of time zone, it is waaaay too early in the day to start a new couch program. Sleep on it. A lot. If you have to get up, to use the bathroom, avoid wearing pants.&gt; Call me arrogant but I think I could have him running faster.

Ok, you're arrogant.

Mark Rowland is one of the best coaches in the world. He has a lifetime PR of 8:07 in the steeple. He's coached numerous Olympians.  Wheating is coming off a season of injury. Wheating has already run 3:38 this year.; Wheating has a lifetime PR of 3:30.9.

Surely you were being sarcastic. April Fools and whatnot.Goal: Sub 40:00 10k (hopefully more like 39:00).

I'm running 40+ mpw atm.

Next is getting above 50mpw consistently.HH is a godsend.&gt;is it really possible to get skinny again just through running?

Running and calorie restriction. Yes. Went from 238lb to 152lb and from being out of breath from "running" a hundred yards to a 1:49 half that way. Although in the last two months of my "diet" I started fucking around with push ups and crunches.

Nowadays I'm at 165lbs and a better body composition thanks to a mix of bodyweight exercises, barbell training and even more running.Have you tried to edit it recently?
Start with a carb binge. Pizza, pasta, dougnuts, etc, because once you start a 5k2C program it will only get easier. Eat more and more each week, but if you start out strong you can't go wrong.Thanks again for "chatting" with me yesterday. I took your advice and ran in zone 2 today and it was still easy but felt like a bit more cardio work.The best tasting food during/after an ultra is the kind that isn't good for you at all! Do we just message the mods when we accomplish something on the goal sheet?To hydrate means to literally consume hydrogen. You need to head over to your nearest running store, and pick up an electrolysis machine and some Gu gels.fuck, got me.

Edit: glad I picked up on it before the McDonald's line, though it's obviously satire when they say burgers and shakes, with no mention of McGriddles (which I wholeheartedly support as race food)I honestly don't get why Wheating trains as a higher mileage 1500m guy. Call me arrogant but I think I could have him running faster. Why are they sitting down after reps? Why is he running 400m reps at those paces? If it's that slow why not 3x 600 or 2x800? Why does he have elephant stomping legs at the end of his reps despite how easy this workout should be for him?Oh, you are very welcome. I'm restarting after 6 months off and I am back to square one. Last year, all I did was HIIT and it exhausted me and didn't really help my cardio. The year before, I just ran but always too hard so my endurance sucked then. Now that i'm starting over again, I am much slower than you are pace wise (although my name says otherwise). Just run most of your runs easy and you will get faster. I'm running by HR now (finally as I always went too fast) and my slow is like a snail but I can go on and on. Why are you posting on the internet.  You need to go to a doctor.  We can't diagnose your problems over the internet.  It could be anything- muscle dehydration, cancer, rabies, or even a stress fracture.

Post back here once you see a doctor and let us know what the issue is so that anybody else who has this problem doesn't have to waste their time going to an ER later.Laying down? Getting a little ahead of yourself on that one, aren't you?I've read about these monks here and there over the years and I feel like much of what they're doing must be lost in translation.

For example, they're not running a marathon a day for 1,000 days. The marathon distance (26.2 miles) is a modern, arbitrary distance. I believe the monks are actually walking/running somewhere between 30 and 40 kms a day depending on the route they take. As this article states, they also stopping frequently to pray and reflect.

I'm not trying to disparage what they're doing -- it is absolutely incredible. But I think in an attempt to make what the monks are doing palatable to western audiences, many articles skim over the profound differences between this spiritual exercise and marathon running. This might sound like a silly question but what is a good baseline mpw for an average runner? Or is that question just far too subjective? Going faster sounds more enticing than running further! I'd love to do a marathon one day but these long runs just take up so much time!Sounds good! I hadn't even thought of a running club. I guess I thought I was too slow to join a running club still...I kinda feel bad for the people just behind you. I keep this on the fridge for motivation. http://i.imgur.com/XczufMd.jpgThanks. I haven't run a race yet, my greatest fear is being last or being picked up by the bus when the course closes...Thank you! I'll take a few days off and do a few easy runs.

I think I might sign up for a half in the fall, just to give myself a goal. Do you like the Hal Higdon plans? That's the one I'm using now, but I adapted it to give myself a few more miles a week. 21.94 minutes for the curious.Thank you! I know I shouldn't compare myself to others but my husband is the one who got me into running and when I compare myself to his 6 and a half minute miles, it feels discouraging...

But thank you! I run on trails, so sometimes I pick up garbage that people leave and throw it in the trash when I get back. Other than that, I sometimes I find interesting things like feathers that I bring back for my kids.That's biologist.Tron.According to wikipedia, its 7 days.

Oh, definitely. I'm a big believer in the "everyone is an experiment of one" thing. For me, though, potatoes kinda mess up my stomach,  so I was trying to steer clear. And it's definitely possible that I went overboard on the food, but I really didn't want to bonk and I could probably stand to gain a couple pounds anyway. Everybody should experiment and find what works for them.That's totally ironic, I just finished the 30km Around the Bay on Sunday. With 5km to go I swore never again and today I am wondering if it would be too early to sign up for next year.But how were your bowel movements?I'd love to see the map!
I didn't have a set amount, I just tried to keep drinking consistently in little sips every few minutes or so, and backed off whenever I felt like it was too much. I was surprised by how quickly I went through water doing that, though!  I never had to change socks, but blisters have never been a problem for me so YMMV as always.To be Frank, May you enjoy whatever food you choose...you're doing god's work!Agreed! I just finished the 30km Around the Bay on Sunday. With 5km to go I swore never again and today I am wondering if it would be too early to sign up for next year.Your working answer's about rightbut you might be better served by mixing it up a bit, rather than running the same distance every day. If your goal is 70K per week, you're going to see some benefits by having one run be a bit longer (say in the 1517K range) and varying your other distances (so 10K one day, but 8K the next, and so on) through the week.I see AutoMod prefers the unfiltered catheter water. Let this be a lesson to us all."Firefly" is the sci-fi equivalence of blue balls, and "Serenity" is you finishing up by yourself on the toilet.. It's.. okej, but not as good as it should have been.This would have been much better without any of the stats. As it stands, this is only half ironical.This is extremely cool! Thanks for sharing!You can change the distances using the settings.found a Phillips iphone arm band this weekend. minus the iphone.

Did it eat Calvin? Or turn him into a box?  I'd recognize that manic glee anywhere...Hey!  I'm an experienced C'er.  I've been practicing really steadily for about 10 years now....here's what you should do!


Fitness-  Alright, so right now you are a runner, which means you must be in somewhat decent shape.  We need to fix that ASAP.  I would suggest finding a couple television shows that you can get hooked on, preferably ones with a big accessible backlog of seasons with lots of episodes. Start watching 5 to 6 episodes a day.  If you are staying up until roughly 2 AM, you're on the right track.....but you may want to ease in to that.  Other tips include driving everywhere that you could instead walk to, spend all of your time online, and have no close personal relationships.



Nutrition-  Nutrition is key to being an elite C'er. Now, it may shock your system to jump right in to this, so you will want to ease in.  I would suggest starting with something easy....maybe some pizza bites cooked in the microwave, a bottle of soda, and an Oreo for dessert.  In no time you will be able to handle an entire medium take out pizza, a couple beers, a half pack of cigarettes, and a box of girl scout cookies.  If you practice really hard, you will be able to do this every day, and it'll just become a part of your routine. Attention citizens!

ILY kibitzor. At least one sub has a reasonable definition of April Fools :)I believe that you need to break it down into carefully planned sections. 0.1 dcl of water per 10kg of body weight every hour before the race. You want to start with a full tank. After the race I suggest flushing your system with 0.2dcl of water per 10kg of body up to 30 mins after the race and then gradually adding 0.3-0.5dcl of beer dpending on your final time. One additional beer for every 2 mins above the 20 minute mark is a good rule of the thumb.Frannnnnnk, we've been over this before.

"Sure, we'll fit you." sounds a hell of a lot better for business than "No way."Well I walk into the store telling them 'I only want to try some shoes, but I won't be buying anything'. And they tell me that's totally fine. I spend some time chatting to them about races and things and I thank them for their help. If you go on a slow afternoon they won't mind a bit. At least, the guys in my local store don't.Exactly. Respect the calories.

FTFYI just finished the 30km Around the Bay on Sunday. With 5km to go I swore never again and today I am wondering if it would be too early to sign up for next year.A friend of mine told me she eats a Gu every 5 miles as a rule, even if she feels good. I'm picking up a few today to try out before the race.Love this. I have to do this on short runs now. I find I get in my head too much. If I can just find something to think about and let go, I do much better. Is this an April fools joke?First off, you need to go to your local water store for a hydration analysis. If you hydrate with stability water, but you really need control water, you're definitely going to blow out your IT band.

Second, don't buy into the hype of the minimalist/maximalist hydrators in here. The right balance is somewhere in between.

Third, make sure you follow the 10% rule. Only increase your water intake by 10% each week. Also, remember to include a stepback week every month or so where you drop your water consumption about 50%.

Or is that 10% of your body weight? I don't remember. Better do both to be sure.

Fourth, all that water can be heavy, best to have a friend or spouse to carry all the water for you. Better yet, rig up a running stroller to hold a 5 gallon water tank. Better to be safe than sorry.

Fifth, to make sure you don't waste any water, run with a catheter so you can refill your water on the run. Make up your own mind if you want to install a filter, but it's a known fact that drinking your own urine can help maximize your water intake. As a bonus, you don't have to stop to urinate during your runs.

Sixth, sign up for all the fun runs possible. Think that water you wade through in the Tough Mudder is insanitary? Think again! Also, it's a little known fact, that the colored powder is actually Kool-Aid!

Seventh, If you like to run in the morning right after waking up, how are you going to hydrate before your run? IV bags, that's how. Sure, it might be a hassle, but who's gonna be laughing as you slosh around all morning? Your spouse, that's who.This post made my day  thank you  since been thread.

Heh, I first read that as you lost interest in it right after buying it :PI always run by lots of fruit trees :)Not to brag, but I did binge watch "The Wire" in nothing but underwear. I slept on the couch and peed in a bottle. My mom came over and chanced the incense and cleaned out the trash.

And remember, totally sedentary wins the race.Is this an April fools joke?Is this an April fools joke?yes I run the 3 miles non-stop. I had a PR the other day at 3.3 miles non-stop and unfortunately had to stop because of an appointment - I could have run further.

In fact, I think I know what I'm having for dinner tonight!How do I sort out my gait? Before I started running I would get a pain in one of my hips from walking and one foot hurting more than the other. Now I'm running I can feel one calf and thigh working harder but I've got no frickin clue how to sort it out. I've tried running "smoothly" but it doesn't seem to work. I guess I just need to know the correct form.

Thanks :)I guess I answered it like a jerk, but the answers *are* there in my post. To be clear though:

- Nothing, really. I guess tape it if it needs more rigidity.
- Until it feels better. I realize this answer sucks, but it's really the only one that matters.
- Not really.Obligatory:

If she is I'll be sure to tell her you said hi :)**The coveted Marine Corps 17.75K Access Granted event was held this past Saturday. Crossing the 17.75K finish line guarantees runners access to the 40th Marine Corps Marathon (MCM) in October. MCM recently went to a lottery entry system because the race got so big. As you can probably imagine, the Marine Corps 17.75K sold out quickly-- less than 7 minutes to be exact. But Nick and I made it in!**

**We were both super excited because this was the first step to making MCM marathon #4 :)**

**The day before the race we drove to the VA Runner Store in Dumfries, VA to pick up out race packets. We unhappily found out Saturday morning that we could have picked up our packets race morning. Other than that annoying aspect, the race logistics were great. There was no parking directly at the starting area but the event had designated parking a little over a mile down the road and buses drove runners to the start.**

**It was really cold race morning. Like 22 degrees cold when we left the house at 4am. We knew we would quickly warm up once we started running but we had almost an hour of standing around waiting for this to start. Nick and I both had old race space blankets wrapped around us for warmth but it wasn't enough. I was slightly miserable because of the cold until I finally started running.**


**That's me in the space blanket!**



**Right before 7am the runners were called to line up. Nick was trying to place in his age group so he left to go up to the front. I chatted with the woman next to me once he left. The National Anthem was sung and a flag ceremony was performed. Then the runners were off!**



**My plan going into this race was to only take walk breaks at the aid stations which were spaced approximately 2 miles apart. I also went unaided and didn't carry my own water. The course was lollipop shaped. With the first 4-ish miles being mostly on the gravel/dirt road, the next 5-ish miles being paved road, and the final 2-ish miles being gravel/dirt and turning back into paved road on the final stretch.**

**There was not a wave start or designated lineup based on pace so the first 0.5 mile or so I was dodging a lot of people. Thankfully, this first part of the course was on the main road so it was pretty easy to get around people. Not long into the race we turned into Prince William Forest Park and the road turned to a gravel/dirt trail.**

**I knew the course was considered hilly, but I didn't expect it to be as hilly as it was. Right after entering Prince William Forest Park the "rolling hills" began. I guess this race considers rolling hills to gain and lose 100-150 ft of elevation on each one. Nick and I have been doing a lot of hill training to prep for the Blue Ridge Half Marathon in April so I wasn't worried about the hills, just slightly caught off guard.**

**I felt so strong during the first 4 miles of the course. I was passing people on the downhills and passing people on the uphills. I love trail running and the terrain felt great on my legs. Somewhere around mile 4 the course came out of the forest onto a main paved road through the park. There was a long and glorious downhill not too far into the paved portion of the course. My form was holding up and I was able to lean into the hill and just fly. What an awesome feeling.**


**right after getting off the trail**

**From studying the map I knew "the hill" was between mile 4 and 5. Everyone was talking about it, but I thought "What's the big deal? It can't be that bad." Eventually I saw "the hill" in the distance. Yikes. It didn't necessarily gain a lot of elevation-- I think roughly 150 ft..maybe a little more. But it was steep. I gave myself a quick pep talk and went for it. I slowed my pace, focused my eyes a few feet ahead of me, and steadied my breathing. I kept moving and actually passed some people as I ran up the hill. In my head I was repeating "You're killing it. Keep going." I was so proud of myself on that hill.**


**nearing the top of "the hill"**

**When I reached the top a lot of people around me had slowed to a walk. But not me. I kept running, eventually I got my heart rate back down, and began to pick my pace back up.**

**The next several miles of the race were pretty uneventful. The course was relatively flat. My legs started feeling a bit heavy. I felt like I slowed down. Looking at my splits post race I really didn't. Between mile 7 and 8 I saw my friend Jackie pass me. She was knocking it out of the park. I wanted to yell to her but didn't want to ruin her focus.**


**Jackie passing me :)**

**Around mile 9 the course departed from the paved road and headed back on the trail towards the finish line. This part of the course was a repeat of the first 2 miles. Not far into the trail was another huge hill. I had forgot how awesome of a downhill we had on the outbound leg. This hill was tricky-- you go up a bit, then it suddenly turns and gets really steep the rest of the way. At this point I caved to the voice inside my head that said to walk. Slightly disappointed with myself. A lot of others were walking the hill and I think this made me feel like it was ok for me to walk as well. I ended up walking the entire thing. This was my last walk break in the race. The rest of the course was pretty flat. I had slowed down at this point for sure. And was happy to finally pop out of the woods onto the final stretch of road.**


**back on the trail**


**the hill I walked**

**Nick was waiting for me on this stretch and was cheering me on. There was a man not too far ahead of me and Nick kept telling me to catch him. I thought the man was too far ahead, but I figured why not try to beat him. I picked up the pace. Lucky for me I've been doing speed workouts and have been practicing my "kick" at the finish. I came up along side the man, we made eye contact, he picked up his pace, I picked up mine, and.... I beat him! Small victories :) The course finished on a downhill. The best races are the ones that have the finish chute on a downhill :)**


**that's Nick waiting next to the white truck
and that man directly in front of me is the one I passed**

**After crossing the finish line a Marine put a finishers medal around my neck and a nice volunteer handed me the official Access Granted card!**


**Marine's handing out finishers medals**


**I finished in 1:49:22 with an average pace of 9:55 min/mi and Nick placed 3rd in his age group (9th overall) with 1:12:18.**



**Overall this was a great event. Very well organized. A lot of awesome volunteers. And the perfect way to guarantee access into the Marine Corps Marathon. I would highly recommend this event to other runners.**

**Did you race this past weekend? Are you prepping for a big upcoming race? Tell me about it in the comments below :)**
Super interesting! Thanks.

(At first I though April 1st maybe?... but article if from 31 march,)Take them for a run. See how they feel.

If they are a little too big, you can change the lacing to make them a little more snug. If they're a little too snug, you can change the lacing to make them a little bigger.

If you have just under three months to prepare you might want to go on a running program. What is your current weekly mileage? [Here is an example\[1\]](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51127/15K-10-mile-Novice-Training-Program) of a plan that is freely available online by a respected running coach. There are plenty of other plans you can look at but the main idea is to slowly build mileage until raceday.

Diet is something I wont discuss, in very generalized terms, I know that you wont lose weight if the amount your eating is the same as the amount you're burning, but when it comes to specific diet tips I would recommend doing your own research OR if you have the ability to go see a dietician/nutritionist.

Treadmill vs outside has some very obvious differences, corners, uneven terrain and such but the motion is still very similar. You will notice a difference but after a couple of runs you should be okay!Upgrade him to the VIP package if he doesn't already have it. Having a tent to warm up in and get some food is the second best thing to having friends and family there. Hello!

@ your first goal: You seem to have built a decent base. Are you running 3 miles without stop? My guess is that your physical condition is just around a graduate of the c25k plan.
My advice is to look up the b210k plan - [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/b210k/). In just 6 weeks you should be able to run a 10k! Also this plan ensures that you do not add to much volume to soon. After that just add a mile or an extra day of running now and then (no more than 10% increase weekly) and you will have no problem running 15k in july!

@ your second goal. Loosing weight and fat is really all about watching your calories. You should have a nice and varied diet with lots of vegetables.
To loose weight you have to consume more calories than you eat. It can really help to write down how much you eat. There is also lots of apps out there which tell you how much you can eat and when. [MyFitnessPal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-diet-tracker/id341232718?mt=8) for one :)

You must be new around here, enjoy your stay!  Posts like these would be suited for the weekly robot accomplishment thread :)What if I'm being chased, should I still not run.

Sorry for asking questions I'm just really motivated and want to do everything the correct way. Usually there is difference between getting a program to run and having a runnable program. I however see no difference here.

I do not know what to do!&gt; What besides RICE do you do for a sprained ankle?

Nothing

&gt; How long should you stay off it?

Until you can run without pain.

&gt; Does anything help for it to heal quicker?

No. Don't use braces, or tape, or any thing else. All they do is prevent you from strengthening your muscles, which would help prevent rolling your ankle. So braces and tape are actually counter-productive.That's a very good comparison, one I will heavily think about when it comes time for my workout today. Thank you for sharing. Such a good idea, thank you! Woah. Minimalist for beginners? No way. They need extra cushion to support their weak elbows. Wouldn't want them to be shot after one hand run!

I suggest wearing a pair of Hoka's, on your feet. Sure you may look silly, and you might not thing it'll help, but trust me. I know what I'm talking about.http://o.onionstatic.com/images/8/8642/original/700.jpg?4034

this guy?Take them for a run. See how they feel.

If they are a little too big, you can change the lacing to make them a little more snug. If they're a little too snug, you can change the lacing to make them a little bigger.

Also, make sure the width is a nice size, not just the length.You know your talking to an american when they order anything but pizza from a pizza place.Only 1,316,345 ms? True bots run it in at least 1,140,000 ms.

Casual.Not to put you down or anything, but thats like saying a horse either walks or gallops.

The gallop, canter, and trot are three different motions, not the same motion at different speeds.

Same thing with running and jogging. Theres a bit less distinction, but they are clearly separate movements.Damn.All hail robot overlord!I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.I think I when I told my coworkers that "I'd treat myself to something over 10k" when asked about my plans for the weekend.Tailwind works well for long distances. I take it with S-CapsI don't believe you're non-human. I see some very human-like legs in that action shot! But well done on your first 5k ;)That's funny. Must be a Valley thing. These guys are Japanese monks... I think they can handle a week and a half without water!!What's the MPW like for the training program?

Stretch your calf as well. The soreness isn't abnormal.My top tips
1. Run less
2. Run less oftenIf you're going to a store and using their services, purchase from them if you find a shoe you like. It is incredibly ignorant to think their services are there for anyone to find a better price online. If everyone did this, there wouldn't be any more stores and then no one could do this.


Ask if they can price match. If they can't, buy one pair from them, then buy the rest online.Best to use the pizza/salad strategy when you're just starting out.  The official 5K2C app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubergrund.android.bpt) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pizza/id412736166) has a timer that beeps between pizza and salad intervals.  In later weeks the pizza intervals get longer and longer, until you're eating nothing but pizza the whole time you're on the couch.This is great advice, thanks!I use to go to run at the gym and I found it so much easier. My breathing did become painful, but I was able to run for a lot longer until I had to stop. I guess i'll just have to push through it till my body becomes use to running outside!I agree, the other post about eating all that domino's is just going to result in vomit if he doesn't train and prepare properly.

Instead of walk/run intervals, just use cake/pie intervals. Thanks, i'll definitely do this. I use to suffer from asthma so it could be coming back, not to mention I do get bad hayfever! I didn't see the link, thanks! Thats what I was doing yesterday, I saw it that I failed because I had to stop. I guess its more of building it up till my body gets stronger!Only if the minimalist stlye is for you. Maybe you need more stability. I suggest Clash Cynbals. They've been working great for me in particular during hand longruns.Tempo should *not* be faster than 5k race pace, it should be slower. They probably mean 15-20 seconds slower than 5k pace.

At the end of a 20-30 minutes tempo you should be tired but not exhausted. You should have that "I'd quite like to slow down but I can sustain this" feeling. Comfortably hard, as they say.

Whereas 5k race pace feels more like "what the fuck I am I doing why did I agree to this I want to stop kill me now".Yeah, it's a joke.

&gt; the monks enter a darkened room where they spend nine days without food, water or sleep.

You would die.The treads will wear out faster if you run trail shoes on roads.

Next time you buy some, try road shoes from the same brand, they will proably fit nicely.Are you just starting to run now?

If haven't got any running history I would approach this differently. You will need some time to adapt to running and get a decent running technique. I would recommend c25k.

If you really want to stick to that one mile start by mixing running and walking. Say run 200 metres, walk 200 metres depending on your physical condition. Add in a rest day every other day and progress will be made fast.

At first you will progress fast, however as you are closing in at a 6 min/mile progress will come slower and slower.awesome, but keep it healthy... listen to your body, do not increase miles too fast or power through stuff that really hurts...
injury is no buenoI was expecting pictures :-(Hypothetically, I'd say (b) would be more effective, simply because the total training volume is higher.What about from a running technique and/or physiological adaptation (to running) perspective?Super interesting! Thanks.

(At first I though April 1st maybe?... but article if from 31 march,)Proper wrist prep is absolutely essential, I've seen a lot of people screw up their wrists hand-running. Here's a solid wrist warm-up vid from GMB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE

Also be sure to ramp up your mileage *very* gradually. Three miles is way too much for a beginner, trust me. Stick to a quarter mile a day for starters. And remember, your pace should be comfortable, not grueling. You're not ready to race just yet.Please find a way to release this movie as soon as possible. I will gladly pay for a copy. It seems like forever ago I watched the amazing trailer for this film but its really starting to feel like Half Life 3 in here :(

Easily my most anticipated film.I would stick with option b. You will cover more distance, and you will get used to the miledistance much faster.

I would also go for intervals aswell. If you are only going to run that one mile, I would probably start by running, say 100-200 metres at a 6 min/mile pace, so you get the feeling of that tempo.

That being said n'either is really a good approach. You can do much more effective training.If you go in this hard this fast you're probably going to get injured with cramps and find yourself right back to exercising. Please for your own sake, take it slow. Know your limits. Maybe try a few Digornos, pizza bites if you can do two-a-days... but don't sign up for any Pizza Hut buffets unless you know you really are up to that level.

Good luck!"Oh, you ran a marathon? How long was it?"Tie them into my laces or zip pockets.In the world of ultras every single race is unique.5k at a speed of 2c? Well, that's certainly fast.

And it takes *uhhh...* two times infinite energy to get there?

Not sure how many energy gels you'll need for that, better get an IV, and stock up on meth.

Be sure not to arrive before you started though.I think this is a great question, and one that I ask myself every time I pick up a new sport/thing. I didn't think I was going to be a "runner", even after I joined cross country in high school.

Then one day, for whatever reason, I decided I had to go running outside, even though it was some of the heaviest rain I ever remember our town having. It was cold and wet and it was miserable for the first mile, and then at some point it felt like I was watching a movie from within the comfortable box of my own body. My body was now moving and breathing on its own, and I was just a spectator within. I only ran a few miles that day, but the rain, the emptiness in the world, and runner's high made for a surreal experience.

When I got back home, I got in the shower and blasted hot water, and even though it felt scorching, it felt like the best thing ever. I was sore and cold and hot at the same time, but it was maybe a top ten moment in my life.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you finally REALLY enjoy running in conditions and distances that you thought would be terrible and painful and unfun, I think that is when you will feel like a runner. At the very least, that's how it went for me.woahMY FUCKING NAME IS SPARKLE FAIRY AND I CAN FLYYYY. I think you need to start out doing smaller distances as your hands aren't used to the strains you're putting on them just yet.  I would do some short reps to begin with mixed in with feet running.  As you're a new to the sport I recommend taking the minimalist approach with something like [this](http://www.saddler.co.uk/prodpics/ready/b/barbour_fingerless_woollen_gloves_large.jpg).  I'm on an old version of RunKeeper on my iPhone but under Audio Cues there's another section called Audio Timing which lets you set this. Either by time or distanceAh that does sounds right! Next time I'll do a better warm up and see how I go. Will book into the drs as well just in case :) thanks for the help!Except for they would refer to the St. Paddy's 5k as a marathon. try C25K and compression forearmsNo excuse :) just need to book the appt!I think I will :) thanks!After the no pain no gain part; I thought you were going to say now cancel that order. You see how easy that was now do that with the program. But no you took it a whole different route.

Edit: fuck i hate April fool day. Till very recently I would still have said I go jogging rather than running.  But I mentioned to a friend I'd watched a thing on TV about joggers being murdered and it had scared the life out of me.  Her response was, "Sure you'll be fine, you're a runner not a jogger"That sucks. What version are they?

I have two pair of Nike Frees and I never wear socks and I've never had issues with blisters. I don't think either of mine have labels though.

Maybe try the flyknits? I just got a pair and they feel so comfortable and like you're just wearing socks. They're pretty great. This is also good advice.Did someone mention sloths?
 Here's a random fact!

Sloths poo once a week. They go in the same spot every time if able!Decrease your daily active time by 10% every day, go for time, not distance. Gear is of some importance, I would recommend a mini freezer and microwave owen (I use the "Nuke a twinkie 3000"). Remember to rehydrate with soda, take a sip ever minute. A great start would also be to get a netflix account and start watching all the startrek series and movies.

You can even bring an iPad or such to the office and get some couch-time during lunch or when the boss is away for meetings. I personally keep a bag of doritos in my desk drawer. Some say to leave the dorito powder on the fingers while typing, others go for the "lick the fingers", it's really up to you.

And no matter how littel you move, remember that you can move less. And if you limbs starts to go numb, that's just circulation cut off, it's proof of progress.

Pure sloth takes a minute to learn, but a lifetime to master.I wasn't replying to that guy. Anyway, read my initial comment, I completely acknowledge that there's a difference.Run and walk - run and walk - run and walk - run and walk ---   keep on doing this for as long as you want. I run in Nike Free 5.0's. I use a pair of socks called "invisible" socks with them. These socks are a bit like the usual running socks - except that they are VERY thin. In fact , I don't like wearing normal running socks (like ASICS) because they are quite thick and padded - I seem to lose "feel" when  wearing them and and also they seem to take up too much space inside the shoe for me - I have widish feet!! :)  But these"invisible socks" are about as thin as women's stockings - I find them great to use with the Nikes. No more smelly shoes!! :) Isn't it obvious?

Do a [Couch to 5k running program](http://c25k.com/), but in reverse!
Wow, great info thanks!

All I have near me is a pizza hut is it safe to substitute them for dominos?I've been running 7k every day for about two months. I want to run 10k every day. Somebody told me not to increase my distance by more than 10% at a time so I increased my distance to 8k and I've been doing that for three days. How long should I wait before moving up to 9k, and then to 10k?(I am definitely feeling the extra kilometre as I'm a little sore. My working answer is to increase my distance again when 8k feels normal. Is this correct?)Well I think it is important to go on dominos.com right now and order a sandwich, bread bowl pasta, and some pineapple bbq chicken bites...maybe even a hot lava fudge brownie cake to top it all off. You have to eat all of this in one sitting. Your body is going to say no more but mind over matter you know so NO PAIN NO GAIN. After you finish everything, you are going to get very depressed and you will be filled with regret and the itis will kick in and you will fall asleep. You will wake up hours later and you will have a massive headache as if someone crashed a week old baguette on your head and your throat will feel like a dry microwaved tamale. At this point, it is important to hydrate with coca-cola because the polar bears that were on those commercials were so cute back in the day.Thanks! And trust me if I can do, anyone can. Fuck yeah! Well done mate! Keep up the great work, thanks for the inspiration.You're listing some of the signs of heat exhaustion. I know a lot of people who would be in trouble running in the conditions you're describing. Maybe you could try and run during some cooler times for a little bit or bringing cold water/ice water to drink/pour on yourself as you go and see if it helps. But, yeah, keep in mind that you might need to go see a doctor. They would be able to give you a much more solid answer.That's around 4,600 stories. The tallest building in the world has 163. Nope!Oh, look, it's April 1st again. Thank you so much for the advice. I've never been fitted for a running shoe before. What's the process like? Start by sitting just 30 minutes, 3 times a week. You don't want to overstress your sitting muscles and end up injured!What do you guys do with your keys? Right now I run with them in my handI found a gas station sandwich still wrapped up once....

My life is incredibly mundane :/&gt; I guess my question is where do I go from here?

More half marathons and 10k's to improve your PRs off course!

&gt; Do I take some time off after the half marathon?

No. Keep running. Consistency is key. If you start a half marathon cycle in the summer again you will improve only marginally compared with where you are today. If you feel like you can't motivate yourself to go out without a plan or goal, maybe you could join a running club. Plans and goals will follow automatically :)I am on a local trailrunner/ultrarunner Facebook group and about every week there is someone inviting others to come discover their home trail. Very fun. If anyone is in the Netherlands/Flanders and wants in, I can hook you up.I've run a few ultras using Tailwind, it works well and I usually use it in combination with my other nutrition and additional salt tabletsHi, thanks for mentioning that. I was concerned by the load speed too. It seems that BlueHost is a bad hosting solution. I did lots of optimizations already, but server response kills all the efforts.
I am on a research for better hosting options now... did anyone else recognize bad loading speed?I don't use salt stick but have run a 50K in 6:41 using just NUUN. Oops....I have had luck with taping. I find it more helpful that using an ACE wrap. KT tape has a good video giving a run down on how to do it. Good luck.I ran my first marathon February this year. I made training plans that were increasingly heavy in mileage (increments of 3 kilometers, peaking at 35K). I ran it with my buddy (who's a triathlete). Mileage runs were done every Sunday.

Race day was awesome! There were 15,000 runners who ran the marathon. I finished at 4:42. My goal was 5 hours. :)

Couldn't walk for half day because thighs hurt so much lol. Probably because I needed more training. :)For an off subject story, I would really argue that I just have weak ankles: My first SXSW in Austin I was waiting in line for a Pure Volume set. Some folks busted out a hacky sack. We played for a little while as the line was not moving. Eventually, as the pavement was curved towards the gutter in my position, I fell on my foot wrong.

Long story short, it happens quite often for me. This time my friend and I were chasing his dog, I leaped a two-foot ledge and landed in gravel; landed on my right foot as my legs slipped under me.How often did you drink? And for a 50 miler do you change socks?Nah it did get locked down for real, I just had access from the start since I created the 2013 goal sheet haha. I got a bunch of PMs so I've just been adding people. It's not a terrible policy I guessWhat I find fascinating is that it took 9 years before anyone ever completed it.  That guy (Mark Williams, apparently) must have felt like a god.Stop on the spot, yell something about privilege and cite the technical details of the sign up form that allows for your pace.Arizona checking in.  Three to four months of the year, it's a nightmare (I retreat to a treadmill).  The rest of the year, however, is amazing.  I love my Christmas Day runs in shorts and t-shirt.&gt; alumni (any of the 14 runners who have completed the Barkley) the entry fee is a pack of regular camel filter cigarettes.

That would feel so good just to enter a race with a pack of cigarettes. A vulture. I scared it off. I have yet to find anythign worth picking up. Guess there's more motivation for upping the miles.This is what Google says:

**Try the following simple range-of-motion exercises:**

* Trace the alphabet with your toe, which encourages ankle movement in all directions. Trace the alphabet 1 to 3 times.

* Sit in a chair with your foot flat on the floor. Slowly move your knee side to side while keeping your foot pressed flat. Continue for 2 to 3 minutes.

Was hoping for some other home remedies though, to be honest. And as stated, something to add to the FAQ. The post I quoted was for a marathon that took place in a week after the sprain. So last year I was on a cross country bike tour and crossed paths with a young gal who was running across America for charity. Her website is http://www.christinarunsamerica.com ; you should hit her up, she's a super cool gal and I'm sure she'd be happy to answer you're questions. Good luck!

edit: she was running completely self-supported, keeping her tent and things in a reinforced runner's baby stroller she named "Thor". Dunno if she remembers me, but if you contact her, tell her the dreadlocked bike tourer who met her on a canal trail says hello :) I think we've all gone off course once in a while.Awesome thank you!I don't believe you. That sounds exactly like my PTT.  Pain stopped immediately when I stopped moving. Great! Keep pushing yourself! Sign up for races.  If you get less stressed and thus lazy, sign up for another race.  Always have something on the horizon! Live slow, leave an ugly, bloated corpseSo what, you're so incapable of using Google to find what you need that you refuse to add it yourself? Take some initiative, I'm not the one rolling my ankle!Nice! Keep it up. Consistency is the key.Podcasts. Mostly the Giant Bombcast. Occasionally I'll listen to audio books as well. Take a look at BeyondPod. That's the app I use. Its baller as fuck, anything that's on iTunes you'll be able to find on there. I don't wear a heart rate monitor when I run, so I don't have my max, min, average.  Unfortunately, a regular trip to the doctor turned up that my resting has sunk well into the 30s.  Upon further investigation, it goes into the 20s while I sleep.  So...my cardiologist and I are having a lot of get togethers.

Moral of the story...We all love our pulse rates. Runners take pride in the strength of their hearts.  Be careful, people.  There is such a thing as too low.I didn't post about why I rolled my ankle, I posted about how I can treat the muscles in a relevant procedure. Even included bullet points for what I was asking to be added.I found a $20 bill onceYeah, I'm not super excited about those. I'm gonna do about thirty miles per day and luckily I'm starting law school in the fall so i have about four months off this summer and I wanted to do something big with itIt's not the fear card, it's the reality card.

I was bleeding in a flood wash under a roadway after I screwed up my knee crashing my bike.

Calling my roommate who had a car capable of transporting both me AND my bike was a lot easier than crawling on the side of the road (no I was not able to walk) hoping some stranger with a truck would be willing to haul this clumsy girl to the ER.

Another time I was on a 70 mile ride with some friends out in the middle of the Felicianas and one of them collapsed in crushing pain.  It ended up being a kidney stone.  He was glad we could call his wife immediately instead of riding to the next town, or waiting for someone to drive by.

I won't try to convince you to bring your phone.  It just seems an easy enough precaution to take if it's available.  It's also pretty convenient for tracking my workout, listening to podcasts, the rare emergency situation and nowadays perhaps a bite to eat with NFC payment options.

You can count on one hand the number of times you needed your phone. That seems like a good reason to carry one.  /shrugNo I'm in Glendale. It was a race off the 101 and Thunderbird. So apparently there was a couple races poorly marked...I thought I might be the only one who listened to doom-y stuff. I love Earthless, 25 minute jam doom songs are amazing for zoning out.I miss runningIIRC, there are no course markings, most of it is navigated with a map and compass and yeah insane vertical. They have to collect pages of books at checkpoints as proof. I was going to go for podcasts at first but then couldn't figure out how to get any on my phone because all the ones I found were in iTunes format and I have an android phone. So I gave up on that idea and then was like duh audio books. They are made to run barefoot in. I prefer running barefoot. I haven't worn socks in my running shoes in more than a year. Never had blister problems except for when my dog chewed up the heel. Good suggestion.  I'm kind of looking though for something like Vibram FiveFingers shoes, but for hands. Over 50,000 feet of vertical climb.

Edit: Also, I believe the course is unmarked.Sorry to be a party pooper, but it might work for you but not for others. Stomach is a very sensitive organ and varies from person to person. Plain sugar is a hell of a thing to digest while running in general. I'm glad it works for you, but, just as a suggestion, e.g starches like boiled potatoes are lot easier on you if you time it right. Another thing. You don't need to eat a ton at 50 miler. Of course you'll tap your glycogen reserves at some point, but (depends on weather)  bigger part is hydration.
Just my 2 cents.Same spot as where I had blisters my first year of high school track. Shoes that are cut on a narrow last (Nike, Adidas) can do that, especially if you're moving up a size to compensate for the lack of width. Look for wider versions of those same shoes, or utilize shoes cut from a wider last (Mizuno, Saucony, Asics). My personal choice has been Mizunos for about a decade now, but go get yourself fitted and see what's what.Entry fee is $1.60 and a license plate for newbies. A pair of gold-toed socks for veterans. Pack of Camel cigarettes for finishers.Hmm.... Now we're getting somewhere.SPILL.  It must have been seriousHow about a 26.1 mile long moving sidewalk like they have in airports?Road gloves.Well...maybe don't wear them barefoot?I don't listen to audiobooks, but I always listen to podcasts. I'm running an hour or more most days, so being able to lock into an episode of Econtalk or Hardcore History lets me learn something while I get my miles in.There's nothing particularly special about rolling your ankle. The treatment is the same as the treatment for 95%+ of running injuries - if it hurts while you're running, stop, go home, and rest it.

Almost every treatment for an injury that *isn't* RICE is just voodoo. Certain injuries can be helped through strengthening exercises, but the only thing that's going to stop you from rolling your ankle is knocking off whatever weird shit you're doing that results in you rolling your ankle on an annual basis.terrainGo and find out.feels like it is getting better. Maybe 2 more dayshillllllllllsSo true.While we are all still trying to hit the 30 mile challenge [boldlywent](http://www.reddit.com/user/BoldlyWent) destroyed the 30mile challenge in 2 days.  Enjoy the gold while the rest of us work on completing the challenge over the next few weeks :)So, it is 100 mile.

And you have to finish in 60 hours or less.

That averages out to a 36min/mi pace (22min/km).

I'll assume 4 x 15min bathroom breaks per day, so 3 hours.

2 x 8 hour naps. So,16 hours.

Eating and drinking on the run, so no break for that.

I'll add in an hours worth of changing time for socks, outerwear etc.

I'll be generous and give 20 hours of non-running.

Which give you about 40 hours of running to do with sleep, changing and bathroom breaks built in.

That averages a 24min/mi pace (14:54min/km).

I know its hard, but that makes it sound a lot easier than it really is. Wht am I missing here?
Seriously, I clicked on this link thinking you were bragging about how running gave you a nice ass.  (Not expecting or asking for pictures, mind you.)The day I found $10 was a good day. If only that would happen again...

I found a stash of baby toys behind a bush last weekend. I poked around but couldn't find anything else. Not sure whether I should be sad or concerned.Yeah, that's right :-)Bandits at Boston are a tradition. What is shameful is that we let terrorists stop us from carrying on this tradition. Most people who end up running marathons started as bandits. Boston's race director started as a bandit. Plus, bandits run after the last wave; so, they are really not preventing anyone from doing their best. I understand the argument that bandits divert resources from those who paid for the race but honestly with the inconvenience that the Boston Marathon causes for Boston's residents, every resident should be allowed to run it whether or not they qualify. I think you're underestimating how difficult it would be to run a marathon downhill. I'm not a terrible human being, so no. i think the one he is referring to is the FIFA World cupmuch respect to people who atleast try this. cowards die a thousand deaths and all thatI hate to say it... But I'm pretty sure it was just someone getting a jump on tomorrow...


If it wasnt then disregard my post I made because fuck banditsJust don't do it. With security the way it'll likely be this year, you won't get far. Unless you're fully supporting yourself, you're diverting aid + other resources away from runners who have legitimately paid (and qualified, no less!) to run it, and it's just not fair to them. It's theft, essentially.

I get that bandits at Boston are a "tradition", but it still rubs me the wrong way.

ETA: Don't end up being one of these runners: http://fittish.deadspin.com/do-you-know-these-runners-because-theyre-probably-bast-1567215283I love the rules to this race.Eh, live a little.Maybe I will when I win a race. I've been running for about eight years, but I still haven't crossed the line first.this is the most shameful thing you can do. All the participants have earned their spot and you are possibly blocking someone from doing their best.  When you get caught, be prepared for long term bans from boston and other marathons.I'm in the same boat. Looking forward to some ideas!Awesome, thanks for the tip I'll give em a tryId give it a try, i would likely fail thoughWe bought  60" 2000$ treadmill from Nebraska furniture mart.  No interest for 18 months. We're paying it off over the course of this year.

My husband is 6'3", and the 60" deck works great for him.  Neither of us love using it, but we both used it several times a week during the worst of the winter.  I have a couple of TV series that I only allow myself to watch while on the treadmill, as motivation.  We also both did a lot of workouts where we would run for 0.5-1 mile, then do some strength training, then repeat x3-6.  I found I couldn't run more than 3 miles at a time on the treadmill, but it was at least enough to get me through the winter.

Edited for typos.Aside from all the other suggestions is the obvious one: try drinking more water.Yeah, Ive done it the past 4 or 5 years. The key is to get a similar looking bib, the dead give away that you're a bandit is you don't have a bib. I usually pick up spare bibs I find at races (also bandited) and then go to the expo of the new race to see what the bib looks like, then I pick out the most similar looking bib. I haven't payed for a race in 12 years! Boston, NYC, MCM, LA, Chicago, you name it. Next goal, Rio 2016!I use to smoke. One of the things that ex-smokers have to be wary of is using any type tragedy (large or small) as an excuse to light up again. About the best advice I've been given in that situation is that if I light up then not only do I have this tragedy to deal with but I've compounded my problems by adding smoking back into my life.

I use this same logic for running. I don't always enjoy running but when I don't do my planned run, no matter the reason, I feel worse. As an added bonus, I can't remember a time where a good run didn't at least make me feel better after it was done.

Now the corny part for me is that when I run, I often find my mind wandering to people I've lost. I'm not sure why I do this, more than likely it's because I started running for health reasons. I run to be heart healthy. Maybe it's something else, maybe I just never really dealt with the loss but while I'm running my mind decides that then would be a good time to go ahead and meditate on that a little bit. Who knows but running is time that I spend with my lost loved ones. When I lose someone now, they become part of my running pack. I will.That sounds realistic. The only way such a cheap mask could work is by requiring more pressure to pull air in.

That's not like breathing at altitude at all. Altitude has thinner air, which means less oxygen saturation to the lungs (or whatever term they use). To compensate, you need your lungs to more effeciently extract the smaller amount of oxygen they do receive. The only way to simulate that, without going to a different altitude or exercising in a pressure chamber, would be to use a tank of compressed air that has higher nitrogen and lower oxygen content.

That would be a pain in the ass to take to the gym, and impossible to run with.

Or, you could just exercise normally, because that actually helps you achieve the exact same thing.I found a weird ceramic figurine of a woman, just sort of hanging out by the river.  I thought it was a Mary or something religious but she was just a woman in a dress.

I looked for her a few weeks later and some heathen had smashed her.  :/That is a great race photo.

WHEEEEEE!  SSSSSSUUUGARRRRRR!I personally have not had much success running during times of grief or extreme stress.  I would go out for a run and 1/2 mile in, I'd be sobbing.  I think I was barely holding things together, and with the added physiological stress from running, I would just completely fall apart.  And not in a cathartic way, either.  Yoga was out, too.  Meditation attempts all ended with tears, again, not the good kind.

I ended up doing something completely different.  I found some trails by a river that runs around the outskirts of our town, and I started walking those with my dogs, a couple of times a week. I also started riding my bike.  Being out on the trails, in nature, with my dogs for company was more therapeutic than running, for me.

If you try to run and it doesn't feel mentally good, try something else for a week or two.  Go for a walk, swim, bike ride, hike, anything to get you out in the sun and get your body moving.  Try the running again in a week or two.  It eventually does become therapeutic, at least, it did for me.

This will sound odd, but I'll explain it: mourn in the way that makes you happy.

The dead dont care if we mourn for them. If anything, the person would probably prefer that you carry on with your normal life. So, when we mourn, we actually do it for the benefit of us survivors, rather than for the dead. Mourning helps us to let go and say goodbye.

So, mourn in whatever way helps you overcome the loss and return to your life. If that means hiding in a closet and crying nonstop for hours, then do it. If it means dedicating a workout to their memory, then do that. Do whatever makes you feel better and lets you return to normal life.Wanna hear an explanation about the time I *didn't* high five someone?Douche (you not the other guy)There is a name for people that wear those masks: "suckers".MotoGP just had their season-opening motorcycle races there.http://imgur.com/FmMwEPr

Photo from the start of the race this year. Talked to my buddy Rob who was running and some of his crew earlier today. They were ready to go at about 5am. The cig wasn't lit till around 10am. When I bought a pair of nikes.Uf. Good luck in Kansas. Those will be boring runs, my friend.

I mainly asked because my father biked across the country for charity twenty some odd years ago. He the other diagonal, from Washington state to Virginia Beach. Also, I asked because I'm from Iowa and was thought you might be passing through. Sigh... :(

How many miles does this work out to per day and how long are you planning on it taking you? Also, if you don't mind me asking, how are you able to take off work for, presumably, the months this will take??As stated above, I think you are ok to run on the trip, but keep it casual and don't stress about it. Use it as a way to explore. Focus on the trip, this is a once in a life time trip, will be plenty of time to worry about running fitness after. And walking so much will do a surprising amount to keep fitness. Time of feet is an important aspect of distance running.1) where do your feet go numb?

2) do you have pain at rest? Or only pain with activity?Maybe you should leave it for last on your bucket list, since you very well might die trying to complete it.ha, that's awesome! i found the straps a mile away from a road work area. i ran down the closed road (no traffic!) with the strap in my hand. had a thought similar to your experience as i exited the construction zone.Thanks. Sounds like I should buck up and buy something else.I only see random clothing items strewn about. From my experience, any abandoned clothes in the city have poop on them, so I just keep running.Hopefully after I finally get around to doing a marathon. I ran 240 miles this month, but they're still surprised when I say something like, "Oh, just 10 miles."I got mine at REI using my dividend to help with the cost. I upgraded from a FR305, and it is nice improvement. It looks nice enough, and is comfortable enough I use it as a daily watch as well.Next you need to run far enough, often enough, that they stop reacting in shock."No one who speaks German could be an evil man!"I once ate an entire quesadilla, a ham-and-bacon sandwich, and several pierogies during a 50 miler.  No stomach issues at all.Yea that is my next step. I've got it under control now with insoles. But I need a pair of running shoes that will not destroy me. I was using Brooks Pure Connect 2 when it flared up. I may look into the Hoka's. I was eyeing them beforeYou mean besides http://healthandrunning.com/ ?Found industrial bolt cutters. Ran with them. Past some cops.

In hindsight, I should have sprinted past the cops. I agree. It just seems so contrived. If I'm going to run that far, I want to enjoy my surroundings, not fighting through some god damned thorn bushes. You are what you repeatedly do! So, yeah, I'm a runner.I have a vertigo condition and running on the treadmill actually helped me, weirdly. Forced my eyes to compensate for my messed up inner ears so I could stay balanced. It was rough for a while though, and I always made sure someone else was around in case something happened.You don't write 400 words about every almost-interaction you have with another person?Happens to me most times when I do runs longer than 3-5 miles. My brain just zones out.

I run with a group 2 nights a week and we all agree that whatever is said during a run will not always be remembered and will probably need to be repeated afterwards because we all do it to some extent while running.That thumbnail thoAs one article I read described it, most races are set up to help you succeed--there are volunteers or markings at places you might get lost, aid stations, courses that are on roads or trails...the Barkley is set up for you to fail. I think that's why I find it so fascinating (well, also it can feel like watching a train wreck when you read the race reports).T Swift :)I'm all for not high fiving people, but why make such a big deal about it?Cool, thank you so much for this. I definitely want to run the 13 before the actual half so I'll probably do that variation.

I normally never had trouble increasing mileage so I wasn't too worried about the longer runs, but I'll keep your advice in mind. Thanks again  :)I hadn't heard of this before... But I would have to agree and assume that so long as the shoes aren't being stored in extreme conditions, they'd last at least a few years. Earlier this year I found a Nintendo 3DS with Bravely Default.

It looked like it had been thrown out of a car by a raging dad or something.  The 3DS screen was broken, but Bravely Default worked.Seems like the kind of thing you should see a doctor about!I had a similar pain but only in one calf after a 200 mile relay I did 2 weeks back. Just tried my first run today and it flared up a bit but not too bad. Icing and foam rolling has sped up the recovery immenselyJust echoing a lot of what's been said but I've consistently been plagued with ITBS since my first half marathon. What's helped me prevent it is stretching and foam rolling, but also concentrating on strengthening glutes and hips. Lots of lunges, squats, and other plyo stuffI've been listening to the [Ginger Runner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/grinds/id906792131) tracks. Some of the best running music I've ever listened to. Check it out!I love listening to Joe Rogan when I'm going long and slow. I don't even know half the people he has on the show but they are all so funny. I am supposed to get married the following weekend. But I think I will try my luck.

They have a location right near Zona Rosa and have regular group runs.It was 1C today and sunny (35F?) and I was running in just my base layer and pants. Happy as a clam. I've been running in fairly lightweight trail shoes for some years now.  I find them to be quite comfortable and haven't had issue with them even though most of my runs are on road/sidewalk. YMMV of course.there are subreddits for that. you dont want to see my booty. and sorry. the click bait was intentional.http://www.letsrun.com/news/2014/11/marathon-racing-shoes-pros-wear-2014-new-york-city-marathon/

Judas Priest,
Pink Floyd,
Tron II sound trackif your only goal is to finish, if you max out at 10 or 11 miles on a long run, you will be able to fight through 13 on race day. goal #1 should be to get to the start line healthy and enjoying running. dont push yourself to constantly run further if you arent ready for it, and with a light schedule, the weekly increases may wear you out.

if i were designing this, and my only goal was to finish, i would probably do my long runs as follows (starting with week 7): 9, 9, 11, 9, 11, 6, Race Day (which I assume is the last saturday or sunday on your calendar). If you want the confidence boost of doing 13 before the race, then I would do that in place of the last 11.  On the step back week, you could add 1 mile to each of your other 2 runs to maintain total mileage, or take the decrease as a chance to rest a bit if your body needs it.

i would certainly focus on allowing a taper so your body can recover a bit and be ready to go. fill those stores and have something to burn race day.

just remember, if you train for slow, RUN YOUR RACE, dont get out there and decide to try to run faster because you suddenly want to. it will make for a bad day.Lots of road jerky. Never anything of value.When I bought a pair short shorts so short my girlfriend said that they were grounds for breaking up (jokingly of course). When I felt like a runner, even when I wasn't running.A new pair of sunnies (by far my best find)Expected something entirely different when I clicked on this. Came away disappointed. I don't think it's smart to just pick up random shit that you find in a roadside ditch while running...When someone else called me a runner.You got over a half-mil out of your Mizunos? I'm impressed :-p

I think I got 700 miles out of my last pair of WRs before they completely fell apart. Went with the ultra-cushioned Sauconys, and I hate them...Nobody cared who he was until he put on the mask. I was giving blood, which I try to do regularly, and the nurse that was taking my vitals asked if I was an athlete.  Now I've never thought of myself as an athlete, and before then only as someone trying to go for a run on a regular basis (2-4 times per week).  I kind of hesitated and told her that I run sometimes.  She asked if I was feeling okay as she dug out a book.  She had to check to see if my pulse was too low to donate.  I had registered a 44.  40 is their cut-off.  That's one of two times I've been below 50 when giving blood.

A similar situation occurred when I was having some unrelated medical problems and I was asked similar questions while they were watching my vitals.  When the doctor came in to check me over, the nurse told him "He's a runner" since again, my pulse was "low" (mid 50s that time I think).

It's those kind of things that made me realize I am a runner.  I've been doing it long enough and regularly enough to improve my overall health.Have you done any 13.1's?Training for my first one now :)

Cape Cod, MA. October. Goal time is anything sub-4.
I found a lot of animals are coming out of hibernation and exploring my running path. Thank you so much for your insight. I discovered this sub earlier this week and I am so happy I reached out. You all have been incredibly kind and have given such good advice. Thanks for the advice man, cleared up a lot. How true this is. Thank you,  from the bottom of my heart. And my condolences for your loss as well. No problem. I didn't believe in zen moments until I started running last year. I love living in Calgary!http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/2ycae2/best_spectator_sign_ive_seen_at_a_race/It needs something to make me want to read it. I don't find anything there particularly jumping off the page as information that I need to know. (Though I do think it's worthwhile that the sensationalism doesn't exist.) While you seem like a totally decent dude that likes to run and wants to share their enthusiasm for it, I have no reason to consider your opinion any more noteworthy than any other random runner.About three months after I started and it no longer sucked to run a few miles. I started feeling myself get angry with myself if I hadn't gone out in a few days or so.I have found running gives me time to process, to feel sad, to think, to come to terms. So long as I am not sobbing like a baby while running down the street. Its harder to run when angry. I went through a divorce after I found out my ex was cheating. Running through the days of grief was empowering. Running through the days of anger was impossible - I couldnt control my pace and I would just burn out.

Immediately, running is probably hard to do, but hopefully in the short term you will find solace in it.I lost someone very close to me right before I started college, loss turned into grief, grief turned into sadness and then sadness turned into the deepest depression I've ever experienced. I could not find my way through the darkness, but one day I went home and saw all the race numbers I had hanging up from high school and how far off course my life had gone and made a pact with myself to power through and beat it.

My best advice is just take it one day at a time, some days are going to be better than others, but always strive to improve. Run one day at a time, 2 days at a time, ease back into it until you can feel like yourself again. It won't happen instantly but as you go you'll find it'll get easier and easier and soon you'll be back to yourself. But my best advice would be don't stop, life is happening now and you need to savor every moment, every run and every step because it's too short to be unhappy.*The Barkley Marathons: The Race That Eats Its Young* - a documentary feature film -

Careful that you don't ramp it up too quickly.Go see a Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!Amazed he digested that much fat while running...This might sound like big challenge but it won't be.

Just make sure you get the right size. Pretty horrible. Fortunately around here it is illegal to use salt on regular streets ( there are exceptions for freeways in extreme weather conditions) so I don't have this problem - I'd be really worried for my bike.I can't imagine it's *that* much more compliant than a [Mrazek](http://www.mrazek.com/) or a curved-stay Ritchey/Curtlo.

A model in between would have been perfect. In case you really want to upgrade get a solid frame so you can simply swap components.

Canyon isn't the only company offering direct sales. Compare to find a model that fits your needs and you can learn a bit about the individual components, which is helpful.Eight people have bought this so far. That's eight folks who know a good vertical compliance when they see one.That's very different where I am from, however I expect you bring in more business than I do. There has been a movement not to service bikes from direct sellers like Canyon. It's stupid and probably is the reason I bought some tools (online as well) and just learned how to do most things myself. Which in turn has helped my identify those shops that have no idea what they are doing.There are a few more pics [here](http://www.bespokebicycleclub.com/revolucion)[Here's a pic of it built up](http://www.bespokebicycleclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/flaxbuilt.jpg)It's more like a midvelo, than a true 20" minivelo.

I wonder how much play will develop in the drop plate bolts over time.This isn't true where I live. Sure you might get safe some money on 3+ year old models or "only slightly" used bikes. You might even get 5% on an msrp that is 20% inflated from the start. I can almost guarantee that for the same price the component mix will be worse, I will have to wait several weeks for my specific model to be delivered anyway - at which point I can't return it in case I change my mind.

The service is just not worth it. At most shops it's hit and miss (as in which employee does the work, otherwise I'd just change shops) ... they go out of business every 5 years ... Rather than go through all that trouble and paying for several shipment handlers and their managers, I might just buy online.

Warranty claims are even easier. I can send my bike in, talk to the actual people responsible for handling my claim. Everytime I went through a shop, they didn't follow up or lost track of things and I had to manage them while I couldn't open a ticket with the manufacturer. Plus I can send packages from home, without having to walk a distance home from the shop.

Their shop is always open, they will actually pick up the phone ... I could go on.

The only benefit lbs have is being close for last minute purchases (if they're open) or quick fixes. But those are small things and will hardly pay their bills. http://i.imgur.com/BwxrEGX.jpg

Finally got round to upgrading the Japanese bars I'd bent in a crash to some 3Ts (seemed more appropriate) and changed the colour scheme from black to white. Just need to upgrade the seat now and order some new decals that have got rubbed off over the years.We're not. But that shouldn't stop you :)I think it's more the fibrous matter from the plant itself. I believe flax is related to linseed(?) and because of its consistency is used to make sheets of material in the same way hemp is. PLEASE, that thing looks gorgeous!Only if they come cycling :)

Yes, of course, you can post in Catalan, Galician and Basque. It's already on the sidebar. There is a thread to discuss community rules. I'm a noob moderator so there is a lot of things that I could have made wrong.Ojal que s.All you need now is a green water bottle. That also works the other way around as pedestrians should also understand their own vulnerability from cyclists and cars just as a cyclist does.

While for the most part I try and give people a wide birth there are times when they jump out on you, especially when they are not looking where they're going or busy faffing on their cellphone. There's a major traffic light crossing by the train station near me where pedestrians regularly walk into the road without looking even when it's obvious traffic is coming. It makes it even worse when one of them does it and hoards of others who aren't paying attention aimlessly wander into the road as well. I'm sure one day there will be an accident there :-(

I try to be considerate, but I have my limits on stupidity, just like everyone else.Frame is $1,100.
Wheelset $1,200
Cranks were $675 roughly
Everything else was just basic pricing, seatpost was about $120.Eh, it must be overall cheaper to produce as it is a pretty cheap groupset for the quality. I just wish sram had more presence here in the UK. I would take apex over 105 every time ( and you often see it competing with Tiagra in terms of price tiers... No doubt it is a better groupset than tiagra) but they do not have a lot of retailers even offering force or red let alone rival and apex. But one of the great things about sram is you can just upgrade the levers and apart from weight you'd be hard pressed to notice the difference. That's good. Thanks for the laugh. While I can do that it's a narrow single lane road, just over a mile that's all uphill with plenty of cars parked at the side and I would be holding up the traffic quite a bit (I'm not the fastest of cyclists).

I have cycled in the road there when the cycle lane has been a little icy, and have seen many other cyclists riding up that road, but I think the cycle lane was placed there to make the traffic flow a little more freely as it's a main route and there are quite a few cyclists.Hey I'm all for innovation. We need to keep new designs coming along and cant just keep doing the same thing based on "tradition."

That said, what on earth is the deal with that thing?Dude almost looked like he had a mental illness or something.He could also buy a front wheel and tire for a few bucks off Craigslist at any time of the day, but he tried to steal one anyways.

And if he puts together a bike from stolen parts and sells it for $50 on Craigslist, he's just made $50 of all profit.

Pieces of shit like that just want something for nothing.kind of bike selfie I had the "shut up and tyke my money" moment with Canyon as well. I wanted to get a spare part from them and ordered it by mail. All I got for more than a week were mails that the order will be processed and that I will receive an order confirmation in 24/48h. I canceled my order.
tl;dr: Canyon has great products but a very lousy serviceBb is fine. If the brake configuration is good enough for Sheldon and good enough for kits to be sold, it's good enough for me. I'm kinda tall, I'm 6 foot 2, but I have much longer legs then torso. So I got the 58cm bike and just use a longer seat stem. They are topeak defender rc11.  I was a bit sceptical when the bike shop recommended them, but once fitted they look super sleek Yeah! I had a few plates laying around from our cubicles at work. I was staring at them and knew there had to be a way I could use them. Sheldon had the answer :)No one said you couldn't do it, just that it was a bad idea. Judging by that hacked on front brake and your BB height we were almost certainly right.Check out Bikerowave or the bike kitchen. Both are coops and will be able to help YOU rebuild and repair your own bike. Great rates, awesome staff. $8/hour to wrench your own bike and you learn so much. Highly recommended. That drop bolt front brake is amazing dude! What an amazing idea, leave it to Sheldon to have something genius like that laying aroundhopefully you haven't needed to take the T from Wellington, the Orange Line has been hell for the last couple weeksThat's why you sell the cups at a premium.Your seat post is backwards. As a cyclist out here in Ol' Salt Lake City this makes me really jealous.  I did get to ride today in fifty degree sunny weather however...So...Can confirm, do bike delivery in NYC blizzards and hurricanes. Some bum will poo in there, I guarantee it. Check out your LBS. Mine had the brand names like kryptonite but the mechanic recommended some offbrand that was the same thing and just as good. It was around 30 bucks. Whatever you do, don't get a cable lock!price?I don't think I will ever understand the idea that "I just won't ride if I HAVE to wear a helmet". If you don't ride because of a requirement to wear a helmet (something very simple to put on and wear), then perhaps you weren't really that committed to riding in the first place. I don't stop at stop signs/red lights because it is the law, I do so because I'd rather not get hit/injured/killed. Same for helmets. Hair doesn't protect the head well. Perhaps standard bicycle helmets don't as well, but they are still better than nothing.

Helmets certainly don't make cycling less safe, nor do laws mandating them.Sure does http://i.imgur.com/kod2Q0i.jpgThe colder it is , the more badass you lookIt definitely is nice for what I could afford. I put new tires on mine as well. I'm waiting til grad school is over to get a new bike, although I'm not entirely sure which beams to choose.Ha. Thats what my girl said too. She would see my head turn and worried I was staring a some woman, and it turns out I was checking out a bike.Exactly. You spin about at about 12mph. From that speed, stopping in a safe distance can be easily done in any of three ways: you can either spin down, foot jam, or jump off. Maguras hydro rim brakes. Sheeeeet.It's an Origin8.

No KOM on Strava, but great views, new routes, roadside rabbits, an attention-seeking monkey, bamboo groves, cherry blossoms, heavy breathing, and gritting teeth. Shhhh. Taiwan's a cycle-climbing paradise.How do you people do this?

I frequently use 60 as a reason to stay inside.Bollocks, do you wear a helmet in the shower? or driving a car?
do you wear a sock under your condom? - just to be extra safe?Yes we do, Cycling fell in Australia by 36% when MHL's were introduced. Cycling rates for minors was 80% pre law, it's now 5%.
People who say it won't effect ridership are lying. Ridership in Australia has increased slightly since, but has not kept up with population growth. Safety in numbers for cycling is also well documented.Well, in the video he witnesses the thief taking the wheel off of the delivery bike. He wasn't just suspicious. It says that in the first 30 secs of the video... No need to get all defensive. UP TO YOU SONSOFWORVAN :^) That basically describes any food place in Manhattan that does bike delivery.    What specs specifically are you interested in? I haven't weighed it yet but I believe it's around 15-16 lbs. This is NYC.  He could buy a shit beater bike for about $50 off craigslist any time of the day if he actually wanted a bike.    I call bullshit.
The rate of head injuries fell by 29% but the number of cyclists fell by 36% Cycling has NOT "become more popular" it has increased at a rate less than the growth rate. The helmet law has killed cycling in Australia. In the 80's the percentage of children riding bikes was 80%, it's now 5%. Mandatory helmet laws are not good for anybody, they are a worse than useless pretend solution.
When helmet laws came in I watched everybody I knew stop riding.
It has taken something wonderful away from millions of people,
and replaced it with sanctimony and ugly plastic hats, while making it more dangerous for those of us left. Those who push for MHL's are either misinformed or evil.That is the most rad thing I have seen in a long time. Being on a trainer and having someone observe how you pedal is incredibly useful in optimizing your form. You tend to not know what bad habits you have unless someone just tells you.Ahh...ok yes. Now I recognize it. Lower Big T really is awesome. Upper Big T is equally awesome. Head up to Newcomb's Ranch or even better, all the way to Cloudburst some day too. Major adventures to be had up there. Happy cycling!Cars are hulking behemoths, clog up every road in Houston, and run in a place dominated by automobile privilege and automobile-centric rules and perspectives. They bring incessant, daily death and destruction to other users of the road and to themselves as well. Bicycles are the minority, and are especially vulnerable. How else do we bring better attention to the issue? http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2wml00/you_guys_told_me_i_couldnt_make_a_mini_velo_out/Dude I love my chrome. I first fell in love with them when I was visiting my uncle in Seattle. He lent me his old bike messenger bag to keep my shit dry since it's waterproof. Anyway I ended up visiting a chrome store and was drooling over the pricey bag but really couldn't justify dropping the cash. Go home and tell him about the awesome chrome store. I wanted to get some panniers and a backpack but the cost was holding me back. Turns out his backpack that I was using was a chrome bag and has been holding up for 9+ years. Bought this [one.](http://www.chromeindustries.com/us/en/bags/backpacks/pawn) Never looked back.Thanks Man really appreciate it! This isn't Thick Bikes in Pittsburgh is it? u/stayyposii?Whoa I'm in Gwinnett too. You guys are actually my lbs believe it or not. Don't worry I won't out you on here haha. Might have to make an excuse to swing by tomorrow now.Average speed means nothing. 18 mph solo is fast if you ride 40 miles with 8000ft of climbing.

Anyway, even if someone thinks that 18 mph on a flat is fast, a power meter can help them tremendously with a good training plan. Haha I just started venturing in there, and absolutely love it. I like taking Big T up and the 2 back down. This is on the 2 before you reach the turnoff for Wilson, specifically that huge "platform" like turnout where there are lots of donut tire tread marks. As an avid cyclist of the Angeles Forest/Crest area, you have me totally stumped as to where this is. Is that Wilson or Lukens in the BG?In that price range, you can't go wrong with Ultegra 6800 hubs laced to something like Stans 400 rims. 32 or 36 all around, go for round single butted spokes (Sapim Leader or DT Swiss Champion).

I also am a huge fan of running 28mm tubeless tires, like the Hutchinson Sector.Or, it could inform people that the intersection where it happened is dangerous, leading to stronger community support for safer infrastructure, which eventually means safer riding.I'm thinking late 70's, maybe 80-81. Doubt it's much later. The lack of braze-on bits is the big clue.

Downtube vs stem shifters aren't really an age thing. It's more an indicator of the target market. They only generally used them on lower end bikes, as the assumption was that newbie cyclists would be riding more on the tops. They usually go hand in hand with the auxiliary brake levers. Bikes that were being aimed at more experiences cyclists rarely used either. What this guy says. If your rear wheel really needs replacing, then it's only when replacing the hub that it becomes a little awkward as the new one needs to be compatible with old 6-7 speed cassettes and narrower axle spacing.

Anyway such hubs can still be bought but your shop just didn't want to deal with possibly building you a new rear wheel or honestly thought it couldn't be done. Both are bad.We have jack shit for snow this year like the whole rest of the west coast.Yeah the last LBS I purchased from went out of business five months later. So much for the free tune-ups an 10% off gear purchased that was part of the sales pitch.Yeah I think its 7 then 2 in the front. Its a solid bike just needs a bit of TLC and a more fit rider. But I guess that'll come with timeMore pictures!Ah. Yuengling. Hell yeah.Except that bike helmets are designed for impacts you'd get from falling *off* a bike.

They aren't designed for high-speed collisions.They definitely are! consider upgrading your brake pads as well while you're at ithttp://www.merlincycles.com/fulcrum-quattro-wheelset-2015-58465.html  - this is an amazing wheelset. I'm incredibly happy with them so far. 1750g isn't incredibly light- but they're bombproof and are a light year better than the 36 spoke open pro's I was using.

So 280$ for the wheelset, and then you can get some great tires to go with as well as a cassette for your rear for an extra 120 total- hit 400 and have enough for some new gloves.

having an extra wheelset around is amazing. Flats in the morning won't slow you down at all!

Enjoy the shopping!
CheersI thought it was in hours at first. I was impressed. Definitely go for a second opinion. There are plenty of bike shop folks that have absolutely no clue when it comes to bikes more than a couple of years old. Most are really reluctant to admit that though.

I had one wrench tell me that he didn't think he could legally sell me brake pads, because the bike was too old and crappy. Liability, etc.  This was on a nearly full Campy bike...Tandem riding is awesome, and needs a separate hour count. 2 hours a week.In med school, play hour of call of duty every day while on the trainer. Helps keep the sanity- so 7 hours a week.&gt; Again if you lived in Houston it would make more sense why I get so heated. There are a lot of commuters to downtown that don't want to vote to spend money on public infrastructure because it doesn't directly effect them because they take their cars to work every morning.

That's all of us man, very few cities actually take cycling seriously. It's not just related to Houston.That doesn't mean that someone isn't. Just because the PR person tells the media and this organization that they wont take them down doesn't mean that some dude way down on the totem pole in the roads department didn't get the memo.That's awesome man, congratulations on healing and enjoy the heck out of your new ride!Looking at the picture, it appears to be a 6 or 7 speed freewheel.  That's (IIRC) 126mm rear dropout width.

If the frame is steel, it could be spread to 130mm, which is a new hub.

If it's not steel, then you need a 5 or 6 speed freewheel-compatible hub.  They still make them.

Find a new shop.I mean, riding Malden to Boston already seems like a death trap to me, so not too much more risk... Maybe I don't know the right routes.What's that remind me bot?  I'll post up my recipe next week when I'm back at a desktop.  It's not the cheapest or easiest to source all the ingredients but works well since I don't have access to a shower at work.

FWIW my recipe is just a modified DIY baby wipes recipe, just in a spray form vs soaking the liquid into paper towels.  Baking soda gives it a little more anti odor punch and is a staple in DIY deodorants.  Nice build! Any specs? "A 23lb Deore equipped hybrid with a carbon fork, disc brakes and an Italian flag for only $650? Where's the catch?"
*(looks at photo)*
"Oh."I think they were saying I have an older version of axles or something that the gears don't attach to newer wheels the same way or something... I don't 100% remember does that say reasonable at allYeah my buddy looked at it and loved the frame. So I have good feelings. Excited to get the wheels fixedYour shop dudes are full of shit. That's an old but seemingly high end Allez, if the lugged carbon frame is any indication. As long as the frame isn't suspect it's a nice bike and definitely worth riding. As others have said 700c wheels are easy to fix or replace.Phew. Didn't think you were gonna make it for a second there.Thanks!Thanks.

I was shifting often, if only to see what specific wattage felt like in certain gears. It was pretty humbling to see my screen's numbers jumping all over, while everyone else's was varying mildly. I'll go early Monday, to possibly play around a little before class.

Again, thanks for your advice!I'm getting real sick and tired of Canyon's bullshit and not sending to the USA. Just shut up and take my money. When I was studying at ANU in Canberra the police would stand just outside the university grounds and fine students for not wearing helmets as soon as they rode past. if you think the borrower might sue you after a crash or not pay for damages he caused, then you shouldn't lend the bike to him.

If you are starting a bike renting business, then you should hire a lawyer to answer your question. Drunk people buy more bicycle stuff. I've tested this theory extensivelyFor a second I thought I was looking at my LBS, [Red Lantern](http://www.redlanternbicycles.com/) (first bike shop in New York to get a liquor license!) out here in Brooklyn. Then I noticed the nice lighting.This should be a movie posterDon't you mean Alaska?This is probably it.

I was adjusting the hub recently, but now watching YT videos on how to properly adjust, I think I may have been making too drastic a change.

It seems like if they are too tight, that you need to make just the smallest adjustment.I already wear a helmet, so whatever, but required reflective clothing?  Fuck that.  Most of my kit is black.

I hope this bill dies.You would be surprised how well a regular wipe down and lube can go.well first make sure your wheel is tightened on enough. It can be hard to tell with pegs. If its not that you need to rebuild your hub. if you have a bike coop get them to look at it and tell you if its worth doing. sometimes its easier to just get a new wheel.I'd take that bet any day. Ooooh. Me too! I'm in SmyrnaI don't know why everyone is giving you the worst case scenario. The hub may just be loose.

Yes you *might* need new bearings, but most of the time the cones just need to be tightened. If this is the case it can be fixed in five minutes.Dont recall the name. It was some shop I found on google near me. It was a few months back[No sir, I don't like it....](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTM4KkBQKRO0Tek8LZtzukskCzAppQ5vbAz7zTYtNJHuDCYe1_q)What bike shop did you go to?Its really no small thing though. Nice stuff.Relationships in America are impersonal, petty, and bizarre.Hell, I'm not even worried about trying to place any better. It's kinda like with speakers, right? Huge gulf between a $500 speaker and a $1000 speaker. Not much difference between a $1k speaker and a $100k speaker. I'm trying to find that sweat spot. why? Are we running out of carbon!

holy crapExactly. I passed by one today on my way to the bike shop on Westheimer and it didn't click until a block later that it was a memorial to someone who had been hit and killed while bicycling. Too bad not all countries have it as good as Netherlands when it comes to biking right?no, I'm just saying just don't ride under snow because it seems inherently unsafe. You should do it though, and take your bad attitude with you.only Giant really comes close to Canyon for value.  If you have no issues then the Canyon is better value.  Canyon do have a lot of group choice.  In the case of a frame failure within warranty, unless you do all the work yourself, the unbuild/rebuild costs and the process of warranty service easily even itself out.  I am sure that Canyon are great bikes - Would like one myself one day.Right on! Well no pressure or anything. We still haven't figured out our itinerary quite yet, but if were in the area, I'll let you! Thanks again! Love me some Hunter S Thompson hyperboleI currently have the stock wheels that came with the bike DT Swiss 3.0.  You dont think $500 is enough to see any noticeable upgrades?  From what I read wheels are the best thing to upgrade on your bike. i am amazed how many people are happy to prop up their new bike on a stick for a photo.

nice bike btw60% biking modal share here; cars rank fourth. Almost everyone can.I put together a lot of parts and built a bike based from a 1970s townbike. It cost about 100 in total, and while it would be cheaper to buy a whole bike, it was a lot of fun and something I felt proud of.

I ended up using the bike to get to and from uni for 3 months before it was stolenI've not seen people this thick for a long time!
A heavier rider has more momentum therefore less affected by wind resistance and friction obviously. Also if your wheels are heavier the hold more energy when rotating at the same speed and are therefore harder to slow down than light wheels. (angular momentum) There is no significant advantage to a light bike. Even when you go up hill and a heavy bike you end up with a bike that's easier to ride downhill, so that's not as significant as people think. There is only two forces against the bike and rider, friction and air resistance. When you are heavier you have a larger reluctance to stop through forces.
So never ride a bike unless on a nice, safe, designated paved bike trail.It varies depending on who is running the store. Even though official policy is not to bribe them some Starbucks I've worked at give them free drip coffee, and some give them any drink they want. I've seen a cop get huffy when we tried to charge for his wife's drink, and it was his day off! One cop got a free quad mocha every night before his shift, and he paid it forward every year around Christmas. He'd give us his sbux gift card loaded with $100 or so, and we'd use it to pay for everyone's drinks while he sat in the lobby until it ran out.

I don't remember if they started offering a military discount, but I've had people ask for one when they weren't the one serving in their family. Sbux does offer a free small coffee if you say you're a vet on veterans day, but if you ask for a different drink they'll give it to you anyway.Love it! It's the best looking bike that I know of and has a solid, comfortable rideYup I'm really looking forward to it
...

... What kind of bike is that?Well it's great that you can manage that. Almost everyone else can't. That's why people have cars. What wheels do you currently have? Mavic Ksyrium Equipe and Shimano Ultegra are both good, durable wheels in that price range, but might not be a whole lot better than what you already have. Most entry-level wheelsets are pretty bomb-proof. You could get a set of Shimano RS-11's for under $200 that will probably last forever.Problem is few people driving by know what it means.  yep.. if you sell it, you gotta have a liquor license.  Free beer is awesome for customers :)I remember in elementary school (like 7-8 years old maybe) they had these snow plow things that would shoot the snow upwards at an angle, which was really useful for cleaning out snow in an outdoor hockey rink (to get the snow over the boards). So the outdoor recess lady wasn't outside one day, and there was a snowplow cleaning out the rink. This is in the upper-mid west in the winter and the snow already was about a foot high around the rink.

All of the kids were gathering around the rink waiting for the snow to fly over the boards and fly on top of them. We'd wait for it to come by and start running to see if we could outrun the snow because it was fun as fuck and because adrenaline and we're also stupid, fearless little kids. Anyway, the snow came down and fucking smacked me in the head and I fell straight sideways. Then I started getting buried by snow - it just kept piling on top of me. It was the scariest moment of my life because while the snow was piling I couldn't move and panic struck. After it was over, I somehow managed to climb my way up to my feet and out of the snow.  After collecting myself, I patiently waited for the snowplow to come around again for round number 2... because, you know, scary is fun and I'm a dumbass 8 year old. Looking back though, someone definitely could have died.
I've had this, you need ether a new wheel or some poor mechanics whole day to fix this. The rear axle is broken, (probably caused by off center brake pads) and needs to be replaced. Best option is to save money and just to get a new wheel as fixing this by hand is gonna be a lot of effort.
Why does cycling and beer go so much together?Thanks, I'll go get it looked at at another shop this weekend :)"I refuse to die stupidly" Being somewhat familiar with what is often referred to as OCD, I'm curious, why?Seattle, also Portland"I refuse to tip toe through life only to arrive safely at death." You were given a load of nonsense. That bike is fine, those are almost assuredly 700c wheels, and you should be able to learn how to true them at your local bike co-op, or have them trued for you for not very much money at a better LBS. If they're so bent that they need to be replaced, a basic 700c wheelset can be bought online for not very much money.

I would avoid that bike shop going forward.they definitely dont spin straight (not sure on the term) Do  you think maybe it was just a shop trying to take advantage of me? should I get a second opinion? Also im riding streets, but in LA so lots of bigger cracks/bumps should I look into thicker tires? etc. Yup. Though sometimes, I use my other bike.To get in a vehicle that could murder someone everyday and not demand greater rules is the embarrassment of you drivers. You are happy to see the carnage and continue driving(for pleasure/profit). I am generalizing because vehicles kill more people than pretty much anything. Easy call.lol I wager that life is more awesome than death It's a [Pace 4216](http://www.pacecycles.com/?page_id=38). It is indeed a steel frame but very lightweight. The joins between the corners on the frame are lovely and seamless and it rides like a dream.

[Here it is the right way up](http://i.imgur.com/F8b59ko.jpg)That would be way less awesome.Yes. Usually the repair kit would have the cones and the ball bearings. If you're going to do  it yourself, you have to take the hub apart so you can tell what parts you're going to need.Are Catalan invited too?Would a bike shop have the bearings or whatever else I need or would I need to order special parts? You shouldn't be, but it never hurts to have insurance. (This may be covered by your auto or renter's insurance policies.)Whatever happened  with this?That was my old hood. Those delivery guys are mostly immigrants that work like dogs through new york's muggy sticky summers and it's freezing slushy winters. They avoid being run down on the daily so people can have their food delivered hot. That man is a piece of shit, I hope he does some time.&gt; low-population territory

I'm not going to say that this one example is authoritative but Australia has plenty of population to draw any conclusions you want from.THat's all you need if you're a crackhead and you need your next hit.

It's actually better than stealing a whole bike, or doing other stuff like burglary or robbery... because they know most people (including the police) will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing anything about it/giving a flying fuck.

And you still get your stolen property/drugs, etc.
Those are probably 700c wheels. I find it odd that the shop couldn't fix those wheels as they don't look too banged up. Usually a good truing will do the job.There is an Amish* family near here that shows up at farmer's markets with 4 generations from great grandpa on down riding simple bikes with [bucket panniers](http://www.google.com/search?q=bucket+panniers&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1uXnVOmDFqqIsQTU4oCACQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=671). Some have the buckets front and rear on both sides, some have only a bucket or two depending on age and ability. The amount of produce they are able to pull out for sale from 6-10 bikes rivals the pickup truck farmers.

* I'm using the term "Amish" a little loosely here. They may or may not identify strictly in those terms. They might tell you that they are Annabaptists in the Mennonite, BIC or other traditions. I can't quite catch whether they speak low German or Dutch mixed with sorta Olde English. But their bikes are studies in simple utilatarianism.I would have been inclined to keep removing the snow so there's not a potential avalanche of death to ride underNah, it's clearly a Zune!You can do everything on your bike?WHERE?!Thanks man, I'll look it up! I got the brakes from a guy on Pinkbike so I'll see what's thereWell, let's see... I've got a bike?As someone who is 6'4" fuck that noiseOn the topic, in the same way it's good for motorists to hand an understanding of the vulnerability of cyclists, it's good for cyclists to have an understanding of the vulnerability of pedestrians. Cyclists often complain about cars passing too closely, without realising that they often do the same to pedestrians.

I'm not saying that cyclists or motorists do it deliberately (while some may), for the most part it's probably just lack of awareness of what it feels like to be the other mode.

In conclusion, everyone be considerate. It's good that you are, we should all try to be. God, those Longboard fenders are a bitch to get installed though. Did you do them yourself?[i played too much halo 3](http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x315/BTHR_Zero_X/Halo%203%20Easter%20Eggs/Multiplayer/Snowbound/SnowboundEECanadianDollar01.jpg)
You need to overhaul your rear hub. This park tools guide will explain how:

http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/hub-overhaul-and-adjustment

Park provides a list of tools that you'll need. Some of them aren't really fully necessary but properly sized cone wrenches and a proper bearing grease are absolutely required.Lol'ed at the Cop 1 and Cop 2 casting.Can you make a more instructional post on this? It seems pretty interesting. Now, that's a bunch of fine columbus ladies!!
Back in the woods, having to see the trail and obstacles ahead at speed, I have no doubt you're spot on :) I'm just used to commuting around suburbs where 600 will blind the family at the dinner table when you ride past their house.The problem is here in LA we actually have hills. I hope OP has a flat commute, which is very possible given the size of the LA metro.Probably resting.  I broke plans and trained extra hard for the last 6 days in a row.thisLooks like the rear axle bearings went south. If you're doing the job yourself, you need to remove the wheel and disassemble the hub. It will require some special tooling (very thin wrenches) I just bought some at a cycle shop for ~ 10 USD. If you're lucky you'll get by replacing the ball bearings but there's likely to be some more damage in there. Won't know until you take it appart.Glad to hear Chrome products are lasting 5+ years. I switched my order from the Yalta over to the Russ Pope Barrage. Big fan of his art anyway. As an investment I feel that $200 CAD is more than worth a bag that will last me this long!

To the bro that said it's the same materials and stitching, well I don't think so. Chrome has higher quality materials listed for their USA bags and they're fully waterproof not just "weatherproof".  It also appears that you're paying for heavy duty buckles and straps as well as the signature metal seat belt buckle.

I'm Canadian and I have no problem with supporting the American employees building these tanks. Looking forward to receiving my Barrage.Nice work! It's the factory hydro hoses. I left it with the shop for a tuneup and rotor swap and cleanup, so we'll see if they thought it was unusual. The play doesn't bother me, but it's pretty embarassing to have that kind of looseness maybe 400mi out of the box.I think it's 54 pounds That Ultimate CF SLX is a thing of beauty. Very jealous, it's the bike I've been looking at for my next road ride. But hoping I can hold back until next year, when I hope I can get EPS instead of Record for under 4k all in.

Love the team colours one, Super Record EPS, Bora Ultras.....bike porn.....I'm "upgrading" my current wheelset by buying good hubs that should last for a long time with multi-use rims (I have a disc cross bike). So I got Chris king iso hubs with Stans Grails that I will set up tubeless eventually. This way my hubs will be useful for any bike I have (qr and thru axel) and I can just quiet about new runs when I really want to "upgrade" in the future. Again, not the lightest hubs by any means, but they should put live many bikes and can be built for any purpose in the future.One leg drills and really focusing on pedaling technique will help. Faster cadence too. Rollers really helped mine years ago but the other suggestions will get you there too That is true, but to generalize and say that "drivers are retarded by nature" is silly. It's just as silly as saying that all cyclist run red lights. The city of Denver itself in fact. As far as the city goes,  they said as long as we don't sell it we're golden.

Thanks man,  slow winter at the shop lead to a lot of looking into it.  We finished it and were super pumped on how clean it ended up. I actually don't drive. It is a joke how little enforcement is in place compared to how much crime happens by vehicles.I'm not sure why SRAM has apex still. I think they'll phase it out, as it seems neglected. It's funny that the wholesale difference in price between Apex and Rival shifters is maybe 3%. It seems like they're basically the same thing. The article said that the city said they wouldn't take them.Better yet, why would you not?I found a set of NOS maguras in a bike coop parts bin. I wanted to take them so bad but I have absolutely no use for them so I left them for someone else.

I regret that. Colorado? I clean the bike every week, the salt still gets all over the bike, in places that you would never think were vulnerable.It's never enough.. Braver guy than me. Wouldn't have much faith in that thing.

For parts have you tried any of the sale sections on forums?

Trials is a reasonably small discipline so you will find much less stuff for sale on sites like ebay. Guessing you are in the US looking at the brakes so maybe try over on [OTN](http://www.observedtrials.net/vb/)
Why would I?Yeah seriously! I've done a lot of singletrack riding with that setup and it definitely works well, but it's a good idea to carry a spoke wrench if you plan on getting gnarly.Dude, I'm with you, this is awesome.This time of year between 3-5 hours a week on the bike. Mostly on the trainer. Maybe ~1 hour total on /r/bicycling. Zones don't matter. Wattage is just power output. If you don't have a consistent cadence and change gears a lot, your wattage will vary a lot, because you will be varying the amount of power you're putting out every time you change.

If you want a better idea of what a particular wattage feels like, regardless of cadence or gear, use a trainer with an ERG mode that will let you choose a target wattage, and then adjusts the resistance in relation to what you're doing to maintain that wattage target.

Also as /u/kinboyatuwo mentioned, if you're seeing an instant and not averaged wattage readout, the numbers are going to bounce around a lot.

So the tl;dr: practice riding smoothly and consistently if you're worried about wattage output over extended periods of time.Don't make your own taco shells,  just buy nasty pre-made ones? My mother would throw a chancleta at me. 4-7 in winter, 7-12 in summer.

i notice everyone overlooked your second question.  i spend probably 30 mins/week on /r/bicycling.  but 28 mins of that is spent downvoting pointless pics.If we were crafting public health policy, seat belts or condoms or construction hard hats, we would need more data than a single study from a low-population territory of a foreign nation 30 years ago.

Cyclists are marginalized &amp; the lack of a respectable body of facts about our transportation certainly doesn't help any of us.

I'm not calling anyone wrong, despite my strong opionions, I just think we deserve a straight answer about what a helmet law would actually do. MTBs have different geometry, flat handlebars, can fit much larger tires, and usually come with front suspension forks.The point wasn't the 'blinding' effect of hazard lights but the 'attention grabbing' effect.  They blink to get your attention, which is why people want blinky front and rear lights.I usually get "it's very green". My bike is to be appreciated by non-enthusiasts.I usually get "it's very green". My bike is to be appreciated by non-enthusiasts.Hope your bike didn't suffer for your chesting :PBut it feels so good on the quads. I'm not talking about straight-like my spine in line with the seat tube--I'm talking about 45 degree or less, but with back straight.iPod mini.We did a bit of one legged drills, which showed my weaknesses clearly - very squary, esp left. :/ I need more trainer time, I suppose?How many lbs.I hate to sound like a square but how was the permitting/zoning/city whatever for something like this?

Very cool and really clean set up!!Been there.On any bike straight back is not a good posture It's definitely interesting riding here. There's not a lot of open road, but city riding is always an adventure of avoiding hitting pedestrians and battling cars for space!  The bridges are pretty awesome to ride over too!  &lt;3Not at all. I go for 'fast cadence' by feel. I'll get a cadence sensor this weekend. Should I be maintaining 80+ even in zone 5 and higher? Our shop's in Gwinnett.  Stop by any time!  I'll pm you the shops name if ya wanna stop by.
Edit: I don't wanna give too much info awayyou texans..Tried this in my apartment, but my bike doesn't fit. Does nobody in America have a sense of humour any more?Where in GA? Atlanta resident here, I might stop by some time if I'm in the area.Thanks for the really nice pic  :)

Wandering around a cold, snowy city for the first time would be pretty interesting. It's going on the list....Though I'll attribute more value to it if you are female.#####&amp;#009;

I do basic maintenance and the occasional bath. It's all cheap stock parts and so far it's been fine.

Here's the ol' Scat Taint when this winter finally got started some... https://instagram.com/p/xhEAgyFEOZ/?modal=trueNeither? You shouldn't be straight up, but you also shouldn't be fully supported by your hands/wrists/arms. I think Australia is a pretty good example of how mandatory helmet laws decrease ridership.nah, just needs a bath or a good rain.Yeah those mud guards look nice - what are they?I made the mistake of mopping my floors last weekend... They look just as shitty 1 week later as they did for the last 4 months before the mop lol. Our hero of the week. What kind of bike is this? You've got some nice wheels paired with what looks to be an older steel frame. What else do you have on there? I like it!After a day or two on the ground, the snow becomes "snirt" (snow + dirt).7 to 10.Oh I assume the maintenance would have to be pretty thorough, but I more meant that you wouldn't be rolling around on your pride and joy in that stuff.

Snow looks so nice from here (Aus), but living with it daily, mashed into the streets with dirt/oil and salt really takes the shine off it I bet.Have you considered cables? Housing?
I've heard nothing but good things about the cx1 hardware but apparently its a pain to get it setup right.

Either that or RMA the shifter?Careful - You can die this way. Currently between 9 and 14 depending on schedule/races/etcThis man deserves some gold. I have none :(Okay, but that doesn't mean that police should start punishing people who haven't done anything wrong.I wish mine were still that white, gratz on some amazing shoesThats cool, But also VERY dangerous. If the snow were to collapse on you, itd be a very hard time getting out. Just have fun and be safe!~10 hours per week in the summer. 6-8 in the winter.Sort of.  My winter ride is a 19 year old Giant Rincon bought new in the spring of '96.  It's well maintained though and gets preventive maintenance pretty much weekly in this sort of weather.  The only original parts left on it are the handlebars and the frame itself.I'm not insulting the bike, I'm just remarking that it's impressive that people in the past rode around on dangerous machines, including on the track.  Nope,  I'm in GA.  I do have family in PA and have been to the yuegling  brewery in Pottsville. Ewwwwww, you need fenders.[Not as much as I'd like, but getting better](http://i.imgur.com/vlmk2hd.png).&gt; Riding is safer when more people ride. Helmet laws discourage riding

These are both very repeated maxims with a very little supporting evidence &amp; wish people would start to say 'the theory is that...' or something.

You don't *know* if helmet laws would discourage riders or how many riders would have to quit before drivers' stopped expecting them.

Its a theory &amp; should be treated as such. God forbid they pass the law with a sunset clause &amp; actually collect data like responsible adults. More lube needed in the bottom bracket?Ah!

That one needed forcing out. Thanks a lot! Here is the [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2mqcgm/my_bicycle_collection_as_named_by_my_girlfriend/) to the post that has them all. I've replaced the Giant Anthem with a Scott Genius.1) OP didn't say the light is mounted to the bike. I clip my rear light to my jersey pocket, although I've seen plenty of people with them on bags and such. Thanks for the snarky response though.

2) I was simply linking a possible option for easy-to-install fenders. Fenders do more than just protecting lights. Although something like [this](https://www.missionbicycle.com/store/home/gift/packable-rolling-fender) might help if OP wants something to keep road spray off a light mounted to the seatpost. You need shoe cover covers to keep those shoe covers clean.I think it took my ex a while to figure that out too.  To be fair lots of cute girls with good bike legs and lots of tattoos around here
 I know, that's why I said motorcycles not street bikes.  Yeah it's been a nightmare trying to find a replacement mod stem that will ship to me without costing an arm and a leg. I've taken reasonable drops though and knock on wood haven't gotten fucked yetI was making a juvenile flax/constipation relief joke :/

The frame looks awesome though Buy a used one. New ones are not good in your price range.I was gonna post there but the place seemed dead :/Are you in PA??  Thanks for looking out for your fellow riders!Beautiful shoes!I was about to say the same thing, that's a lot of snow that could collapse.It all depends on the conditions of the bikes I suppose Haha,  pretty much.  We're already the only  mom and pop shop around so this just adds to our "charm". Army/Navy surplus usually have a lot of cheap bags.  Some even have sewn-in boards to keep the back flat.  Just drill and bolt in relevant hooks and a strap and you've got a set of diy for cheaps.  If interest I can upload a pic of mine.Oh yeah they did that here too but for specifically DD accidents on a specific section of highway. The sign decreased the amount of car deaths dramatically. Not an internal dynamo. You can see it near the top of the front wheel. It's the internal disc brakes or whatever you call them in English. I agree that if you don't want to wear a helmet you shouldn't be forced to wear one. That being said, it's because I think people who don't wear helmets when engaging in an activity that could end in a head injury should probably be thinned out a bit. Roval rapid40 clThanks man... If only they ran in 42! Cheers.I have had the Citizen for about 2 and a half years,use it every day in all weathers and it still looks new. Keeps everything dry including my laptop that I have the chrome case for and also straps into the bag very well.

10/10 would buy again, will probably never need to!In the case of road bikes, I don't think this is quite true.

For old mountain bikes, yes, an '80s mountain bike is more a piece of nostalgia and recreational riding than something to really go crazy on (though it may still be worth restoring for personal reasons - some did have some hella rad paint jobs).

Road bikes, however, are a technology that's been refined continuously since the 1900s.  In fact, I'd argue that you get 90% of the functionality of a modern road bike with a bike as old as the 1960s.  The geometry was still designed to be fast, the wheels were still designed to be thin, the gear range was designed for speed, the bars were still curly, and often they're pretty fuckin' fast.  I've gotten shit on here for giving my '75 Grand Prix too much love, but I can really get that bike to move!

Whether OP is going to throw all new components on this bike or just get the original-quality stuff working, they're very well worth putting money into as long as they make the rider happy for (generally, I'm sure there are masochists out there) non-professional racing and anything more casual than that.

The only issues are part condition (if it's been severely neglected), and sometimes finding parts designed to older standards.  27" wheels are actually a boon in some cases because they're super inexpensive for someone who only wants a freewheel, but on the other hand, a French-threaded bicycle can be a nightmare.

We will not see the end of these awesome bikes until the last hipster gets hit by a Crown Vic in Chicago and destroys the last vintage frame in existence.  lol wow. On Illinois highways they list the number of people killed in auto accidents this year on overpass tickers.Yup, it does. Straight from Wiggle "benefits such as independent "reach adjust" for both shift and brake levers."There's only three frames in existence at the moment, one of which is built up and he rides around on. I've not spent any real time on it but there is no undue flex in the bottom bracket, although these ones all have full Ti chain stays. It's fairly light, not super light, maybe 1.6kg from memory, although I believe the Ti in these lugs is plain gauge.

He's been riding bamboo for over five years and swears this stuff is the most comfortable ride ever. It just soaks up road noise.  That seatpost collar matches the hubs and the pedals though.
And it's backwards because that's how you clamp carbon.1-2 hours a day on my bike in the summer months, daily.Yep. Learn to pedal smooth circles. I can float my power +\- 20 watts pretty stable.  If you are pedaling squares and rocking your body.

Side note is if it's showing instant and not a 3 sec average it's hard depending on how it is reading the data. Larry Miller summed-it-up nicely:

Women say they have sexual thoughts too. They have no idea.
It's the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it.
If they knew what we were really thinking, they'd never stop
slapping us.

Still doesn't stop me from being annoyed by my fellow males acting the fool.well this guy obviously has issues.It's like NFL coaches tell rookie wide receivers about touchdown celebrations:  Act like you've scored a touchdown before.  Act like you'll score one again.

Act like you've spoken to a woman other than your Real Doll before.  Act like you'll speak with one again.
I'll probably just end up buying the Garmin eventually. For now the spotty computer will have to do. I've got a canyon road bike, no need to service your self, i still take mine to my lbs to get it serviced.FWIW, in contrast to the zeroloss on the shifter, I have a TON of deadzone play on my new CX1 brake levers. I love SRAM's shifting design, but the build quality is not amazing.I'm a Gringo/Septic and I know what it is.Depends on how much business the stores get, my local lbs wouldn't give a huge discount or free servicing, they get a lot of trade, so no need to.Well I think it looks fine, gets the job done, and we already voted on the design. They will probably tweak some things in finalization but to make some grand changes would kind of piss me off. Kind of like every time I vote for a politician and they decide to say fuck all to everything they said while campaigning. I already voted. The design has been seen and ranked. To change it now would be a slap in the face.  You can't please everybody anyway. Somebody is going to not like something about it. Yeah he keeps trying to have sex with my roommate Does Apex have adjustable reach on both lever and paddle? I don't recall having one of those on my Apex shifters.Ghost bikes aren't the solution, they are a symptom of a real problem in this city, which is lack of bike infrastructure in a city where more people are biking every year.
Am I saying that I'd be happiest with a ghost bike at every corner? No because that's absurd. What I'd like is for the problem to not be ignored.

Again if you lived in Houston it would make more sense why I get so heated. There are a lot of commuters to downtown that don't want to vote to spend money on public infrastructure because it doesn't directly effect them because they take their cars to work every morning. So... how smoothly does it run? You're going to be the most popular bike shop in town now!Lately?  4 or 5.  It's kind of bleak.  At more enthusiastic times maybe 10-15.  I don't do much at work.  Maybe I'll do a couple loops in my downtime for funsies tonight.You seem like a sociopath.Dude, fuck off.

The only person creating drama here is you.If you want a durable taillight, this is definitely the way to go. L&amp;M makes very high quality products. Unlike many cheap plasticky lights, the Vis 180's made out of metal and a bit of solid plastic on the lenses. I have a [full review of it here](http://www.bikelightdatabase.com/light-and-motion/vis180/) if anybody's interested, it has some videos of the flash modes, battery life graphs, and a bunch of pictures.about 2 hours per weekday, plus 6-10 on weekends.  Call it an even 15-20 on an average week. Pretty poor output for the price on that bontrager taillight.My boyfriend actually did just this thing about a month ago. He went to our local bike shop with a budget of $400 and got himself a road bike, biked home with all the parts for it tied to his back with tubes/in his bag, and assembled it. It's a ss with a flip-flop hub so if you wanted gears your price point may be a bit higher, but it was a great learning experience for him and he loves riding fixed now. The frame is aluminum, no idea what brand, nice wheels + tires, handlebars. He already had a Brooks saddle for it.

One caveat: I'm not an expert (haven't built my own bike yet but I plan to in a month or so!) so forgive me if I misspeak here, but there was one thing he couldn't do himself at home. I believe it had something to do with the hub? The shop did it for him but left the rest of the bike unassembled. The only reason he didn't do it himself is because we don't have the tool. Wish I could remember specifically what it was, but yeah. Building your own bike is totally feasible on a poor person's budget! Hook up with your LBS, tell them your budget and that you want to build as much of it on your own as you can. It's quite a long winded and expensive process that I don't fully understand, but if you take the fibrous matter from the flax plant, through various treatments you can compress it and make a sheet that is then rolled into tubes and can be epoxied into the lugs. The tubes in the prototype have walls about 4mm thick. The new tubes with carbon are about 2mm. I do have a Giant partner store down the road and a Cannondale one not too far away either, two brands I'd look at....also Specialized, but I can't fathom a way of getting a discount+free servicing that would out do the value of Canyon.

Any other bike ideas in the similar price range? I know it's a jump, but if the values there and it's absolutely worth it for what I'm planning to do on it, I'm happy to go above a 1000, like for the Grand Canyon SLX. But I don't expect to taking trails serious for a while yet.Nothing lasts, nothing is perfect, nothing is finished. Embracing wabi-sabi males life a lot easier, especially with things that by nature will wear and age. It's not like synthetic tape doesn't darken and discolor too, it's just the nature of the thing.I don't mind them --they don't scare me or creep me out-- but I don't believe they belong in public spaces and I don't think anyone has a reasonable excuse to be upset when an unauthorized memorial installed on public property gets removed.No money on top?I was just typing a bit as you were replying :)I'm not sure of your point.

My point was that I saw someone who I thought had stole a bike (two of them actually). Sort of like our guy on the video. It's pretty common for people to take their front tire with them where I live. So the guy filming doesn't really know if the guy stole the tire. He was just suspicious. Bike thefts are also common here as we have a pretty large homeless population that tend to hoard these things and we have a lot of cyclists and a lot of bike thefts occur. I ride by a greenway where a lot of homeless camp and its common to see guys with one bike who have like 6 front tires. Did they steal them? Who knows. Is it likely? You tell me. Just like it's common to see homeless people pushing around baby carriages full of their possessions. Now, if they have money to buy a baby carriage you would think they would just buy something more practical, but there I go making assumptions again.

Maybe you can read between the lines?

Maybe you can give me the benefit of the doubt when I write I knew it was very likely he stole both of them? I don't often see a guy in dirty street clothes who "looks" homeless riding an expensive road bike that doesn't fit him while awkwardly steering another expensive road bike and looking generally sketchy in an area of town where bikes get stolen every day.

Or maybe you can be self-righteous about the whole thing?

Up to you Mountainslayer. I did give that guy a pass anyway and I regret it.That looks dangerous. lolHaving the mobile app helps so much for that. I run Zwift on my laptop, and it's far enough away that I can't easily reach the keyboard. I have an iPad mounted on a microphone stand more or less right next to my bike so I don't have to change position all that much to like... get rid of those damn breakaway burritos.

And to echo your sentiment, Zwift is totally a game changer for trainer usage.So I'm working with this guy who's an eco composites engineer. He was a pioneer of the bamboo bike scene in the UK and has developed a process for making tubing out of flax.

It has a similar tensile strength and flex to bamboo but in his words is "more predictable" to work with.

He's just had the prototype back from EN testing (it passed) and he's now done a second set of tubing with thinner walls and a sandwich layer of carbon in for those who want extra stiffness.

The lugs are titanium and were fabbed by Hi-Light, who build the Van Nicholas frames. The test frame is modelled on the geo of the Baum Corretto.

It's got a lovely organic look under the lacquer that somehow looks more refined than bamboo.

Any of you guys in London, UK, in March/April can come see it in the flesh/plant matter if you like!

Tell me more, I'm intrigued.Hey fellow FlanThanks I'll check it out.I doubt the Anise would be okay with it, but who knows? It also says that they were taken from "higher crime areas" so it could just be regular vandalism which isn't uncommon in this city. YES!!!!You don't see white cars left out at bad intersections where people have been killed. I mean, I kinda get the thought process behind it I just think it's a little misguided. /u/unpickle summed it up best in [their comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2wkw8p/ghost_bikes_are_being_removed_in_houston/corudq6)I'm new(ish) to the sub so I can't comment on time spent here, but right now I'm at 5-7hrs a week in the winter. Hoping I can rack up a lot more hours/miles a week once it's no longer a frozen hellscape outside. Canyon's are great bikes, but just remember you can get a hell of a lot more out of a bike brought from an LBS than initially advertised. Most LBS' give away ~10% on all 2015 bikes, be it with an offer of free goods or under the table discounts away from the manufacturers noses. You just need to ask. With this, you also get all the benefits of free servicing and easy warranty issues.I get crazy buildup on my cantilever brake arms whenever the snow is sticky. Maybe I need bigger fenders. Yep, this has been our life all winter. Three bikes, one tiny bathroom. Usually around 10. 100-150 milesI own a match cycle Paramount from 1998, their 60th anniversary model if memory serves correctly. Lugged Reynold 853, probably my dream bike, especially since I have been able to slowly upgrade it through the  time I have owned it. I have easily put 20,000 miles on it and it's still an amazing ride.
Possibly might need cables. You can get a complete set of cables/cable housings from Walmart for $6.96. If it seems that the braking/shifting is harder that it should be, it may have corroded inside the housings.

Shogun made touring bikes about that time with triple front chain rings, a desirable thing that makes the bike a little more valuable.The article was kinda weird because the headline said "stolen" but I seriously doubt they're getting stolen. City is probably taking them down.It's just weight and finish really. Rival and Red both shift very well (as does Apex to be honest). Unless you are very poor and $425 would be irresponsible, I would get the Red. It is as good as road groupsets get. I would put it above Dura Ace and on par with top end Campagnolo (though I have only gone as far up as Chorus). These top end groupsets are not really functionally different from the tiers below, but they look boss and are light as hell.I still have one bike with HS-33 in the rear. No reason to change.

https://www.facebook.com/BostonBikePartyIf your bike is constantly getting covered in slush, make sure to take your seat post off before having it upside down like that. I forgot to take off my seat post a couple of months ago, and now it's stuck completely with the grit/rust/salt/sand ectThat was funny. :)It's been interesting to read the comments posted thus far; I've always appreciated the commemorative sentiment and artistic notions behind ghost bikes. It didn't occur to me that they could be perceived negatively for the reasons cited by other redditors. I live in the Bay Area but went back to NYC (where I lived for many years) not too long ago -- and saw a ghost bike near the Williamsburg Bridge along my former commuting route. For me personally, it made me feel closer kinship to the departed cyclist and our community. So while I was saddened by the memorial, I felt it as a touching gesture of camaraderie. But I'm glad to hear other perspectives as well.Adjustable reach goes as far down as Apex. Sram are pretty good about trickle down features.&gt; I saw a guy riding a bike while guiding another one a couple weeks ago and regret not at least calling the police about it.

I rode my girlfriend's bike once while bringing my own bike to the shop.  Did I steal both of them?  Or do I get a pass because I don't "look like a bike thief?"This is why I don't like wearing black in the winter.I dunno, I personally think there are a lot of folks that would be interested to learn which company's leaving you hanging after you've done the work.  Probably get them to pay what they owe you just to pull it down too to avoid the bad press.  It was Specialized, wasn't it?Are you keeping track of your cadence?I've heard that will still yellow with age though.Whoa, I didn't realize Google Image translate was a thing, thanks!Oh man, my Goodwill doesn't even carry pets, that dog is boss!  Sweet trainer too.6-7 hrs/wk commuting in the winter. With 42 km round trip commute and mountain biking I am guessing 10-15 hrs/wk in spring, summer, fall when I account for weekend mtb adventures.

I bet I spend about an hour a day reading and commenting on various bike sites and forums. It fuels the addiction.Yeah, but that little kid does have a good point.Oh man I feel you. Here in California it got down to like 62 F. My shoes get kinda dirty when I ride.Wet wipes. 5 hours for meWell, as terrible as it sounds and it is, he looked like bike thief in a part of my city you wouldn't expect to see him. That weighed on me too sort of like - "Um, self, you're totally profiling this guy based on race." It was later I realized I would have been suspicious of anyone.

I do believe that even if the cops showed up they couldn't have done anything. The guy could just say he bought the bike as gift from a stranger and paid in cash.Being as that dude was a bike thief, if he steals a bike that was only locked by the front wheel (as opposed to bike that was locked everywhere *but* the front wheel like in the video), he could put them together and make a whole bike to then do whatever with.[Dirt bikes](https://www.google.com/search?q=honda+dirt+bikes&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch) aren't street motorcycles.

But yeah, I'm sure DH bikes have come a long way since the 90s'.Holy hell, that looks nasty. I assume you guys all have winter only bikes that you don't care too much about?But if nobody bought stolen bikes then there's be no reason (or less reason) to steal them in the first place.

Chicken and egg, I guess. But if there's no market for stolen parts then people wouldn't bother stealing as many as they do, only people who need a bike to ride (which would be way, way less than are stealing now)Agree 100%. SPD cleats and double sided entry are great for around town ridesAwesome Maguras. I had to move a broken down bike to my buddies house via another bike in the past. The broken down one that was mine and the one I was riding was my dad's, but I had no way to prove that at the time.

I'm glad nobody did call the cops on me, but the thought that someone would never occurred to me.- Seatpost and handlebars/stem are easiest to remove/install when the wheels are on the bike and the bike is on the ground.

- Seatpost is easiest to remove with the saddle still attached.

There are some other quick tips but they're dependent on the type of bike/components you're working on. I'll usually strip everything off the frame, remove the BB and the fork/headset assembly too. lay everything on a clean table, and make sure to keep bearing assembly's in order.

 Polish up the frame real well and get all the grease out of the bearing races, BB threads and seat tube/headtube/etc. Go to the headset next, wipe old grease off the bearings and fork and races. If they feel shitty and roll bad go ahead and repack em with grease. reassemble the headset in the correct order and pop the fork back on, then put the stem on to keep it tight and in place.

Hit the BB next and do the same basic bearing maintenance, re grease it all and put it back in the frame. clean up the grease the crank spindle and chainrings then pop it back on the frame.

everything else is somewhat basic cleaning and then installing. I'd do the derailleurs first, then clean the cable for the brake and shifters. I like to run some chain lube in the shift cables to keep it smooth.

have fun! Bike maintenance can be extremely enjoyable.   Been there...Why is it overkill for commuting?Only a handful of brands do them, most with MTB style cleating systems. The ones I have are NorthWave Extreme Winter GTX Road Boots - http://www.wiggle.co.uk/northwave-extreme-winter-gtx-road-boots/

Had sidi ones before but didn't like them much. Used normal road shoes and overshoes for 3 years, now in my 3rd year of using a winter boot and it's fantastic.

They keep my feet warm and dry and they are easy to put on and take off.

I used them the other day in -4 degrees C with a basic sock and my feet were fine :)&gt;In a few urban areas, its just a normal way of getting around That's all cycling is too, if you let it. That's not to say you can't do it for fitness or sport if you want to.

 I commute 25 miles every weekday.  I don't even have a car. I understand the concept of "cycling as transportation." I really do.  And I'm telling you that riding around California without a helmet is stupid to the point of being negligent.  It's going to be years and years before the infrastructure--even in a place as far ahead of most of the US as California is--reaches the point where anybody should even consider riding without a helmet.

If people are going to be too stupid to protect themselves, it is the government's job to protect them from themselves.  That's why we have seatbelt laws, among other things. You're probably going to disagree with this sentiment.

At this point we're just shouting past each other, and I've got to go fix my bike's spoke so I can leave work without dragging my rear wheel across the brake rims all twelve miles home.Beautiful! How do you like it?Holy shit is that an adjustable stem? I hope you have dental insurance!That's absurd. I mean I live in a city with poor infrastructure so as a result pedestrians and bicyclists get hit by cars. Do you live in Houston? Do you know what it's like to live in the 4th largest city in the nation and most places don't even have sidewalks? So yeah I believe it is necessary.

I haven't brought my whole bike into the shower though I might when this winter is nearly over, but it's been my standard for tires if I swap them off the bike for a long time. Tires get horribly filthy in any circumstances and its nice to store them away clean, plus it makes sure no grit will hang around inside that might rub a hole in your tube later.Lol, that's not going to stop himWell my raw rugged sexuality can be a little unnerving at first but I make up for it with my rakish wit and unparalleled modesty.Too rich for my blood.Right foot un-clipper huh.

How fast did it get dirty?&gt; If people aren't going to protect themselves during an activity

This is exactly the mentality we need to avoid if we want to expand cycling. In many places in America just WALKING is "an activity". People drive to a paved MUP to walk. In a few urban areas, its just a normal way of getting around. That's all cycling is too, if you let it. That's not to say you can't do it for fitness or sport if you want to.

Sorry about your uncle but anecdote isn't a way to set public policy. That girl will almost certainly live a long and healthy life, in fact a longer one by staying active than she would if she drove because she didn't want to fuck up her hair.Thanks!

I think the thief was honestly intimidated by this dudes confidence. Meh - I think protection is what's important - make sure salt never gets through to metal that could corrode.  Rinsing *can* do more harm than good, washing salt into gaps.   Plus keep any grease-cutting cleansers away from the bike unless you're sure you're **very** comprehensive with re-oiling afterwards.

I've had no problems over the years by making sure a bike is well serviced before winter, liberal use of T-9 on corrosion areas, and just keeping an eye on things.  Oh, and long fenders...  My bike is pretty salty right now, and as usual I don't really intend to clean it until the salt's off the streets.  Steel bike with some cheap parts on it - either low end stainless and even some galvanized crap (liberally and regularly T-9'd), and it gets through fine.[A gravity lean rack](http://i.imgur.com/AMhOLXc.jpg), my landlord was very much against drilling any holes or leaning bikes against the wall.Yes I understand what salt does and how it works.

But you don't really have it right. They usually end up using more salt as it gets colder, not less. This is because salt becomes less effective as the temp drops but not completely ineffective (it doesn't become 100% ineffective until much colder than 15F [source](http://www.usroads.com/journals/p/rmj/9712/rm971202.htm). So therefore as the temp drops toward 0F you find them dumping more, not less salt to boost the effectiveness. They use sand as well, and as the temp drops they drop more sand of course, so maybe that's where you got confused.

But seriously, just go down any major thoroughfare in the city, see how it's like WET on the roads? Even though it's below freezing today? Yepp, salt. And minneapolis still uses plenty of it. You can see the salt pellets on the street. I'm here going, wait my bike is a rolling salt lick and you bike in downtown MPLS and thought we didn't use salt? Because that kinda blew my mind.

EDIT: [this is what I mean. That fender should be jet black.](http://i.imgur.com/2tWrJe4.jpg)Why not split the difference and get force?

Red is definitely delightful, and rival works just fine. Force is a healthy middle ground.

I use force and rival shifters , and I definitely notice a difference in feel. The weight difference isn't significant enough that I notice.

I personally think that it's worth splurging on shifters and rear derailleur, and going a step down on front derailleur. Dat teamworkTell me more about your winter boots with cleats.Don't you ask for partial payment up-front or in regular instalments on delivering milestones?still in beta so they're still adding more trainers. I'm guessing when it's complete, you should be able to use any trainer. Mind you that you'd need to buy a speed/cadence sensor as well to hook to your bike.&gt;Its a disincentive.

And?  If people aren't going to protect themselves during an activity, they shouldn't be doing it anyways.  Maybe this would **finally** get rid of the god-damned ninja-salmon who can't ride safely anyways.

&gt;Do you really think this girl needs to wear a helmet?

...did you miss the part where my uncle has brain damage?  **OF COURSE** I think she should be wearing a helmet.

Also, I don't know what magical fantasy version of California you're talking about, but it sure isn't the one I live in.  We've got some trails and a few bike-only roads, but they're nowhere near as widespread as you're implying, especially once you get outside of city centers.  What size is it?Not a bad idea!I mean the $10,000 Pinarello.Because a helmet mandate isn't good. It hurts cycling. Its a disincentive. The crash numbers don't even support it.

Helmets are great. Mandating that everyone wear one no matter what circumstances they ride in is not.

By the way, we have some great bike infrastructure, just most of it isn't on the streets. Why should someone on a bike path with no cars have to wear a helmet? A decent amount of off-street bike paths are pretty much Dutch-level infrastructure. Some places have bicycle boulevards that are pretty damn safe as well. All of these things are available in the state you're suggesting we mandate helmets in.

Do you really think this girl needs to wear a helmet? http://www.davisbicycles.org/img/blog/13-03-27-001.jpgWell, my commute is fairly long--12 miles each way--so it was actually kind of nice to be able to just clip in and go.  But having to stop just chewed through cleats and in the end it just wasn't worth the hassle. Now I only use my SL's when riding 60+ miles.You almost feel bad for the bikes. Chain and cassette removed. Welded and spray painted as to be unusable. Locked to a post with the key thrown away. Poor little guys, you could have been so much more than a statue. SPD-SL is overkill for commuting. SPD on the other hand is durable as hell.This is great and everything, but I feel like I'll be reading about somebody getting killed by confronting a bike thief any day now.

I saw a guy riding a bike while guiding another one a couple weeks ago and regret not at least calling the police about it. At the time, I figured how could anyone prove they both weren't his, but of course I knew it was very likely he stole both of them. I regret not doing anything and admittedly I felt guilty about my thoughts because of the guy's race. Later I realized watching anyone trying to ride a bike while steering another one would be sketchy. Next I'll take a picture and call the cops, but I'm not confronting anyone. It's just not worth it. please rinse off that poor bikeOh, I agree.  But I also think it's ludicrous to dismiss a partial solution because it doesn't neatly solve the whole problem.

I believe your severe case of psychopathy was misdiagnosed.
The best way to make cycling safer is to reduce the chance of someone on a bike being hit by a car. Getting people to wear helmets is a distant second.There are dozens of us. Dozens!A bullshit argument. Lots of bicycle-friendly cities are of the same vintage as North American cities.

As far as your confusion, my point is that clothing mandates hurt cycling. They make cycling less appealing, less common and therefore more dangerous.[Here](http://www.nwatrails.org/)'s the NWA Trails website to get you started. It has a map of everything:
If you're into pavement, the Greenway has a lot of miles to offer and some really nice views.
If you like dirt, Slaughter Pen is my favorite set of MTB trails, but there are also Mt Kessler, Hobbs, Devils Den, Lake Fayetteville, etc.

Any of the bike shops in town can give you good suggestions too. [Phat Tire](http://phattirebikeshop.com/) is located on the bikeway near the mall, [High Roller](http://highrollercyclery.com/) is downtown, [Lewis and Clark Outfitters](http://www.gooutandplay.com/) is on the Lake Fayetteville Trail, and [The Bike Route](https://www.facebook.com/thebikeroute) is between both of those.

Have fun, and get ready for some hill-climbing!

I second the idea of the Ale Trail. [Apple Blossom](http://appleblossombrewing.com/) at Lake Fayetteville has some awesome food and beer, and [Fossil Cove](http://www.fossilcovebrewing.com/) has great beer and often times has a food truck parked outside. Just as an FYI, Tanglewood is still listed on the Ale Trail passport, but they closed a while back. lighter weight, adjustable reach, and better resale value. I've not done that yet but it's an interesting quirk I'll have to look out for ;-pSomething like a 18x increase in energy for a 4x increase in velocity.

The math **should** be closer to a 16x increase, but I'm guessing there was some imprecision in the conversions I made from mph-&gt;Kph-&gt;m/s that is causing the discrepancy.Sidi Wire Carbon Vernice and Look Keo Blade 2 Titanium Pro Teams.

The pedals are *light*.

Just in time for a foot of snow this weekend. :(My OCD is trying to reach through and kill you.The only suitable Genesis in your price range would be something like this [Genesis Equilibrium Disk](http://www.evanscycles.com/products/genesis/equilibrium-disc-10-2015-road-bike-ec073925#features) and you're getting a cromoly steel frame with that (albeit quite a nice one).


Honestly, the only bike that I'm familiar with that I would consider over the Synapse would be the [Pinnacle Arkose Three](http://www.evanscycles.com/products/pinnacle/arkose-three-2015-adventure-road-bike-ec071307) if you can use your voucher elsewhere (which shouldn't be an issue). Again it has 11spd Shimano 105, a more relaxed riding style, and all necessary mounts for racks and mudguards.


How did you feel the Synapse's sizing was off? Bear in mind the small changes such as flipping the stem and making sure you have the correct saddle height will make the world of difference. See if the shop will stick it in a turbo for you so that they can assess the fit when you're actually riding the bike.


Hope that helps.As a Houstonian this makes me furious. These bikes are a reminder that bike safety is a real problem in this city. People die on bikes, and I think if more people knew we would push more for bike lanes.They do a pretty good job of keeping crap off the back of your fork stanchions but that's about it. I can't speak for the people who put up ghost bikes, but personally I want more people to ride bikes. I believe that would make everyone safer. You're not going to encourage people to try riding a bike by putting up visual reminders of how it could lead to death. That only perpetuates the popular misconception that it's an unacceptably dangerous activity for most people.Someone local to me is [selling one](http://orangecounty.craigslist.org/bik/4890522005.html).Why not both?WTF is a wolf whistle? Is this a limey thing?
Yeah it's a memorial. But some don't have any signage so I guess people took them.

Edit: I just realized that I answered the above question wrong. It's a memorial for a person who was killed in a nearby road/intersection. I believe the bike pictured is from a fairly recent incident of a young woman who was killed on Waugh.I've caught myself making hand signals to turn while walking before..Planetbikes makes some cheap gels,  like $12 or something. Another thing you could do which I've been doing to customer bikes a lot is taping a strip of old tape from the hoods around the corner of the bar to add a little padding there. Free cushion when you go to wrap your bars. If people didn't steal bikes, there would be no stolen bikes to be bought. It was in the imgur description. I've got no tri experience, so I can't be much help, sorry, but I wanted to recommend trying /r/whichbike and some of the tri-specific subs too (they're have to be some, right?).  Also, check out what the other kids in the club are riding and if any of them got new bikes this year.  If they did, they'll have the scoop on deals, or even better, they'll have the bike they rode last year they could sell you![Through](http://i.imgur.com/BCfGwkQ.jpg) the wheels and seat every lock up. The 7 foot one is ideal.Yeah my shit is just caked in this stuff. I've also been riding without fenders so the spray is just ungodly. Luckily, I think the city of Boston ran out of road salt because it's been noticeably less salty. During one of the warmer (26F days, before I needed goggles... ah those were nice times) I took a big old hunk of road salt to the eye off a truck that blasted me unexpectedly. I was only a quarter mile out from work but the residue in my eye was absolutely unbearable.they were among the worst performers in the German tour mag [tests](http://forums.roadbikereview.com/wheels-tires/tour-magazine-test-2011-4-hand-built-wheels-pitched-against-12-factory-ones-261933.html), the fact that they have a weird nylon bushing in the freehub in lieu of bearings and the fact that they have narrow inner width make them all in all pretty crappy compared to most of the new wide-rim options. They're pretty bombproof, I'll give them that...Thanks, I'm debating them on my roadie.  Guess I'll save the $20Going to try and stay on my trainer for more than 20 minutes at a time! Exciting, no? ;)He was wearing a helmet, thoughYou might get more answers over at /r/whichbike -- good luck!Wait, are you telling me how places that existed hundred and thousands of years before cars were invented seem to do better at handling alternate modes of transportation? That is just crazy talk.

I was stating that I was confused by your idea that airbags and people wearing what they want while driving somehow affects the popularity of cycling. I think you're exactly right.That's insane, I've never seen a hub/wheel like that.  I have no idea what it's worth, or even what the use is besides a neat trick of engineering, but kid looks like he's having fun so it's worth that at least!Damn nice! After a couple seasons and minor repairs, mine are finally starting to break down. Durable little beasts, those things. Wish there was something just as good for that $25ish price point! Is it a memorial? Or is it supposed to be a sign to fix things so this stops happening?Shifters or groupo? Red feels nicer but Rival has always been a good bang for the buck. Not to mention Rival is 2 steps down from Red.An oldie but a goodie.Thanks for the info I will post some pics when i get itI wouldn't say it's a bad idea either and it's more convenient to stick to your normal tyres, the turbo is depressing enough, the more faffing about you do before you jump on will just discourage you...

And I agree, you don't need all that, the person above me said he advises getting an extra rear wheel.Don't forget about Slaughter Pen up in Bentonville.That's what I was thinking. This guy will definitely think twice about stealing next time.i would like to see no mudguard and a slammed stem. the colorways are great on thisI just use winter boots, then you don't need to faff around with all of that :PI thought I was the only one, they creep me out. There was one on my commute that popped up and was eventually taken down after a few months. I get that people want to memorialize their friends but there are other ways to do it. I didn't like sitting at that light right next to a ghost bike knowing that somebody died right there.

The family might not even like it to be honest. I had a friend who was killed in a car wreck in high school. Some friends put up a cross and the family asked that they take it down. They didn't want to be reminded of it every single time they drove by. Makes sense to me.Give it a quick bath. ;)Thanks. I plan to move the the Pacific Northwest in he next year or so. I'd much rather have rain than attempted assault and/or murder. Looking forward to the fresh air up there, too. Oh god, here we go again...

Can we please just make a subreddit specifically for threads concerning wearing/not-wearing helmets and the scourge of cyclists running red lights.I mean, I have a Colnago CX-1?I don't like ghost bikes, or any permanent, private roadside memorial in public space, for that matter. Lighter and feel.
There's probably 500g in it between the two? Assuming the same year

Shift should be instant and silky smooth. Depending on the year of the red gruppo you'll have zeroloss on both shifters, every mm you move the shifter is a direct movement of the rear mech.
2013 red saw a yaw mech and revised chainset that although it's a night!are to set up - once set up right completely eliminates chainrub even when cross chained completely.

Its probably the best you can get (others opinions may differ) or at least on par with super record and dura ace.

The downside is replacement when you damage or wear out components. Its expensive. Very expensive.

Shifters are 250, chainsets can be had for 80 with a lot of shopping around. Brake set 60. Cassettes are ludicrous (I run ultegra). Rear mech is around 100.
Those are bottom end eBay prices with a lot of shopping around needed and waiting for the right auction - the retail price on deep discount for the current red 22 groupset is about 1200.... And of course the newer the kit the more it goes for - the limited yellow edition goes for stupid money. The black edition goes for a premium too.
This is North of Berlin (Spandau). Most of Berlin MTBikers are riding the trails in Grunewald and also Tegeler Forst. I used a small stick under the left pedal. The rest is some photo editing in the iPhone. It's not as much strength as it is technique.  Maybe so. But still... If OP rolls a Prince Pinarello or something, I could see it. For those who don't read good... You still crack your head way harder when you fall off a bike, even when you're going "slow."

This thread makes me want to smash my own head against a sidewalk.  I wonder how many KJ that would equal.Parking lot at Wellington Orange line train station was plowed and they pushed all the snow against the entrance to the bike path that connects Malden to Boston. The snow mound was at least 10 feet tall! Bunch of local cyclists got together with shovels, picks and other tools to build the tunnel.Whoa...never knew road shoes have vents on the bottom.&gt; The only thing I can say is to ride it!

Kinda a no-go with used bikes because there are none in my area :(

Thanks for the repliesMan, mine look like that at less than 1000 miles, when I used them for commuting.  I eventually just went back to platforms.Illuminati confirmed.It's a mudguard and it helps a bit if it get's really dirty.Yeah, people get stabbed doing what this guy did. Just call the cops and show the video.I think I'll stick with my shitty weather (flat roads) and bike infrastructure.

"I was talking to your bike."Fry-oil bucket panniers are a classic.

There are variants on the method, [here is one](http://www.instructables.com/id/Building-Better-Bucket-Panniers/).

I have seen fenders made from corrugated plastic campaign signs, but they're kind of bulky. http://www.bikehacks.com/bikehacks/2011/09/coroplast-fenders.htmlRight, but I'm talking about ones which haven't been abused. Like perhaps on OP's bike. If it's still smooth, there's no reason to change it yet.I met this guy at Burning Man once. He's the real deal.I'm at a higher latitude. 55 degrees F, and when it snows we don't pollute our streams and rivers with a bunch of salt. You *North-Easterns* are a whack bunch.Do a search for the Joe Martin Stage race routes.  Some of those were fantastic routes.  The first stage Time trial is short, but the roads it's on through Devil's den are kind of nice to ride  - especially if you want some climbing.

Or just bring your mountain bikes and go to Hot Springs :)Shut up, Meg. Hey, great for you.  I was taken out in a left cross two months ago and landed on top of the car's hood head first and then rolled over the whole thing. I've only been riding for about a year.Does my anecdote cancel your anecdote?

Anyways, even a perfect cyclist has no control over when a motorist decides they need to turn more than the cyclist need to continue breathing. Are you female?my single speed freewheel gives up at about -15.

Now I just have to figure out how to get 12 miles home from work with a fucked up rear wheel and no tools. Don't steal bikes, bro!&gt; I don't doubt you but could you explain what's so bad about that?

Bullhorns are generally found on pre-aero TT bikes, and "fixies". Never ridden them offroad and I'm not sure I'd want to.

&gt;I know but it's probably all I can go with when it comes to a used bike

The only thing I can say is to ride it!

&gt;What should I pay attention to when I ask for the exact specs on the 2nd bike (Cube Cross 2013)?

Most of it you can tell from the photos (EA50 Aero wheels, full 105/CX50 groupset). I don't think there's anything else major that's left unknown.Pretty cool -- where is that exactly?Ah yes, the "MUH FREEDOMS" defense.  People said the same thing about seatbelts. They got used to that, they can get used to a bit of helmet hair.

edit: and the reason it matters to me so much is because my uncle was involved in an accident without a helmet a few years ago and now has permanent brain damage.Would you rather talk about the popularity of cycling in the United States and Australia/New Zealand, which are the only places entertaining these stupid ideas? Its nearly nonexistent as a transportation mode and not all that popular for recreation either.It's easier to track a full bike, parts on the other hand, not so much.I'm lucky to have an independent local outdoor equipment store.  They have bulk nylon webbing straps of all sorts of widths.  They will happily cut them to length and attach buckles and whatnot, too.  I like them much better than bungee cords.  I do have a few bungee cords too, but with mini-carabiners instead of hooks.&gt;You can ride a trainer with the same tyre you use on the road

You *can*, that doesn't mean it's a good idea.

&gt;second wheel/cassette/trainer

Why do you need all that? It takes like two minutes to switch out a tire.

I mean, I have a cheap pair of Bontrager Race wheels I use on the trainer just so I don't put extra "milage" on my training wheels, but that is definitely not necessary. that's just the shifters...OPs post implies he's talking about the full groupI don't see what you're trying to imply. I was trying to make a value comparison between the two. Almost everyone has finite financial resources, that 1000 euro is coming from somewhere.this was a production bike, nothing hand made or special that way about it so... early 80's should be an adequate estimation. it maaaaaaaaybe even late 70's because of the lack of braze-ons for a water bottle cage and shifters on the down tube (early 80's they began to creep up to the handlebar stem) but it's a 30+ year old bike. ride it!&gt;Do these things actually work?

Every single professional cyclist spends time on the trainer throughout the year. They definitely work.
I would recommend spending a little more money and going with a more reputable brand though.

[DC Rainmaker](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/10/2013-trainer-recommendations.html) has some good recommendations. I personally have a Kurt Kinetic Road Machine that I'm perfectly happy with, but that might be a little more than you want to spend. Plenty of good options well below that price point.

Also, as others have said, get a trainer specific tire. An indoor trainer will tear through regular tires in no time. The [Vittoria Zaffiro Pro](http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/ProductDisplay?storeId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10052&amp;productId=506667&amp;utm_source=Google_Product_Search&amp;utm_medium=pla&amp;utm_campaign=datafeed&amp;cm_mmc=Google_Product_Search-_-PLA-_-Datafeed-_-Vittoria%20Zaffiro%20Pro%20Home%20Trainer%20Tire&amp;CAWELAID=1011779430&amp;source=googleUS&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;catargetid=400006960000088447&amp;cadevice=c&amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA05unBRCymrGilanF9SwSJACqDFRmVdDoty4Bn4NzFAzrHkEHtgSsWa-Gih7KzKugGr1wbRoC3Dvw_wcB) is a good option that won't break the bank.Will do. I've got until May before winter ends here. Yup! Full on winter mode here in the Northeastern US. Neoprene booties + taped up vents + foil between the inside of shoe and the insert + wool socks = happy feet. The tape could use a bit of touch up though.I'm not sure what the incline was of this route but it was about a mile and a bit and it was all uphill. It's funny how fast it flies by when you're on a bike (and in the right gear) ;-)the yellow rubber is just to give you grip when walking.

I usually replace my fairly regularly, maybe once every 2,000 miles. I have a fair bit of stop start so they wear our quicker.I would much prefer a designated cycle path up the edge of a road but the road I cycle on my commute is just full of parked cars.

My old route had a nice cycle lane along a 2 lane straight road but there were always parked cars over the cycle lane and it was a bit of a nightmare.Their commercials are straight up racist. Pretty fucked up. Almost like getting rid of somebody's gravestone. We have plenty here, even some from the 1980's, still untouched. Sad to see the respect for cyclists in Houston be so low.Nice bikes like that are able to will gravity around it.So not that hardy then ;)

When you're riding in actual -30 come back and tell us if it feels any colder. My record is -33F. The good news is at those temps the wind is basically zero, so windchill is only due to moving speed.It's funny how that happens. I know I had a new sense of awareness for cyclists whilst driving after I started cycling on the road every day.It looks like it's to cover up the vents.@Plantification I think people who want to test their stamina would bike no matter what the gas price is.

At least at this point in time, a dollar saved is a dollar saved for me :)As a fellow long hair I regret I can only upvote this onceprobably covering up vent holes to try and keep warm/dryDoes that mini fender on the fork do anything?Did OP say if he bought a 1000 euro wheel set he couldn't take a bike trip?I take it inside with me. I'd be paranoid about leaving it outside all dayThe OP most likely didn't take the video.OP gets it.They're that desperate. The idiot who stole my bike literally dumped it and only took my kickstand, my front broken brake, and my reflectors.

If this was a cyclist vs a cyclist discussion, it would not be downvoted or defended. How many topics have people agreed with when it comes to a cyclist passing another cyclist who either has bright\blinking lights that are blinding\disorientating to opposing riders in the dark.

It's 99% agreed the cyclists with the strobe and\or bright high-aimed lights are jackasses.

Yet in the case of a cyclist vs a car, that same jackass is all of a sudden justified and correct in the situation.

If you want to be safer, use a blinking non-directional light. The same kind they use for road construction. They are designed to be visible uniformly without being overpowering. The light spectrum they use also is designed to be easier on the human eyes.

Anyone who makes any form of statement that their safety is more important than a drivers discomfort no longer has any validity in arguing for shared road use. If you want to "share" the road, do so appropriately. Discomforting drivers on the road is not sharing the road.

Does a strobe affect the safety of a driver in a negative way? Yes, I would like to see anyone make a valid argument as to why this can be answered in a No for every possible scenario.I'm not the only one to like the overall color and look and think the r/bicycling need some work, even the creator said so elsewhere in the comments.

What the hell are you doing that you are randomly falling off your bike "once in a while"? Been cycling in dense urban areas since I was a kid and the only crashes I've ever had were in races.So THATS where that meme comes from. Thanks!Although I always wear a helmet, I do not believe in regulation or that I should enforce it upon anyone else.  It is my belief that that this law is not to protect riders, but rather to take burdens of responsibility off of motorists.  The passing of the law will also allow the state to stop and harass people without helmets who are otherwise doing nothing wrong.  Further it will keep many bicyclists off the streets clearing the way for motorist.  Additionally, the passing of this law will open the door to other silly laws being passed in the name of safety but in reality are further remove burden of responsibility from motorists.

As far as the $25 fine goes, that is likely the base fine and the total of the ticket will be closer to $230 once all the fees are added on.  A [failure to stop at a stop sign in San Francisco](http://i.imgur.com/sIgEvYk.png) carries a fine of $35 base fine, but becomes $238 once all the fees and penalties are added on.

Not sure why you want to control other peoples personal choices so strongly.Yeah see I tried that but the salt still gets in there. In a lot of ways I found it worse than external gears because you really can't get in there to service it (well I mean you can if you're some kind of wizard but not for us humans).Now slather it in grease for 25 years, run it through rain, sleet, dust and tell me how nice they are.

I haven't done it, it's on my to do list this year.  I can't imagine that it would suck."Nice frame geometry" is another good double entendre.  &gt; As for the rate for head injuries, where are you getting these numbers from?

[Here](http://www.treehugger.com/bikes/more-why-we-shouldnt-have-mandatory-helmet-laws.html):

&gt; . . . one is much more likely to have a head injury in a car than on a bike. The absolute number of head injuries is staggering in comparison; Stromberg shows that even looking at the number of injuries per hour of travel, which compensates for the fact that there are a lot more drivers than cyclists, the rate of head injuries is not significantly different between walking, cycling or driving.Point well taken, but Ksyriums are still a tier below good aero wheels.

You're right though, for the average weekend-warrior rider they're more than enough.While I agree with the "Don't steal Bikes" Message I feel like the real message should be don't buy stolen bikes.  People who buy stolen bikes are worse than the thief in my opinion because the encourage all thieves.If that's around Berlin, can I ask again where and if you can recommend more trails like that?It's funny you say this, I felt like giving him money after the video was over. &gt; If you want to compare bike accidents to car accidents, you need to be looking at auto wrecks under 30 mph.

Why? We're talking about helmet laws, here, which are presumably enacted in the interest of public health. My point is that if you're interested in preventing head injuries you would do just as well to mandate auto occupants wear them as well as cyclists because both populations are at [roughly equal risk of head injury](http://www.treehugger.com/bikes/more-why-we-shouldnt-have-mandatory-helmet-laws.html).

Obviously a car occupant is probably going to fare better than a bicycle rider in a &lt;30mph collision but that's simply not how people use cars all the time in the real world. That's entirely beside the point. Even at lower speeds the risk of injury is greater when falling off a moving bike, since kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity.

KE for pedestrian (same weight as bike+rider) traveling at 5kph(3mph): **0.126 KJ**

KE for bicyclist travelling at 20kph (13mph) : **2.318 KJ**

And this isn't even accounting for acceleration due to gravity during the fall, which would be greater for the cyclist as they're falling from a greater height.Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.&gt;Local cyclist and riding buddy was hit by a distracted driver on Feb 8. He has broken vertebrae, rib and road rash head to toe but is going to recover.

Holy shit that's fucking hairy.  Why didn't he just use the eagles instead to fly to Mordor?How do you tell he's got gel? Was thinking of getting some for my tourer. Picking up the bike from LBS after its annual tune up, watching the temperature rise and hopefully setting some PRs on my neighborhood route on Sunday after crosstraining through the winter months.People also wear whatever they want while driving them, which contributes to the popularity of cycling in places where it is popular.Well I don't agree with you but I can't disrespect your honesty.Well now I feel like an idiot for not realizing, but I was very confused.The title reads like a Portlandia scene.Yes, but any differences are basically semantic. The end result is that most cars today have airbags and most people use them if they want to or not. I am a relatively new cyclist.  My main goal in cycling is general fitness as well.  I bought a Specialized Sirrus Sport last year and I've been quite happy, for the cost of around $600 at my LBS with tune ups etc included in the cost.  It is a flat bar bike.

In my opinion, if your goal is fitness rather than speed, and you plan to bike for less than two hours per ride, saving some money by going with this flat bar instead of a true road bike with drops makes sense.  The main drawbacks of the bike to me are (1) not as aerodynamic a profile means more wind resistance, and (2) only one real place to put your hands can cause discomfort on longer rides.  For your purposes these points may be moot, particularly if you pay $25 or so extra for ergonomic handles or bar-ends to give your hands some extra comfort.  The bike is very reliable at least in my experience.

Another nice thing about the Specialized Sirrus is a wider range of gear ratios, espcially reaching for easier gears, than you would find on many road bikes, with 3 gears in front and 9 in back.  If you live in a hilly area this may be quite nice for you.

If you compare a $1000 bike to this $600 bike, you are basically getting features that make you go faster rather than features which will give you better fitness training or more safety I think....maybe because cars are traveling at much higher velocities?

If you want to compare bike accidents to car accidents, you need to be looking at auto wrecks under 30 mph.

That wasn't my point. I was saying that after you have a certain level of bike than what is the point? There will always be something better out there until you are broke. Now everyone has that itch to get something better but eventually you have to realize your chasing seconds that don't matter for thousands of dollars. So yes, they are faster. But are they worth it to the weekend rider who does not race and already had a damn fine set up? ehhhI know. I though the "durrs" made it clear I was not a supporter of that viewpoint?

It's like people don't understand that **velocity** is the important bit of 1/2mv^2.I think it's not anger, it's frustration with a broken system. Discouragement in the form of civilian-handed-out corporeal punishment.

Does this mean it's right? Does this mean it works? Probably not. But we've all had a bike stolen from us before, and feel their pain, and it feels *good* to watch someone get their ass handed to them for doing what caused us pain once.Rinse off your bike!

If you catch me giving someone the once over, they're probably a bike.If you don't, I'll have it.
Seriously red for that is.... Ludicrous.
Hell post it to the UK and its cheaper than I've ever seen a full red gruppo.

Red is nicer than rival. It won't make a difference in speed, let's be honest. But it is nice to ride.

For that price, get the red, post it to me.On my first trip with my Brooks saddle I had a camo waterproof cover and I just left that on it whenever I wasn't using the bike or when it was downpouring. No one can tell what type of saddle is underneath unless they go up to it and lift it off.

I've also got a Busch &amp; Mller Seculite Plus that's a bit newer, also working flawlessly.  Out of the two, I think I like the Brake Plus light better, as the fact that it pulsates/brightens as I brake is pretty neat.  Both have been through multi-day hurricane levels of rain, winters with lows as low as -20F, summers over 100F.  Neither has any sort of USB seals or battery compartments, so there's really no where for water to make its way in.  I'd expect both lights to last decades, easily.Honestly, this question gets asked a lot, so I'm sure if you search you'll find more information. However, I'll continue.

1. You need to determine a budget with real numbers. Cheap for 1 person is expensive for others.

2. You'll need to determine where or how you'll gain access to bike-building tools and know-how to work them. Budget and network (buddies, bike shops, bike nerds/collectors, vintage shops) accordingly. If you don't know what frames or configuration you're dealing with, you'll run into unexpected costs and downtime.

3. How long of a project do you want vs money spent?

4. Acknowledge the fact that it's going to be a huge challenge to come from 0% experience to building without more time and money than planned for. Buy a used, working bike that fits you properly in your budget. Maintain and acquire tools as needed. This is the cheapest/easiest/funnest way to get riding and start collecting (N+1). There's always another bike to find.Well, police and everyday citizens, the title should probably read.How is it staying upright?  There's no kickstand or anything....Those would be the brakes

Edit:I'm actually the idiot for not knowing how to spell! If you have a co-op of any type near you you can usually find some parts for free or cheap, and sometimes shops will have random old parts like cheap derailleurs and stuff they'll sell cheap. In some ways the cheapest way is to find a good old bike you like at a garage sale and then learn how to rebuild and reuse as many of the parts on it as you can. Salvaging the crankset and wheels on a bike alone will save you a small fortune most of the time, even if you end up replacing most of the rest. If you really want to "build" a bike it can add up fast, with cables, housing, bb, crankset, cassette or freewheel, pedals, stem, handlebars, wheels, levers, frame, fork, headset, derailleurs, brakes, and--on older frames--clamp-ons like cable stops. Finding a bike that has the fork-frame-headset-crankset already and just rebuilding that much can go a long way to keeping project costs down. Also, if you're going old skool, find a cheap hardware outlet store and pick up a digital caliper. Old bikes use a dizzying array of seatpost, BB, stem, and clamp diameters, among other things, and a few seconds measuring a part will save a lot of money blindly swapping it out.A legal requirement on a company producing a product is different than a legal requirement on the user of the product.what makes red worth the extra coinSo wear a helmet.

See how that statement is different from "force everyone who wants to bike to wear a helmet"?Casual bikers are rarely going 20mph.Cotter pins.

Ugh.this is old red and old rival right? $425 for current red would be unheard of. Still, get red.Doesnt happen very often but it is funny as hell when it does :-) Two options: You don't. You buy one thats already built and upgrade it. It'll be cheaper this way and you'll still get to learn.

Or you work at a bike shop.

Think about all the parts, measurements, abbreviations and standards you know nothing about. Now think about all the parts you'll order that are the wrong size, length, diameter, etc... It's expensive learning this stuff on your own.

Oh yeah don't forget the tools you'll need. Like for installing an external bottom bracket or a third hand tool for uninstalling the chain masterlink when you realized the chain is too long (or god forbid you made it too short), or a proper pair of cable cutters (and cable housing cutters), torque wrench (they're not just for carbon), chain whip (don't forget the monkey wrench and cassette removal tool).Do you live around a bike co-op?

I got my bike stolen awhile back and would definitely do the same thing if I saw the person who stole it. He was asking for it. Your link doesn't work.No, its sorta the arm bar, but you raise your hips and it can break any bone in the arm. Also his arms were short, so i could inly grab below his wrist for good grip.
Edit: i wasnt being gentle.That is utter bullshit. High visibility clothing works great. I wear a very bright yellow cycling jacket and most cars give me lots of room when passing me. When I don't wear the bright jacket I have a LOT of close calls. It's as if I'm invisible when not wearing that jacket. Cars just don't seem to see me. By the way, AL__S is absolutely right "so many drivers are just massive dicks".Except aero wheels have been proven to make riders faster.

This isn't hearsay, its physics. I can't say for sure because I have only spun on the trainer for about 5 minutes. They feel super comfy, but in the drops I can feel the gels twist if I stand and mash. I might end up taking the gel off the drops. I am going to leave the ones under the hoods though!If one can kick someone else in the head *without* an angry passion (ie, in my words, being an asshole) then one is something even worse.  I just don't think you can calmly and judiciously kick someone in the head unless there's something even bigger wrong with you.  I think that when we act on our angry impulses, even if it's justified, we are letting out our inner assholes.

I can almost hear the drivetrain dissolving.Whatever you want to call them, airbags are designed to reduce head injuries. We started with two for a car, now some cars are up to eight. Say what you want, but car makers and insurance companies seem to think they work pretty well.

As for the rate for head injuries, where are you getting these numbers from? Are they both the same? Are they decreasing at the same rate? Are the head injuries in question more serious or less serious then those 30 yeas ago? Once you can answer that we can start hypothesizing why it is happening. If only people did this for a living :DTime to take out your winter jackets and ski goggles :PYou should make this your day job. Let's all donate $5 for every bike in town this guy saves.

&gt;

&gt;__Target fixation__ is an [attentional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention) [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon) observed in [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans) in which an individual becomes so focused on an observed object that their [awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness) of hazards or obstacles diminishes. The phenomenon is most commonly associated with scenarios in which the observer is in control of a high-speed [vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle) or other mode of [transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation). In such cases, the observer may fixate so intently on the target that they will not take necessary action to avoid it, thus [colliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colliding) with it.

&gt;The phenomenon is common amongst [racing drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_driver),  [fighter pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot), [motorcyclists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcyclists), [mountain bikers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking), and [surfers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfers), amongst others. When individuals target fixate, they are prone to steer in the direction of their gaze, which is often the ultimate cause of a collision.

&gt;The term target fixation was used in World War II [fighter-bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter-bomber) pilot training to describe pilots flying into targets during a [strafing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafing) or bombing run.

We got a heat wave in Chicago. 22 Degrees F. :)You can ride a trainer with the same tyre you use on the road, granted the tyre will wear quicker but you'd be looking at a good number of years before the cost of a second wheel / cassette / trainer tyre offset the cost of slightly increased wear on the road tyre.TrainerRoad ride and hopefully get the fatbike out in some snow.I have to second this. I wore down my precious Continental GranPrix 4000s II tire within a couple hours on the trainer.

edit: definitely watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulhpwTRvAfo) video before you purchase. Magnetic trainers are very loud.She is until you post something she dont like, then she will witch hunt you and have people brigade.We do for cars. We just call them air bags. Absolutely. He just got more careful about it, at least for awhile.If I didn't already have a Jake, I would be seriously considering a Rove.Shes SRS. She likes to start fights in places and then runs away.As a driver/rider, hi-vis is second to lights. If I see you (and I do keep a careful eye out for fellow riders. It'd be a nightmare for me if I ever hit one of our own!) then I can plan ahead to make a more careful and convenient pass for all parties involved.

But I agree- most drivers are dicks. Get bright lights, and shake them out of the haze they're in.you seem like a cool personButthurt banned user, nothing special.If that's the route you wanna go, that's certainly a viable option.

My advice is to get some rain gear, go outdoors and nail that shit.I'm going to offer a different view than the one offered in this thread. I say do it. Fuck this guy's day up. If it's a bike that is retailing for under a grand, then it's simply not worth it for the police to lock him up overnight. It's a slap on the wrist and that's it, and he's back on the street stealing bikes for more drugs.

I can't imagine what I'd do if I caught someone working over my bike. I'd probably carry out similar violence. People like this deserve to be punished, severely. The law does not do this. It's a dangerous thing to do, perhaps not the right thing to do, but I don't think it makes them "assholes" or anywhere nearly as evil as the thief.

I think people don't understand how much bikes mean to bikers, especially to commuters. That's not just "A bike." That's something we use to get to work. That's our car. That's our train ticket home. Someone tampers with those, they get arrested and have the book thrown at them.

Sometimes frustration over the lack of persecution of this crime and the reluctance to prosecute it means that people think the present punishment is unsatisfactory, and wish to add to the amount.

tl;dr: I can't blame them. We're human.Do you think this guy tried to steal any more bikes?Im not doxxing. Go fuck yourself.the fuck is going on in this thread?very philosophical.. very true, too. but that guy especially provokes nothing but pity in me..
on the other hand i cant tell what i would do if someone tried stealing my ride..Not a musician... but thanks for letting me know ya failed to doxx me!I tried a few times now, the bead always in the bed at the center of the rim and I can't see how this thing could possibly be mounted by human hands and I'm no weakling.


A while back I was on a date with a girl and she was clearly getting annoyed at me. About two hours in she happily exclaims "I just realized you are checking out bikes not women".Yes, proper maintenance and adjustment is key. But I've seen some on old Japanese bikes which just spin and spin. Open them up and the surfaces are mirror smooth.Eh, I have no issue with helmets on motorists.  As for pedestrians, You do understand that ke=1/2mv^2 right?

Yeah, it was only -1F. But i was riding against the wind.

It's a deal as it sits, but I'd try to negotiate down to 530 Euros.


That Quantec is a mess. Stay away from it. Gotta love the bright sunshine ;-)A good wide beam pattern really helps prevent that "tunnel" feeling that sometimes happens on night rides. Multitasking, bro. Multitasking.It's pretty easy to DIY a mixture like this too if you find yourself regularly commuting and needing a refresher.

This derby/cucumber/mint is exactly what I whipped up for my last few batches.  Cucumber scented witch hazel mixed with some peppermint Dr Bronners, baking soda, aloe juice, and olive oil.  Spray it on, wipe it off with wash cloth.  Instant shower after the 10 mile ride in to work.  Pretty cheap to mix up on your own too and alcohol free to keep skin from drying out.

Then again it was a refreshing cool scent/feel during the hot summer but thinking to make a warmer blend for the winter once this batch runs out.  Thinking to add some sandalwood and clove to the blend with neutral witchhazel and Bronners.  Cool!While we're at it we should require helmets for pedestrians and auto occupants, too, since they're at an even [greater risk of head injury than people on bikes](http://www.treehugger.com/bikes/more-why-we-shouldnt-have-mandatory-helmet-laws.html).I'm sympathetic to both views.  Kicking someone in the face, no matter the circumstance, makes one an asshole.  Yet sometimes it is in one's best interest to be an asshole.Seeing how much self-pity I can generate after getting hit by car, getting chewed out at work, and then my weekend plans, a 55 mile race was canceled.  :(

In all seriousness, I'm okay, just a shit week.Shouldn't you be modding some comments about women stuff?Biking without a helmet is, at the very least, stupid. Just ask any emergency room doctor about cycling and wearing a helmet. Your head is the furthest part of you from the ground and is going to hit the ground the hardest of all your body parts. I'm a good, safe cyclist but even I crash unexpectedly once in a while. Buy a helmet, wear it, and you won't end up in a wheel chair for the rest of your life due to head trauma.Yea, it really helps for night trailrides. There's this really flowy wide gravel fire road with super steep climbs and descents. Nothing to techy, you could probably ride rigid/locked out. Its so wide that when I got my 2500lm light, I noticed the center beam wasn't much lighter, but the spread was much farther.Don't know the model, but it's almost certainly from the early 1980's.they do have the choice not to kick him in the face though.dude ur crazy. stay warmAlright thanks for the input, I'll ask the guy for the exact specs on it  Indeed :-)My (2013) Moto X uses [Moto Assist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motorola.contextual.smartrules2) for all of this.

The phone does all the heavy lifting, the car stereo is basically a  bluetooth speaker at this point.Depends very much on your definition of violence, but certainly they escalated the violence.

This is inevitable when police have an antagonistic relationship towards the public.  Pragmatic people are left with little choice.[Here you go](http://i.imgur.com/8LaLRZn.jpg)Yes. But you need trainer tires to use a trainer. Trainer tires do not come with the trainer, or with your bike. I advise getting an extra rear wheel so you can simply swap out wheels instead of tires. (Much easier.)the picture shows the bike on the trainer with the wheel on it.No. Just no on the Sunn. It's cringe inducing. That Cube is pretty well speced and a good deal, though I'm not too familiar with the brand as it's not available (or at least readily) here in the U.S.I've been riding a [Trek 1.2](http://www.trekbikes.com/int/en/bikes/road/performance_race/1_series/1_2/), and if the Defy 3 doesn't do it for you, maybe take a look?

It's basically Trek's equivalent of the Defy 3--they're both sora-level starter road bikes.  It'll probably come down to a test ride or picking the color scheme you like best.

edit: whatever bike you get, replace the tires ASAP.  The stock 23s on my 1.2 ended up like [this](http://i.imgur.com/LsvcGop.jpg) less than 3 months after I bought it. Citizen and Bravo.
I've had the Citizen going on eight years and it's been a great bag. After using it just about every day to carry books for school, beers, my laptop, clothes, etc I've retired it. As of late the tarpaulin liner became thread bare which allowed water to seep into the bag a bit faster then I'd like so I had to carry my clothes in a dry sack to keep them from getting wet. Last summer I finally noticed the shoulder strap was getting funky from continuous use (20 mile commute, 5 days a week) and the foam pad was doing a good job soaking up sweat so much that washing wasn't doing the trick. I've used the shit out of this bag and loved it the whole time.
I've had my Bravo a few days now and aside from learning how to pack the bag all over agin its been fine though I still need to put it through a good rainy commute and see how it holds up then.Well, I don't agree with this, but I can see your logic.  I see this as removing casual riders (who would not ride due to objecting to wearing a helmet) while those willing to wear helmets would still ride.  I typically associate those wearing helmets with more serious cyclists which I consider myself safer sharing bikelanes and roadways with.

I just want to state again that I oppose mandatory helmet laws, but claiming that mandating helmets will do anything other than discourage people from riding is a stretch.[Por que no los dos?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqgSO8_cRio)I've been using a [Light and Motion Vis 180](http://www.lightandmotion.com/choose-your-light/vis-180/vis-180-brown-shugga). I commute daily in the pacific northwest with regular rain and weather and the light has held up well for the past 3 years. It is generally run in the low blink mode and the most I ever seem to charge it for commuting is ever 2 weeks. I like that the light is visible not just from the back, but from the sides as well. Another UK cyclist here! My Blackburn Mars 4.0 has been brilliant. Only ever had trouble with water once, a couple of years after I bought it. Squirted some WD40 inside and it's been fine ever since. Most of this time was without fenders.Not all northerners. It's +14 around Vancouver. psh you're talking windchill there buddy. not quite the same.I guess I've not found too many old steel frames which have had a properly maintained BB.  They always seem to have flat spots or worn bearings and popping a $20 cartridge in is so damn easy.This line of argument always devolves into "durr I guess we better put helmets on pedestrians durrr."Yay, let's escalate a nonviolent crime to a violent one! That's always a good idea! Yeah, that vigilante justice train is a sweet one, woo!Got enough salt there for 200 orders of fries! My winter bike looks a lot like that. Disc brake calipers and fenders etc are caked in salt. Winter time sucks-big time. Come on spring. It's lunch time here, an hour north of Toronto, and it's only up to -17C. Coldest day I rode last year was -25C. I wear 4 layers of clothing and the outer layer is wind-proof. Gotta LOVE cycling!!Yes, a trainer will turn your bike into a stationary bike. I advise getting an extra rear wheel with a trainer tire so you don't have to swap the tires on and off.You can crack your head open if you fall while walking as well.

I'd end up leading people on only to laugh at them when they **finally** figure out I'm actually a guy. Read the headline again. It doesn't say wearing a helmet makes cycling less safe, it says "Mandatory Bicycle Helmet Law Would Make Riding Less Safe"Or is it too small?Yay :-)You don't think you can crack your head open if you crash all on your own riding to the grocery store?I had a ~10 year old pair of Ksyriums once and they were aerodynamic bricks.

It's then running at exactly half the usage/time.i did :)Because it works to get driver attention. SMIDSY is a term for "Sorry Mate I Didn't See You." It's bullshit, because if they were paying attention, they should have seen you.

However, most are in their cars and insulated from the world around them by the game/text on their phone, so a distraction helps survival rate.That is one handsome motherfucking bike. I hope you have a safe place to park it at work.If it works, it works.I'm a motorcyclist AND bicyclist- and as motorcyclists, we're fucking TIRED of being told that we weren't seen or heard by someone who pulls out in front of us because they're in a haze. We have running lights and we're loud, but people STILL DO IT, unless you have something that causes discomfort. Driving has become an all-too-insulated from the world around experience- one where it's entirely too easy to zone out. If some discomfort is what it takes for someone to force drivers to acknowledge our presence then so be it, because I don't see any other way of guaranteeing it.

I agree with you wholeheartedly, even in spite of his "please don't light up too much it's too bright and it's unpleasant." That's the point of lights. People are entirely too fat dumb and happy in their heated jets and heated padded bucket leather seats with their favorite soothing song playing on full-blast with a new message from their S.O. on their iPad- if what it takes is some discomfort to blast them out of that comfort zone and into paying attention to the road, then fuck me, I'll do it.

Distracted drivers are more dangerous than drivers who know that there's a bright, flashing object in front of them, even if they're not sure where it is. They're people, not some barnyard animal. **Disorientation doesn't mean you suddenly go stiff and can't see anything- if anything, it gets the driver to slow down, to analyze the situation, to understand that I'm out there- somewhere.** Most err on the side of caution and give me plenty of space to the back, others err on the side of not knowing where I am, so they go WAY around me, which I also prefer.

I don't doubt you but could you explain what's so bad about that?

&gt; The frame size isn't the final word on bike fit.

I know but it's probably all I can go with when it comes to a used bike

&gt; Honestly, I have no idea.

Alright, thanks anyway.



What should I pay attention to when I ask for the exact specs on the 2nd bike (Cube Cross 2013)?

Lucky, I'm stuck with this dude for the next 2 years. Lmao&gt; If the wheels are steel and have no lip like this ,(this is a wheel with a lip), then I wouldn't exceed 60ish psi when pumping them up.

I'm pretty sure OP meant 1990s, not 1890s. ;)No, them fixating and not turning their car directly into it like a moth.Not a bad idea! I'll probably do that this weekend, I don't like leaving my baby outside in the cold so vulnerable :Psorry for the questions, just for my information - how do you "safely" hanged the wood section (with bar and stem over) on the wall?Nice explanation. Yeah, for me having the cockpit so crowded is a draw back. I do understand riding the tops for a better view though.Gah... Thanks Iso700c (front rack means you've packed too much?) and Landaan (thanks for confirming I'm not crazy to not be blown away by carbon's ride) for the support of the Whyte choice.

But Maxii345 has confirmed my fears somewhat: I started reading the comments about TRP hybrid brakes just after committing to the Cyclescheme voucher. I'm hoping that TRP have updated later versions of the brakes - as some users have said - but I agree that it's a bit crazy to miss out on 105 kit and a lighter bike for the brakes only. The other thing that put me off the Synapse was that I fell just between their 51cm and 54cm frames. Ho-hum.

Anyway, I'm committed to this bike shop now I suspect: http://www.bike-uk.co.uk/, although I may try changing the Cyclescheme voucher if I can. Maybe there's a Genesis or some other model they do that people would recommend I try also?

I hate shopping :-(
I love cycling :-D

&gt; I would even go so far as to replace the bottom bracket.

Even if it's fine? A well adjusted cup and cone works just as well and is often lighter than a cartridge. I know of no advantage to cartridges beyond ease of installation.Still, bullhorns...

The frame size isn't the final word on bike fit. Reach and stack are the numbers you should look at, but they're hard to come by as they're hard to measure.

Honestly, I have no idea. Looking at the parts on there, I don't think it's worth much more than the asking price. Definitely no more than 700. But it depends what the used bike market is like where you are!So them fixating on you leading to you getting hit is better than them not seeing you and likely just passing you by? Gotcha. Hers are pretty permanently rotated since she likes to put the bike on with a rear pannier still loaded.  Since I have to lift mine up farther it always gets unloaded (both pictured bikes are long gone).

The best thing about my setup is that you just tighten down the stem wedge to increase the clamping force inside the steel pipe, just like on a threaded steerer setup.  &gt; bump into their vehicle lightly.

Two wrongs dont make a right. You are suggest doing something unsafe to alert someone to their unsafe behavior. Not when other options exist.




















Sorry :(In this case, if a car hit your bike you shouldn't be claiming off your own insurance. the driver's insurance should be sorting you out. Go to a solicitor who specialises in road traffic accidents. Don't let their insurance dick you about (because they will if they can).

&gt;Chinese carbon FS 29er that explodes and kills me twice a day

Love thisMaybe scoot your bed away from the wall a bit to fit your bike between the two.Prepare for penetration by stem.yeah, should work.If a car hits your bicycle you shouldn't be going near your own insurance, the car driver/car driver's insurance should be sorting you out. Yes.  It'll fit over the teeth just fine and allow for less chainrub on the front derailleur.  Inner width between the plates is the same, it's just that the plates became thinner.

I used to run 10spd chains on 9spd bikes all the time for the same gain.  In theory the 10spd chain could work as well since the inner width is still the same but the overall width is so much thinner that you might have issues with the derailleur being unable to push the chain around.1. it's without the spinergy wheels
2. Do you think the frame height makes a noticable difference? 57 would be good for me (and this one is 59) but I've heard that a "larger" frame can make for a more comfortable position
3. Keep in mind it's an auction so it's most likely to go up, what would be a "reasonable" price for that?



Thanks for the input

I could definitely try that, though it'll be a tough squeeze between our fridge and t.v., since we lofted our beds. Shared-use paths are shit and will always be shit for exactly this reason. I don't blame pedestrians for wandering into cycle lanes - I blame the cockfaces in infrastructure planning departments who ever thought this was a sensible or practical idea.Nah, canvas. If they were leather I would be cleaning them all the time.&gt; I think that it takes a bit longer to pop when I'm on my reserve bike, which has an undersized frame for me and keeps my legs more cramped. But I really dislike riding that bike, so it might well be that it just seems to take longer.

It's a lot easier to make a small bike bigger than a big bike smaller.  Since you have another bike that fits better, measure the saddle height and setback of the main bike, then match those numbers on the small bike.  If the frame is small, put in a longer seatpost.  If the seattube angle is steeper on the small bike, you may need a setback post to replicate the pedaling position of the main bike.   For example, my main ride is a 64cm frame but I have a 61cm fixed gear I built up, much smaller frame but identical contact points (saddle height and setback is the same, bar height and reach is the same).  The smaller frame has a 30mm longer seatpost and 30mm longer stem but in a straight line the bikes feel the same.

Once you ensure the bike fit on both bikes is the same, you wont have any knee pain.  And if you havent had a professional fit, get one.  It's a lot cheaper than a medical bill down the road.  You only need to get fit to one bike, then you can take those measurements to the other bike to make them both fit the same.  The struggle of us Northerners. Under your bed? If there is enough clearance.You may not be, but I am. I wish I could, but the size of the dorms are bit small for that :(I went to [Paul Wyganowski](http://wyganowskiframes.com/), who is about 90 minutes north of Minneapolis -- he studied under Terry Osell and teaches the Paterek method.  Instead of the usual 2-week class like most builders/schools do, we worked together every weekend for 14 months.  I got a ton of bang for my buck.

There's a whole bunch of people that teach framebuilding, and I really should get a list of teachers/schools compiled in one place.  I'll share it here once I have it pulled together.Don't feed the trolls, it's not worth it. Just hit report and move on.The wheels you've got are just fine for those purposes.That looks pretty standard for a small tire.  Just take your time and use the slack from the center channel to work the bed into the channel, then repeat with the second bead.

You should never have to use a tire lever to install a tire, and if you get really good you might not need to use one to remove a tire either (same concept with putting slack into the center channel but rolling the tire over the sidewall).  Make it a personal goal to use your tire lever as little as possible and you'll find your tire beads hold up much better over the long run.I wish I had one that bright for my helmet. The 1500 Lum. only goes on the bars. 1. No, just no. Spinergy wheels and bullhorns. *screams internally*

2. Looks like a good deal.

3. Even better deal! Weird mix of parts though, and maintenance will cost more as it's got a Campagnolo drivetrain (mostly). Best spec of the lot by far.&gt;It's not always about speed, right?

That's what I was getting at.

&gt;Sometimes its about being able to go greater distances with less effort or getting to the top of a hill/mountain without resorting to walking the bike.

You actually are talking about speed here, though. Going a greater distance with less effort is equivalent to travelling the same amount of time but with higher speed. So yes, in your example it *is* about speed, because on the bike that is what **everything** reduces down to. A new set of wheels will help you get somewhere by giving you higher speed.

Also, if someone is struggling to get up a climb, then wheels will not do anything for them. If you are talking about physically abling yourself to overcome a climb then you need to buy an 11-32 and a compact crank, not a set of wheels that only sheds 3/4 of a pound off of a 160+ pound system.You guys don't drive?While we don't have split lanes like that where I live
 I do find it helpful to walk my routes every now and then. It keeps fresh in my mind what goes through pedestrians heads, same with driving. I goof up in all three situations pretty regularly which helps me not get pissed when others do the same. If they're leather, you may want to clean them up (white vinegar and water). Leather doesn't like salt. Couldn't agree with you more Store it on your side of the room.

Move to Alberta, it's been a chinook for the past 6 weeks now, which makes up for our chilled economy.Have you ever had a professional bike fit?  Bike setup is the first part of the fit and cleat setup is adjusted after the rest of the bike is set up for your bone structure.

I also stand pretty duck-footed, so my cleats are rotated to allow my heels to swing in under pedaling (so much that if I'm not careful I'll bang the chainstays).  When I look at the bottom of my shoes, the cleat points towards my big toe.  When on the bike this allows my foot naturally to fall into the right position.  Nice! I yours look more secure than mine. My bars will rotate a little, but the GF saw those online and loved the mounted deer look. Does the job though.I would even go so far as to replace the bottom bracket.  I'm sure there are many differing opinions on this, but I really dislike the old 3 piece setups and replace mine with a cartridge BB every time.  I give that title to the group of guys i saw running that morning. Excellent response! Just to add a few things, it's worth checking the three main bearings are adjusted correctly, or they could do damage to themselves as you're riding it. These bearings are the two wheel bearings, and the bottom bracket bearings (near the crankset/pedals).

These checks are quite easy. For the wheel bearings you just need to grab the tops of the wheels and try to wobble them from side to side, or remove the wheel and try to wobble the axle. The axle/wheel should spin freely, but with no play when you try to wobble it. If not set correctly, these are possible to adjust at home, but are a bit fiddly and require some special thin wrenches known as cone wrenches.

Checking the bottom bracket is a similar process. The chainset (big gears at the front) should be able to spin freely, but shouldn't wobble when you grab the end of the crank (where the pedal is attached) and wobble them from side to side. Again, these are somewhat easy to adjust, but require a couple of special tools to do properly (although you can sometimes work around this).

If any of these bearings feel rough, or you're adjusting them anyway, it is probably a good time to add fresh grease.

Cool ;)

But nice work, I ride in those temperatures too!

Best moment was when locking bikes up after a Halloween ride, wearing a skull balaclava and full lycra.
Wolf whistles and catcalls, till I turned around and lifted up the balaclava, then strangely they stopped.

Either way I'm happy with the occasional accidental feedback that I have a nice ass :)Well? What does it weigh!

More curious about the wheels now that I see your scale picture.New riders tend to be more comfortable braking from the tops when descending since it gets the rider more upright.

Experienced riders like to brake from the drops over the same terrain since you have more braking control in the drops.  You also have more handling control due to the increased width of the drops.  And you can maintain a more relaxed hand position since gravity and impact forces just push the bar into your hand.

A lot of people start with the cross-top levers but remove them by the time they've put on enough miles to replace their cables and housing.I rod an '85 Peloton once thing was a dream.

Section 32. [**Rear fog lamps**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting#Rear_fog_lamps) of article  [**Automotive lighting**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive%20lighting): [](#sfw)

---

&gt;In Europe and other countries adhering to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be equipped with one or two bright red "rear [fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog) lamps", which serve as high-intensity rear position lamps to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the rear. The allowable range of intensity for a rear fog lamp is 150 to 300 candela,  which is within the range of a U.S. stop lamp (brake light).  Rear fog lamps are not required equipment in the U.S., however, they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North AmericaAudi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation [Ford Transit Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Transit_Connect), come standard with rear fog lights, or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation [Chrysler 300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_300), have an option for them. The final generation [Oldsmobile Aurora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Aurora) also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment.

This is why you should practice bunnyhopping cracks and speedbumps on your commutes people.  Practice every day.  I've got a stable of nice bikes, ride thousands of miles a year in a heavily populated/urban area and am not particularly attractive.

The current score is zero wolf whistles to countless quiet "nice bike"'s. It's the cleavage, I'd reckon.  People that cant do it are impressed.  Then again bunnyhopping a TT bike has to be pretty difficult with the crazy weight distribution.  Make sure you film it!


Does anyone else remember that guy that was doing a live feed of catching a robber and it turned out to be the lamest thing ever?Thanks for being a creep and doing it in a completely unoriginal way ~~to boot~~ for science.Just posted a bike with green bartape...nothing but downvotes...i like yours better though!If you're enclined to do the repairs yourself it can be really worth it. If you have to get it done by a shop it might start being cost-prohibitive so you should think about how much you want to spend on this bike and whether you want it fully restored, or just rideable so as to make a "beater" out of it (a bike which you spend a minimal amount on money on and will ride until something breaks).

If you want to do repairs yourself, check out your **local library**, they might have a **bike repair book** from the 90s which will still cover all the older kind of technology that your bike will feature.

Check out if there's a **bike coop** in your vincinity, it will save you a lot of money on **tools**. Stuff like brakes, tyres, you don't need bike-specific tools to fix, or very cheap ones that are always a good idea to buy anyway (tire levers, a pump...). Stuff like hubs, the bottom bracket, the headset, you will need special tools that you probably don't need to own if you can get borrow them somewhere. Cone wrenches and freewheel remover are not so expensive and quite useful, but justifiying the expense for a bottom bracket tool that only works on 30 year old bikes, or for threaded headset spanner when every new bike comes with a threadless stem, is much harder.

Finally, there are a couple of very useful **online resources** for you:

[Park Tool's repair help](http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help) resource features a lot of articles on bike repair, but might not always feature the correct one for your generation of technology. Be aware of that.A good thing is that there's plenty of pictures and they always tell you which tools you need (so they sometimes exagerate on the tools needed, as that is what they sell, obviously).

[Sheldon Brown's](http://sheldonbrown.com/home.html) website is the most comprehensive and helpful resource on bike mechanics. The site looks a bit dated but it's excellent, well linked, and it features a ton of articles. Edit: protip, don't bother understanding how the site's content is organized, just google "sheldon brown freewheel removal" if you're looking for info on freewheel removal.Nuts. Really? What am i for riding in -30F weather?Seriously, go through the proper channels to get your bike back.  All these guys saying to just ride the bike away dont seem to realize that this thief now has your email address and phone number.  With that info he/she might be able to find out where you live and work.  Depending on the money at hand, they may come looking for the bike or money.

You already filed a police report, now let the cops set up a sting.  Just a couple of [these guys](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Sioux-Chief-3-4-in-Galvanized-Steel-2-Hole-Pipe-Straps-10-Pack-HD502-3PK2/202273985?N=5yc1vZbqjc). A wrapped the bars in duct tape to increase the friction, they will still twist a little, but not when a bike is on there. The seats, if you wanted them, are simple tied onto the stem with twine, since they aren't load bearing. Can you explain what the real difference in the two bikes is? I mean tires can be traded out... so is it the frame? (also... any recommendations on a MTB?)That's definitely the right way to spell Cervelo. Have an upvote.But a nightmare to work on. I break the damned cotter pin almost every time I work on one. Looks like I'm off to Google some things... :)Beat me to it, [mine are very close to your design](http://i.imgur.com/QwEqZ9s.jpg).  Made them a few years back and have sold a couple through our co-op as a fundraising effort.dammmmmnnnThe Crossrip does have mudguard mounts but those used above are easier to fit and importantly easier to remove.I'm really confused. So you are putting your life in danger over your principled stance on a local helmet law?

I agree that the law sounds like bullshit, but I'm not sure this form of protest will get you anywhere. Other than putting yourself at a higher chance of risk. Am I missing something?It looks fine man, don't worry about it.I'm not sure how you can say that without seeing the rider on it?Thanks for the suggestions.Bike is too big.I agree.God I love summer.I had a bike like that (not half as nice) back in amsterdam a long time agoThis thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.

Not so sure target fixation is better than not seeing. Put a layer of aluminum foil over your toes outside your socks, then into the shoe.What I would replace: tires, tubes, brake pads, bar tape, and maybe the cables (if they're in bad condition).

The rest is probably fine. Those bikes are relatively simple, and you can find out how to work on older bikes by visiting sheldonbrown.com. It's the best source for bikes of that era.

Old bikes are fun to ride, enjoy! Quite a few lights have a pulsing option. Most Light &amp; Motion products, PDW Lars Rover, and many Knog lights have this option. The video in my [PDW Lars Rover review](http://www.bikelightdatabase.com/portland-design-works/larsrover650/) shows what a pulse mode looks like.The plaque says it's "double butted," which I understand to mean the tubes have different sizes?  And it's light?

Edit: after some quick googling I think I understand now.I have a CAAD 10-4 that came with Shimano Rs-10 which I wasn't super fond of. Since I am also not a racer I got a set built up with CK hubs and fatter rims(Velocity A23). I love them. It might be snake oil but I think the wider rims smooth out rougher roads. Big difference from the cheap shimanos which are now on my commuter.Yeh it would never work but it's good to see new ideas developing.
Mine is too. Just don't want to replace it in the middle of winter. Really can't think of anything in my life that a new mountain bike wouldn't fix.Sweet, how did you get it?&gt; rear fog-light

Huh. I didn't know this was a thing. Thanks.Don't you think there's a change he doesn't share the rack because of something related happened to him?

If you want to spend time on this weird parked bicycle,write a note or something &gt; For the love of God, do not spend too much money on a bike like that

It's a Chromo road bike, probably butted. The way I see it there's no reason not to spend money on it if OP likes it and especially if it has sentimental value for him, being his father's.You should not have your seat tilted that far forward.  You're wasting too much core strength holding yourself in place, I guarantee it.

Otherwise, rad bike.  I really looked at one of these when i was getting a new gravel rig, but the top tube's inability to work with a relevate tangle frame bag made it a no go for me.  Enjoy your many gravel adventures!Surfuras thubderbolts (que the 4 stam 5 strength leather belt gasp).&gt; it's like talking to an idiotic wall.

I think you just described yourself bro.While we women do often deal with catcalls and wolf-whistles directed at our appearance when out in public, I'm actually inclined to believe it may have been the bikeespecially if you've got a particularly nice rig. At least, OP, tell us what make and model you roll.What kind of ksyriums do you have? There are entry model ones (equippe, elite) to higher end ones (SL, SLS, slr) which are race ready and around $1000.  Are you TT thinking about carbon aero rims?

Wheels/tires are the best upgrade to make though. Carbon aero wheels will be a significant upgrade from any traditional box section rim. Nothing in this article said anything about wearing a helmet making cycling less safe.  I am against helmet mandates, but I am more vehemently against bullshit headlines.

edit - It's been pointed out below that my interpretation of the headline is incorrect, just an FYI.  I'd just like to make the point:  Helmet mandates = bad; Helmets = good.  That's all.For the love of God, do not spend too much money on a bike like that. At most: new tires, tubes, brake pads.

Do not replace any metal parts, because you'll be ending up spending too much (which you could have put towards a new bike purchase). Old bikes are nice, but technology has moved on since then.Still made [today](http://www.cerchiinlegnoghisallo.com/pagine/fotocerchiopista.php?tipopag=eng)Damn, that stem is sick.Yes, and please remember to place the round things symmetrically in line with the camera and then, down in the middle, between your legs, where the business happens, be sure it's clean, preferably lubed, parallel to the ground, and make sure we can see it from the drive side.

EDIT: apparently this sub does not have the sense of humor of /r/runwild We need pictures of both, for science. I compliment people on their bikes as I pass them.
"Nice LeMond!"
"Cool Merlin! Don't see many of those!"
"Do you have any openings for a cleaning on Tuesday? Also, nice vl!"If you are riding in -21C, you are a stud and a hero sir.....You can make them yourself for about 50 bucks. I made [this](http://i.imgur.com/mCpsRO4.jpg) very easily. Went to a local "re-cycle" shop and got the bar/stem and seat for 10 bucks. Went to Michaels and got the wood plaque for 10 bucks. Then to Menards for wood screws, varnish, pipe fitting brackets, and drywall anchors for about 15 total. Then ordered some cheap Cork style tape from amazon, 8.50. [Works great.](http://i.imgur.com/QtL9BZd.jpg)
I had just left my girlfriends apartment (i crashed literally 50 feet from the door) and was still rolling through the sidewalks in the complex, I pulled out my phone just to turn up the volume so I could hear if anyone tried to contact me. Then I kinda crashed. I had done it before, but at higher speeds when the bike is more stable. Needless to say, I learned my lesson. I bought a MTB last summer, couldnt believe how much stronger I got on the road bike from it. Of course riding more helps(ed) but it was crazy how much stronger I felt, especially climbing. I could agree with that.  The ones I'm talking about are probably around 10-18 Hz.  I was using [this](http://moodlight.org/#6842) site to try and figure that out.Better than not seeing him.But the sun! The blue skies! The dry roads!!! Way better than -1 with snow salt shit everywhere.Boom. so fresh. wooden rims?Now I'm hungry for tacos...Cool story. Most BMWs have lights brighter than my headlight. Trucks shine their lights into my eyes just by existing and I'm not wishing death on you.

Stay salty.
Don't mind the drivers. They are retarded by nature.This would be  a great feature.  I've never seen a bike light be able to do this...MEC Drencher booties, eh? &gt; The fact that construction barriers use flashing lights to get additional attention from drivers, plus emergency vehicles indicates that you are incorrect.

No it doesn't.  There's a massive difference between the (I'm guessing) 20 watt bulb diffused in 360 degrees in a road barrier and the 100-700 Watt focused and often times magnified with a lens pulse pointing right in the drivers eyes.  Also, if you're going to link to a study (which I'm 100% sure you didn't read more than the abstract), don't link to one behind a pay wall, you might as well not link anything.

Also, you seem to be forgetting that I'm not basing what I'm saying on a study, I'm basing it on my personal experience.  There are many bikers in my neighborhood (myself included) and the ones I see the best are the ones with a steady beam headlamp.  To your point, if you want to light yourself up like a christmas tree with something like [these](http://www.mec.ca/product/5013-891/filzer-ufo-led-light/?f=10+50002+50037), have at it.  Those aren't going to disorient a driver and you still get to blink to your hearts content.It really is the perfect solution for most of life's problems. [Link](http://www.bontrager.com/model/09588)

As far as front lights go, DO NOT buy a Knog blinder.  Shitty clasp mechanism and terrible electronicsSploosh! Or whatever the male equivalent of Sploosh is. Which I guess is just sploosh...

*Edited for phrasingFirst ever attempt...It's not always about speed, right? Sometimes its about being able to go greater distances with less effort or getting to the top of a hill/mountain without resorting to walking the bike.  I don't care how long it takes me to get somewhere (within reason), I care about being able to get there.Sadly Schwinn v1.0 started to plaster 'Paramount' on all kinds of stuff during the late 80s/early 90s.

http://www.velospace.org/files/564_schwinn.jpg[...](http://worldsbestbikestickers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/My_Other_Bike_is_4f7ced7b710d5.png)Don't feel like paying for parking at work and then sitting idle in traffic on the way home, so I've been riding this from Hollywood to Downtown (7 miles each way.)No, you are notThis is non-emperical, but it seems to me that bike lights that blink at more than 1-2 hz are disorienting.  I think my blinks in that range.  I use it on roads to make people notice me a bit more.  Some have the bikes that flash at almost 12hz.  That is very distracting.

Yeah, on bike paths I just use a normal light front so I can see and only set it to high if I'm mountain biking at night.  On the back solid red, or blinking a long-short pattern if I'm on a road.I would say upgrading to a better pair of alloy clinchers would be worth the money as it can be done relatively cheaply compared to carbon. Get a set with CK or DT Swiss hubs and some nice tires and it will feel like a new ride. First I would make sure the bike frame is the right size and that everything (seat-post height, saddle position, head stem length, handle bar height and cleat position) has been set up for you correctly. If this is all good then maybe play around with the angle at which your cleats point to give you a more natural foot position. I would also recommend that you use Shimano SPD pedals with the yellow cleats which allow for about 9 degrees of movement.

Barring that make sure you aren't pushing too high a gear, you want to be comfortable especially if you have possibly knee issues. Use the lowest gear (easiest) when going uphill. Keep your knees pointed forward as straight as possible and try to maintain that throughout your rides. I have no idea what level of competence you have so these are just basic things I'm recommending assuming you are fairly new to riding.What do you mean sub-brand?  AFAIK Paramount has always been the premier *model* of Schwinn.... obviously of varying standards and prestige as they changed contractor/supplier.

In the 80s they were build by a group in Wisconsin that would later be Waterford cycles.

The 2nd top model, and lesser known, was the Peloton.  Back in college I saw one listed on ebay, out of some consignment shop 3 hours away in some small town.  Perhaps they had no idea of its true value.  I called them up and arranged a straight purchase, and for 120$ got a beautiful condition, white, mid 80s, Peloton (made by Panasonic???) in Columbus tubing and full Suntour Superbe group set.  Unfortunately the frame was 2cm too small for myself, so the parts were grafted onto my friends Colnago where it still lives today.  No idea whatever happened to the framesetEven if you aren't sure bring the cops.  If it is not your bike you will be a little embarrassed, if it is you might need those cops.  Better to be prepared.Ksyrium is a good wheelset. If your goals are long distance riding, there are some wheels that could better suit you. You could definitely get a wheelset built up at that budget or less. Ksyriums are pretty light and are very reliable for wheels with such a low spoke count. The thing I'd look to upgrade most is rim width. I'd look for something wider which will be more comfortable.

As far as upgrading, at the price you listed you can find better wheels but I think only marginally. Fixed :)There was a TED talk about helmets... It said the mandatory helmet laws killed more people due to lack of exercise than were saved by helmets.

[here it is](http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxCopenhagen-Mikael-Colville)IFL Goodwill.  You can find some great stuff there.Thanks for the feedback, even if biased !  Much appreciated and will take a look.&gt; Another factor however is fit

Second this, another issue that yous LBS could give you hand with or if your the [handy type](http://www.bikefit.com/s-13-road-bikes.aspx).  A few tweaks could make for a much more comfortable ride.test drive it and never come back!Instead of downvoting everything I say out of spite do you think we could just have a normal conversation?  I understand what a slippery slope is yet I fail to see how it applies to this conversation. Could you point out where I used that fallacy in my argument?

Edit: Apparently you can't.Nah, it depends on the beep.

Bip! - As you heard in the video means "Hey there buddy"
BEEEEEEEEEP - Means "YOU ****ING ASSHOLE I'M GOING TO ****ING KILL AND YOU AND YOUR FAMILY"

Subtle difference!Maybe you can blur their logo?

Also maybe check some free lance sites and see if anyone is asking for something similar to what you have designed.I can't help specifically, but do check out the links on /r/bikewrench.
If you're still stuck after asking here it's a good place to ask questions

it sounds like a great little projectNo problem! I just can't wait until I do get an apartment so I could actually make sure my bike is in a safe spot inside :PCan I ask what those mud guards are? No mounts on a Crux either and I'd like the option of adding them.Same as I do every weekend - getting a quick hour's ride in around Cornwall while my son's at ballet :)This is an excellent place to put this, you just need pictures!Three things you do have to replace right now.

Tyres: As you've said. But you'll also need inner tubes to go inside them! They'll be shot too
Brake pads: Who knows what condition they are in, even if top nick there are better compounds now, so replace them, if you post close up pictures on here we'll advise which ones you need.

The chain may need replacing but lube it up - just get some bicycle specific oil and put a drop in each link then wipe off with a rag.

Everything else is a matter of riding it and see how it feels. It may be that the chain needs replacing which isn't a big deal and the cables might been lubing or replacing.

Another factor however is fit - just because it fit your Dad doesn't mean it'll fit you, assuming the frame size is in the right ballpark then saddle height and stem length will need to be looked at.this sums it up perfectly. the only thing I would want to add is cleaning and repacking both hubs, the BB and the headset.Yeah man, in case you forgot, your average lane width is 10-15 feet or so, and drivers coming the opposite way are closer to the center line.This is gonna be my answer for everything. "Hey my wheels busted" "yeah you're gonna need to buy a mtb"Ahh ok, didn't realize it was a dorm.  I just assumed it was an apartment, my bad.Yeah, in college you usually dorm with another person (or sometimes two people). http://i.imgur.com/121LWM2.jpgA helmet mandate is fighting the symptoms. In an ideal world helmets would be unnecessary for 90% of the people riding bikes. Simple town trips/commutes/leisure rides don't require helmets if you don't have to cycle amongst stressed out people in death machinesFor the money there is no way I'd be going for the Whyte over the Synapse.


With the Whyte you're getting a 9spd Sora groupset over the 11spd 105 5800 and that will make a world of difference, not just because you'll have a much worse groupset right now, but because in the future it will give you a lot less flexibility when it comes down to upgrades.


In terms of the brakes, yes the Synapse only has mechanical Promax disks that aren't going to set the world alight - however neither will the TRP hyrbid brakes that are found on the Whyte. These have numerous issues in regards to wear over a few rides, and require much more regular bleeding than you would expect. It's a real shame as it's a great concept.


I love Whyte as a brand and have one myself, however this model is overpriced for what it is, and I would personally go for the Synapse.You're getting taken. Try another shop, and realize that some of the damage (like the paint scratches and a bent pedal) are wear and tear, and aren't something that is commonly addressed unless it's a restoration. Nice! That would be awesome. I'm a student at the University of San Francisco and we just started the cycling team. I would love to just do nothing but ride but I don't have the balls to do it i guess From what I remember I did not need to provide any proof of ownership.  I did need to provide a key number to buy they key, but I was buying a spare so I had the key number on hand.I too went from a mountain bike to something faster (although a cyclocross and not a pure road bike), the difference is great

Anyway if you start tracking you might want to look into [Strava](http://strava.com/)  Alas, I am in Arizona and it's in TorontoIt's happened to me. You're supposed to line up logos on the wheel with the logos on the tire, right? I always do and they always end up slight off by like an inch. I ride 25s at about 100 psi.I just bought a mini-computer that I haven't yet got the chance to test it, so... I'll consider the next time I go out -&gt; The Start :D And indeed, it's easier to keep going comparative to my used stock rusty mountain-bike. HaHaI can attest to this. I used to be fascinated with a crash in the peleton, elated to dissect how it happened, almost. I crashed in the early fall last year and separated my AC joint and did some damage to my rotator cuff. It was the most painful event I've ever endured. It was shock, agony, some tears, and a hospital visit and lots of tests. The crash caused injuries not unlike Tom Boonen's recent wreck, and watching it made my heart race and my chest heavy knowing just how bad that actually hurts. It's given me an entirely new perspective on a crash and what happens after the cameras move away. It's also given me a new concept of how tough professional riders, like Contador or Tony Martin or Geraint Thomas, are to go down and keep riding the stage (or Tour) they're in. I was like, damn that's some track slack!Tell me about it, all the gear and no idea!If it's close enough just drive up and get it. Don't claim anything.  Say you went up for a bike ride with a friend. That's what I'd do anyway. Thank you, appreciate it! It was a tough decision to make but at the end of the day I thought University could wait (I have my offer) whereas my chance to reach my full potential in sport is very much now.http://vancouver.craigslist.ca/rds/bik/4944616332.html

What do you think?

Couldn't find any 29 inch wheels but this was the closest I came to those specifications. I could always re-buy new wheels in the future for better road performance.I'll be touring Scotland this summer, I hope it won't be raining constantly! Hills aren't a problem though :)Almost all of the top pros now are riding narrow bars for the aerodynamic advantages of them. Sprinters tend to have a fair bit of upper body bulk over a regular rider so the narrow bars really help pull that frontal area in and make for a more aerodynamic profile. I found them tricky at first but now it actually feels more natural, especially on starts.COR, sort it out brah, all that dollar and no skill. You know, except from the 3rd place in the GB nationals and all that jazz...Are you using the C15 or the C17? I think the C17 would fit me better, and I like the idea of the cutout, but I'm wondering if its too big for mountain biking. Fuck ya! That's awesome. Going all in in life is something that is too scary for most people. Go git'em! Anytime!  My Domane was (and is) my first ever rode bike.  Enjoy the ride!

&gt; Bars: Alpina Track (33cm)

33cm bars whaaaaaaatt. You must have the upper body strength of a minor Greek god to keep that in a straight line (OK, a curved line on the track) during sprints!This sub is not the place for classifieds...Looks like a death trap. Imagine a bike splitting in two at your crotch as you rife. Not to mention, no manual, and the setup you'll have to do once it arrives. Or go up hills...Wet, cold, windy and wet. Overall fantastic! because every now and then we get good weather and the scenery is stunning. Good luck finding a flat road though.Jesus I would have to have a spacer in my handle bar for that. My jimmies don't need to be rustled by my own bike. Can I have an amazon link for that?OK, fair enough. Who paid the bondsman his $250,000 then?I'll be on the kwaremont vip-style with my dadCheck out 29er hardtails. I wouldn't buy anything that came from a department store. The bikes are usually poorly put together and will wear out/break/be problematic really quickly. With a29 inch wheel you'll be able to cover decent ground and still have good traction. Go for 16-17.5 inch frame. How does that work in terms of them verifying that it's my lock?  I appreciate the suggestion but how would they be able to tell my legit claim from some bike thief trying to get around someone else's lock?

I don't have the receipt as I purchased this lock like 4 years ago.  Fuji S10 that I picked up last fall that I rode around for a bit. Figured it was finally time to redo the tape and some tuneup stuff instead of just having it be ridable.

Bought it from a guy who had it in storage for a few years and was missing a tube and tape in the rear, but mostly this thing works alright for $80. Still...removal of the tape sucks.I looked that up and it's not that model.  That chain is as loose as your mom, OP.Giant Escape 3.

Beyond that it's basically the used market.  You can get some pretty decent deals on Craigslist as bikes depreciate quite a bit like cars.  There's some homework you'd need to do, stuff a bike shop would do for you if you went to them.  Things like frame sizing and checking for damage and wear.A bail bondsman who saw that it was easy money since there's no way she'd go on the run?A full 630% range on the 2x11?  Yikes!  I don't think I've ever seen a setup go that wide, even on a touring bike.

The road biker in me doesn't care for the jump between the 10t and 12t on the cassette (20% jump!), so I'd rather this be an 11-42 cassette instead.  That would bring the range down to 573%, which is the same as Shimano's triple so no big loss there (except for the selling point).Really secure bike rack design...attached to the ground with regular bolts. _I had one that looked exactly like that, but a 54cm, and it was stolen... *tears* but it did kickstart my love of bikes. Great bike. Treat her well.Just contact either the company you purchased it from, or Brookes and get it replaced.Plus the rumble a disk wheel makes on a velodrome sounds like the second coming of Christ. Yea it's different, but it's so eaaaaaasy to just keep going and going I think

Are you using anything to track your progress/mileage?  As it once was.How could you put that tire on bare brick without a tire on?! Track Hack: the cough we get after riding at our track.I actually don't expect anybody here to waste their time doing this for me. I'm hoping some of you will take a look though and maybe see something worth a steal.

If none of this works out, I can always head to a local bike shop, I know there's lots around here. :PI hate those.  University of Washington campus is full of these.  I would only replace it if you are concerned about the weight savings or you are spinning out of the larger cog. Since you don't seem to be doing that in your description, I would save the cash!I love the normal noises my bike makes, its the noises it should not make that bother me :)Well I was referring to running 10km total, not 10km splits! no way I could do thatThats an awesome bike stand. I'd love to see more of them about. Adding to that, they get infuriated at cyclists on the exact same path where they are also getting out of the way of parked cars. People just love to hate on other people.Cover is blown! But doesn't it come with an offer to buy a swimming pool treadmill at full price?  How can you turn that down?Can you order a few sizes and send them back?Because of bad weather, I've only managed to ride it once, did a 20 km route, to test it. Since I didn't ride a road bike... I found it kind'of.... different :) I still enjoyed it, no problem. Being fully equipped and with a nice ride... nothing to be ashamed of.Since it rains a lot here (pretty much raining now), there will be a lot of traveling through partially rough terrain. Definitely gravel and trails.

But I will be mostly sticking to roads as much as I can.
A mountain bike is a good start, one with thinner tires sounds great&gt; RD-A350

&gt; BR-L750

Do you mean 570? 750 seems like it would make them dura ace level.

Edit:

&gt;BR-L331

You mean BL-L331; L for LeverIt was a 'cartoon' filter on the phone which seemed like a good idea at the time :-DI run a lot of different gears and tomorrow will have to switch from my warmup gear which pulls the wheel short (49x16) to race gear (49x13) which is long in a very limited amount of time so no way I can take links out in a rush like that.But the 50 was a good match and the brand she gets her new bike from only has 48 and 52 for women. Well, if it's too small, we can still give it back.Dude I said I would if we could find one that fits us both. But I'm steering.I bought a Chinese frame from Hongfu a few years ago (2012?). It was the FM-015. I ended up racing it hard for a season and a half and it had about 17,000 miles on it when I was done. I ended up moving to a slightly larger frame. I bought a second-hand (but basically unridden) Cannondale SuperSix. It ended up basically being the same bike in terms of handling and stiffness. The SuperSix was about 150g lighter, but was also BB30 instead of GXP.

In the end, the Chinese frames can be pretty nice and perform well. Don't get it into your head that they are equivalent to the bikes that they are modeled after; high end bikes are expensive because they use ridiculously complex carbon layups, and that's also what makes them really, really nice. This is, unfortunately, where the Chinese carbon frames come up short. I haven't ridden one of their top-tier frames (FM-066SL or FM-069SL), so I can't speak about that.

That said, the frames are sturdy. I nearly bought the Tarmac clone last month, but ended up pulling the trigger on a real Tarmac for less dollars used.

That seems to be my answer: having ridden Chinese carbon for many, many miles, I feel like it's only about as good a deal as a used bike off of craigslist. I've had some killer luck on craigslist, landing great parts and decent frames. That's what I'm up to now.What kind of riding do you want to do ? Are you going to be on gravel or trails? Or will your riding mostly be in the city? if you aren't looking to do anything extreme I'd suggest a bike with thinner, higher pressure tires (60-85).  Also you need the proper size of frame. The last thing you want is knee issues from riding a bike too small for you.Neat! How is cycling in Scotland? :)im not really familiar with a dremel so youll have to make the call on that. i used a power drill with a high-carbon or carbide bit that was as close to the width of that counter sinking nut as i could get it. then just drilled enough to enlarge the hole slightly. use a smaller bit if youre not sure youve got the size right, then you can always enlarge the hole further if its not big enough. the goal would be to enlarge it just enough, but not cut away more metal than you need to. you want as snug a fit as you can get.

edit: you wont need to drill the hole on the caliper side of the brake bridge, because the bolt itself is narrower than the recessed nut and should fit fine as is.GuiltyThis makes me sick. Who posted her 2.5 million bail? The church I imagine. I'm sure the parishioners love their money going to her defense.Nice.That's a high level aluminium frame so I don't think the jump will be huge. I find it hard to say though, I changed when I was 15 from a Dolan Pre Cursa to a Planet X Pro Carbon and I wasn't powerful at the time so I didn't notice much difference in that respect. I've not really ridden anything but DF3s and DF4s since I've been sprinting. They've always felt fantastic to me, stiff as anything, no feeling of flex or wasted power. It may be worth it.Or, miniaturizing the hydraulic internals is an expensive and time consuming process that requires even more careful quality control and tighter tolerances and therefore slows production down and increases cost.Usually I'm a big fan of black and white but for some reason it doesn't completely work for me with yours

The white band shouldnt get too dirty, it'll just get that rough and "used" look which I don't think is too bad

So how does the bike ride?  Was hoping for 350 rangeTry renting a bike with him and go for a ride, if a local bike shop offers that service.  See if he'll reqlly like biking before you invest $350 in your brother.

Look at craigslist too.  You're more likely to get a better older bike.  Pm me if you have any follow ups.I need a new pair of pantsI was going to replace the white band on the "steering wheel" because it will get real dirty after a couple of rides; I saw a post the other days with a nice red one, looked cool. And regarding the saddle, as I told /u/jaiieq, I`ll look for a better one in the future.

Thank you for your advice :)I only day performance because your bike is from there, so I asked it's close to you.

[This bike is at your exact max]( http://www.performancebike.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/mProduct4_10551_10052_1135997_-1_catNav). It had wider tires which will be great on gravel, but still nice and comfortable on the road. It's one of the only bikes in that price range with 8-speed gearing.

For a bit more you get the [SE brand counterpart]( http://www.performancebike.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/mProduct4_10551_10052_1170759_-1_catNav). This one will be a bit "faster" as it has narrower tires. Still wide enough for gravel, but may not be as comfortable as the wider tires due to tire pressure.

I'd say to get him the GT and this [bike care kit]( http://www.performancebike.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/mProduct4_10551_10052_1135673_-1_catNav). This will get him everything he will need that isn't size specific (helmet, shoes, clothes, etc... Well... Except the bike itself).

If you can I'd say to take him to a shop and let him sit on a few bikes to see what fits him and what you might be able to get a deal on.Thanks a lot for your advice, I appreciate it a lot, especially since this is my first road bike. I will consider your advices and will look for a good saddle :)

I would use a padlock in the box. A cable lock could still be easily cut.Ride on a velodrome sometime and you can really hear it!Props. You may want to consider measuring that chain again. Seems long.dat droopThey've probably got bike polo wheel covers, [like these](https://fixcraft.merchtable.com/hardcourt-equipment/700c-wheel-cover-*-corrugated-plastic).It certainly is. What are you looking to spend?slack chain means less friction=chain wear. And chances of throwing the chain are nonexistant.i remember these. Those soft ride beams squeaked like a motel 69 bed on valentines day. Cannot unhear.Unless you really like the stock saddle, I would recommend replacing it.  Its a super cheap one.  Replaced mine (with a fi'zi:k) and am glad I did!  Made a world of difference.  I have a Domane 2.0 and love it (though, I replaced everything on it with the Ultegra groupset from the original Tiagra after owning it for about a year and a half)

I'd also remove the plastic chain stop on the wheel.  It will never come into play with a properly calibrated rear derailleur! :DBefore I get told how to live my life: Bike is super shitty, all my classes are in crazy public areas, hate U locks, its a conscious decision...not me being a rookie.If we could get the goddamn 2015 reddit jersey, that'll be great. You'll know it's spring because someone will actually bother cutting through such a shitty lock.But I have no idea how old his lock is.Based on her track record, did anyone really expect this criminal to do anything other than lie about the situation?Thanks!_The locks susceptible to that are quite old at this point.Can you give me examples?How? It's a physical size thing. It places the lever like 12346187" away from the bars.Religious hypocrites like her will commit whatever atrocities they care to, plead not guilty and pray for forgiveness...You might try [opening it with a Bic pen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LahDQ2ZQ3e0).Source? I can't anything in the 'Strassenverkehrsamt' other than the advice to stay right when possible. I take the lane btw. Endomondo and garmin seem to peg my calories at about 1200 an hour for about 18mph average, strava says 618 for the same.  I weigh about 87kg (192lbs).

When I hook up my hrm, that goes down as obviously I'm fit enough that it's not as hard as it used to be.

Who knows how accurate half that stuff is, and I'm sure it differs significantly from person to person, but it's a starting point at least (or maybe benchmark is a better word?).

Most estimates I see seem to think about 1000 calories an hour for that kind of speed.  However personal experience says riding my road bike at that speed is a LOT easier than doing it on my hybrid.

Also half an hour running for me seems to be estimated around 500 calories.  So it's all a bit random really...That's a thing?Order a new key from the manufacturer.Hah, tried the vertical thing. No luck.

 Problem is 1) it's a narrow entryway and they jut out too far and 2) I can't drill into the wallsJust the angle. Fork is straightTape delayed TV coverage: BeIn Sports network is broadcasting from 7:00am - 9:00am Monday Morning, April 6th.Not much competition wise, just structured training during the winter months so I can kick some ass when the good weather hits.  You notice much of a difference between carbon and aluminum frames when sprinting? Riding a Cervelo T1 right now, always wondered if it's worth it to upgrade to carbon."tracks" hehehehe I get itRear derailleur is only marked Shimano sis. Part number is RD-A350. Brakes are Shimano SLR part number BR-L750, Brake levers part number BR-L331When you can't trust a bisop to tell the truth, who can you trust?

What an absolute cunt. Just own up and save people the grief you evil woman. It's a lost frame from the movie Wolfen.These bikes are (mostly) made in the same huge factories that build frames for names like Trek, Colnago, Pinarello, Cervelo, Specialized, Giant, Scott, etc. They're small companies that contract a run of their frame at those factories (pretty much what a lot of those big name companies do too). They don't have the branding or reputation for quality control so they're a lot less money, and you don't know what kind of standards the frames are checked out to after the factory spits them out, but they are built by the same workers that make the expensive stuff. These people need a blue light alarm clock, changed my life! I'd agree though so many people moaning about that lost hour to me it's an hour gained.I hope she gets whats coming and then some. Not guilty my ass.

She'll probably show up in court with that Gandalf staff and put a spell on everyone.Do you have a caliper? Could you measure the tire width? Im curious if these tires actually run 25mm- I have 25mm Veloflex Corsas and they run 23mm. Vitoria Evolution 29x1.9 on a G6000 Alexrim is the problem tire. It's probably closer to 45 actually, I don't have a meter so I'm just guessing. I only have a portable pump so it's probably not  full pressure, it's reasonably firm though. I saw that tandem and tried to get someone to buy it so we could ride together. he said no.some of us don't have mile long legs okay?!True,

There's also nothing quite like using the right tool for the right job

I know I'm both suggesting "get a road bike" (because I love them) and "just ride the bike you have" (Because you're enjoying it)If memory serves me right both of you gentleman friend requested me! I'm glad my love of tall strapping bike lads from across the pond can join you two in tandem matrimony. Friction, usually...  :)
More seriously, I don't ride the HILL when it's slick out; no hail, very slow and careful in the rain.  That would curtail the trailer use somewhat but it would still be do-able even here I feel.Nice! I save society about $1.50 on my ride into work.What the hell, you'll get a tandem with Darren but not me?! Coolio,

two things, for easier viewing creating an album on imgur helps

Second thing would be that the bike looks cool but if you were swap the band or saddle I'd think about something a bit more colorful (or black), but I guess that's personal preference



have fun riding gina ;)The box protects against leverage attacks, but also hides spiders. This is one of the best racks I've seen because it locks both wheels and frame, even for folks who only carry one lock, but I'd be checking for spiders everyday before reaching in there.see if I ever send you a care package again!Looks great! It might just be the angle of your photo, but it appears as tough the fork is bent (head on collision?) It may or may not actually be a problem, but it's a good thing to at least be aware of.Look, I know you're kidding, and I don't want to get into an argent here, but anti helmet folks are clearly not pro brain damage. That's ridiculous and you know it.Also, take a moment to google his name on YouTube and track nats...he's racing with the big boys, I reckon he knows what he's doing. yesThanks! I get frustrated searching routes on Map My Ride but I was going to look anyway. The 2nd link is pretty much what I was looking for. I remember finding a few sites for MTB when I was looking at moving up there but not for road biking.I'm in the same boat, flying 200 / Kerin on a 51 x 14, racing on a 51 x 15 or 16 depending on the event. Wow, I've never seen these, someone really put a lot of effort into them. Not sure they're really that practical, but they would certainly put a thief off!Oh it is something. TILDefinitely feel like it was worth it. I've taken a year out of study to train full time and try to make a career out of cycling. It's got to the point where I'm fighting for every marginal gain available so it's worth it to me. Google Track Slack.Probably. Many track racers run 20 or 21c tires. They are also much thinner in terms of rubber, too - less rubber to deflect means they roll faster. So track tires (look for the word Pista) roll really, really fast, and flat if you look at them wrong.It could be a 1988 PH501.



[Here's the '89](http://cyclespeugeot.com/images/1989_Peugeot_7.jpg). Are the shimano components 105? The '88 catalog is mysteriously missing from the web, so even though this is the wrong color for the '89 it could easily be the '88, and that would make it an *outrageously* good find for $100.I'm kind of jealous of places that can get away with convenient locks like that...I don't ride track bikes, so at first I thought it was something unique to track bikes and thought "hmm interesting,  lemme check the comments." Glad I didI have looked at the trek 7.1 fx and the specialized sirrus and I liked both of those alot but they are a little too much money for meI know its spring in New York because my BODY is no longer a freezing, stiff coil that is impossible to maneuver.What kind of bike/tires are you riding? Even the big apples on my mtb frame get way more pressure.Don't have it with me at work today, but components are as follows: Shimano biopace sis front crank (52/42), Shimano sis front and rear derailleurs, and 6 speed rear cassettethat it does!..was replying from my inbox lol. yea that's what I keep thinking about....that a road bike really won't make me any stronger, so training on my MTB is sorta like extra resistance training...and I'll be even faster when I do make the switchIf suggest getting a rigid framed bike from performance, as well as a year membership (should come out as "free" for the membership after the 10% off, and let's him get some stuff he m may need for s cheaper price). This way he will get the free tune ups and the bike will already be assembled when you buy it (if you buy in store).

The suspension in lower end bikes are crappy. And for the same price a rigid bike will usually have better components. In the store.I see the occasional goober riding on the street with a full back disc. I'm usually like... [what?](http://i.imgur.com/I8CZK.gifv)Sport hybrid!Did you get it in store or online?At the moment, I also have a Soma Double Cross set up for light touring (parts from a used Cross-check I had) and it's done an awesome job with 35mm tires.  The standard build kit is, unfortunately, pretty pricey.Yep, should be fine.Thank you for the info :) !And THAT is what's important :)&gt;Or is there something wrong with the shifters?

i think he means the shifter moved a bit inwardsYou should be able to adjust the reach of your shifters. Are these tires thinner than regular road bike tires?England - it says so along with a little flag right above this text :)

Just enjoy riding your bike. I started off a few years ago on a truly shockingly bad full-sus BSO.

Switched to a decent MTB and started riding offroad, got a road bike and got hooked.
Speed and distance start slowly climbing... Gear helps but above a certain point it's all about the rider.
You'd be faster right now on a road bike - but you wouldn't be any fitter, it's just easier to go faster.
And you are unlikable as presented in this thread. Maybe fix yourself up a little. Weight plays a roll when accelerating, but also at constant speeds. One of the forces slowing you down is rolling restiance, which is a linear function of total weight. Drag forces due to air resistance go with the square of your speed though, so at higher speeds, rolling resistance is still the same, but aerodynamics are much more important.

So both drag and weight are continuous hurdles, but drag increases with speed, whereas weight doesn't.

[Here's](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/rinard/aero/formulas.htm) a more in-depth explanation with formulas and graphs.Ill need to grow an entire footA little tlc and that frame should keep going for years to come.  Its usually minor things like that that are their downfall.  Its a very cool frame.  ~~These wheels cost $120 new (for a set, but you only need one)~~ (misread the rim label. A cheap set of wheels still is around $120, anyway). A set of pedals of this quality is $40 tops. A compatible RD costs about $20 to $30. Repairing paint scratches sounds useless to me. Can't tell what's wrong with the "handle". Are the bars bent? Or is there something wrong with the shifters?

I don't see anything beyond repair here, try another shop.I ride in my drops, so all I do is the lift fingers from grip thing to someone coming the opposite direction.  It seems to work out.I'd like to take a whack at ID'ing it. The 501 and forged dropouts point to a higher-end bike, but no chrome on the fork is consistent with their middle-tier offerings. Can we get a drive-side pic and what components it has on it?Track slack:-(Might at least help you get started:
http://www.mapmyarkansasride.com/Routes/routes.html
http://www.gooutandplay.com/departments/cycling/ar_road.shtmlReminds me of a scene from SkyfallThank you for the input!You put the ulock or some other type of lock (perhaps a shackle or strong padlock) through the hole in that middle prong, INSIDE the box, which keeps the thing from being opened up.

The box keeps people from using "leverage attacks" to pry open a lock, and also perhaps keeps people from using a tool that can cut through a cable easily, unless they can access the cable by pulling it out of the box (which is why I wouldnt want to use a cable lock, because the excess length could be pulled out of the box and cut).Sounds like it was worth it to him, getting this bike.&gt;bent front wheel,

if its not too bad they can true it and it won't cost too much.

but i can't tell anything happened because your pictures are terrible.

&gt;damaged derailer

does it still work or is it cosmetic?

&gt;paint scratches

they aren't going to repaint your bike....

&gt; dented left pedal

I don't see how a simple steel pedal could be "dented", nor do I see how that would need to be fixed if it did get dented a bit.

&gt;crooked right handle

i don't see any issue with the handlebars. Chances are your brake/shifter just slipped a little.

**$450 is absurd for what looks like little to no damage to anything. your derailleur still looks like it works, but I can't really tell**


post better, closeup pictures of every damaged part and you will get a solid answer. But from what I can see, quoting this work at $450 or more is simply absurd.

1. Chances are you need a new derailleur/tuneup for the old one which is &lt;$100 total.

2. Then moving the "crooked right handle" back takes 2 minutes, which should be $5 or free.

3. I don't know whats wrong with the wheel but a new wheel should be &lt;$100, and you can easily replace it yourself. Or you can learn to true the wheel if its not so bad.

4. They aren't going to repaint your bike. Maybe they will apply some touchup paint or something, but you can DIY.


put the chain back on and make sure the derailleur works. learn how to adjust it and try that. if its bent or something is very wrong, you will need a new one. if you are really lazy try getting this work quoted at another shop, otherwise try to DIY.

cool! I'm thinking after I can pedal as easily as i can on 5th gear, in 7th gear, and I start getting my times low enough where im happy with them, I'll upgrade to a roadbike. Btw... "Tyres"? Where you from lol?Not sure if it is just the angle that the photo was taken at but your saddle looks like it is at a terrible angle. Exactly! Track equipment often weighs a bit more for that reason and also to deal with the stronger forces being put through the bike.&gt;  It's pretty easy to swap a cassette.

And once you swap them, does everything typically "line up" correctly?  My concern would be that after switching the cassette, I'd have to get the shifting working properly again.Road bikes are pure faster - same rider on a road bike vs an MTB will be faster every single time.

The bike is lighter, it's more aero and the rider is in a more aerodynamic position and almost certainly geared for a much higher speed.
Tyres make a massive difference, an MTB on slicks vs an MTB on offroad tyres at a low pressure is a totally different beast.

There's a local hill I used to delight in going down fast as my reward for going up it. With hindsight it's neither steep or long but I used to think it was vertical and endless :)

A few years ago my MTB with slicks I tried and tried and eventually found a day when I hit 30mph down it.

My peak speed down the same hill on my nice road bike - 41mph. I backed off when I was getting sidewinds snatching the front wheel.

A lot of time has passed since then and I've a much bigger engine, but the difference between the two machines couldn't be more pronounced.
It does help, thank you. I guess the weight is a temporary hurdle that's gone when momentum takes over, but drag will be a continuous hurdle.Yeah. The cambium series are specifically designed to be comfortable right away, no break in. My c15 is great. Thanks. It was pretty dry and slow late last year. Took it for a tune up and made some small upgrades. I've put more miles on it in the last month than I have in the last 10 years. I'm a fan of the bike. It's a little heavy, but you can get around most places (off/on road) alright.Wow that thing is sexy. My first thought was "great, more shimano shifters that require your fingers to be about 4" longer than they are right now"

Why the hell do they keep making shifters that absolutely cannot be used in the drops? I've been borrowing a friend's bike with Shimano since August and I have to ride on the hoods 100% of the time because I absolutely cannot reach the levers from the drops. It's the most stupid shifter design ever.Your chain, thoughMaybe he's run out of fucks? Some people are poor and don't have a lot to give.I test rode one for a week and realized everyone else on the trip was complaining about their bum except me.  When i came back i bought one right away, i love my cadmium.If you stacked differently you could fit more bikes in that space surely? :)

I'm pretty certain you could get at least 4, possibly 5 (depending on how tight the clearance was) by putting them wheels against the wall, vertically?The only thing more versatile than a CX bike - 2 CX bikes :)seeeeexxxxxxxyyyyyyyy.The tire size was one of the things I considered.  I'm a heavyish guy and I'd really love to use it for camping.... I've actually considered using my kayak as a very heavy trailer and pulling it down to the lake for a camping trip.... though after 70 miles pulling the yak I might not be able to move.
that's not any less dangerous.More aerodynamic. All in the aerodynamics. A disc wheel creates far less drag than a regular spoked wheel. On track aerodynamics are more important than weight as it's (basically) flat and efforts are high speed where the biggest resistive force will be the air rather than the mass to be propelled. Someone with knowledge beyond me may be able to explain this better but I hope this helps a bit.What he said... This is the most secure public lock up i've seen... I'd love to see every parking lot in town have 50 of these.... or the amount proportionally correct to the number of customers they have. I hope you enjoy it, I stopped cycling for a good decade or so and only fell back into it because of a recent life style change. I dug out my dad's old bike, broke it and bought a new one with in a week because I was addicted.Eh, I'd rather ride with my girlfriend than bolt her on the back. Hang on, let me grow half a foot.Could you tell me the advantages of having a back wheel like that as compared to having spokes?"Wellgo".I never smeared the peer review system. Just journals. You can peer review an experiment without ever paying to get published.

Part of being a scientist is being skeptical. It's good that you're skeptical about unpublished works, but you should extend that same skepticism to your oh-so-revered journals.Looks like your bike goes in sideways. Like 1 prong through the front wheel. middle prong through the frame, and third prong closest to you going through the back wheel. Then close it up and slip your cable lock through the box and through the second prongs hole.
 Catherine Furnace is supposed to be pretty epic.

And your point is ridiculous, mainly because you don't actually know what you are talking about so can't form a response to said arguments, the peer review system is the best we have currently, is it perfect, not at all, but to just smear it because you have no retort is just childish.  Wierd, it still has at least 30, and it had more yesterday after I pumped it. If you think getting published in a journal makes something "scientific" you must be new to the "field." My co-worker wants to thank you for informing him about that.. he is swapping them over as we speak :)Only came here to say cat. Cat. Cat. Also it doesn't take much to flip the darn bike to drive side. I picked one up last week, slate color but also carved. Most comfortable saddle off the bat I've ever owned. I'm hoping it just gets better. It disappears under my butt. He is wanting $1000 but you need to be at least 6'2.He is wanting $1000 but you need to be at least 6'2.Thank you so much!Thank you!My dad crashed his bike into a culvert when I was a kid and wasn't wearing a helmet. . .he broke his collarbone.  Consider yourself un-scolded.He has also climbed Alpe d'Huez Yep. Tires only rotate around the rim if you ride it with like 5psi in the tire. Titanium SerottaWe race discs outdoors on track too but generally only rear discs as a front will pick up gusts too much.That's a great idea! Is this a serious question? You ride it all summer with dust and grit all over the place, cover it in vomit, wipe it off, and tuck it in like a newborn baby. Don't be a little bitch, Redcorns.

:P &lt;3I'm all for taking the lane for your own safety but I'm also cognizant of the fact that doing so pisses drivers off.  I've taken the lane before on a blind curve and then had a driver behind me start honking and punish pass me within inches of my handlebar as soon as I moved over to the right. I can see that being a thing. I personally don't care if they look awful, so long as they work well.Gonna upvote you!

In real life.

E: No Rafi fans on this subreddit.What's wrong with the picture?Thanks

Ah alright

Makes sense
I'd bet either the wire-rims of the tire are bad, or the rim of your wheel is bent outta place.

Even like 0 pressure, with the tube in there, you should feel a lot of resistance if you try to pull the tire down the rim. http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/972480/obama-rain-o.gif I think this is for track racing only. No sidewinds indoors. You get pushed. The back isn't so bad, the front is incredibly noticeable as that's obviously loose for steering. This setup is for an indoor velodrome (actually with a front disc too for qualifying) so it's not a problem there! Have you seen those things try to turn?Dolan DF4 Track Frame (inc. forks, headset, seat pillar): 1250

Mavic Comete/IO wheelset: I got for 2500 pair. They're about 4000 normally

I'll probably go to the store and check them out. Thanks!

I've been reading more about the MIPS technology. I suppose it's worth the extra $$ for the protection to my brain but there isn't much of a consensus on its effectiveness.To Americans, 'pavement' is basically the same thing as saying 'asphalt' - it just means the surface of a road or street.  We just use the word 'sidewalk' to mean 'sidewalk', and 'pavement'  for the surface of a road.Can it happen? Yes.

They're only held in place with friction, if you managed to overcome the friction, it could slip.

Realistically, it's almost impossible to do-the grip between tire and ground is never as strong as the two beads pressed into the rim over the entire diameter.I'm glad you're okay and recovered!  I'm curious what type of cycling you were doing?  Whenever I'm out on my road bike I've got my helmet secured.

But when I take out a [bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) I don't (since I typically didn't plan in advance to be biking) and almost no one else does either.  They're &gt;40lb bikes that are built like tanks and super stable.  Mandatory helmet usage has been shown to pretty much kill bikeshare systems.  Would you still feel the same way about those?With that paint job and that cloth color, the first thing that popped into my head was, "oh, hey, look, it's got its PT belt on!"  Hehe nice rig :)No, I am doing nothing of the sort, for anyone who works in this field it is quite apparent, as I clearly explained, that this isn't what data looks like, it has been thoroughly manipulated, not to mention this is about as much Harvard as a PR rep is a design engineer for Specialize.

And what study, as I clearly said the source goes back to a News Letter, not a scientific journal, there is no relevant study as it clearly was so poor as to not be publishable. Quick question about those back wheels...compared to normal spokes what happens when a sidewind hits you?  Just as a novice's intrigue, how much for that?But the amount of factors I don't have any control over changes drasticly between the situations.Don't insult other users.

If you wish to discuss this removal then do so through modmail: http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FbicyclingIn American English the word 'pavement' is synonymous with 'road'. OP is not riding in pedestrian territory.You're still misunderstanding.

Americans talk about 'pavement' as a *road surface*, not a pedestrian footpath. This person is actually cycling on the road, NOT the 'pavement' as we would know it.

What we understand as a 'pavement', they would call 'sidewalk'. When they say 'pavement', they mean 'road'.

When I pick up a bike from my city's quite large bikeshare system (DC), I don't wear a helmet.  (And neither does anyone else.  Are you proposing to cripple the SF bikeshare? Because that's what mandatory helmet laws do.)

When I'm running to a meeting and need to arrive without messed up hair and carrying bulky items, I might not wear a helmet.

When I'm running a couple of blocks down to the store and don't want to have to carry the thing around, I might not wear a helmet.

And I don't notice any difference in how drivers treat me, whether I'm kitted out for a weekend road ride, or in my suit and tie with no helmet headed to a meeting on Capital Hill.

Statements like, "but everyone who rides for long enough will eventually understand its just not worth the chance accident to not wear one" are not accurate or helpful.i like the term 'girl friending'.  It happens when we walk or ride anywhere- to the point where i'm worried people will think i'm being a jerk.  No matter what - i can be doing somersaults, she will match my pace 10 yards back. I've learnt to cover my tracks in this place hahaBut you have zero control over the actions of traffic around you in either situation.Came here to flip out about the chain tension. hah!The sidewalk still isn't on the road. My issue is that this nob is speeding down a pavement and mot a road.I guess I tire of threads like this. I have been involved in an accident where a helmet saved my head a good knock but I only advocate for responsible helmet use. Maximum Salt Level Achieved!They have said 105 Di2 is a long way away. The high prices on Ultegra and Dura Ace are still paying for all the research and development. [**@alispagnola**](https://twitter.com/alispagnola):

Every time hahagooby pls.
If you've got the photo on your phone or are taking your bike, they'll sort you out easy.I've heard mr tuffys tire liners get a bad rap and, apparently, cause flats for some users. But after a few flats in a row I gave them a try. . . and they were AMAZING!  That was my last flat.  No more flats due to punctures and no flats due to the product.  3+ years now and I'd never ride without them.

Get whatever tires you like and attach your own, reusable, puncture resistant layer.  good for you!  Set the goal ahead of time, but if you get out there and feel good- go ahead and do an extra mile or two.  You will start seeing huge improvements, that may outpace what you think you are capable of.  It never gets easier- you just go faster.I also want a trailer, but have nowhere to store it.  If you have storage space then get it!

You knew we'd never talk you out of buying bike stuff though, didn't you?Ouch! What are you training for?

I'm a pure track sprinter and this is going to be my qualifying gear for my race tomorrow. Feels heavy but can get it spinning nicely on a flying effort. Will be tempted to lower a bit for the sprint rounds though.Beautiful bike, I've been riding 49x13 in training for the past couple months, and my legs will still be screaming in pain after 20-30minutes.They have to make them ugly so the more expensive ones look better and seem more "worth it"You can use Hola.org extension for Chrome to set your browser to Belgium and use the live feed from Sporza. If you watch a lot of racing a dedicated VPN like Express VPN or the like (google and do your research) works. I live in Belgium, so I get to watch most everything live on TV.

The newspaper was reporting they will show the WHOLE of the race on TV this year. Welcome to 7 hours of continuous cycling from 9:30am to 5:00pm(ish). Thank you. It's like saying walking is dangerous because there are also some other people doing parcour and free-running.

Some of my cycling is less dangerous than taking a shower. I'll be not wearing a helmet for that. Comming from a daily helmet-wearer.You'd be right. It's an allen key tightened track skewer. That's a logo on the wheel, see OP's reply.Not seeing the quick release on the front wheel.I think every bike shop on Earth looks like that.Okay since you've opened the door to it I'm going to call you out on a couple of things.

1. Read my comment. Haven't tensioned the chain yet because I've just cleaned it up and was about to bag it up to pack for the trip.

2. That's not a quick release. The Mavic IO comes with an allen key tightened skewer as visible here: http://www.mavic.co.uk/wheels-track-io

3. Hey, try reading my comment again... If you think I was actually going to ride on this like that you're crazy. Those babies are going to be up to 220psi come tomorrow morning but tubulars are meant to be let down when in storage to preserve their life.


Anything else?Do you mean there's a large gap between the frame and wheel?

If that's what you're saying then you'd be correct about the multiple gears. The current setup is a 49x13 but I sometimes warm up on a 48x16 or race on 50x14 which pulls the wheel a lot closer the frame. If I was going to really go for an aero setup I'd take chain links out but when I'm switching between warmup gear to this qualifying setup in a limited amount of time I have to make do.Looks OK to me. I wish I had enough $$ to buy new wheels when the chain drops off instantly, destroying the rear disk and/or frame, the front wheel drops off due to the unfastened (wrong side, too) quick release [who puts a quick release on a track bike?!] And the flat tires, well, you never really wanted to use those wheels again, did you? &lt;/end_snark&gt; Pretty bike but is unrideable as shown.I had an old Aluminum Forza Vilano 2.0 that I've upgraded now to the point where there are no original parts!  The final upgrade was a slightly larger Carbon Fiber Frame :-)  The old frame (and old parts that I've kept) are going to be re-assembled for my girlfriend.http://www.cyclinghub.tv/livestreamOr: "Oh, when I go to the store it's a high traffic day if I pass 2 cars before I get there. Perhaps the chances of being hit by a car aren't that high if there are no cars around in a two mile radius?"

So yes: when I ride to work I'll wear my helmet because there are some high traffic areas on my 15km way over. On top of that I will be traveling at higher speeds.

For cars to accidentally kill you there need to be cars, no?because i thought you were riding on one of [these](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pompino) and i was gonna give you propsI wear mine, but it's worth remembering helmets are only recommended for crashes under 12kph.  Personally I figure it's going to reduce any damage regardless and would rather not belt my head on the ground without one.There's a link on the right side of the subreddit's page (if you're on web) with information about [this year's winning design](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vm4hf/and_the_2015_reddit_kit_design_winner_is/).I'm very glad to hear you are ok.  However, I do want to say that although we all know stories of helmets preventing catastrophes like this one, helmets are still being made to the same standards they were in 1993.  All of the advancements made elsewhere in the world of safety in the last 23 years but helmets don't get a bit better.  There is huge lobbying for this by the helmet industry because it would complicate things but outside of MIPS, there is almost no innovation.  There's even research that suggests wearing a helmet during a crash that is less than forceful enough to crack the helmet can increase your chance of head injury.  Supposedly this is why head injury and helmet usage seem to rise and fall together.  I know multiple people who have had accidents and spills on their bikes. Little scratch here and there, a trip to the ER now and then, but they always, consistently say "I'm glad I was wearing my helmet".

Will it save you from getting run over by a truck at 40MPH? No. But it will save you when you're going 10MPH, look down at your shoe for a second, and end up in a road crack that dumps you ass over teakettle onto the concrete. Your skull is fragile, and concrete wins. Your chance of accidents per mile is not independent of the miles and the way you choose to travel those miles.

Chance of an accident per mile going to the store at 15km/h is not the same as doing the very same mile at 42km/h.

Chance of an accident per mile, both at the same speed,  where one mile is in the middle of dense, high speed traffic with lots of intersections and the other mile is on a towpath next to a canal where no cars are allowed will not be equal.

It does matters if I do a mile in my jeans or thirty miles in my lycra because all involving factors are completly different.

So yes: I wear my helmet daily for my commute, and on serious rides. Not when I'm just going down to the store. It makes perfect sense.

Statistics don't make sense if they are misinterpreted.Freaking Mavic.Someody her height does not belong on a 55 (most likely) but also probably does not belong a 48.Bro. I get ass pain when i ride with a backpackNot for MTB, it was like riding a pogo stickIsn't the wheel too into the back? Even before having the chain tensioned? Is it because you run multiple gears on it or it is supposed to be like that?Yeah, so I've purposefully avoided wheels and tires up to this point because I know people switch out wheels pretty often.  That makes it pretty hard to track reliably on my end without some kind of additional context, maybe via ride descriptions.

Trainer rides as well, at this point I just assume they are the minority (for everyones own sanity I hope that's true), and figure for something simple like this it that it will come out in the wash.Not a stupid question at all.

Normally they don't come with a cassette.

Cassettes are quick and easy to change, you just need a socket wrench, a cassette tool and a chain whip.

Or just a wrench but it's easier with a socket set.Virginia Creeper is off of 81 near Damascus.  Not super exciting, but it's a ride, and is pretty.  Not a loop though.There's a design contest held.  :)  The winners are printed and made available for a limited time.  There's a link on the right side of the subreddit's page (if you're on web) with information about [this year's winning design](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vm4hf/and_the_2015_reddit_kit_design_winner_is/).Indeed. Not many of the countries in that region feel the need to constantly push the blame and responsibility on to the cyclists. I don't think Bern still sells the G2 but I'll keep an eye out for that feature since I'll be riding around in Seattle.Pavement = road, in this case. An American would say 'sidewalk'.Yeah I'm more of a commuter than long distance biker. I just want to be protected if I end up getting hit by a car and fall on my head.
So the image is a reflection?

Horrible horrible advertising It's not only the Dutch. Belgium is quite good at this too.I have sold hundreds and hundreds of bikes. I love excited customers, I love it when I help find them their perfect bike, I love it when they come back for the one month tune and they have already ridden the shit out of it.Statistically you find yourself closer to home way more often. Every trip/walk/... starts outside your door. So naturally chances of being in an accident closer to home are higher.

Every bike trip I take there is only a few streets I pass twice because I try to start my trip home, but also finish there. Chances of an accident happening in these streets are likewise twice as high compared to it happening in an other street.

It doesn't mean that the area around your house is more dangerous.Agreed. I feel like when I take the lane I piss off drivers even more and they make it a game to almost hit me...


This is never going to end... people will always be jackasses until the punishment become severe.
One public hanging of a cyclist murderer might do the trick. But until then, ride safe :)All that's left to do is put air in the tyres, tension the chain and turn the front wheel around because I've just been alerted that Mavic have put the directional sticker on the wrong way round...Found the non-americanWe're everywhere! What do you ride metal detecting guy?I want that cycling Jersey A road bike is definitely faster than a mountain bike on road.  Obviously though, slow joe on a god's own road bike will get his ass kicked by a pro team rider on a mountain bike.

If you put slicks, or semi-slick tires on your bike, you'll move a bit faster.  Obviously not recommended if you spend a lot of time on single track.After tuning it up thoroughly, I sold my wife's entry-level roadie to a spin instructor whose sole road experiences has been granfondo charity rides on a walmart BSO.  She had been saving and saving, and this used bike was her reward.  It's a great feeling putting others on the road.If you stop in Harrisonburg, stop by Shenandoah Bicycle Company. The staff there was super helpful and helped me find some rad, local singletrack in the area.What is the best way to watch this online in the USA? I know that Steephill.tv is good for replays but is there anyway to watch it live?They areYou could keep the cassette on the old wheels if you wanted different tires easily available, but I wouldn't keep the cassette on the old wheels for "emergency".  It's pretty easy to swap a cassette.

You do want to make sure you get a wheelset with the correct freehub body though.  Sram and Shimano use a different one than Campy.  You likely have Sram or Shimano though, which is the most common.Thanks! Glad you've had a good experience with them!If that's the case then grand! Also, as far as instructions go, pedals are one of the few parts I'm fully confident with replacing myself so that's no bother! (The other being wheels, spokes notwithstanding!)Going at top speed on a pavement sounds like an awful idea.If it's the same pedal, the OEM likely just comes in a plastic bag rather than a box, and may be missing instructions.That's silly giving names to hills and bumps like that :)DC doesn't look too bad.  And I'm really surprised Seattle isn't a complete waffle iron grid.  What's up with that?What ass?&gt; inherently dangerous activity

&gt;cycling, snowboarding, kayaking

I wouldn't group cycling as inherently dangerous. there are different types of cycling.

* Cycling on the Road - I'm going fast and if I come off I will hurt myself, best wear a helmet
* Mountain biking - I am going to fall off, best wear a helmet
* Having a relaxed cycle along a cycle path on a lazy sunday afternoon - Yeh.. I don't need a helmet for this one.

When I'm longboarding or snowboarding you bet your ass I wear a helmet. When I'm walking down the street I leave my helmet at home.

I'm all for helmets, but you need to gauge what the risk is and what is appropriate in each case. Saying that cycling is dangerous is just plain stupid. Magura rim breaks - right in the feels, oh, the memories of trials riding.I agree the numbers seem inflated, but keep in mind the calorie curve isn't linear, though, because effort increases the faster you go. There's a big difference in terms of kCal expended from going 17-18mph to going 20mph. Its not just "if I burn X at 20mph, I will burn X/2 at 10mph".  &gt; Even when I take the lane there are drivers that still pass way to close. Its the responsibility of the person overtaking the other to do so safely.

Upvoted for this. Taking the lane doesn't deter all aggressive driving maneuvers. Just yesterday I had two drivers overtake me way to close in the span of 3 blocks while I was taking the lane.The best place is the local bike shops, *and take her with you*, at least to look at models/sizes/colours, etc.
To encourage cycling they should 'love' the bike, at that age(?) that usually means "it has to look pretty", and should be easy to handle.
Don't be surprised if the ribbons on the handlebars are decisive, even if she likes another model more (but doesn't have those), or maybe it's the paintwork.
Be prepared for some 'artistic' accessories (or paint/sticker-work).

4'6" is probably 'children' size, those often come with 20-24" wheels, which look small, and they want an 'adult' bike, don't object (too much) against 26" wheels, she might grow into it pretty fast.

If the area is flat-ish, a single speed should do, otherwise a 3/8-speed internal gear hub, *don't buy her a derailler system*, they *will* try to change impossible gears while pedaling backwards.

She needs to learn to 'look around' for safety, a 'racer' is the worst model for that, a straight-up(-ish) seating position is probably the best choice.

Walmart seems to sell crap, your LBS might have a suitable 2nd-hand in the back of the shed, or can advice on 'other' sources.
If you do buy from the internet, unless you are a mechanic yourself, arrange for your LBS to assemble/tune it.

I wish I got the 4Nice, I guess.  I will get excited when they announce 105 Di2.

Edit, a word.I'll carry it on my backpack, bottle cages
Very occasionally I suspect drivers to cut into my lane very aggressively out of malicious reasons. But I think usually it's a combination of seeing a "slow" bike in front of you that they want to pass as soon as possible and the idea that they can easily squeeze by a bicycle riding on the far right/left of the road. If a cyclist rides in the middle of the lane it's usually more secure:

  - Cars behind you are more likely to perceive you and will see you earlier. (The ones that are currently texting will probably also hit you, when you aren't taking the lane.)
  - Cars have to change their lane to overtake. They are less likely to squeeze by and then cut you off when turning right/left a few meters down the road.
  - Cars trying to turn into your current road can perceive you easier in the middle of the road. You also won't get hit by them if they enter the road/bike lane partially.
  - You can avoid the door zone completely.

In conclusion it's just not reasonable for cyclists to bet their life on every driver not to fuck it up. I'd rather piss of a bunch of ignorant drivers behind me and avoid having to bear the (probably deadly for me) consequences of the bad drivers' mistakes. They're isn't anything you can do against the psychotic drivers that endanger you intentionally in any case.&gt; I really cannot see a situation where you'd be cycling on a sidewalk at any speed

Sweet bike.I have a lot of long distance riding coming up this year and I find it more comfortable on longer rides. well I wouldn't.i always tell people to fuck off whenever they use that argument, partly because i'm also a driver and pay my car use fees (registration, maintenance, emissions testing, fuel tax, etc.) so even by their fucked up logic, i'm entitled to using the road....and partly because they're assholesThe only way to reduce these dangers is to always take the line (bike lane or not) and ignore all the honking behind you.I was always wondering why bikes sound so different in the gopro videos people post to youtube. Then I realized that that's just how a bike sounds minus the wind at my ears.No. It's just a thin coating for comfort.  I'm not even sure how it's applied.Maybe,  The flame is too small.

But,very nice bike particularly that's color.

I have Speedster S30 (MY 2011), same color.A local coach/wheelbuilder/riding buddy sources his carbon alongside some of the "boutique" manufacturers here in the states. I'm not talking Zipp, ENVE, but think smaller/local operations that throw unique branding on very similar looking wheels.

Anyway, I got a pair of Yishun 50 mm, 25 mm wide clinchers laced to White Industries T11 w/ Sapim CX Rays (20/24). I'm about 195 lbs. The wheels are super stiff, spin up real quick, corner great, and stop pretty damn well. I wouldn't use any carbon clincher if I was going to be doing a bunch of climbing/descending, it's just the nature of carbon and heat displacement. He stands behind them and will offer lifetime spoke replacement, truing (if ever necessary) and rim replacement from the manufacturer in the event that something terrible happens.

He's done his research, as have I. If I was doing a super technical descent I would go with a wheel that has an alloy brake track. For everyday use and light descending, you really have nothing to worry about. Use carbon specific pads. Modulate your braking. Go fast and have fun.&gt;pro-brain-damage brigade.

He could have rolled down his window and said "Hi", but yeah, not much to do at a red light.  Plus, if there were other cars behind him, they might be waiting for him to turn right on red.No, it's not that. Cyclists are free, fast, flexible, quiet, outside in the sun. We have more fun, are in better shape, and don't poison and threaten other people. And we save money and resources. It makes them feel bad and they want to pay back.

Parked cars is just drivers' turds and they're not having fun. So they leave them alone.It's illegal where I live. I got stopped by police when I did this between a pedestrian island (an elevated patch for pedestrians in the middle of the road when there's a crossing) because the street gets narrower and it's impossible for a car to safely overtake me there but yet they still do it. Luckily I managed to talk myself out of getting a fine.They are exactly the same, just come in a plastic bag not a box. Have been using two sets for years with no problems.Man... I liked the crossrip... you'd think trek would fix a mistake that stupid.   That said, the only thing I liked on it better than the kona was the shifters and that might have just been an adjustment thing.
It doesn't happen often but I know what you are describing. My bike is almost silent when riding with the wind except for the most satisfying hum from the tires. It's such a great sound.  The near complete silence of the whole world except for that soft hum from rubber meeting road.

But then I realize I am riding with the wind so I will inevitably be riding against it.

So I do anything I can to avoid the wind and find the hilliest way home.Why not both? Even when I take the lane there are drivers that still pass way to close. Its the responsibility of the person overtaking the other to do so safely.Original Marathons (now called Green Guard) are pretty cheap nowadays, here in Europe at least.With an HRM and power you can start to get quite accurate.

With just an HRM you can get estimates that are close-ish and average out over time.

Wind and hills make a mahoosive difference. Strava's calorie count includes hills (known elevation) but cant take into account wind.

That said, I've lost weight down to my target at the speed you'd expect for Strava's estimates being accurate (With every calorie and exercise tracked and an estimate of my BMR honed over time).

I've then maintained a steady state weight based on eating to those calorie burn figures. Where I've gained weight from lazy time, the weight gain corresponds to what I've eaten, and is lost at about the rate expected.

The whole process relies on a stack of nested estimates - which means it can only be accurate over long periods, but having tracked this for 14000 miles of riding, over a year, if Strava figures were out by more than a few percent over a long term aggregate average, I'd be able to show that in my bodyfat percentage and gross weight.

anything branded dt swiss will be great quality - those guys don't mess aroundI LOVE my bike shop - and for some stuff they're great. Found and fitted a new crank arm 10 minutes before close on a weekday, and were very reasonable; I think about 12, not cheap, but considering it was last minute, and they fitted it on the spot right on the nose of closing shop I can't complain, though I'll hit up my bike co-op when I fit my own parts (pay for entry, use of tools is free etc).

I'll always buy big parts locally (they contribute more to the shop's takings, I can try before I buy etc), though their stock is pretty sparse for some things (they don't do a lot for non-racing riding after bikes, sadly). Pedals though? No qualms about ordering online! No, we don't need more groups based on sex, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion or any other divisive shit. We need more groups of *human beings* doing things *together*.It's April 2 in Japan only 85% effort? Hardly trying :)

Seriously though, your figures should be closer to accurate than mine.

There are situations that wind and weather conditions can make a massive difference (Do 50k into a strong headwind - I can FEEL I've put in a hell of a lot more effort but it wont show on the track).
They don't take into account temperature, clothing and air density (it's easier going in the warm than in the cold, wearing full winter gear is more constricting, heavier and less aero than summer kit etc)

A circular course should negate the wind effect, unless it was ludicrous wind. Racing kit negates the clothing issues and the course was to all intents and purposes flat, and for every up there was a corresponding down.
Congrats stereowhiz!! I'm always glad I got the REI credit card because the dividends and the additional amount back from the CC funded my spring tune-up/refresh. Tires, tubes, new chain, new saddle, even tires and a new pedal setup for my singlespeed. Can't fix his own derailer, but thinks he can fix an entire country.Strava's calorie estimate is typically about half of what Wolfram Alpha states, once you factor in wind.  Wind and hills really make a huge difference in calories burned, but without a HRM and/or power meter, it's impossible to do anything but estimate.At least your cat knows what's up and is facing the right direction.
Nice cat. Cool bike. &gt; That seems like a pretty high markup

That's pretty much why I find it hard to buy stuff at a local bike shop, yeah. Markups are insane. But I've grown more willing since I bought a bike from a shop.Well judging by the vast majority of people who have had no issues whatsoever with their kits, I'm going to guess that the mods didn't pick poor quality kits.I simply wouldn't ride in that green bike lane since it *is* the door zone.Just as an FYI to you and any others linking directly to Strava.

When you link to your own Strava profile you give people a chance to see :

* What you look like
* Where you live
* What bikes are in your stable
* Possibly your IRL name

Things you can do if you want to protect your privacy when sharing your Strava info:

1. Just take a screenshot of what's of interest, and then post the image
2. Make sure you have your [privacy settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/privacy) on Strava set to have a fence around where you live
3. Don't put the actual make and model of your bikes in your Strava profile.

Here's a race from the other week where I spent most the time on the front: http://app.strava.com/activities/272393219

...just about 1000 kj/kcal per hour @ 22 mph. Strava's HR (fastbeat) estimates are a little higher, and 1466 is way off. That seems like a pretty high markup, but I suppose with all the packaging, shipping costs add up eventually!Or huge ballsOh come on, you inherit a beautiful Campione D'Italia Bianchi with full campy and post non driveside photos? Shame on you! I agree with you completely, but If i might add to what you said about perception of the helmet and clothing...

Honestly.... I want cycling to look as good as it feels. I want people to view cycling as attractive and easy, not dorky and dangerous. If not wearing a helmet is more attractive to people and gets more people on bikes then I am pretty much all for it. That said, I've been riding for most of my life, if one looks at the broader global cycling community you'll find it increasingly more difficult to find veteran cyclists who don't wear a helmet. If it saved their noggin once out of a thousand times then it was worth it, right?

Sure, advertise cycling as safe enough to not need a helmet if thats what gets people started on riding, but everyone who rides for long enough will eventually understand its just not worth the chance accident to not wear one. &gt;I can't help but feel that that big a difference must have some impact on the build or manufacture quality

I don't think so, 50 is probably the MSRP, discounts of 40% are common with bike parts.Specialized Armadillo Elite: http://velonews.competitor.com/2014/04/bikes-and-tech/reviews/reviewed-new-specialized-condition-armadillo-elite_323343/r/titlegoreNo, but have an upvote for your pussy.Oh man, what I would give to be you. I'm a bicycle mechanic and my shop shares an alley filled with crackheads always coming in looking for the most ridiculous type of shit. Most of them just try to steal from me anyways, half of them are banned but new one always seem to turn up. Anyways, most of them steal bikes or peice them together from stolen parts to get around town. It's so prevelant here that the police even have a term for them: G.M.O.B. or "g-mob" = Grown Men on Bikes. They cruise around town selling whatever and they use bikes to get around and quickly evade cops. Me simply wearing a helmet lets both police and your average driver know that I'm not a 'g-mob".

I know it depends on where you live but drivers treat me with more respect when I wear my helmet where in my area. Perception!&gt; You should need a license to bike on a road

I do agree with this to a certain degree. But when I consider that most road rules and signs are part of mandatory education (you know, so kids survive as pedestrians)... it's not as necessary as it might seem.I've done 200 miles on my non cut-out c17, which I picked over a b17 as I wouldn't have to worry about rain or upkeep of it. Once adjusted right it's been very comfy but I was amazed how a small adjustment on nose height took it from comfy to owwww that hurts. LBS really helped with a tip of riding 10 miles after an adjustment to get the feel of a changeSnip from my recent UWCT tilt, can confirm:
http://i.imgur.com/nXv2D9P.pngYep. 40 minute per 10 km is a killer. My best is like 55 min/10 km, and I'm a pretty fit person, and I feel like dying after that hour. Or moving more weight requires more work...

Pretty basic physics, put me and someone twice my weight on a stationary bike and they will burn more calories. That's just flat out not correct as a flat statement.

The heavier you are the more calories you burn no matter the exercise you have more "work" to do to move the weight around, this is pretty basic.

Beyond that the numbers do not match real world figures. The headline "733 per 30 minutes" is pure wrong.
On the flat I can maintain 20mph pretty much indefinitely - remove wind and hills from the calculation, they skew everything. It's not a high impact speed.

I diet and eat according to the Strava calorie burn figures, sourced from rides uploaded from a garmin 800 with HRM (no power).
Those figures are "about right" for me, the calorie burn + measured food intake corresponds roughly with weight loss and gain (roughly is about the best you can expect, there are too many variables). I've been tracking like this for about 14000 miles - so I've enough experimental data to be happy the figures are right and I ride enough that if it were noticeable too high or too low then that would show in weight fluctuation.
I also use the same tools to drop weight when I've had a week or so off and been bad - and it works like clockwork.

Looking at some history, Strava thinks 4.5 hours at 20.2mph was 3000 calories.

looking at their data I'm 127lb - so they think I should be burning 990 calories per hour at 20mph - or 4455 total.
It looks high by about 50% - which is more than enough to have shown in my diet and weight gain / loss over the last 14 months ish of detailed tracking of diet, weight and exercise.

&gt; This is not just Americans though. Everywhere in the world has the bystander effect, and everyone experiences the normalcy bias[1] to some degree.

Sure. But: in Europe, you are trained in giving emergency aid as part of getting drivers licence, and are **obliged by law** to stop and give aid to those involved in an accident. If you don't, you might get very, very fucked (as in prision time).I love it. I tried refurbishing bikes as a side business but discovered that the only way to profit is to be a complete scumbag. Nowadays I buy 20-30 year old bikes that have been abused / neglected, get them back in shape, and sell them at cost. It's a great feeling putting together a bike which is likely to last decades and selling it to somebody just for the cost of parts.

Last night I came across a dreaded FAG bottom bracket - the cups are 100% soft, crumbly plastic and impossible to remove with a tool. I ended up cutting them the fuck up with a hacksaw and hammering the damn thing out.

I'd rather take the photo (and "sweet" karma) any day of the week.
the hole might be a wear indicatorWTF kind of stupid reasoning is that. The question you ought to be asking yourself is why would Reddit (or /r/bicycling mods  specifically) choose a poor quality brand for their kits?The drivers who overtake you too close are usually pretty aggressive in the first place, so when you gesticulate to them they are usually pretty aggressive in return. Like most bullies, they hate it when someone fights back.scary.  If a lower temperature resin is used, the resin can reach melting point during descents where you are riding the brakes hard.  If this happens, the sidewalls of the rim will fail -which can be unpleasant on a descent.  I have had this happen on 2 different rims I was testing.  I would be VERY cautious about using no-name Chinese carbon rims.  You are taking your life into your own hands.

I think that ongoing maintenance of the site is a much more fitting memory of Sheldon Brown than letting it die. This joke included.Your right ..perception matters and right now the helmet and hi vis clothing say "holy crap this is super dangerous please don't hit me...its only a matter of time"

There are so many more deaths from cars that its silly to try to compare but the perception is that me riding my bike is far more risky then anyone in a car despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary

Perception is everything and right now the biggest enemy of cycling is the viewpoint that its an inherently dangerous  activity done by weird people who are not like the rest of us

Until that changes it will continue to be more dangerous then it could be That is so cool
Congrats on sourcing road levers for the v brakes.



Obviously there's a heavier bike passenger-side.It's no fun at all get some decent lights and keep pedaling though. or wap out the trainer.Mum get the camera Absolutely not.This is largely [superstition](http://cyclehelmets.org)Seems nice, just don't forget to ask for "papers" or whatever would one call it.More importantly, what stops you jackknifing on the way down if the trailer has a fairly heavy load?When I was a kid one of the few things that persuaded me to wear my helmet (other than being shouted) was that my dad always use to wear his. Then I saw his helmet and bike after he wiped out on the way to work and now always wear mine.

Consider yourself scolded.I've done several thousand miles of touring on a set of Schwalbe Marathon Plus tires in 32mm without a single flat.

That said, they may not suit your style of riding.Just to take issue with this little bit

&gt; which is a reason why you see so little helmets on cyclist over there.

Personally, in England, I can say that people cycling without one are certainly in the minority.  'So little' is definitely not accurate.  Europe is not The Netherlands!

I can't speak for elsewhere in Europe though.but its in the [rules](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/)Statistically accidents happen closer to home anyway. So if anything, you should wear it more for the down to the shop rides. I just sold a 1 year old Felt 20" wheel MTB which was my sons until he outgrew it this month.  We kept it in great condition, and we got a good price for it.

But most satisfying was the happy look on the 6 year olds face as they rode off to the local park to try it out right after buying it (we just had a whole new park built in our town with a big cycle friendly track).

That was after I'd of course talked his/his mums ear off about how important it was to dry it off properly before putting it away, and locking it up right, and not putting it down on the derailleur side etc.I mean, I still love you..... Yeah, but even then. It seemed like he had enough time to react. But, you never know. Can be hard to tell in footage. This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.

I let my brother borrow it when I got into road bikes and it turned into sitting in his garage for three years untouched. I had him ship it out to me a few weeks ago via Amtrak. I took everything apart, cleaned and lubed it, threw a Brooks C17 on it, as well as some new bar tape and chain. I'm in love with it again for sure. I forgot how much fun it is to ride fixed. That feeling of total control of the bike can be mesmerizing. Also sneaking up on unsuspecting people on a silent bike at 25mph is fun too. In my experience, crackheads in don't bike.WHAATTTT!? How does one possess such a jersey?I like Bern's. More utilitarian than most cycling helmets. I have the Bern G2. All season helmet. It has closeable vents so I can use it year round. Snowboarding, kayaking, rock climbing, cycling, any activity that warrants a lid.

Enough vent in the summer that it's not hot, changeable liners that I can close the vents and pop in the winter liner that covers my ears for snowboarding. Absolutely love it. Hope this overview of my setup is useful.

I have two rear wheels, one for outside and one for the turbo trainer. For a normal ride I'd want to track wear on my road wheels, road tyres, road cassette, chain, chainrings, brakes. For a trainer ride I'd want to track wear on trainer wheel / tyre/cassette, chain and chainrings.

There's no braking on the trainer, so no brake wear and I would think reduced wheel wear. The front wheel isn't doing much, so no tyre wear and much reduced wheel wear? However, the drivetrain is still getting wear.

This might be an uncommon setup, so not worth catering for. Can't.
To talk you into a trailer, they are usable for (very) large 'stuff' that doesn't fit on a bike, and extra weight on the front wheel makes steering more difficult.
The downside is acreage to store it.
Yes the bike makes the difference, as many have said, a road is going to be much faster than a mountain....

All comes down to the motor though. I ride a 29er and I'll consistently pass guys on full on carbon roadies. Group of 4 guys on Cervelo's, full team kit caught up with me on a ride the other day, bout 2 miles in I dropped them.

That being said I've been passed by guys on full carbon, full kit, looking like they aren't even trying when I think my eyeballs are going to explode. It doesn't get easier, you just get faster...That's cause hitting a parked car will do more damage to their car than hitting a cyclist. I always like to say this when it comes to any inherently dangerous activity like cycling, snowboarding, kayaking etc.

The internally routed cable ports have a messed up angle that causes the cables to cross over each other.  Shifting problems like no other. My Trek LBS won't carry them anymore.  I've turned mine into a single speed to compensate.

Kona Roves are wicked though.  1st: be safe; control the scene; I mean don't get hit standing in the road. If you have to move an injured person to a safe sidewalk, do it; don't become a casualty yourself. Stop traffic if you have to. Then call 911; where *exactly* are you? -who's hurt? -do they need help? -are they conscious? -man, woman, how old? Check for breathing. Don't let the person walk around; they can fall over from shock. Talk to them; ask simple questions; if they're not answering correctly, treat for shock, i.e. sit or lie down. Shock is weird: people go thru stages; denial is usual (I'm OK); rage is common. Can't give you a Red Cross course here, but anyone can take them. Maybe some schools offer them. I strongly encourage anyone who goes out in public to get at least a basic course. Maybe the guy with the camera didn't signal that he was getting on the sidewalk/slowing down?Just do like me and don't ride a bike and drink heaps and become a fat bastard for 2 years before you finally get around to doing something about it.I'm probably going to get scolded but I don't wear my helmet when I'm on my hybrid and sticking to the trails. But in my defense here in town you can stick to trails and at most just have to cross a street and on my hybrid I'm just cruising usually with the wife or kids not moving fast. On the road bike I always wear my helmet. Deep down I know I probably should but averaging 10-15 mph I don't get enough air flow and it gets hot up there Yep.. I imagine it would be how celebs feel having every weirdo and his brother come up to talk to you every time you walk out onto the street "yeah... I've really got nothing to say to you so I'm just gonna go now &gt;.&gt;;"Quick calculation tell me it's roughly the pace someone runs for a 2:36 marathon time. The 20mph speed on bike is not even close to the same effort.I've got both.  They both work just as well, but there are some weight savings to be had with the folding tire.  You probably wouldn't notice the difference of 100 grams or so, but maybe the placebo effect will help.  I'd just go with whatever one was cheaper.  This cannot be me, I am black! Down here in Australia I'm preparing to be plunged in to darkness this Sunday :(Though there's obviously many thoughtful drivers here in T.O., there seems to be a disproportionately high amount of fucking shitheads.  Honestly I'd gotten fairly used to it until I went overseas to bike through Ireland.  It was night and day, all the drivers were WAY WAY more patient - not to mention friendly (I actually had many instances of people coming in the opposite direction on long rides waving hello).  Within 24 hours of getting back in Toronto I had been cut off twice and screamed to GTFO the road by two greasy ass kids. It was like night and day.

 I'm used to it again having been back here a while, but still - I see lots of aggression and stupidity on our roads on a daily basis.  It's ridiculous.



What can an untrained pedestrian do though? All I can think if is make sure the airways are clean and perhaps check for any major bleeding. Is there anything else?

I've heard they don't corner very well in the rain, but I'm never going fast enough into a corner in the rain to notice - and the aggravation and money they've saved me by not having to change a flat *EVER* is worth every cent.

I build bikes as a hobby (mostly 40s-60s bikes), and selling them to a person that will take care of it and love it feels so good.Very good. You've now demonstrated that adjectives (and prefixes) describe that there are differing levels of comfort.

It is still the same concept. If it's not a matter of comfort, as you said, why, then is your argument that the height will negatively effect the comfort of the ride?
I've had 28mm gatorskins on my commuter / touring bike since last year.  It's yet to get a flat, and still goes like stink.  I think they're worth the investment if your looking to avoid flats. personally.

Seems like a good deal for 400. See if they will take 350 and meet in the middle if not but 400 is a decent price. And when you sell it you won't take that big of a hit.

I use to have an alloy synapse and sold it for 700. Loved that bike. And it was a 7 as well. momNo prob! I think it's a better bike for your money, especially with that discount and Nashbar will ship it mostly free. Just pay attention to the sizing, if your local guys have a size their recommending with the silverstone, you'll want to compare that bikes geometry to the Nashbar geometry.

With the current (horrible) conversation rate it still be a great deal. I live In Windsor so I would also if needed be willing to drive to detroit to pick it up smuggle it back in to Canada and hopfully save on tax (13%).

Treadmills are a great example of an alternative solution to running outside in a cold weather winter.  second, is the wear and tear on the roads.  If a road is never driven on, it still requires maintenance to keep it safe, crack free, and clean.  That cost is picked up by state and local taxes, license and tab fees, and gas taxes.  If less people drive, the roads will still require some maintenance, and that has to come from somewhere.

The gas tax in the U.S. is too low.  The carbon costs are not accurately charged in all things we create and burn from oil.  I get that, but the fees for a car (in MN anyway) are based on the age of a car, and the newer the car, the more expensive your yearly tabs are.  That is downright silly, as a newer, more efficient car pollutes less than an old beater.  If we charged more for gas taxes, those who drive/pollute more would see an increase in their taxes, and those who drive less and bike more, would see a decrease in taxes.  That doesn't mean that when we get to no oil burning cars on the road that no maintenance will have to be performed, it just means that the costs have to be picked up elsewhere.Get it on the frontage road and pedal in the wind!One time a guy passed me too close as we were both just about to turn right.

I've noticed it easier to maintain a higher speed in road orientated bike. In my case its easier for me to maintain 30kmh on my cyclocross than my mountain bike.

General rule is that the better rider goes faster but when you switch bikes you will notice a difference.
You won't automatically be able to cruise at 40kmh as soon as you hop on a road bike.

I've noticed that a more aggressive geometry is better for muscle recruitment and actually feels more comfortable when putting in some effort. If you've ever ridden a chopper bicycle it can be frustratingly difficult to get to a high speed.Some things are provided free because the increased quality of life provides a bigger return on investment than the money they'd get in user fees.

It increases tourism, increases desirability of the area as a place to live, and can provide a source of revenue (and thus tax money) for local businesses -- bike rentals, shuttle services, and the inevitable ice cream shop, for instance. Not to mention the benefits discussed in the article regarding a healthier population, lower pollution and congestion if you get commuters, and so on.

But really, it depends on where they're touching. You want the electrons to see the path of least resistance as the other paddle. If it sees a low potential a short distance away, with conductive cream making the skin not a great insulator, and another low potential at say the foot, then the ratio of resistances of the two paths is going to be hefty, and the person touching the foot wouldn't ground out much of the current.

So, i'm perfectly fine with this fair share stuff, and the government paying me to cycle :)These stats are skewed. The vast majority (I'm willing to bet 100%) of people wouldn't burn 733 calories under the most strenuous situations you could find on a bike.  Not to say it's isn't high.Road funding comes from other sources than just user fees, especially at lower levels of government. In my state, much of the funding for county and town roads comes from local property taxes and the 4% county sales tax, and these roads are where I do most of my riding because they're much less busy than state roads.I do this in my tiny little Suzuki yellow plate.  Only thing I have to watch out for the drops hitting the frame - I wrap a thick towel around the frame for safety's sake.Another carved rider here, same experience. It's a great saddle once you get it adjusted just right :)as someone who can ride at 20mph solo with not an insane amount of effort..... jogging at a 40 minute 10km pace is a lot more effortWhat temp does CF usually delaminate at?  In direct sunlight, cars can get up to 170F according to the NHTSA, although that's probably in a glass bowl of a car parked in Death Valley on a sunny summer solstice.  Some pro riders had issues with wheels delaminating coming down descents in the Tour of Oman stage 5 this year - but that's using rim brakes.

Combined with (just leaving it for days on end) UV exposure, wouldn't that adversely affect the CF?Well,   couple of times ive been riding an  had to apply my brakes rather hard ( car ran stop sign ). Applying a rear brake hard enough will cause a skid, which i used to my advantage and slid my bike 90 degrees so my body made a slowed side impact instead of a head on collison. My head bounced against the side of the van and because i was wearing a helmet i was perfectly fine. This happened two blocks from my house in a quiet neighborhood. I was going downhill and had the right of way. Point is if it helps one time out of 100 tthen to me its worth it.

Edit a wordDebatable. The old Specialized Echelon, which looked almost exactly like the Prevail, was noticeably heavier on my head, just wearing it around in the shop, trying it on. Over any sort of distance, that would be something you notice, mostly in your neck/shoulders. I'm not exactly knocking a cheaper option, but I definitely think this is one of those areas where you get what you pay for.does the cotton soak up water/sweat bad?So who is camera?Nothing wrong with that.Allez gang Looks like trainer rides where the app doesn't shut off the GPS once you've changed it over 'stationary bike' mode...Don't you like paying your share for things you enjoy? I pay for a state park sticker, I pay for a cross country ski pass, I pay for sports season tickets.  I can walk/bike/snowshoe on the trail by my house, that is maintained (cleaned, kept free from downed branches, plowed in the winter) for free.  That isn't fair to those who never use it.  If I put on skis I have to pay, and I'm told because of the groomer, but it really isn't any different than when they street sweep the trail in the summer or have to use chainsaws to clean up after storms.

I could go either way with it.  I am fine with higher taxes, no fees to use parks and trails.  I am also fine with lower taxes and fees to use.  I don't like the sometimes fees and other times no fees, especially on things that have a measurable cost to maintain, like bike lanes on roads or paved trails.correct. left &amp; right side. Take a womans' bra off; no time for modesty here. if you have a hairy guy, there's a razor in the kit; yes, shave the hair for good contact. *no one* can be touching the person being defibbed; that'll ground out the circuit. so put the gel in the case on the paddles; attach the paddles; wait; zap; a voice will cue you; the voice will tell you if you have a beat; if no beat, wait &amp; the AED will recharge &amp; tell you to go again. simple. I find these numbers very hard to believe, even taking into consideration the variables like wind, elevation profile, etc. With this logic, at my average of 17-18MPH over 2 hours on my weeknight rides I'd be burning 2500 calories, which is more than I eat in a day. On my weekend rides, averaging 16-17MPH over 4+ hours, I'd be burning more calories than I take in over the entire weekend typically. That's twice as much as Strava claims and I usually divide their estimates in half to get a more realistic number.

Cycling does burn a ton of calories compared to other exercise, but 1400 calories an hour sounds pretty ridiculous to me, besides the fact that someone who typically averages over 20mph is going to burn a lot less calories than I would, given my high average of 18mph.Harvard isn't the one manipulating anything, this blogger and you are.

The experiment was never about establishing a baseline caloric burn for different exercises.

The point of the study was to compare the differences in caloric burn for individuals of different weights performing the same tasks.

As you can see from the table, a heavier person needs significantly more calories to bike at 20mph, but this difference is much less on a stationary bike (lower in the table). This suggests that aerodynamic drag is causing the calorie discrepency, because heavier people take up more space.

Again, you're misinterpreting the data.

Not a bad build, new 105 looks good but very weird set-up for traditional bars.I have one of those stems. It was on a sweet 90s rigid KHS i bought recently. Anyone interested in buying it? :Pyou must be new to cyclingProbably the best thing to do now (if you're in over your head) is to take it to a LBS and have the look at it.  And have them explain to you what you did wrong - that way you can fix it right yourself in the future.And in typical reddit fashion you took a pic at reasonably close range and said nothing.Not as funny as carrots, right? /sPolyester?

Well, stop using an acronym and I might have a decent idea of what it is.In theory, yes, but are you going to tell me that $2,000 carbon race wheels on a $1000 carbon race frame is equally as unreasonable as putting racy $400 wheels on a ~$800 bike aimed at a beginner demographic? I guess a few cm in any direction isn't hurtful. In this case, though, it's spoiling all the fun of a bike ride.Yeah, security &amp; vet here.  It's sad how people fall apart at the 1st sign of trouble. Maybe school's need to teach a little safety course each year of school. The only thing certain in life is, there will be trouble. And thanks to you for staying at your job; I'm sure you've helped many people. I love everything about them. Significant difference from the stock Oval 950F carbon wheelset.. Anyone else immediately scroll down to see what bicycle he was riding?  It is a nice table, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions, which completely invalidate the numbers.

For instance under what conditions are these people riding, on what bikes, in what weather, one would assume laboratory conditions, which either means a track or treadmill, that doesn't simulate the real world properly, it is flat, it is uniform, it will have a far lower rolling resistance than the road or off road, and wind resistance, on a treadmill at least, doesn't exist.

Which brings you to the bike, just tyre width let alone any other inefficiency will drastically change the amount of energy to do the same activity.  Add to this the fact it is rather conveniently close to the running 10mph figure, i.e. exactly the same, even over different weights, despite cycling being way more efficient once you are up to speed, it all becomes completely farcical that these are actual scientific results as they have clearly just used a multiplier to change the figure from one weight to the other irrelevant of the activity rather than measuring it, there is a reason the source of this data goes back to what is essentially a news letter, and that is because no scientific journal would publish such shoddy data manipulation, which then of course leads you to question how the data was even obtained, because if it isn't via a method that would lead to publishable results it is probably just as poor as their data extrapolation practises, as they say, Junk in, Junk Out.

I kept my old cassette on my old wheel to use on my trainer, along with an old tire and the special skewer.

But in general, it's not worth hanging on to a cassette that's worn out.You never shave your legs on race day.She's not that tall (172cm).You know the expression about re-inventing the wheel? If you're not one of the *one billion* people who cycle, you'll have no idea if you're re-inventing the wheel.

My advice would be stick to the things you know. 1/8th of the human race cycles on bicycles which are mostly unchanged for over a hundred years. You've gotta be pretty brilliant to think of what the rest of us havent. There are patent wars and wind tunnels &amp; CAD to get even the most marginal of gains.

Maybe if you had a more direct experience with the sport you might have a eureka moment. Its fun.

I feel like this is the athletic version of carpet-bagging. Sorry If I'm coming off as rude. But its offensive. A freaking stick or rock can accomplish what you're trying to do. And you'd know that if you'd ever worked on a bike at the side of the road. Man, I am fat and weak but I have to absolutely bust my ass in order to average 15-16 mph over a 30-45 minute ride. 20+ mph is doing real work, it should burn calories.An April Fool's joke.Where's the fun in that? :DSo far it hasn't been too bad, but I'll keep my eye out for the pro-brain-damage brigade.Having been a 911 dispatcher you would be amazed at how many people don't know proper first aid and will do more damage then good trying to help.

Now I feel like a dick.OH LOL! i meant to post this one which is mine http://i.imgur.com/F1xkdc1.jpgWhy would you want that part to be horizontal? Won't the rider fall forward?

Edit: I understand what you mean now. But the middle part of the drop bar doesn't look like it is good for hand placement, and only the bottom part is. So I think the angle of it is good, although it is more difficult to access the brakes.TRAIN!! ..no waitIs it too late to say April fools?You should check out [ISM Saddles](http://www.ismseat.com/) too, something like the [PR 1.0](http://ismseat.com/saddle/pr-10) or [Century](http://www.ismseat.com/saddle/adamo-century) is great for long distance riding.Welcome..

I hate when people honk at me unexpectedly while I'm concentrating, so I appreciate your reticence. look at [this](http://sheldonbrown.com/images/bolttypes500.jpg) image. i think youre saying that the brake caliper youre using wants to attach like the picture on the left. this requires the hole in the frame to be slightly larger on the side opposite the caliper to accommodate the "counter sinking" nut.

i have drilled out the back of the hole in older frames to solve this issue, as you described. and i'd do it again. sometimes i draw fire on reddit though for telling people to do things like that. so ill just say that nothing bad happened to me as a consequence of that procedure.It actually increases your efficiency because you are riding in the camera's draft.do you really need all those tools? What would you recommend to an amateur who wants to clean his bike?Hello my fellow shitlordOn RAGBRAI I got the most comments on the Reddit jersey. Based on your bike and your description of it, I'd say we could be best friends. This is not just Americans though. Everywhere in the world has the bystander effect, and everyone experiences the [normalcy bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) to some degree.

But yeah, its pretty scary how people just won't step in. A big part of first aid training is trying to overcome those things by teaching you to take charge and give people jobs ("you! Call an ambulance. You! Find a defibrillator." "You! Apply pressure to this wound while I do CPR.") if you're the first person on the scene, and I think that's a good thing.The image being a reflection is the only way the kid could be in the left lane.

You're either shaky on how mirrors work, or on your left and right.  (Protip: your left hand is the one that makes an L.)15mph on a mountain bike is pretty baller. See if you can maintain it for an hour or more. It doesn't typically work that way in the USA.

Registration fees go to both the county and the state (or weird 'Regional Tax Authorities setup for various reasons).  These are typically once a year - money goes 20-80% into road funds, the rest to general funding.

Gas taxes are state or federal.  Again, a mix of this money goes to road funds, the rest to general funds.

Finally tolls are typically collected at the city, county or state level and go directly to road projects.The bIke and parts don't really affect that. It's just mileage. Chains and cables stretch, and tires and brake pads will wear out. Cassettes and chainrings will go after a long time. Replace when worn. Yeah i dont think its going to do much of a difference. The flashy paint job, not to mention the fork and disc brakes are sure to catch any potential bike theif's eye.Love image in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/slowottawa/status/578195029652578304)Don't buy these!!!

He loves it and had zero problems with it sinceriding on the sidewalk can be just as dangerous. there's not much we can do if a motorist does not practice proper defensive driving. if i ever feel uncomfortable with drivers passing too closely, i ride more towards the middle of the lane to force drivers to change lanes. this can't really be used in busy traffic though.&gt; Truck has a train horn

Does your window go down? Looks like you were stopped right next to the dudeI'm not him but I've been touring with, and just riding with the Cambium for for over a year now.  I always used a B17 prior, but not any more.  With the Cambium on bumpy trails or roads there is a trampoline effect that softens out lots of the harshness.  I didn't really notice it until I went back to my B17, which has zero give.  The only downside to the saddle for me is I really like the smoothness of the B17, and being able to effortlessly slide around in it.  But now that I'm used to the Cambium that's not much of an issue.There are huger end tektro brakesDain bramage is sexyHope you have good health insurance Awesome ride! What kind of GoPro mounting system do you have going there?It's pro to say helloYes, I would.  A frame with a new downtube and a frame with a week old downtube are the same.I am a cyclist who believes cyclists should pay to use the trails and roads.  You should need a license to bike on a road, it should require a road test and a fee.  In my perfect world, no cars simply bikes and mass transit, trails still cost money to maintain, especially in Minnesota, where the weather destroys asphalt.

I'm fine paying my fair share.  I like biking on trails.My tendency is to put a rider on the bike that will give them the most fit flexibility over the next stage of their life.  For riders who are interested in tri, or road racing, or just express interest in being fast, I tend to size them down so that they have the flexibility to get into a lower, more aggressive position.

For riders who are more interested in endurance events or who are older, I tend to size them up and lower the stem on the steer tube, so that they have the ability to bring the front end of the bike up as they age, or if 100 miles brings back pain that 50 miles does not.

Ironically, this has the effect of spacer stack on potentially racier riders and stems slammed on old guy bikes.How tall is she?  I actually most often see women who belong on a 55 or 56 but are on a 54 or 52, because a shop was reluctant to put a woman on a bike that big.I think it is the length and angle of the stem coupled with the stack height of the spacers. Too common an experience. Everyone should be able to recognize what an injury is and be able to respond correctly by the time they get out of junior high. When taking my Red Cross AED course, the teacher told us about an eleven year old girl who properly deployed an AED in an airport and saved a man's life. How many adults even know what an AED is?The average American is no way equipped to handle emergencies. I've seen this all my adult life, since I got out of the service. In the military you never do nothing; you always do something. People in cities  have simply turned their lives over to: police; EMS; security officers; bosses; politicians; school teachers. Having ceded personal responsibility in every aspect of public life, it is no surprise that bystanders are helpless to do anything when something unexpected happens. I've had to respond to too many situations where people simply had no clue what was happening and didn't know the difference between a sprained ankle and a heart attack. People (and drivers are people) are entirely too sheltered from real life by TV and movie tropes that show the hero flying over a car and landing on his feet, gun in hand.  Not 1 person in 10 is actually capable of giving 1st aid or even recognizing a serious problem in an accident. Seems a shame. Totally get this. I just keep my redditing to myself.The headtube seems massive. Could be the angle?Jeez. I think that analogy is a little extreme. Just trying to toss ideas around, not like im bragging about revolutionizing the cycling industry. But thanks for the advice. It all helps.No, they usually don't unless it's some combo package being offered by the retailer. And getting a new one depends on how worn it is. I wouldn't get a new one just for the sake of keeping the old one on the old wheel as an emergency, the process to move it takes just a couple of minutes. "one of the most defining features of the mamachari is brakes that go "SCREEEEEEEEEEEECH!" when even slightly feathered, startling everyone within earshot"

my steel 10 speed does that too, it's a great safety feature.You're an idiot&gt;putting wheels that cost more than half the bikes original price doesn't quite add up to most folks.

When you think about carbon wheels sometimes the wheel price almost equals the bikeYou are right, wearing a helmet does affect driver perception. Drivers view cyclists wearing the magic plastic hat as impervious and pass them more closely.Oh they are... Thanks! MSRP is $3550 USD
Same rider on each? Yes.

I average 3mph faster on my road bike than on my Hardrock.  That number is likely even greater when I'm on my Stump Jumper.  They are built to be more efficient.  The price you pay is in suspension and traction.Wait, what?  Why did you repost the same picture?Someone's been 'mirin.I know right? Being caught in the small ring is never a prideful moment.Yup, a Zee shifter is just an SLX painted black.

But I also have waved/nodded/smiled at dudes who respond by looking at me like I just stuck my finger up their wife's ass... so I know that feel.

Let's just all wear mirrored sunglasses and call it even.I'm actually planning to buy 5 new bikes...I did!I ended up thinking it was that Hangar too.

I nearly vomit every time I see something Chive related.[Try watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45llr44Pu9g) this video and see if you could figure out how to fix that brake problem yourself. If not, taking it to the LBS never hurt. Saddle issue could either be you're still breaking into it, something wrong with how it's set up, or you just need to try a different saddle.

The pedal problem can be solved as simply as practicing more and getting better at it or just investing in a different pair in general. The ones on my road bike are weighted so they're almost always facing upwards ready for me to slip my foot in. Have another friend where his pedals are like paperweight and are never the right way so you have to force it upwards with your foot. Pretty sure none of those pedestrians helped at all. They all just stood there and looked at the person laying on the ground. If that person had even the slightest chance of living they weren't going to get any help from the passerbys. I know it is a bit off topic but back in the day I had this skinny GF who used to ... well, skinny people can suck, too.Physics and biology we could be friends !How do you fetch beer on that?

Ymmv. Forrest?Figured what out? Is it just a drawn out joke?Popped the star nut, sounds like. Can confirm. I just got a brand new helmet for my birthday and I was so excited.

The Cinelli Zydeco is brand new. I sold my road bike and bought this because 1) I signed up for the [Hilly Billy Roubaix](https://www.bikereg.com/26404). and 2) I'm not a fast enough racer for the marginal gains between this and a road bike to matter. If I get dropped, it's not because I had slightly more tire clearance. Anyway, it's got 105 components and an aluminum frame.

Cars have become wombs wrapping drivers in a sound proof cocoon free from weather, noise, vibration, and all earthly concerns. I exaggerate, but I look back at times when drivers always had a window down, no radio, and the car communicated to the driver thru' the road and engine noise. I find riding in very modern cars to be eerily disquieting. Most cars have better sound systems and more comfortable seating than my home. After a short ride in a car, I can't describe the stops I made or the turns I took; but I can remember the bike ride I took to the mall last week in every detail. Cars turn drivers into an unengaged  automaton.Well, my transaction went smoothly, but reading the experiences of others in more recent times has made me lose confidence in them somewhat, especially after hearing their forums are heavily moderated too.

"I wear my helmet for long or serious rides, but if I'm just going down to the store I don't bother."

But statistically this doesn't make any sense. It doesn't matter if you do one mile, or thirty miles, your chance of an accident per mile remains the same.It's not light.At the time, they thought it was just the funniest thing.Thinking of doing it myself...  Only downside is I live on a HILL. Yes, this one should be in Caps...  Even with a super-low MTB gear it's still a lot of weight to get up this HILL.  Willing to try, though...  Sorry I couldn't help...  :DYeah my thoughts exactly. I have a lot of spare parts, but frame, wheels and brakes are going to run me about the cost of that whole bike.[/n/](http://boards.4chan.org/n/) has as much to contribute to the world as /r/bicycling.Thanks for the reply. The fit should be good, I think, the local shop did the hours long pro fit.

 Im still working on my position. I'm putting in as many miles a possible.

It was just depressing seeing my speed drop that much after months of riding on the hybrid.Thanks for the input. I like to run my wheels pretty high so it sounds like these might not be a good fit actually. Ill keep looking for a nice frame/wheel set in the mean time.Yeah I don't know why people were expecting you to get out of your car and shake his hand like you're bros. You're at a red light. Not much you can do aside from honk, scaring the living hell out of him.I bought a frame and all of the trimmings to go along with it from them about a month ago. Everything went over quite smoothly. Let me know if you have any specific questions!**He is not one of us!!** ^he ^hasn't ^gone ^through ^the ^red ^light.You could always block me! :)Thanks for the input. Im sort of nervous about throwing 500$ at someone who doesn't speak English and never getting anything. That could be a nightmare to handle yea I will have to order one of those. no biggie. Actually I just took the brake calipers off the donor bike and put the new rims on and every thing reaches and works, one thing though, the new brake caliper has a mounting system that is just a bit too wide for the frame hole thats there, would it be too unacceptible to take a dremel tool and widen the mounting hole just a little bit?That's pretty amazing! My cyclocross bike was the same price for a full alloy frame and fork with Tiagra, but I didn't get mine on sale.

Enjoy the sweet ride OP!Well then.....Abs with discs?Could be

-lower rolling resistance on road tires

-more aerodynamic riding position

-they spent a bajillion dollars on their bikes, they better be faster than a mountain bike!Brook's racing saddle? So weird.  It's like a doc marten making racing flats. Lighter bike, better bearings with less resistance, muscles heart lungs trained for the exertion.I wear my helmet all the time. Even when I go cruising with my buddies on the vintage beach cruisers. They make fuck but honestly, I don't care. Glad you're OK OPIn my 3 years of reddit experience what you say here has not been the case. But, I'm glad that you can experience it in that way. I try to, and mostly I can curtail my experience for the better (more faith in humanity that is), but often I am let down by the overwhelmingly present prejudices that are constantly reinforced by many users of reddit.Plyometrics have helped me with my sprain, might work for you as well?I live a busy life. Part time job, go to college,  write for a popular music site,  bike 20 miles per day... yet every five months I take time out or my schedule to go on reddit, browse a few threads and leave just two comments before I leave again, and here you go, wasting my second comment.  Feeling cheeky now bucko? You should look into getting a bike fit done. The cockpit setup looks a little unorthodox to me. I feel like it's an amplification of the bystander effect: not only do they think that someone else will take care of it, but by driving their so focused on their destination that their "I have somewhere to be" overpowers their "maybe this requires my attention."Drivers show more respect for crows than they do cyclists. It's strange, when daylight savings time started everyone around me was bitching and moaning about it. "It's so dark in the morning." These people don't like to be outside. They go to work and then go right homeIt's really awesome. I love how bright it is. No worries, I get it. I wish I had taken pictures, my mom threw out the helmet because she didn't like thinking about her precious baby smacking into the ground and I don't have the x-rays anymore.

I do have video of me trying to do shit with the casts on, my friends took it and it's hilarious. Schadenfreude at its finest. If I can find a way to upload it I'll post it.This was a strange conversation to be witness to.It's not like they're secretly the same company or anything...Yep, it'll work!This is exactly why I want a CX bike, because they can do it all.got any pics? Not that I don't believe you.problem is that the people who spout this shit are too lazy to read. Was a hi-ten frame with a carbon fork less weight than going with cromoly for both frame and fork?

I guess I'd have gone with a better frame material, and just upgraded the fork later if I couldn't afford it now.

Edit: Looking at their site, they don't offer a hi-ten frame, is this the cromoly steel frame?Thanks. I better think about how adjust my parents position. I did. He was skeptical.Original guyI don't see it.You better believe it!
Hey, there's guy driving a car with a Reddit window sticker. Maybe I should talk to him. Nah, that'd be too weird. I'll just take his photo and post it on the internet.Tinkoff-Saxo Bank camo training camp kitsHaha good call. That would have scared the shit out of me.I'd just go straight through Zhongwei (whose frames they are) and skip the middle man. Either that, or go another manufacturer like Deng Fuhttp://tricyclesforadults.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Komodo-Cycling-24-inch-6-speed-3-Wheel-Adult-Bicycle.jpg 4chan in stylei like reddit.

it is beautiful it is a place of total equality. where every one is free to have there say

and every one has a place, the good and the bad.

its one of the places you can see there are bad people but a hell of a lot more good ones.

there will always be one person who says fat people suck but there are 94 more who will downvote him.Truck has a train horn. You wouldn't have liked me very much! Next time I will say hello - hah.Speaking of which, where can I purchase the 2015 kit?&gt;I feel like if I try to piece together components, even used ones are going to run me more than this for a decent build.

With the 21% off, it's going to be hard to get below this if you build by yourself.


105 Groupo @ Merlin Cycles: $350

Avid BB7r @ Amazon: $110 f/r

Wheels : $200+

Puts you at $650-700 and you'll still need a frameset and bars/stem/seatpost/saddle/tires.

Only way I can see you getting a better deal is through Bikesdirect, or some very careful shopping for last-season CX bikes.
If I wanted to watch your daily commute I'd subscribe to your youtube channel. 21 videos in the last 30 days, or 1 video for every workday.  Go start your own subreddit instead of spamming /r/bicycling This one looks like it won't rattle or crack and can be easily cleaned. Probably fits snugly so there's no harnesses needed either. I guess ingenuity still trumps cash in some places.Had ptsd for a while; start to shake when I heard cars overtaking me. It got better. It seems to me drivers have some hugely developed sense that their cars are an inviolable space they are reluctant to leave. Pedestrians not so much. I've seen many vehicle accidents where drivers just roll by without a glance. Had a friend T-boned at same intersection a year earlier. Hit in the afternoon and knocked onto the grass verge. He laid there unconscious 'til nightfall; no one stopped. When he told me about it, I was stunned. Can't wrap my mind around why drivers are like that.Well, did not expect to see my ass on reddit. You could have said hey instead of just paparazziing and running! Someone later in the ride honked and waved at least.I'm just here for the pornography.Ah yes, an endless day of faceplants. count me in.Yeah, us city dwellers are practically cheating. It would be more of a challenge NOT to ride my bike for 30 days.The soft ride was fine, the real disappointment was that stem.There was the [Ritchey Lite Beam](http://mombat.org/MOMBAT/Bikes/1995_Ritchey_Lite_Beam.html)She just likes the fuji better.
Little bit more expensive, but I LOVE my Specialized [Vice](http://www.specialized.com/us/en/ftr/helmets/mens-mountain-helmets/vice)Is this TREK 1.2?Hey, that's me!where da cat doeI was actually reconsidering the child seat that I bought for my bike after I saw this. Seemed a little over engineered.Without ventilation that's gonna be one steamy helmet.You go faster than you would on your own. If you're the stoker, you can watch the scenery without worrying about what's in front of you. If you're the captain, you can make the stoker massage or scratch your back. It can be frustrating though, especially if your partner prefers a different cadence. damn itThat kid clearly needs a Styrofoam funny hat.Zack?Yea the frame is Reynolds 853 which is apparently one of the lighter types of steel tubing without getting into exotic and much more expensive materials.  I got it for a good deal at $120 with the original aluminum fork,  headset,  stem and bars.  I had the carbon fork so I opted for the swap to avoid the harsh ride I read that the alu fork gave. That's really sad and I'm really sorry to hear that. :(That's what I thought when I first saw video. I was thinking: "Oh I guess he didn't see the guy from his angle." But after re-watching the video you do see the guy turn the wheels left as if to go around. But yeah who knows really. He might have genuinely not seen the victim.  What's more sickening is when it's promoted by shock jocks and seen as humorous by a culture addicted to its cars.  The number of hit-run collisions involving bicycles that go un-investigated, or if they are and the perpetrator does get to court, the penalties are usually insignificant because jurors are car addicted idiots.I always thought there should be stem cap attachments like a headlight or phone mount... albeit one a bit closer.like you don't about anything?Yep, one of these http://www.on-one.co.uk/i/q/CBOOPOMPKOJ/on-one-pompino-drop-bar-urban-bikeXXXL/r/fatpeoplehate checking inRule #12 my dear fellow.I've ridden the carved (slotted) version for six months now and out of the box it has been by far the most comfortable saddle I've owned. Years ago I tried a B17 that was supposedly pre-broken-in and couldn't stand more than 30 minutes on it. Since then I've used a Selle An-Atomica and had been a strong proponent of their saddles but the carved Cambium is now my favorite. I have a Giro Savant and can only reccomend it. Awesome helmet and it doesn't even look that bad ;)the fire nation attacked?Yeah, I know what you mean, my dad had a lime green speccy enduro ex demo. This though was just a demo bike for the shop, they rent it out to people for the weekend. I think orange do custom paint jobs for an extra price, son the stock ones are black, silver and white, but they do a range of other colours for extra. You can check them out on their website I figured it out...but it was work. There was no tension in the cable. Had to take the brakes apart to see that the screw and spring work together. Once the screw was backed out too far you lost tension and thus need to take it apart. Jenny?Got it, I try to be on the bike every day.  And I'm not exactly 'gentle'.  Its starting to sound like alloy is the way to go!

I'll post some of the options I'm looking at once i get home.  Thanks very much for the thoughts.hit by a car 20 years ago at a busy T intersection by a stop sign runner &amp; knocked from bike lane to the yellow line. When I came to a couple minutes later, the first thought I had was 'why hasn't anyone stopped to help?'. Had to stagger to my feet and drag the bike into the bike lane while drivers sat impatiently in their cars. There is something about driving that cuts drivers off from the rest of humanity in a way I can't reason out, but it is there and witnessed daily everywhere.They chose who they got the kit from.  I've had that issue with more than one primal kit.  So it's reddits faults...or the mods That's a cool looking bike, I love the color!You don't seem to realize how a camera's wide DOF along with an offset viewing angle can severely change the look of the image. It looks pretty flat to me if you ignore the taping.  So it is an optical illusion.This is nothing short of the most incredible bike I have ever seen and will ever see.DUDE.

WHAT.

THE FLAMES.

HOLY SHIT.

THIS BIKE IS AMAZING.

How much?

Never had gold, I'm not very good at reddit. :-PTIL if you're in an accident, pedestrians will help and drivers will try to quietly leave the scene. Also, every driver should carry flares and lights and an emergency first aid kit in their car and know how to use them.I read that as 'narwhal barcons.'  Now I want pointy shifters.Why not both?[Already exists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe-U2E6Cw8w)This just reveals exactly what percentage of people are criminally stupid, to be honest. The systemic disregard that most people have for other people is sickening.Well he couldn't say  "No" and "I hope so" in the same conversation, now could he?This prank isn't harmless so I can't support your endeavor. Embro on the balls is excruciating.Nancy Grave will be all over it.

Edit: Grace, not changing the original typo so the reply still makes sense.You'll give away the surprise shitbrain.
Maybe that hacker does. He's going to murder her with a pool cue and run round in circles on her body until he's got all her money.If only something about him could give an indicator of how the relationship will turn out. Oh god, those are on all the pickup trucks here. I also ride just about every day.  It's just for fun muh man.....$1210 out the door.Oh man, you're exactly the person I need to hear from. I want to ride the entire Colorado Trail on a hardtail this summer, and I'm trying to figure out what saddle to use. Yours is at the top of my list right now. Let me know how it goes! I bet he's faster than you, too.It is great, keep it up!My housemate dates a guy with a really shit Rockstar Games logo tattoo.Very nice! What kind of deal did you get on it?
It isn't as good as any other U-lock, whatever that means in the first place, it is 14mm rather than thicker or thinner ones that range from 13-18mm, it is of course on the lower end of this range. I don't know how good it is, but it is on the lower end and can probably easily be cut by standard bolt cutters which really require 16mm or bigger to hinder their capabilities.

It really depends on the security you need, it will be perfectly adequate to stop amateur thieves, but if you live in an area with a large amount of bike theft it probably isn't up to much, then again if you live in that area leaving a bike outside worth stealing isn't very smart in the first place.Needs more drillium.I'll have to take some when I get home from work!If only I could unsee!

Thank goodness the UCI cracked down on bicycle designs or we would all be riding wacky uber aero, nonsensical bicycles.

I do love this bike as a piece of history and would certainly not turn down a spin on her.  Sounds good.  Thank you for sharing.Drivers give more space to parked cars than they do to cyclists.Great! I'll let him know so he can fix that. Thank youThis style, not so much.  It's made of of vulcanized rubber and cotton.  It's really comfortable right away.  I have a hardtail mountain bike and this takes the impact out of all the bumps.  I'm going to go test it out on some Colorado singletrack for the next week.  Is your bike actually called a pompino?I forget. Maybe Pac NW; one car with broken windshield, really messed up. They strung saran wrap between pillars under an over pass. Hard to believe saran wrap would do that much damage.I feel like he might have not seen him since it happened pretty quick and wouldn't be in the line of sight BUT there is a slight turn in the wheel as if he was going to go around. I'm not sure what to think.
So you mean nothing at all?&gt; "The hardest part will be cracking down on bootleg viewings and visitors randomly looking up and seeing it."

that's easy to fix just build a [ha-ha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha-ha)

would need to be a big one.I have one! its aluminum and really heavy tbh. I sure do with i found onw with that paint job! http://i.imgur.com/X6ZgOU9.jpgJust get an 11-speed on your next bike. It's an expensive upgrade.think about how hard i'm gonna mash gears when i'm back on the road.

my injuries tend to be those that require rest, so i primarily focus on that so that i heal properly Not any more! I get pings occasionally and I don't have gold.

"this bike cost me nothing it was a gift"I do believe it only pings you if you have gold. I may be wrong, but I'm going to bed. God speed friend. I have unleashed a whirlwind upon you!I think they've kept the site updated over the years. It's a fitting and lasting tribute, imo.Ohhhh. I was wondering if that was you.

And now you've summoned her, great.there's a phenomenon called "girl friending" where your SO always seems to stay about 50 ft behind you no matter how slow you ride - tandems overcome that entirely.  they also fix the issue of one rider being significantly faster than the other in a pair.  if part of the reason for riding is to spend time with your partner a tandem can be a fun way to do it.  I did over 5K miles tandem last year and they do go really fast, they let me take my wife on rides she would never have been able to go on otherwise, they attract a lot of attention, and I'm basically having a lot of fun with it.Some random girl from Tampa added two tall strapping lads from across the pond on Facebook. /wave /u/charlieburgers Right on it is too bad they couldn't see customer loyalty when you contacted them the first time, have you thought about taking to them personally about the defect?  It would be where I start, if even just to see how they price a frame if you just wrecked yours I beleive a majority of frame companies do this.  Just wait and find something a bit bigger. Hit up your LBS (local bike shop) to try out different sizes to see how it is, and ask their opinion too. You might have 10 minute rides now, but eventually, I bet, you'll want to ride more and farther.Do you know where that happened? I didnt know it could do much to cars. Scary thing is, sounds like something I would do as a kid being naive and stupid. Please come back later and offer a review.  I understand they have a break in period.So, this is the Bicycle Blue Book [value](http://www.bicyclebluebook.com/SearchListingDetail.aspx?id=22610&amp;make=750&amp;model=63309&amp;year=2011). I would say it definitely puts leverage in the buyers hand. I don't think $400 is a bad price for it if its in great condition, but you could probably get it down a little bit.

Just make sure it fits, so you're comfortable when you ride. That should handle a 70-mile ride no problem as long as its comfy &amp; in decent condition.I thought I knew you from somewhere. Where do I know you from?that or you could have said "No"actually if you just tilt your wrist up a bit, it's very easy to tell what direction you're going to turn.  The bigger issue is turning right, not everyone looks for a right hand coming out for a hand signal.

*edit can't tell left from right.
I actually own a pair of these, they are quite bright and easily seen by others.  I use them when riding with others as the trail rider on a group to let traffic know we're moving over or turning.  I've not had any issue with someone not seeing or understanding that we are about to move.  I think the combination of hand signals and the bright lights work really well.  I wish there were more people that had them when i'm riding in more popular areas, it would make my life easier when following people.
From a marketing perspective, if people responded to your 'center of gravity' argument, we'd all still be riding steel frames instead of aluminum then carbon &amp; things would be exponentially cheaper.

From a more practical perspective - locks, water, beer, laptops, groceries, clothes, shocks, cheap heavy frames - when people *do* ride around with more weight, that weight generally preforms a necessary function. Flipping a bike over to work on it is too easy to dedicate extra weight to.

You work harder, you fly faster. Thats the payoff for biking instead of squats in a gym. Anything that detracts from that payoff which isn't necessary isn't desirable. Hi Joe. :PI'm 6'1 and at 195 currently. I'll check those out. I'm not getting into any racing anytime soon. Still have a long way to go there, so I suppose when I start shifting more towards that kind of crowd I can look at a more racier wheel set.
Thanks for the taking the time to reply and offer advice. They come in different sizes.. Usually the stoker is pretty adjustable (long seatpost and an adjustable stem)I'm preferential to gross anatomy.

Like reaallllllly gross anatomy.6'8" here. Let's get a tandem.I'm not really sure what you're trying to achieve with a swap.

First off, there's nothing wrong with riding in the middle ring of a triple.

Second, why does your rear shifting frequency bother you?

Third, if you're sticking mainly in one chainring and shifting across the cassette, it sounds like you have a great setup.  If you switch to a compact double, you might end up having to shift front and rear more frequently in order to duplicate the gear range you currently have using your middle chainring.I see Zipp wheels. What's the frame?Drafted a tandem for a metric charity event a few years back. Freshest i'll ever feel after such a long ride with a 19 mph average. It's like drafting behind a semi.The first time I saw that page, it was not Apr 1.  So I kept reading and thinking are these guys serious? Why not just buy a new chain? Then I figured it out.It'd be an interesting way to shave for sure.No one will ever see you coming with that camo!I like science...

Biology is my favorite. So it's been a whirlwind week, largely thanks to /r/bicycling and /r/strava.  We've gotten a gaggle of new users, a little bit of press, and a ton of really good feedback.

We've since last week pushed out a new profile page (shown in the image), where you can update your information and the service intervals for each part, support for international phone numbers and simplified entry of those, the ability to disable notifications that you don't want, and a few other tweaks behind the scenes.

Based on the plentiful feedback we've gotten, the plan for the next week is to show either KMs or Miles based on your saved preferences in Strava, and to add one custom notification per bike, so you can enter in whatever name you want, whatever interval you want, and we will have to pick some common hashtag to use for it.  I'm open to suggestions there, of course.

What else? What would you all like to see?

If you haven't checked it out yet, head to www.pedalwrencher.com and let me know what you think.I'd prefer to start with something cheap and upgrade parts slowly to things I like, rather than get more expensive generic parts from the get go.I might actually buy this. I can't tell if you're trying to trick people maliciously or if you're an idiot who doesn't know the difference between embro and chamois.

Either way...don't put embro on your genitals or taint. You'll only ever make that mistake once.How big are the hills near you, if you are a relatively unfit, such as at the start of the season, you aren't going to be able to sustain much more than a 5% grade with a 34-32 gear ratio, even less with a 34-28.

Personally I feel that it is rather irrelevant unless you are racing, the weight saving is negligible and a triple allows versatility, I ride a compact and there are many times I have wished for a lower gear, it can also limit the routes you can take if there are hills you won't get up.  They get posted here fairly often. http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/search?q=softrideVery nice. Should be a comfortable ms150 rideI got this Cannondale Synapse 3 an a Giant OCR3 for $400 on craigslist- both in really great shape.where can i get one of these?I saw a Salsa tandem on display at a company I was working at.  One of the employees said a couple rode the Continental Divide Route on it.  I guess it would be pretty good for that.salsa warbirds are pretty nice.  Unfortunately you can't keep decent bikes locked up outside for any length of time.I have gone through a set of Corsa's and Master's (clinchers) and they are definitely not the most durable tires but the ride quality is great. I get about 3000km (maybe a bit more) out of a rear (if you are lucky not to hit glass!). I avoid using them in the spring when there is all sorts of crap left on the roads from the winter and only mount them in the summer.

Tubulars are a different story in my experience. Would not buy VF tubulars again. $120 per tire, only rode them indoors on pristine brand new wood track surface and the rear stopped holding pressure after about 400km and the front conked out at about 800km. No damage to tread either.Thank you!ooo looks like they changed their site since last time I looked. Before you could only get items if you ordered a frame. like the checkout portion was completely locked out.That sucks, man. One thought: It might be covered by your parent's homeowners or renters insurance policy. That sounds fantastic. I'd love to be on a tandem with someone else really strong and fly along. Problem is I'm 6'5 and getting a tandem that would fit me and someone else... hmm..[Hey, we have the same shirt!](https://youtu.be/V5Z_ZducwbQ)Pockets? Those are really inconveniently placed hand warmers. I see one light and a reflector.Yeah but that would make him spill mom's spaghetti all over the handlebars.k, noted. Thanks.I use deodorant to minimize chaffing, it works well enough.Not sure if these are the exact same as OP, but they look very similar to the [Velobuild 50mm rims](http://www.velobuildmall.com/vb-r-50-20-carbon-fiber-light-wheelset-50mm/). Velobuild also now has 60mm rims as well.I have a little bag on my top tube and I keep my phone there- easily accessible but away from sweat. I used to keep it my saddle bag, but one time I needed to call 911 while on the move and I couldn't get to it, so now it's within reach anytime I'm on the bike. I did a century once without it and my cheeks were raw from chaffing. So yeah, PUT IT ON YOUR BUTT and maybe a little bit on your balls and thighs. Anywhere that's going to chaff really. Once told someone I was reading Reddit. He said "Ugh. Isn't that site full of kiddie porn and stuff?"

I don't tell people I'm on Reddit anymore.Sure, [why not.](http://youtu.be/PYwiwbgMusY)1. Yes

2. Probably, they go for over 700 MSRP new. Just depends on what shape it's in.Does that mean I need a new bike?One time i spent an entire afternoon feeding the internal cables on one of those someone had carelessly yanked out. I did get to test ride it though, it was fun.You should have at least 3mm or so of spacer (or stem) above the top of the steerer tube. This is needed to properly tension the headset.Yes. This is very important. Without this the OP can't properly tighten the headset. Riding with a loose headset will, at least, damage the bearings. At worst it can lead to a broken steerer and all the problems that brings about.Thanks Alexander. I will stop by the bike shop tomorrow and grab a tiny spacer.With my KCCO stickers on my bike, helmet, and chamios.Wish I could take turns like him :PspaghettiI'm pretty sure anyone with a vague knowledge of what 4chan &amp; reddit are already knows this.  The secret is keeping the rest of the world in the dark &amp; away from the seedy underbelly of the site.

Now, if you will excuse me, I'm off to check out the seedy underbelly....for science.Awesome thanks! I'm sure I won't be going there anytime soon but perhaps this summer.
lazy screenshots

http://imgur.com/a/Wi3uQYeah, I currently have a paper thin one on my Trek. It doesn't look like it's necessary but without it, everything was just loose. Can I get a tiny spacer, like 1mm?You should of run him off the road and yelled at him for making you late.  That way he could submit another asshole cager text post.I tried it once. Key word being once. [This](http://sheldonbrown.com/chainclean.html) has always been my favorite of his.The wheelset looks like the biggest problem for a commuter bike but that's up to personal preference.  Some guys would dig some big fat Schwalbes at 40 psi on their commuter rig.  Smooth.  Might need to get a pair of actual road wheels at some point though so you could run smaller tires.Do they have a panorama version? I'd like a 360^0 view of myself.Good point! Not as quick when pulling it out for directions but probably smarter. Put in a spacer or cut the steerer some more. Those are your only options. The spacer will be by far the easier option though One of us, One of us, One of us, One of us...What? I love talking to strangers...Nothing says 'share the road' like the vague silhouette of a 9mm through skin-tight polyester.  After googling the map distances,  it's more like 2.5 each way. I don't think that's a *secret* pro tip.


I don't use the stuff unless I'm doing a 50+ mile ride. &gt; He pointedly wouldn't even look in my direction.

Sometimes people do get in the zone. You can't be 100% sure he saw you.Nice ride! Got any drive side pics?I'd love to see what a bike, designed to "feel" like a bike (ie. not a recumbent or so on), but designed without any regard to UCI's absurd restrictions would look like.

Could we be riding something much, much better? As/If I'm not racing, would I care? It's incredible to see how mountain bikes have evolved in the last two decades, but is there something to be done to the way I accomplish my tarmac/gravel escapades?I was struggling to clip in, I hadn't noticed how much harder it was to clip in with them until I used brand new ones. I do suggest buying new ones and trying them out, if you feel like your old ones can last longer then continue to use them, just put the new cleats on a shelf until you feel like you do need them. You won't lose anything from trying, you will need new ones sooner or later. That's what I did and felt I needed to throw the old ones away right then. It's *so* not awkward if you're lobbed an opening line like "Hey! Reddit!" Honest to god guys, sometimes life really can be easy. Don't pass up those opportunities to interact IRL.&gt; Redditor for 2 years.

I've determined that you have too much of a life and possibly friends. That's your problem.Except CC is Concealed Carry, for when the motorists get to close, right?Five miles one way?  I'd want a bike that fits.Well, now you gave me an idea.Isn't that more an issue with primal or whoever they use to make the kits....? Not really reddit's fault..
The narwhal bacons at midnight :).This certainly gives me an idea. Thank you!he's sizing him up for a good scalpingThat....is not what I would've expected of /r/humanporn ....
Ordered my Brooks yesterday. They shipped almost immediately and I got a very friendly email asking me to let them know if I have any questions or if any issues come up. Very happy I went with them over Amazon so far!Ah truue.  I wasn't thinking right.  He needs a more upright position.  I just wanted to make sure he didn't buy a $400 bso.  Thanks for the correctionI just have a massive attraction for shiny silver components on bikes.Just starting my 4th week of ~6.5km a day. A few extra Km's scattered throughout the week. But as I get more used to it I will start adding more distance. I've also been pushing cardio. Ride fairly hard for a bit to get the heart rate up. Then drop a couple gears and slowdown and let my heart slow. Repeat that a few times, and then try and hold a medium cadence for as long as possible. Or whenever I get home. In the last week or so its gotten easier. Can't wait for more. :)well, to be fair no where was the opportunity to down vote you in real  life.Zip lock bags, also good for if it rains, put wallet in it too.Here in the UK there are two counterpoints to this silly argument. First, 'road tax' (it is actually not called that anyway...) is linked to emissions, so very low emission vehicles have a road tax rate of 0, so even if they assessed bicycles for road tax they wouldn't pay any. Second, road tax is not ring fenced, it goes into the general treasury fund so the person who contributes most to the road is the one who pays most of any type of tax. CAAD (race) frame might not be great for touring.. can't mount racks, and position too aggressive for multiple centuries..#####&amp;#009;

&gt;In [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany), "Unterlassene Hilfeleistung" (failure to provide assistance) is an [offense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime) according to section 323c  of the [Strafgesetzbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch); a citizen is obliged to provide help in case of accident or general danger if necessary, and is normally immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith and following the average reasonable person's understanding of required measures turns out to be harmful.   Also the helper may not be held responsible if the action he should take in order to help is unacceptable for him and he is unable to act (for example when unable to act at the sight of blood). In Germany, knowledge of basic emergency measures and First Aid and CPR Certification is a prerequisite for the granting of a driving license.

Those surely knard tires are amazing!Had the roles been reversed he would have done the same.I use my ebaums bib and drink out of a somethingawful bottle.Since you obviously work for pure, can you please do pizza next. thank youSo just for the bicycle, why not check out a CAAD10?  Here's a link to the new [frameset](http://www.cannondale.com/nam_en/2015/bikes/road/elite-road/caad10/caad10-frameset).

It's a pretty cheap bike that is great for beginners.  You could try a [CAAD 8](http://www.cannondale.com/nam_en/2015/bikes/road/elite-road/caad8/caad8-7-sora).

They may have better ones at the shops nearby you that are on sale.  Just tell them what you want to do and they should be helpful in picking out the right bicycle.

As the comment by /u/c0de_ says, you're gonna need a ton of other things and it is going to add up.  Good luck!Sorry for your loss :( WTB NanosLikely from Sheldon's friend and fellow Twenty owner
[John Allen](http://john-s-allen.com/blog). Smart guy, not disrespectful.Looks really cool actually. Probably weighs less than my new CX bike with similar components.Yeah I didn't know if it'd get much headway but was worth a try. Getting in touch with the local paper actually sounds like a great idea, I'll try and get some thing in motion, cheers! Yeah my Ibera rack is rated for 25KgNice, hard, thick, developed calf muscles. Impressive stuff. It's not level and as a result he's probably sliding forward putting weight on his wrists and hands instead of his sit bones.  It happens a lot when people get an "aggressive bike" but lack the flexibility to handle the saddle to bar drop, but it gets uncomfortable fast.  I know because I initially made this mistake - for exactly 1 commute.One of the best bikes for the money I have seen. The 28h wheels may not be the best fit commuting, but this would be a great race bike. As for commuting i don't see eyelets or anything for a rack. Also those rims won't be able to go to higher pressures. Stans doesn't recommend above 45psi, thigh I've seen some forms say to to 75psi w/ tubes is OK. I ran my tours at 100psi in them for a while with no problem, but some people said I was lucky.

If I didn't already have a cross bike I'd but it in a second.this changeds everything...there's so much room for stuff to put in

can I...can...can I put my..dick...in...it?  That baby has seen some shit.Sorry, no clue. Haven't done structured swimming in years.. try [the Swimming subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/swimming)He does not appear to be in a race, what is wrong with any of that?i only ride in my fark jerseyI creepily snapped the picture and took my right turn on red.Reddit tattoos. Yep there's alot of those.I bet that would get a lot of media attention and sponsors if someone really did it.Great I will have access to a pool this week because it is holiday here in Chile! Any tips for swiming better or some excercises I can do?unless it's the Di2... meh.Good Luck, and hope it works out.. an across America tour would be SWEET..I really like the color on that.Hairy legs: check
Saddle bag: check
More lights than you need: check
Trek: checkI've got about 200 miles on it so far and I love it. Shifting is immaculate as you'd expect. Worth it for front shifting alone. Went for Seat post battery. My cable for that is a bit short so i will have to be careful when taking the post out. New bottom bracket if it comes out of the junction box! Bike gets its first real workout at Paris roubaix next week. I definitely think I have the right bike for the job. You have any specific questions? Cheers! Didn't know about this weekly thread. Made my post [over here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/312tgl/some_upgrades_ive_done_to_my_three_bikes/)Thanks! I'll check it out. I got to start somewhere.I'll take steel (even high-ten) over alu in a fork for comfort reasons.  My area's relatively flat, so the weight savings don't mean much to me, but the teeth-chattering ride of an aluminum fork was enough that I'm happier on either steel or carbon.Okay! Thank you. I'm really new to the cycling scene. I'll check out some touring bikes in the local bike stores. Would Craigslist be a good place to check? Also, do you think you could add reply with a couple links to give me an idea of a good bike in the $1000 range?&gt; King of the ~~Beard~~?

King of the Basement
Across America? you'll need a bigger budget my friend. You'll probably need:

* A good, reliable, steel bike - No idea, $800 I would think? at least?
* Probably switch to puncture resistant tires (if bike doesn't already have them) like Gatorskins or similar - About a $100
* Rack and Panniers, you'll need to haul stuff.. - $100
* Helmet - $20
* Lights, back and front.  - $50
* Bike shorts/bibs a jersey and gloves.. those will make your life a LOT easier - $100 (probably more)
* Tire patch kit, portable pump, spare tubes, saddle bag, multitool - $65

PS: ALL NUMBERS ARE BALLPARKED TO MY BEST KNOWLEDGE, I COULD BE WAAAAY OFF..

.. try /r/randonneuring and /r/bicycletouring they can have a much better input.[Wow...](http://imgur.com/Djo1eyg)Would say just go get a presta adapter for $1. But I'll bet they want more around there. OKC is cheap living. Not to mention you have another asshole that seems to be in a rush and tries to go around one of the victims and in doing so almost runs over the person again. Like wtf?!

Until....  _Shhhh don't let this get out &gt; narwhal bacon

http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-narwhal-bacons-at-midnightI have a 65/35 split in my torso/leg ratio (32" inseam but 77" tall) and still manage to ride with a 120mm stem. I know that Taylor Phinney rides a 58cm frame with a 150mm stem, but even that seems excessive.

Problem with me getting a bigger bike is I already ride a Giant XL frame.. not many bigger if you want carbon!The story yes, thought it was a serious comment though :-) That's because you didn't ask him when the narwhal bacons, duh!Err... I'm a Redditor and don't know the answer to this question... Should I buy a jersey to show solidarity, then return it as I don't deserve it?In my opinion, no.  Not in a comfortable way.  You're gonna end up spending more on repairs and parts by buying a very cheap bicycle.  Look in the $1,000 range if you need to go cheap.  Many shops are having amazing sales to clear out last year's stock right now.  Go and look and maybe you can find some sweet deal.

Oh and definitely go for a touring bike, you'll be more comfortable.Considering the same District Attorney didn't file any charges against a woman who drove onto a pavement, hit 10 people and killed one of them, I can't exactly see him filing charges in this instance.  Which is so, so wrong.  What the hell is this man doing?No clue what it's about, care to explain to a noob like me? Ready for anything ! I love it ! Cool bike! Sprained ankle, then swim.. keeps up your cardio base, has some leg work, but not a lot of ankle movement..Nice. I was curious about the paint job as some bike companies do (or used to, at least) special paint jobs for their demo fleets. I see quite a few Fives on my local trails and have never seen a purple one, it's really nice.  I was doing light road biking and I have a sprained ankle.Just go for it!  In all honesty, most women who "join" the women's group I'm a part of never ride and there's really only some 5 core riders.  It never hurts to ask.Looks like you cut them with a hammer.Well I don't think your opinion is *bad*, certainly not enough for downvotes, but I don't think that it is as universally true as you seem to imply.  Enough people have "non-standard" leg to torso ratios that just saying "If it has a long stem/seatpost then the frame is too small" isn't true.  It may be a decent guideline, but just look at how many pros use 120-140+ mm stems and it seems pretty clear that it's not a hard rule.

Is it necessary to emulate the pros for weekend warrior century rides?  Definitely not, but plenty of people enjoy it so what's the harm.Maybe, but still looks vaguely daft. Maybe it's just me, but then again I do have a huge saddle&gt;handlebar drop as it is because of my size.Looks like they are getting ready for bring your own big wheel in sf this weekend.

http://bringyourownbigwheel.com//r/pocketsand guidelines: "To keep things simple consider this before posting; if it's not sand it needs to come from the pocket. If it's not from the pocket it needs to be sand."

Is that some kind of zen thing?This is super informative! Thank you for sharing and I will be sure to show my coworker this tomorrow :)Hah, I've definitely gotten into conversations with random redditors while wearing my reddit jersey. I usually check if they are real redditors or just posers (kek) by asking them what time the narwhal bacons and I would say shockingly 90% of the time they give the right answer.Its not worth investing in at all.

It is exactly something that people see and go "why on earth would I ever buy that?"

A much better thing IMO would be covers for shifters/saddle so that when its upside down they don't get scratched.

Also some kind of clip thing that keeps the fork straight when the bike is upside down.

Or some kind of tool to make it very simple and cheap and fast to align handlebars with the wheel.

If you want a proof of concept project: make the whole thing attach to the bottom of the bottom bracket and fold out.

Make it out of carbon fiber.I tried the screwdriver and hope it'll hold. I need to pump the tire now; I have a schrader pump and presta tube and the plastic tip hack didn't work.Here's a better reason.  I got mine and the zipper broke off the first time I zipped it up.  I've never worn my teddit jersey on a ride.  Will never give them money againCan you cross train? or does your injury prohibit that?

PS: maybe give us a little background to what you did, what you want to do, and what your injury isSorry for the late reply, I've been away for a bit. Inner leg measurement will help with standover height.

[Wiggle](https://www.wiggle.co.uk/h/option/bikesizeguide) has an article about it which may help and explains it better than I can. King of the Beard?Oh the last one is great! I'd already found a couple of those, but thanks a ton!

I found a few more by finding out specific rider names, which as actually bee really interesting to read about. Maybe I'll post an album when I've found a good number, just to show them all in one place.Phones and exercise are not friends...I've put mine in the back of a jersey or on an armband but they still get sweaty enough that I'm worried about moisture damage after it happened one particularly warm night waiting tables with my phone in my back pocket.... :/
