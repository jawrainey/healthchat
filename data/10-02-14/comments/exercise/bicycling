I agree with what everybody else is saying about this jersey.  I'd MUCH rather see the Reddit logo on the center of the back, and highly diminish the /r/bicyling text.  Because those rims are painted, and they painted over the braketrack, you're going to have AWFUL braking until your pads wear it off (which is normal).  It wouldn't be a bad idea to sand it off now, but see how it stops in the wet before you find out the hard way.

Also, I'm not sure if you need to remove a link in the chain, or you can pull the axle back further into the dropout, but you do need more chain tension.  Take a look at youtube for some tips on how best to do it (I personally recommend walking it back by tightening and loosening each side at a time).  The culture is completely different though.  In Netherlands, bicycle is a legitimate form of transportation.  In US, aside from a few areas,  bicycles are considered more of a toy that one puts in their cars drove to the lake or mountain or something children ride on their driveways. 
Let's make bicycle registration a thing first. I would love to have bicycles in a police database. &gt;Helmets have saved my life twice.

There is no way to quantify whether a helmet saved your life or not. Helmets don't protect from internal concussions. 

This is about creating a barrier to entry on the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation. It has been shown over and over again that the only thing helmet laws do is decrease the number of cyclists. How far is your commute? Are you spending more time cleaning and performing maintenance than riding?Any word on EU/UK shipping costs?One option is free and the other costs money. The most notable benifit of running a chain tensioner is that you are afforded the freedom of switching up your gear ratio. If you have a flip-flop hub, consider a tensioner.

What gear ratio (# of teeth on chain ring : # of teeth on the cog)?
What is topography of the area that you will be biking in (flat vs. hilly)?This is tricky. Used bikes can be a hell of a deal, IF you know what you're looking at. New, close out bikes can also be a hell of a deal, and you most likely get follow up service with the shop and future discounts... I would lowball him since he swapped parts out, if everything else lines up.At the end of the primary submission round I asked each designer to send me designs that they wanted to see in the final voting.

Nothing is set in stone at the moment though, so we can still move elements and such without much issue.I am actually surprised there isn't a lyca dude in this group. I live in SF &amp; it's really awesome to see the mix of bicycles &amp; riding styles. Our college kits looked almost identical to this last year and we won worst kits in the conference.Just take a link out.Yes, it's still possible to tweak. I'll be working with /u/Highwinds and Podium to take this design, modify where needed and then put it into production.Thank you!Great question! Designed them myself (important for you to vectorize them) and set background to transparent. Once designed, save it out as a .png - and then you can send them along to pretty much any signage store, they can cut decals.  Should only cost you about $3 bucks per decal max (thats a high estimate too)

The cut them on their printer and what you'll end up with is your design on a sticky surface with a layer to pull off.  Then push to apply it to your bike, and press on all corners of it.  (Do ti slowly)  Then peel and voila! You have your decal!

Just be sure to apply clear coat AFTER putting the decals on!Hopefully everyone that voted for it. I know I am. If you like your Krampus you'll love an ICT so much. And find a way to afford the Bluto, its amazing. Thanks dude!Thanks so much! haha gotta admit i was a little worried that I would get some flak for taking a classic bianchi into a no-namer fixie! 

And thanks for the feedback! I'll give it a shot tonight!What kind of bar tape is that? Good luck dude. As a guy with two right knee injuries, do everything you can to figure it out and address the problems asap. I didn't have insurance for my first one, fractured the tibial plateau, and was unsure on ligament damage because i couldn't get an mri. Straight leg brace absolutely atrophied the hell out of my leg in no time. Because i didn't get physical therapy as soon as possible took me forever to walk normally, then it was weak and i refractured it on a fall.... Got physical therapy that time, but a year of neglect has left me with stiffness and rang of motion issues all which could have been avoided.
Cleaning at LEAST once a week in mandatory. I usually do a full wash and lube on sunday, but lately my chain has been completely enveloped in rust by wednesday :/ So looks like I'm going to have to start cleaning 2x a week and maybe wipe and lube the chain every day or so? This winter has been brutal on my drivetrain. Thanks so much! Really pleased with it! Learned some things and will definitely do things differently, but a great experience over all! 

And thanks for the feedback! Seems to be what a lot of people are saying! - would it be better to get a chain tensioner? or just the take a link out?The Netherlands where virtually everyone bicycles don't have a helmet law. The thinking is that if you force people to wear a helmet you will effectively create a barrier to entry causing fewer people to adopt biking.

I'm not saying you shouldn't wear a helmet, I've seen one probably save a friends life when he slid into a curb at high speed and I've had my fair share of falls too, but they may have a point.Screw ID and credit card, I'd insist on having the cash in my hand while the prospective buyer is on a test ride. I was surprised it isn't already a law. I know motorcyclists are required to wear helmets, I thought surely cyclists would too. Southern Ontario here - yuppp :'( and it's supposed to drop below -30 degrees C this weekend.Podium CyclingLOL, a biker must take the safest route.

You sound dangerous if you would rather risk the safety of yourself and those around you.  
If you dont think it is dangerous to bike on 50+ mph roads then you are crazy.    

A responsible biker always takes the safest route for everyone.    

Also, since drivers dont drive on the sidewalk, then it wont matter if the biker is on the sidewalk.  I dont get what their expectations have to do with anything. 

As for bikers in crosswalks, drivers always expect someone to cross in a the crosswalk on either foot, bike, rollerblades, skateboards, etc if that crosswalk has the green light.  That's what I thought too, so I went back and checked, and it looked like [this.](http://imgur.com/a/ibsLP)

However, it did change in the actual head to head voting thread.  So I'm not really sure when the change was made.You're the driver in the black car. You're justifying unsafe, illegal actions. Is this one of the sidewalks you can ride across in Los Angeles? Nope. You're disregarding the expected behavior of people who commute in cars/bikes/walking.

You can do anything you want. If you wanna walk your bike across the bridge on the sidewalk, that's your decision. How long is this bridge? How much time would that add to your commute? I don't know either of those things. You're pretending things like that don't matter. You're pretending the decision here is as simple as "hurt or don't get hurt." It isn't.The shorts look awful (do i need to say in my opinion?) and I think they will not come out nicely from my experience of last years kit. The only saving grace is that the jersey is pretty nice and will go with last years bibs, so that's my plan.I'm surprised at the negative reaction to this. I think it's a great idea. I see tons of people daily who ride without helmets and it absolutely boggles my mind. If you have a minor accident and hit your head without a helmet it can kill you. Helmets have saved my life twice. This seems similar to seatbelt laws. Good to see him smiling and having a blast.Cold forged cranks aren't that expensive anymore.Of course he did. Definitely bib shorts. They are pretty comfortable and will cover everything.Totally understandable.

We had to play a careful balance between price, quality, ability to work with reddit inc's weird requirements, and our sub's requirements like being able to ship each order to a different individual.

Podium represented the best balance of these needs, and has great quality. However, pricing isn't the lowest out there, and I understand that's hard for some folks.Who will be making the kit?Definitely picking this up for the spring.Looks sweet!!Hawk wheels

Did you buy a bike before a bed frame?God dammit who is chopping onions back here?

Really unfortunate title, but goddammit if this doesn't make me want to go for a ride.I know, California just seems to have more than their fair share of silly laws on the books.Good Quality Jersey ~$45 USD  
Good Quality Bibs ~$60 USD

High Quality Jersey ~$80 USD  
High Quality Bibs ~$160 USD

There is shipping to Mexico available, but I can't remember pricing offhand.I don't get it...I say "bikers" but people think I mean beer-gut-wannabe-hard guys on motorcycles.#####&amp;#009;

Keep your head up! Live to ride another day. :)Thanks for the constructive feedback!

Nothing is set in stone yet, so there's a chance some of these suggestions could be implemented in the final product.This design in various dark greys of matte and shiny would look awesome.Thanks for the info and encouragement. The mileage I'm doing is not about the STP; it a personal goal for the year to average 100 miles a week throughout the year. I'm considering bumping it up only because I feel like I can. Tossing off a 43 mile  ride in the epic rain that was last Friday gave me real confidence, too.If you want a solid number:  about 100 people  are killed per day as a result of motor vehicle collisions in the US according to CDC.  For 2013 that number is 33 804.

Census.gov says  2 217 000 injured in 2009 as a result of motor vehicle collisions.  This is 4 people per minute or 6100 per day.Podium Cycling

Here's a good write-up on the quality of their kits:  
http://www.bikerumor.com/2013/11/04/summer-weight-road-kit-shoot-out-podium-cycling-gc-vs-pearl-izumi-elite/This isn't actually a law and isn't likely to become one.California seems like it would be a cool place to live if they swapped laws with basically any other state.Not sure if the 404 is from redditmarketplace's side or Podium's. I will look into it.&gt; Tens of thousands are killed by cars, most of them _in other cars._

I really wish lawmakers wouldn't ignore this.  They think increasing what they consider to be safety margins makes driving safer, but all it does is make people drive faster to 'compensate.'
That sounds ridiculously brave (potentially even foolhardy). "Stealing" from a gang of thieves in So Paulo sounds rather a lot more dangerous than taking a bike back from a single guy in Vancouver!More armchair cycling advocates telling cyclists what to do.Yeah, for custom stuff this is a good relative price, I just wish the going rate for a full kit would less than $100.Please tell this was posted in /r/JusticePorn.

Man, that is awesome.We actually get a really good pricepoint on these because of the volume of our order. While it's not chinese-knock-off cheap, the price for just a jersey is around $40. And that's getting you a quite nice jersey, of much higher quality than those eBay specials.Like others have said go with a bib. Not going to say they are better then shorts but they just keep everything nice and neatly tucked away. This is even truer if you are a larger or taller guy. I am 6'6 and having a bib on helps in the but-crack/lower back showing off department. going to put this out there just in case you have any interest. 

[brandt-sorenson](http://brandt-sorenson.com/) makes custom fitted kits. this works well for those that don't fit the average joe kits. I'm a pretty stocky dude so for most kits, it's either too loose or too tight in a variety of places. 

I had brandt sorenson custom make a few kits and they fit like a glove. no weird sagging, no uncomfortable tight spots. they send you a measurement form and you can either do it yourself or take it to a local tailor. 

some find getting custom tailored gear kinda over-the-top/too expensive but it's really awesome when you have an odd body size. 

also, the kit quality is EXCELLENT. super comfy bibs/chamois and both jerseys and bibs last for a long time. 

my usual squadra, pactimo, LG kits last about a year after heavy use. my first brandtsorenson kit, i bought 3 years ago and i am still wearing it heavily and it still has lots of life in it. also, if you lose weight, they do free size downs as well.



Am I the only person that would knock someone's teeth out if they stole my bike and I found them? Fucking thieves...Yes, it will ship internationally.It never gets easier you just go faster! Honestly for the first few months(2-3) I got my first proper entry level road bike I just stocked to my indoor soccer shoes which was comfy enough for decent distances. The bike came with clipped pedals so I didn't have to buy anything. After that few months I decided to get clipless pedals and shoes for Christmas as a gift to myself. What I got was SPD-SL ($29) and Nashbar's SpD-SL shoes ($65 I think? The one after their cheapest pair) as they seemed rly well-made. Only 2 months in using SPD-SLs but it still feels great! I can't go back now. I only wear normal shoes now if I'm communiting to school (less than 4miles). Even with shimano SpD-SL pedals its wide enough to not make normal shoes uncomfortable for short rides. ["cycling furiously"](http://vimeo.com/74449197)

I put RS80 hoops on mine, swapped the saddle, and the rest is stock Sram Rival. It's just brilliant.Great design overall. Just for the love of cycling please but r/bicycling into the lines like the front!If you ride a lot, such an extreme position could have really bad effects on your junk. Just fyi, if you didn't already know.That's so nice to hear, I keep getting more and more excited about it as the days passThat bothers me oh so very much!I had a friend kind of do the same. He had his bike stolen in downtown So Paulo, Brazil. A few days later he saw some suspicious guys riding bikes that (for him) seemed to be all stolen.

He realized one of the guys was riding his bicycle. So he waited for a distraction, grabbed it and rode away. He was chased by the other guys, so he went to the police station as fast as he could.

When they got there, he still had the receipt for the bike in his bag, because he had just filed a report for the theft. The cops made some questions to the chasing guys then released then. Yeah I haven't had anyone balk at the request in person, but I have had people suddenly stop replying to my emails when I say that. Maybe they're legit and think I'm a creeper fishing for addresses, but most people seem to think it's reasonable.Thanks! May order a pair thenHOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST AND HOW CAN I GET IT SHIPPED TO MEXICO?ZachlyNice. Now, no more pedal stands (he said, having learned it the hard way)Rabobank?What's risky about this? There was a stop light in front of the bridge, there's a stoplight on the bridge, this is GROSS negligence on the part of the driver. I've got an RS myself, and it's a brilliant bike. Too bad it's UCI illegal, so I guess I'll never be able to do Le Tour with it.

I went through the same process as you, I rode 25 or so bikes, and kept coming back to the RS. The shop tried to put me on an R3, and it just wasn't the same.

Ride it like you stole it.Ah, I was looking at [this one.](http://www.slingshotbikes.com/technology-foldtech.php)I think STI is for shimano only.Exactly location? I'm from Yorkshire and I can't figure out where it is... Looks great!Fined for $25..? What the hell?Yeah I know it's easy to get upset about victim blaming, and obviously the cyclist has the right to take the lane, and obviously the car is at fault.

*But* if you can't keep a decent pace in traffic, maybe walk until you have a safer path. That guy was going slow af (maybe it's made worse by perspective but it looks like joggers were moving faster than him.) It's not about being right, it's about being safe.Depends on your city. It is legal in many parts of los angeles. 

I  am trying to say here is simple. There are drivers like this and there always be. If there is a great chance (from what i read in the comments here) this happens very often, especially on this particular bridge.

Here in america we are caring about the laws more than reality. I know you are legally right but i prefer to live legally wrong than dead legally right. Makes sense now?Not anymore so much, but i have padded tights so i have that going for me Trading a license for your bike (it's a decent road bike, too) is not necessarily a bad call.

When I sell bikes at my shop, I tell buyers they need to leave their license AND credit card with me during a test ride, and I still worry that the test ride may become permanent. The colors &amp; patterns are very good.  But...

* I think the back would look a lot better if the snoo/gear and /r/bicycling were swapped.  That way you could use a bigger snoo/gear and the sub name wouldn't break up the angled design pattern.
* I don't like the "reddit" on the front at all, and it won't be legible while riding (covered by right arm).  There isn't really a great option, though ... OH YES THERE IS: wrap reddit around the collar, twice, once on each side.
* The bibs are fantastic as is!I personally gave up on risky rides like this long time ago. I am riding to work everyday and bicycles are my daily commute. I nearly got killed multiple times so no, i won't ride because it is my right. I totally understand some of us will.I agree. I won't be buying it unless this change is made. As it is it looks rough.&gt;And just so you don't get the wrong idea, I have ridiculous reflexes, peripheral vision, and situational awareness. It would be hugely safer for me to ride a bike in traffic than literally 99% of the population.

I found this part exceptionally awesome!If this was the first time this happened, I would've said the same thing. You're right, the reason I mentioned it is because I noticed that OPs saddle is all the way forwards. If he had it set professionally, thats one thing, but if it is actually too far forwards, he will feel scrunched up on the bike, and possibly feel like he wants more reach.Super agreed! I really hope they either remove that or move it inside one of the stripes for the production run.Guys, guys, guys... I've been putting together a campaign of the pen &amp; paper superhero rpg, Aberrant and... well take a glance at this hero, [Caestus Pax](http://www.rpgpost.com/uploads/gallery/album_14/gallery_1_14_104325.jpg).I like that the article shows that in doing this and using similar phrases (don't say cars, say person driving a car. Don't say accident, say collided with. etc.), it is reducing the "us vs. them" mentality as well as being more accurate in descriptions of events.I'm glad OP's okay too! I rewrote the title and the sentence to emphasize the absurdity of blaming cyclists for their own deaths:

&gt; **California Senator wants law forcing all humans to wear bullet proof vests.**
&gt; Lius nephew, Alan Liu, was killed in 2004 by a drunk gun owner while sitting around in Sonoma County. Liu was wearing a bullet proof vest.

Definitely thought it was a butt cheek ...which really helps with scaleLasco is the pits. Looks like there's a darkened portion in the break, this means oxidation, which means it was probably partially cracked through for at least a bit of time. 

I can't stress enough the importance of looking over your bike at least semi regularly. This crack may have been evident? I wish this stuff didn't cost so much.What, are you one of those people who thinks that roads are paid for using some magical usage fund, funded exclusively by drivers? Buahahhaahaaha. Everybody pays for roads. &gt; Lius nephew, Alan Liu, was killed in 2004 by a drunk driver while riding in Sonoma County. Liu was wearing a helmet.

These are the sort of people who tell you bikes are dangerous even though only a handful of people are killed by bikes each decade. Tens of thousands are killed by cars, most of them *in other cars*.I don't even get the joke of the title. I did, however, enjoy the film and appreciate this kind of commercial endeavor. I'd rather see an advertising budget poured into work like this rather than some garish spread in a magazine or obnoxious signage in a store or event. 

I get that Rapha is an easy target for snark, but you can still enjoy a film like this without buying their clothes.And this is why when I sell bikes on CL, I tell the buyers in advance that they have to leave their licence with me if they want to test ride.No I had a few time constraints, and my rural area is extremely hilly. 10 miles is all I could manage before on my BSO and it sure as hell would have taken me twice as long :') the geometry is going to be a bit of a learning curve I know, but I'd rather learn the hard way. The saddle is set up correctly and the frame size is right for my height though, thanks. Ha yeah, GP4000s definitely. Although don't you know how tricky the logo thing is, I always start out trying to do that, them I'm like, sod it.I have the Thermal Elite bib tights from PI. I've had them about 2 years, and I'm in WI so they see a lot of use. I like the fact that there is no chamois, because then I can wear a pair of bib shorts underneath and change up which pair depending on temperature and ride length.


The fabric in the crotch/inner thigh area is very wind resistant. I have never gotten cold there even in 20 degree 2-hour rides. The lower leg area doesn't stay as warm, under 25 degrees I will usually wear a pair of knee warmers underneath.


I am very skinny and they are a bit loose in the upper thigh area. It's not enough that the wind catches them. The lower legs are nice and snug, they might be too tight if you have large calves.


The zippers in the bottom have held up well with lots of use.Have you done any century rides previously? What is the longest ride you've done?It does but you have to have a Garmin which can be cost prohibitive for a lot of people.  Or just not a high priority if you're not serious about training.Do you have testicles? I can't imagine how you ride this.wow that makes me so happy to see. Really devastating to learn of his injury after watching those amazing road bike party videos. To see this man getting to still do what he loves despite his injury makes me feel like no matter what happens there's still so much joy to be found in life! :)I had the same problems bud, using bibs solved everything. Also bibs don't have any waist elastic, so they are much more comfy.

On AliExpress I bought 6XL clothes that are huge for even me (6'3" 270lbs).I thought it was reasonably old when I saw it, as the frame looking nothing at all like my 2012 model.Why not helvetica???????? Would look so nice.Pedestrians on bikes has potential problems in urban planning because much of the cycling infrastructure in the UK already assumes that people using it will basically be pedestrians on bikes, hence the having to give way to every single side road and property access and that putting up signs allowing you to ride on the pavement is somehow sufficient.when I was 18 or 19, I hit over 60mph down a very steep hill that had some (I thought) gentle curves at the bottom. 60mph on a bike made those curves seem very very sharp, and the amount of lean I had to do was horrifying. Never again. These days I stick to 50.I honestly looked at this and said that I would buy it if the /r/bicycling didn't look so damn out of place.It's often used in cycling circles as a derogatory term for someone who isn't a cycling enthusiast, rides down the street on a heavy mountain bike with fat tyres then down the pavement getting in the way of pedestrians, that they are a "person on a bike" not a cyclist to avoid giving cyclists a bad name.

However for cycling for transportation it's a useful device, to say the infrastructure is not for 'cyclists' but for people who want to get around using a bicycle. It taps into the way our brains have to organise everyone into groups and it's all too easy to put cyclists into an out-group, as they are strange, and not one of us.Ride it and see. I'm 6'4" and I ride a 58cm fits perfect.[This fucking thing BRAAAAAAP BRAAAAAAP!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqpcBpSsj1A)Now do that for 50 miles ;)From one big guy to another, bib shorts are where it's at.  Aerotech Designs makes some great big or tall bibs for plus sized people.  I've ridden the hell out of a few pairs of Aerotech bibs and jerseys and they really hold up.

My normal mountain biking setup is Aerotech bib shorts under the [Aerotech pedal pusher shorts](http://www.aerotechdesigns.com/aetedemecoca.html).  The shorts are long enough to cover up any knee pads I might be wearing which is more comfortable than shorter shorts that bunch at the top of the pads. Bib shorts cover the crack and lower back and I'll normally wear an Aerotech tall jersey over the top or a motocross jersey if I'm getting a little more aggro.  

Just own the uniform.  The drivers are just angry that they're stuck in traffic and you're keeping pace.You gotta be really pro to pedal with the height diff between your saddle and handlebars...

If your legs cant keep your body "floating" on the bike through pedal power, you will feel exhausted after 10 miles indeed.

EDIT: [This can help you](http://cdn.mos.bikeradar.com/images/bikes-and-gear/bikes/road/CYP216.workshop.riser_prev-500-90-500-70.jpg)This will be my first time buying one, but in the past it's been a piece by piece thing so you could buy any individual article if you wanted. The prices vary but I think you could get the higher end kit, or jersey and bibs, for around the $200 range and the lower end kit around the $130 range. Of course if you preferred you could just get the jersey or bibs or get only socks or whatever else they decide to offer. I will probably go a little crazy. I messaged aggleotis about the quality last week and he said the GC is a very nice quality kit. I am excited to try out the brand as all I have been exposed to is Pearl Izumi. All of my kits are their PRO line and I have nothing but great things to say about that brand. I'm interested to see how the GC stacks up and I'm excited to show off this sub reddit. Not to mention PI has some pretty boring designs so this will be my first set of bibs with loud colors. I'm Pumped!I don't upgrade things that are working just fine for their application.Theres a cat4 climb connecting my city to another. It goes through a forest and has a big bike lane.

I love to ride there and I know it very well. Last time I went through, a truck hit one of the light poles and everything was pitch black. I descended on complete darkness, just looking at the tree shadows at 54 kph.MN rider here. I stay indoors on a trainer mostly because I don't want to get my bikes full of snow and salt. Next year I think I'm going to get a cheap CX bike for winter riding.How do we purchase a kit? Didn't think about it at first. Now I can't stop thinking about it.Make a "freeride" 3/4 lenght version of this and I'm in. Looks amazing.Exactly this. He was at fault in this situation and caused damage to someone else's property, so he should pay for the damage. Which feels weird for me to say because I'm usually rooting for the cyclist. But if we want equal rights on the road, this is part of it.  Granted the bill was pretty far-fetched when comparing it to the damage shown in the video. 

But playing devils advocate here, I wouldn't be surprised if the insurance lawyer or whoever wrote up the bill, got quotes from the actual manufacturer of the car for the original OEM parts that were damaged and needed to be replaced. Which in doing so would cost a lot more when you need to replace a whole hood, quarter panel, lights, hardware, and etc. Not to mention the labor involved would really bring that bill up, in comparison to a bill from an autobody repair shop. Plus the insurance company wants their cut as well. People don't work for free. So I wouldn't be surprised if the insurance company puts a percentage on that bill for administrative processing fees or whatever fees.

So even if this guy takes this to court he will still be paying a couple of thousands for the damage done on his part, plus his lawyer fees, which in Canada aren't cheap. Either way, this guy will pay.

Are you trolling? 

This car was going to have an accident regardless of the cyclist or not. He's selfish, wild, and ignores road rules. If it wasn't this cyclist it could have been a car in the same exact situation. If it didn't happen that same day, every other day he's on the the road driving like a socially-dysfunctional child he puts himself and others at greater risk.

You realize it's illegal for the rider to bike in the sidewalk, pretty much everywhere in the US? I fail to see how the rider was being unsafe.I have used this exact phrasing when trying to distinguish enthusiasm (cyclists) from convenience or perceived laziness (people on bikes) as motivation for riding. It's not fair because I don't know what their motivation really is, but it's helpful when discussing cycling issues in urban setting with someone who can't see the difference. Maybe "pedestrians on bikes" is better.Ty, I started going backwards after the first two. I assumed it would finish with a full shot. I don't mind it much except for the huge /r/bicycling on the back.... I don't even understand why that's there at all.Even though the clothes are nice, I get making fun of rapha sometimes, but this is a video about a guy overcoming cancer. Title is idiotic. It is a emonda with campagnolo record groupset and shamal ultra wheelset.. 7.0 kg with bottle holder.. Had some problems with campagnolo and the bb90 Okay. I thought it was your butt.I think it's a good design. But I agree the /r/bicycling should be smaller and located on the lower back. Also I think something can be done to correct the design break with the back.I wonder if it's possible to still tweak? Just to put the text in the orange band across the back?It is hard, especially after taking it for a short spin. But selling them will help recoup some of the cost of purchase, so I'm trying to stay strong. Thanks!Can you change the back text? Check road.cc for reviews on all types of clothing. They seem to always be spot on when it comes to reviewing. I am quite satisfied with my castelli sorpasso and would buy them again (actually I did because I have 2 of them haha).How much do they usually go for and is it the whole kit we'd have to order?I think it would make a really sweet retro merino wool jerseyyeah I have this, its not very good and the handle bar mount still sucks if you have hoods.They are metric not quarter inch by the way.I used a Smartwool Rambition knicker last year but I lost some weight so it fit like a diaper when I put it on in December. (In TX, don't hate on me because I didn't need it in October.)

So when my club ordered new kits from Voler I picked up their thermal knicker and I'm really happy with it. It's been plenty warm down to 40 and it wasn't overly hot in the mid 60s when a ride stretched out to 4 hours.

Obviously not Buffalo weather but I've been happy with both when they fit properly.You must have strong willpower to sell those incredible wheels. Obviously you don't need it for the type of riding you do but they look absolutely badass.When mother nature isnt trying to drown us here in the northwest thats the plan.I really like the 2014 kit :(Er, the third one?Thanks, but I want something good for long distances even if it's less convenient to get upstairs. Bought last year's, didn't fit. Was sad and $60 poorer. :(Find my friends on iOS and Android.Shame, I loved all the data it showed and the comparisons. I had a good 450 activities on there over a couple of thousand segments. 

If it's less than 10 per year i'll probably upgrade to Pro, that's not a lot in the scheme of things and if it means VW can keep going that's great.All that while maintaining his mobile phone in the pocket.like that a lot - Ill get one
That's the seatstay. You can tell it's not a fork because the head tube isn't there (it's out of shot at the top), it's too wide, and the angles are all wrong. If it was the fork, the head angle would be all whack.Might have been nice to have something about this group mentioned in any of the threads about the jerseys this year.

Honestly, this year's jersey has been horribly mismanaged, I already thought we won't be getting any. And I wasn't alone, judging by the threads in december...

I will be buying at least a shirt, though.Is there a single picture where I can actually see the bike and not pseudo-artistic closeups? How/Where did you get the decals made? I think it's important to remember that in Chicago, drivers cut off other cars like this all the time, too. Not saying it's okay, but it's less bike related and more shitty driver related. 

Also, I always have better luck on Dearborn than you. I'm sorry for how terrible those pedestrians are. I'd wear it.  Whats with the google drive belly?Yup, I liked the runner up jersey.  I would've voted for that one had I seen the poll.  The Trek 7.4 FX is not very light, and it's just as bulky as any other full size bike, so not going to be a lot easier to walk up. A proper road bike like Trek 1.2 or whatever they call it now might be slightly lighter. But if you want something much easier to walk up stairs with, a folding bike like the Dahon Mu SL might be better.That sounds painful, I'm glad I didn't add laceration to the mix. These were Lasco cranks, not unbranded but not great. I'm thinking of going to SRAM S100 or Omnium. I have spare 5700 nd Rotor 3D24 cranks lying around though, so those may be an option if I can make the chainline work. Though the Rotor cranks cost nearly as much as this bike!I voted against this one at every head to head. 

Can't believe this ugly as sin kit got chosen. I wish there was a way of knowing how many people who voted for this were actually planning on buying a kit...If you are really immersed in it, you should talk to /u/BucknChange, he just posted below that he's willing to pay people to design stuff for his team!Looks like you need to take 1 link out of the chain, besides that a great looking build, congrats :)&gt;The standards have tripped up other helmet makers who have been working on more portable models. European models  including the foldable Pango and a model from Carrera that collapses like an accordion for storage  are not certified to the U.S. standard. There's even a Swedish-designed version worn as a neck collar until sensors detect a crash, at which point a head-covering air bag is deployed. It might appeal to those who eschew helmets because of hat hair, but it, too, doesn't meet U.S. safety requirements.they hate us cause they anusWell, now what are you going to do? Any other big plans?Running a single freewheel.Lasco branded, unsure if there's a model.Don't ride cheap bikes. Life's too short. That's a junky cast alu Chinese crank. huh TIL I always just called them sti'scool bikeAre you saying 10 miles is all you can ride now? It seems incongruous with your saddle-bar drop.What do you mean? Did they add a bike lane since I last watched?Then what is the black thing on the very bottom left? It appears to be the fork to me. 

OP could have his terminology wrong. Yes my renters insurance can be updated but the cost to do that was more than the bicycle only policy and I found out that the renters insurance doesn't pay replacement cost and the bike only policy does. Knowing a bike only policy will pay a claim is more comforting than hoping the renters policy will pay fairly.
1. Talking on a cell is still legal in Georgia. Drives me nuts
2. Watching people just stroll around in the bike lane makes my blood boil.
3. You did blow a couple stop signs there... 
4. Salting the roads really kills the stripes in the bike lane I live at 6th floor and changed my bike a little less than a year ago, beside that the current bike has drops and the last doesn't the main differences for me are the weight (6th floor with a too small lift) and the numbers of gears.

Ask them if you can take it to a spin and then find some stairs to try to bring the bike up.

The bike seems a good bike to me, you should be able to go faster with the same effort.So, what exactly does this thing do that other cheap E-Bikes don't, except for a pretty add campaign with charity slapped on to it?It's too easy to spend money. 

Bright side: it's good stuff.

Not-so-bright-side: you don't NEED it. :)Colour me surprised if they manage that!Oh man you got me looking through their website. Damn you Internet and online shopping!Cyclists aren't the barrier to cycling, the infrastructure is. Looks good! If you saved a bike from a rusty grave that's fine by me and I think by most. You didn't grind the derailleur hanger off too like some people...

Your chain tension looks slack, though! I'd take out a link, you should have enough movement in the dropouts to account for this.They're going to lose $250 each bike at their initial price if they make it through production.I'd love to cycle in the clothes I work in and arrive fresh faced and, importantly, alive.

However, the roads in London on which I commute are decidedly *not* suited to Dutch style riding. If I changed my riding style, I'd be in a world of trouble.

With the new protected lanes that have just been approved for London, it should help the development of a less Lycra-fied cycling culture.

However, I enjoy riding my bike the way I do at the moment.Slingshot bikes actually have a fibreglass hinge in the top tube.Get the backpack! That way you can pick which one you wanna use on which day.Was it a fixie?I broke my left crank starting from a light on my singlespeed earlier last year. It sheared off just like yours, then the sharp bit left on the bike scraped about 6 inches along my shinbone. Had to get a bunch of staples for that... I replaced with Sram Rival cranks because there was a good deal, and they are hella stiff and leave me much more confident than brandless OEM cranks.[Sorry, but you're wrong ;)](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vl0rg/okay_for_leisure_riding/coio1j8)

It's the underside of the downtube. You can see the seat cluster in the background, but you can't see a head tube.You mean, strip off, naked? No thank you. I think my gentleman's vegetables would fully invertIt used to be a rusted beat old Bianchi Strada LX (i know it's probably a cardinal sin that I turned a bianchi into this).   But I had to strip down the bike to it's bare metal and sand off all of the rust until she looked clean again! 

Then repainted, and even decided for fun (and since would always be my personal city bike) I would create my own logo and make it my own.  Made the decals and recoated the bike.  Then sanded down a lot of the old parts, repainted them black, re taped the bars, and cleaned up the hoods.  

Bought new cables, and since the old crankset was blown, replaced it and bought new wheels (wheels were also bent).  

I had painted the old wheels and they looked really cool, but didn't realize how untrue they were until they got on the bike. Lot of wasted work there...so life lesson learned! 

Let me know what you guys think!No this is definitly the seatpost tube. You can clearly see it is a pic from behind the seatpost tube, the fork is visible on the bottom left and the downtube has the cage mounts. 

EDIT: he is holding the headtube, the fork comes down on the left, the downtube is on the left and has the cage mounts. You know what's the SHIT is the Timbuk with the DSLR camera insert. I picked one up a couple years ago, and at the time I was skeptical 'cuz it was so expensive but it's the BOMB! Completely inconspicuous with tons of storage.

Maybe I had to find a reason to buy another one, since the first one will never wear out.Thanks for cross posting here. saw this in r/funny and thought "That's not funny, that's just awesome"Easiest bingo ever created.
Big fan of my Endura Thermolites. They come with or without a chamois so you can wear your favorite pair of shorts underneath if you so choose.Agree.

Simple solution could be to just swap the position of the reddit alien and the "/r/bicycling"What crankset were you using? I haven't seen anything like that in years.Yeah, I have a timbuk2 bag that I've used for 4 years now and it still looks new. It's my daily laptop carry-bag even when I'm not riding, and when I travel via plane I can pack all of my electronics, 3 days of clothes, and my toiletries without much effort. It expands beautifully and gets tiny easily too. 

I would DEFINITELY invest in the cross-chest strap for riding. 

My wife has the timbuk2 backpack, and I love that one too. Came with a bottle opener! :)Ehh not sure, most likely responding to a robbery or taking a break. I would not say better, different certainly. Fat people tend to like them because they support the gut and don't show the crack.I am every day..I'll bet it was brisk up there. Some proper amazing scenery in Yorkshire, i'm in Sheffield so have the TdF route on my doorstep!First of call, start calling yourself a clydesdale. That's what I do.

Bibs are the answer. There is thin material that comes up your lower back and the should straps keep the shorts from drifting down.

In general, look for the words "club fit". They are designed for people with an...umm...non-ideal cycling shape.Agree its an insurance play, but get legal advice first. Don't want to be hit with costs if it goes against you.What logic is that? People who are legally obligated to use infrastructure they've paid for should be able to use it without being killed? Retarded, right?

What you're advocating is (on another plane) this: women should avoid going out alone, because it's easier for them to get attacked.Looks like the Wal-Mart fat bike with a battery and motor tacked on.You are literally telling people to not use infrastructure they have paid for (and are often legally required to use), so that others may use it without slowing down.

That sounds really fucking stupid.reminds me of Team GB's 2012 Kit.I have a size small 2014 Timbuk2 Classic. My biggest problem was deciding on the size. I went with a small to allow for a smaller bag for lighter loads when on a bike/around town. I have a backpack/rack for more stuff.

It's a decent bag but maybe not the most bike specific that is around. You'd have to go with the Chrome or Mission bags for a really bike orientated bag. But for my purposes it's solid. 

I found it for about $50 on amazon.Yea, out of all the kits, this one was the only one i would never buy.No. No it wasn't  Yeah. I would go with shorts with built in chamois. Using normal clothes over the lycra just feels weird. It feels "floaty".~~Does it say that in the video?~~

~~I was one of two tourists I know who went to Porto Vecchio last summer to cycle. By the amount of bike stores around town and non-locals I met on climbs, we weren't the only ones. So if a conservative estimate is that there where 50 tourists in corsica last july to ride bikes, that would mean there would be 50000 now. I highly doubt that.~~

oh wait. this is rapha. you're making fun of their customers. nevermind this...I started getting really into cycling in 2005 in SF. Even then that city had great bicycling infrastructure, community, and weather. You don't know how good you have it ! Attempted *hit* is even worse, because of intent, malice &amp; aforethought. That could even net you as much as murder (or at least vehicular assault.)Wrong again.

For people who aren't children, it is in fact illegal to ride a bike on the sidewalk in many areas.

http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6255/can-cyclists-legally-ride-on-the-sidewalk

It's also more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists alike. Drivers don't expect cyclists on the sidewalk, and don't look for them.Combining that fork with that frame is absurd.

I love it. &gt; Yep, move it back along the lines of the orange and I would consider picking it up. 

Me too. Now the subreddit name looks like an afterthought.
I use the Android version of the Road ID app - I'll assume the iPhone version has the same features:

It generates a lock screen background to give all the info I'd want someone to have if I couldn't speak for myself just by turning on the screen.

It updates my location on a tracking map, and texts a link to pre-set contacts. The tracking is active for as long as I specify - I usually set it quite a bit longer than I plan to be out.

It has an option to alert someone if I don't move for 5 minutes. It warns me first so I don't scare anybody if I take a break or have to fix a flat, but if I'm down and out it'll let people know where.

I also use Glympse when I'm out and about because my watch has an applet to start and stop it manually, perfect for errands and JRA days (my worried person has an uncanny ability to call for my ETA with the dinner ingredients precisely when I'm busy dodging heavy traffic 10 minutes from home!) but I make sure to use the Road ID app for non-utility rides.The top tube is also much bigger.Laughable Insurance company ploy. He should reply with a counter offer of $100 and if they don't accept they can see him in court. In court they will need to prove damages and actually win a judgement and they are likely to spend more than they win.  It's nothing more than an extortion play.I've developed prostatitis from biking. Sucks when it flairs up. And is probably a scam.This is quite disappointing... I do not feel like wearing a rainbow riding.I've been using the same Timbuk2 bag since I got it in 1993. Still waterproof; none of the truck tarp lining has worn out.I'm getting those at the end of the month. Glad to hear they're nice and stiff!Keep the seat, it looks like a bananaThat is really useful info. Did you read this somewhere or reason it out?What the heck SUV did he hit to get a $6K repair bill?  Guessing a BMW/Mercedes or something else along those lines.Thanks everyone!  It seems like I should probably use this as an excuse to get myself one of those fancy Garmin's I've been eyeing for the past year, haha!  "No no, honey, I'm actually getting this for you!"Totally agree. I'm all for periodic driving review tests. No idea why this doesn't happen. There's a lot more to driving than being able to see.These are some of the many companies making "true" messenger bags. There are a ton of great options out there.

Seriously though, don't knock it till you have tried it.This is my thought as well. That's exactly the point. It's a stress-surrounded cycling culture. The city just needs to relax, take a deep breath, strip out of their lycra and just enjoy riding a bicycle.Exactly. Remove as many barriers as possible to the adoption of cycling. As it remains (gear heavy, including carbon lycra and high vis) it will continue to be dominated by young and middle aged men, serving as a large barrier to adoption for women and childrenUnless theyve changed it (i havent been back in years)there's stairs on the South Side end of the walk way. You'd have to carry your bike down or up, and the walkway itself would be pretty cramped for pedestrians and cyclists alike if they split it. As to why there's no designated bike lane? I dunno.#####&amp;#009;

&gt;__Paul van Winkel__ (born 1953 or 1954)  is a [Belgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) former [wheelchair racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_racer) and multiple [Paralympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic) gold medallist.

&gt;He is [Belgium's most successful athlete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_at_the_Paralympics) at the [Summer Paralympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Paralympics), having won seven gold medals in [athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_(sport\)) between 1980 and 1988.  In his first [Paralympics in 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Paralympics), he was a gold medallist in the 4100 m relay (category 25) and the category 3 slalom. Two further golds followed in [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Summer_Paralympics), this time in the 400m 1500m. He was also the silver medallist in the 100m and 200m sprint events, as well as taking a bronze in the category 3 slalom. Van Winkel medalled in all the events he entered in [1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Paralympics): he was first in the 400m, 800m and 5000m wheelchair races, and was the runner-up in the 200m and the 1500m. In his fourth and final [Paralympic Games in 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Paralympic_Games), he came close to further medals with a fourth place in the 800m and fifth in the 200m. He did not make the 400m final and failed to finish in the 5000m, making his last appearance one without medals. 

&gt;He twice medalled in the demonstration [wheelchair race at the Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_race_at_the_Olympics), winning the inaugural event in 1984 and coming runner-up four years later.   He has also competed outside of Olympic competition and took three consecutive victories at [Grandma's Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandma%27s_Marathon) in two separate streaks.  He encouraged fellow marathon racer Marcelo Ordaz-Cruz to enter the sport, after Ordaz-Cruz became paralysed due to a gunshot wound.  Van Winkel now lives in [Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota).

Nobody had any idea until one day a guy was in the breakroom talking shit about how fast he is on a bike (being a douche). [Paul](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_van_Winkel) pipes up that there is no way that the douche could beat him. They set up a race behind the store I few days later and Paul repeatedly whup'd Mark's ass. Multiple ways and distances. The only time Mark won was with an impressive full roll head start. At the end HR very casually told everyone that he owns gold medals. We call Paul "breakroom" because he is always sitting down but he works harder than anyone else in the store and customers love him. If you have iOS 8+ and your wife also has an iphone go to a message of hers, click details, then click "share my location". You can then set a time limit (hour, end of day, or until you turn it off) and anytime she wants she can see you on a map when she clicks details on one of your messages.

For non-phone specific tracking, which has been mentioned, the new garmin edge devices enable live tracking of your location. They sync with your phone (they have android and iphone apps) and upload your location. The advantage here is more frequent location updates and less battery drain since the device has the GPS and doesn't use the phones.Because bicycles are vehicles and don't need a seperate path.


http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/1335/9552/original.jpgLook into bibs. Way better than shorts.Are you saying these guys are racing to their IT jobs? Fastest I've gone is around 45mph, a couple of times

Downhill of course, I think I could go faster but the road dead ends into a grass drainage and I don't wont to go from asphalt to grass at that speed.

 I don't have this problem where I live. It's just too cold for slush. Everything is frozen rock hard.Error. Wheels not found.That's what I'd call fresh air.http://www.aerotechdesigns.com/big-and-tall-cycling-apparel.htmlAh, I see. That actually makes it quite chaotic indeed. If this bicycle-business is consistent, they might as well turn part of that road into a cyclepath.Oh, I wasn't even referencing to real racing, just the behavior. I don't even know what Cat 6 is :'). That blogpost is pretty good, heh.I like the idea of stopping cars from driving on a public sidewalk, but the way they are going about it is aggressive and misleading. No signs or anything, just a giant group of teens in hoodies stopping traffic. Even as a cyclist, I would be more frightened and anxious then questioning my road choice and listening to what they had to say :/ 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reddit-jersey-announceLast night was my first puncture since march last year.

In feb last year I had one ride with 7!! punctures, one with 3. 
Funnily enough that was a "change the tyres" moment and it really wasn't a good day.


Turns out it was just bad luck, one of my friends has run my old tyres for the last 6 months without any problems.You can subscribe to the Jersey Announcement Google Group. You'll get an E-Mail when important stuff happens. Pretty good:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reddit-jersey-announceKit looks fine, I'd add a couple of bits (same kit comes with me everywhere on any ride and fits a jersey pocket)

- Multitool with chain breaker
- Spare chain links

Otherwise, go ride your bike. You'll be fine. Who wants to bet all the people commenting on how the cyclist deserved it are a bunch of lard-asses high on too much mcbeetus?

Easiest bet ever......ugly as sin. I wish I'd known about the voting so I could have voted for something else. Blegh.[Reminds me of Southwest Airlines.](http://www.wggb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/southwest.jpg)I, too, greatly dislike it. I wish there was some way to do another run of the 2014 design so I could get something that actually fits me. :(Yeah, wtf. I'm on here every day and never saw anything about this. I wish I could have voted for something else...Wow. This is hot. Can't wait to buy one.[Just like the '83 Astros!](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sUNW_fWgUbE/TxXxHDZMMmI/AAAAAAAACAA/YeiiumqXkNM/s1600/HoustonAstros1983.jpg)Just about all dedicated cycling shoes will have holes to attach cleats so you can clip into the pedals. Mountain bike cleats (SPDs) require two bolts, road cleats (SPD-SLs) need three, and they clip in to different types of pedals.

I'm gonna assume your bike currently has flat/platform pedals. If that's the case then you're probably best using regular sports shoes (unless they're super-minimalist running shoes or something extreme) until you get the new pedals and shoes together. If you use cycling shoes on flat pedals you'll find it hard to keep your feet on the pedals - because the shoes are designed to be used with cleats, they generally have a hard smooth sole with just about zero grip.

As for brands, I personally wear Shimano shoes, but it's best to try on a few different pairs and see what feels good. Prices range massively depending on how securely they fit, how stiff they are (more stiff = more efficient pedalling but less comfortable), how little they weigh, and so on.

As ever, the best thing to do is go to a local bike shop and ask for advice.Where and when can I buy one of theseWell they are built knowing there is no downtube. OP's bike was designed with the structural integrity of the downtube in mind.LOL, no it is not.  

Also, a biker needs to look out for their own life and take the safest route for them and others.  
Many times the safest route for everyone is the sidewalk. 
In most places the sidewalks are empty anyways. 

Safety trumps everything.  Who produces these?nice repo girl.Upvote for Glympse. I use this for my commute both ways because my wife worries a little bit when I'm riding in traffic. Works very well and doesn't drain the battery too much. Entirely determined by pressure?  Even if the rubber on the tire is much harder (that is what I read and it feels much harder even at 85)?  Makes sense though, today it is going up in pressure, so we will see.Well they are called [brifters.](http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/shifters.html#brifters)Chrome and Timbuk2 are the go-tos around here.So he hit a car and is surprised to have to pay for the damages?Haha yea I was on my phone and I'm not to Good at spelling in the first place!No snow in the Caribbean!Because fuck you.

Good for her. I probably wouldn't be able to keep calm in front of the asshole.Yep, move it back along the lines of the orange and I would consider picking it up. As it is it looks rough. I do like the overall design though. Not my first choice but I do remember voting for this one more than a few times.This is great. But if you think about it, for most people who can only afford one bike for whatever reason (could be financial, space, not wanting to deal with x amount of bikes, etc...), they would buy the one bike that serves all potential purpose they need it for and use it in anyway they can. Basically, the thing is here, do the best you can with what you've got. I am a mountain biker. I've got a dual-sus 29er bike. I use the same bike to be out there on the mountain going incredibly fast downhill, climbing hills in forests as well as being on the road heading to work on most Monday mornings or the occasional meetup with friends for dinner at a restaurant on Wednesday evening. One bike, multiple uses.

As for Lycra, some need to get work fast, and have made arrangements to clean up once they're at work. And let's not forget, it is incredibly more comfortable riding 15 to 20+ KM in lycra than it would be in any other type of gear. And this has nothing to do with middle-aged men but there are all sorts of people and also Women out there.

One thing you and I agree on is the messenger bag. But hey, I use a backpack which might be worse? (Not too sure). But it's what works for me and the type of bike I own.

Finally, clipless shoes... There are clipless shoes out there built in ways you wouldn't know they're clipless unless you looked really closely. I've got one of those for when I commute. They're practical off the bike but on the bike, they allow me to put in as much power as I need. And again, it wouldn't make much sense for someone with one bike that is used for multiple purposes to keep changes pedals just because...

It's quite simple, cycling will become mainstream when people start more and more realizing its benefits. If they're waiting for us all to start "dressing up", they'll wait a long long long time.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I see where you're coming from, but somehow I strongly feel that this is a false debate.Reality reduced into a cynical and sad metaphor.Indeed, thanks.That's exactly what I would do, too. Nicely done.Ty!

Yes; I'm already seeing some differences in the style of raiding... like paying way more attention to the road itself; ty!, i'm 1.63Well, the beer came after we rode. Though the mental image of somebody chugging along the interstate whilst chugging a beer is a funny one.Nice bike! I've been lusting after an Anyroad for a bit now -briefly considered it as a first 'proper' bike, but ended up getting a Defy instead due to availability. I'd still love to have one as a gravel grinder though!or a descent, I believe it goes by a variety of names you smart ass.I'm in the same boat when the hell did voting open? I swear I've been on reddit every day and somehow missed it.. Ground effect (New Zealand company) make mountain bike shorts that have a high back to minimise the bum crack visibility. They are very comfortable shorts, but aren't cheap. Might be a good option for you. Came in to say thisSo because you can get killed by a rando (no idea what that is) when you are following the 'obvious' rules, then it is ok to ride recklessly? Oh come on.

We've started to see a lot more people sharing their rides with videos, and an obvious part of doing that is that you are going to get feedback and criticism for your riding. It was clearly obvious what could have happened in this situation and the rider was lucky they avoided a serious collision. Being able to get that feedback and learn from it is very valuable. If you don't want that feedback, don't post videos.&gt; negative incline

so a decline.This makes me sick.Sure but so many in this thread are too quick to look at the bridge and think the guy was wrong to do what he did because they think they'd feel uncomfortable doing it.

That's fine but that doesn't take away that this cyclist was 100% textbook in his approach. And if we are gonna bring personal experience into it, then we should defer to him since he presumably knew the route and knew what he was doing. What's more likely, he decided to go ahead and do something risky (no evidence of that  in The video at least) or that he just had actual experience of what this bridge was like and rode like he was supposed to? 

All evidence and reason points to the latter. &gt; My balance apparently sucks

Damn, I'd say you quit a little soon. My balance sucks too, the great thing about rollers is that is one of things it's more effective at training.I have a chrome citizen, it's really well made but I find like many messenger bags the inside shape is rather weird.

If I buy another one, which I probably won't, then I'd probably get one from these guys:

http://www.grimbags.co.uk/

As the inside of the bag is much more rectangular and thus good for carry boxes and whatnot. It also had a padded back which is something the chrome bags sorely miss.Can I turn it into night mode for that more 'sheek' look Lots of high vis does make sense for cycling in the UK, especially in the winter. Gloomy overcast days are frequent, and we generally just don't get a lot of sunlight.Walking it? Sure.

Riding it? Nope. Bicycles should be ridden in the road.That sort of speed will be normal to you - eventually. Just going down a very very slight hill it's pretty easy to exceed 23mph and eventually it'll feel like cruising speed.

I don't much like descents either, once I'm topping 30mph most of the time I'm thinking "ok that'll do" and I'll start braking to scrub off some speed. 

But it depends on the road concerned, the fastest I've been was going down a long straight road with it blowing a gale at my back and I topped 50mph at one point but I knew I had plenty of space to brake if I needed to. Yeah, that's exactly what I was hoping for but didn't get. Not like it wasn't fun, it was great! But could've used just a little bit more... adventure, shall we say?

And seriously, the level of planning that went into this was, at best, very low.is....ugly as hell
I read the comments.  Lord help me, I want to wash my eyes out with acid right now.There's tons of cool little hole in the wall places all over the place to see and experience.  For example, the town I live in split across 4 river valleys, with the main body of the town in one.  When you get out on your bike to explore the back roads through the farming country you find crazy things - like roads laid right over/partially atop older roads, barely market castle ruins (which I only noticed because it was on a hill and CARPETED with cherry trees in bloom, temples build into caves dating back close to a millennium, weird territorial boundaries where you bike in and out of a town 4-5 times on the same road in a straight line with only one crossroad in that stretch...) 

Only problem doing it on New Years is that so much stuff is closed for the holidays - I like to get out and do a tour on Golden Week or during Obon.I really want the Patagonia Black Hole messenger. It's 22 liters and comes in some awesome colours. Seems to have all the right functionality of a great simple messenger bag for cycling. Ya sorry, even though obviously no one should be commended for a hit and run, there was no reason for that guy to take up a whole lane of traffic like that. That's, well, how you get hit by a car... And this coming from someone who was run over and almost killed...on a bike...by a car. You can bet your ass that guy will think twice before riding in the middle of the road on a busy street like that again. 

I don't care how much we cyclists may think we're entitled to the road, we're absolutely not. Roads were built for cars, and you'd be wise to gtfo of their way. Yeah, I was hoping to be riding through some of the lost lands, but alas... Next time! Hoping to make this an annual thing.I wish I could claim the paint job but it's not mine. I love the colour though. Looking to go a green and black colour scheme with some deep v black wheels,  black cranks and chain ring too.Me tooI live pretty far north too - and not too far off the 4.  Going north/south along the corridor you can go for 50-60miles of pretty much the same intermittent towns.  Go west or east from that corridor and you can find some real inaka.  Especially if you go towards Naruko or the coast - some of those little river valleys are like the land that time forgot.  (Until you ride up to the Lawson or 7/11...)They said I could become anything when I grow up, so I became a samsumg wallpaperWe all look stupid in cycling gear, that's half the fun!

If you're wearing baggy shorts, you could wear a pair of bib shorts underneath, that would help.

 There are also trousers and shorts cut a bit higher at the back that are supposed to prevent it, I've a feeling Rapha and Vulpine do them, though they're expensive. There's also a Levi's one that are I think.Kinda reminds me a bit of the 2012 team GB olympic kit.I used to live in Iwate, so I can definitely say that the entire road to Utsunomiya never really set off my Inaka Sense. Honestly, the whole ride was really just through a lot of dilapidated buildings &amp; crumbling infrastructure. Not that I didn't know that that was the case, but its a lot sadder when you are faced with an endless wasteland and aren't just hearing about it.Wait, when was there a vote? Why do I keep missing this stuff?!Nice!  New years up around Tohoku was about 10cm of snow and ice!

I'd choose something other than beer to drink mid-ride, but cool non-the-less.Very cool and sleek looking! Nope - they just didn't get rural enough I guess.  Up north we have bears, wild boar, monkeys, foxes, raccoons, and tanuki (as well as snakes, but they're less of a hazard) which all like to run out onto the roads.  If a cop sees the roadkill they'll call out the local municipality to have someone come and clean it up, so a lot of roadkill gets cleaned up quite quickly.Loving the paint job. Certainly would turn my head (and my bike so I could follow you and ask if you did the paint job yourself) 
Double agree. I'm not buying the kit as I have enough gear...  But the r/bicycling tag on the back it out it place and breaks the very awesome design. Super sharp kit,  integrate the forum name unto the design better. Not Pro enough, needs more black. /sThis isn't good advice. You shouldn't move your saddle to accomodate your reach; saddle placement is solely dictated by the placement of your feet over the pedals. Moving it up and down could give you discomfort or knee problems. If OP needs more reach then he needs to get a longer stem.Congrats on the new bike. How tall are you if I may ask?Even the guys who look like Lance get ridiculed.  You kind of just have to own the Lycra look.  Haters gonna hate.

If you want baggier clothes though, look into mountain bike clothes.  Lots of loose-fitting stuff there.  Shorts with a built-in chamois but not skin tight.  Jerseys that don't conform to your pony keg.

You can get away with wearing street clothes over road Lycra too.  Gym shorts over bike shorts, no big deal.  But you'll still get shit from drivers who want to give you shit.  You're still a guy on a bike as far as they're concerned.  Haters gonna hate.Wooooo, go Team BARF!&gt;Wiggo isn't pumped on Qatar

Didn't really get that sentiment from the article, but whatever. He's not here for GC, which you can tell before even seeing the race as it consists of only flats and one extremely short TT. The 94th place doesn't really tell us anything, and neither does his 3rd place in the TT. Just a warm up race/paid training camp to start the season, and I suppose the conditions does help prepare for PR.All you need is some decent core strength (abs and lower back) and flexiibility to hold that position, and being lean helps too because you're supporting less weight; if you have a gut you won't be able to hold a aggresive position because it's weighing your lower back down. Being naturally flexible is also of great help but if you spend enough time on a bike you can build up the flexibility. 

If you want to adopt more aggressive positions then you can do so by gradually dropping your bars. You can also build lower back strength (which is more important than abdominal) by doing backward supermans or deadlifts. You don't need to work out much to be able to support your torso, so it's actually rather easy.70kph on a mountain bike on a country road.... Good times.Agreed, also don't like itRuntastic's "Roadbike" has something like that. pll can see you during the ride via their website(runtastic.com) and can cheer for you. This might work.

https://appsto.re/at/8tO3B.iGo Snowboarding or Skiing. Will help you over getting over the fear of going fast.

Trust your equipment,  in context.

White knuckle the bars, ready to stop, enjoy the ride.Still a lot of work to do on it. Looking to get a new seat,  seat post and stem sometime soon. It gets me from a to b kind of quickly and the paint job turns heads.Odometer is already built into Strava.

How many tubes and water bottles ($10 wth?)  do you go through?  I had two spares for my road bike until I blew up one tube, but I purchased them in the middle of 2013.  I've only ever had two flats since then and  I just patched them.  Same goes for my commuter, the four tubes I have (2 spares) are from 2010 or 2011 because I patch them.  take my moneyPwobablyJust don't take it as a license to dope. Great bike... Love it!!!Ok, then same range of price. They look cool too !There was a crash up ahead involving the LBS manager and my friend couldn't stop in time, and ran him over... Thankfully everyone was OK!How do those Slingshot bikes not fold up, then?If you take off a 27" wheel with 25c tyre and put on a 700c wheel with 25c tyre, you have more clearance. You're overthinking it.Or at least put the front one on correctly with the logo next to the valve :)We both ride fixed gears, so the flatter route ended up being more appealing than the warmer one. It actually wasn't all that bad. 

We rode about 155 miles total, so call it 35-40 miles per day. We're not all that hardcore in regards to trekking.Congratulations to /u/highwinds on the win. I'm pretty new to bicycling in general and hadn't seen many real jerseys when I submitted, but since then have immersed myself in it. I'll be back with a vengeance and more experience next round.I always have a cycling multi-tool on me with a chainbreaker and I keep a spare quick-release chainlink in my toolkit.

If the unthinkable happens and I need to walk a long way I use my multi-tool to remove the cleats from my shoes.

Have a patch kit with you. I prefer a mini-pump over CO2, you can fill the tire with air to find the hole. If you find the hole, you'll most likely find the cause of the flat (always check the tire and rim).

I also bring some zipties for when something loosens that shouldn't.You picked a nice color, it goes well with the chrome and leather.

One day i'll strip my winter/commuter roadbike and have it powdered in the colorscheme of the [cannondale synapse rival disc](http://www.cannondale.com/nam_en/2015/bikes/road/endurance-road/synapse/synapse-sram-rival-disc). Instead of "cannondale" I'd get my (nick)name on the downtube and my initials on the headtube and on the forks. The thing about looking forward and going fast actually works, also the thing about keeping hands on the bars and using shoulders and elbows to lean against the door or doorway - works perfectly. After 10 minutes I could ride almost not using wall to keep myself straightIt's a three lane one way road.
Change one lane to a bicycle and motorbike lane.
That will at a minimum mean some paint on the road and some signage, not 'fucking a lot of shit up' by any means. Thank you! I like the orange color scheme.&gt; had I not been in traffic...

&gt; ...and saddening since I broke my favorite shoes

Well you're lucky you only lost a pair of shoes and that your pedal came off. Terrifying indeed, it was an unpleasant suprise when I had it happen on a freewheeled bike. Can't imagin it happening on a fixed gear...Shit.I use heavy bontrager "hardcase" tires, the ones with metal wire, on my training wheelsIs that Ayrton Senna nephew?&gt; So what's cycling around Moscow like?

Over the weekend, a very good ride because no one in the city center practically lives. To work on weekdays tolerated. Today posted a video about everyday life and travel to work by bike in September last year.Yeah it's not very practical. It was meant for days when I needed to take the train (no restriction of folding bikes) but I got a little side-tracked! :D&gt;  the notion that cycling is an inherently risky activity (its not).

I think you'll agree with me that this bridge, right here, is not a place where you'd feel safe. No place to pull over, enclosed by very tall concrete barriers (6feet? It was hard to tell from the video).

I think I'm a very safe cyclist, and I'm also a very experienced cyclist, having cycled for 30 years in a large city.

On this bridge, I'd probably get off and become a pedestrian (or break the law and cycle on the sidewalk, if there were no people around).

Accidents and risks are also highly dependent on infrastructure.At this point, I'm usually getting 100 km (60 ish miles) every week. I'm bumping that up to about a hundred a week starting this weekend.Lovely work there! I do like this type of bike and would love to have one myself. Unfortunately I'm too tall for them because the seatpost never extends high enough for me. The model they put this jersey on looks like they are bloated. Thanks! I got the frame stripped and powdered locally. The bars are Velo Orange Porteur with Elk hide sew-on grips. :)
Wow, that's a good job. I like the handlebars and brakes. 

Did you repaint the frame? Did you do it yourself or had somebody do it? It looks nice.Know if your feet are wide and get wide shoes to accommodate them! I got narrow shoes (Shimano R088) for my wide feet and decided to go on a six day bike tour from San Francisco past Los Angeles. My feet had me curled up on the bed after the second day, and I had to make it home with my shoes half closed and hopped up on ibuprofen. Not pleasant!I've never looked back...&gt;Reddit jersey

lolThe old "fast or safe" debate. I also prefer Folsom. the majority of vehicles using market st. During commuter hours are bikes according to the San francisco bicycle coalition. w00t!Glad that guy's ok. Bus driver is a hero. Yes, do tell us more about why we should wear what you want us to wear rather than what we want to wear? Honestly, riding a bike in London, all we get is don't ride here, do ride there, wear this, don't wear that, don't stop there, do stop there, where's your hi-viz? Why are you wearing Lycra? Slow down! You're going too slow! Your lights are too bright! Your lights are on! Your lights are too flashy! Take the lane! Get off the road! Don't wear black! Where's your helmet? Get out of the way! Don't ride in the gutter! Why are you crying?Thank you! That much more pumped about it. In order for cycling to become 'safe' it needs to become mainstream and appear as a safe and everyday activity that everyone can participate in and not only *adventurous* middle-aged men who need to don a 10-piece activity-specific outfit to do.

Also, it's getting a *lot* better (in SF anyway) recently, but for some reason us cyclists are *incredibly* impractical. Stem slammed road bike + uncomfortable messenger bag and clip-less shoes is what people think they should be commuting in. I'll admit to that being me at a younger age, but it seems practical bikes with panniers + front basket + upright position are making a resurgence. 



people have *too much* ambitionThere isn't a brick n' mortar in the world that wouldn't try and sell him a new bike if he brought that frame in. I'm so sick of bike shops... They're Ksyrium SLs. Great wheel for everyday and race day abuse. They're bombproof, stiff, and fairly light. Not aero, but who cares. I have the SLRs and think they're the best alloy wheel on the market, even with Mavic's shitty hubs.And what a fine job you did. It looks a really fun ride.That's the wrong direction to travel in winter!   
I made the same mistake and went south in the middle of summer.  

Also, you split that over four days?! How many miles did you get in per day?Yup. Personality and an eagerness to learn is what gets you hired. Bikes are easy to learn.Cat 6 isnt a real division of racing, its just a joke to describe the commuters who feel like they have to be the fastest every morning on the ride to work. 

[Related article.](http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com.au/2011/05/probing-for-answers-cat-6-racing-boom.html)Ok sir. You ride like that. Check out the AirZound. Refillable and it mounts on the barsYeah exactly. Don't actually engage the brakes until you see danger, but have your fingers resting on the levers so you're ready. Sorry I should have made that clear.Oh, over here we use it to ruin our roads and make the country miserable.Even sim city 4 had that issue :/Thank you dude! I swapped the forks for a set of 24" from an old road bike. I run track brakes on it.

[Here's](http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r82/ThiBitterPill/TwentyFour_zpseae9f884.jpg) how it turned out. Y'all motherfuckas are gonna look like the default Samsung Galaxy wallpaper in this.Sick! Reminds a bit of Rabobanks jerseys. Definetly getting one this year.I need this in my life and I need it with overnight shippingSoon you'll be able to do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIcrppPDqFIUgh.... if you live out the road in my community you have to go along a 45mph to get into town. It's the only way in, period. 

It's no problem.  Wide shoulders &amp; passing zones mean cars can get around bikes easily.  I've never had a problem as a motorist or a rider.

Where I do have problems is in the busy downtown traffic.  And those speed limits vary between 10 and 25mph.I'm on Golden Gate just east of Divis. Dont get the full hill but I do time the lights every morning!Not bad, not bad.Agreed. That's the reason I voted this design over others. Maybe if it was across the pockets out would look better, but it clashes on its own up there and make it look bad.Was going to ask about age too.  My city makes it illegal for anyone over 12 to ride on sidewalks (I think that's the cutoff anyway).  Basically before puberty, you may ride on sidewalks because no one expects you to go very fast.  After you've grown you need to ride on the road.  In reality, they let the middle school kids slide but do enforce the rule for high school students and adults.Will it be available in Europe?

Eh, it was actually a pretty good joke.  I didn't know Germans were allowed to make good jokes.  I'm kidding, of course. 

...Sort of.   I studied german for 4 years in college and only ever heard my teachers (who were Austrian and German) make one outright joke.  My german's pretty rusty, but I think it went something like...

&gt;Warum soll Man nicht nach funf im Urwald gehen?  

&gt;Weil die Elephanten Fallschirmabsprunguebung haben.  (Or is it "Fallschimabsprung ueben haben"? )
this is the key. keep in the paceline. keep out of the lead. if you're training and hitting a 7 hour century by yourself, know that the same effort is equivalent to a 5 hours century in the paceline in zone 2. it's so much easier. that said, it's easy to get in a pissing match with the one-day riders. let em go and pass em when you get to mid way mark and they peel off to tent-ville. fuck em. you don't need em. second half is when shit gets REALIt signifies cars licensed in The Netherlands. It was an attempt at banter.
I take Turk (Balboa) to Baker to Golden Gate to my office at Gg&amp;Taylor. If you wait at the top of the hill above Divis, the lights are timed all the way to Gough. 

You can cruise at like 30mph the whole way down. It's amazing.and practice staying away from rookie folks who don't know how to ride a paceline. keep your chin up and fingers on the brakes. it's risky until renton and then you can relax, a bit. preride from seattle to the hill and back at least a couple of times before the ride. it'll get you used to the first half and you'll get confident. 

i hear each year a few riders get ass raped in winlock. watch your back door. So true. I'll take my chances hurling myself toward roots, ruts and rocks. At least as the rider, you have only yourself to blame and you usually have actual control over what you hit or don't hit.You sure it wasn't: accidental hit, attempted but unsuccessful run.Still shouldn't havehey, one day newbie. it's ok. there's lots of time left. just do what the training tips on the cascade site tell you. exactly. do the mileage and you'll be ok. even though there was a shitty 96 degrees f heat warning last year, i pulled through no problem in 11 hours. why"? i drank way too much and ate like a mofo and i did all the training to the letter.

Yeah but Minneapolis has entire bike boulevards to ride recklessly on. And we do!Completely agree with this. The overall look gives a very streamlined and cutting edge look, but the /r/bicycling part stands out too much and affects the flow of the design. Also the lettering is a bit too rounded, but I understand it was done to standardize the font like the front.

Overall, very cool design, and I would definitely pick one upoh, fuck, please don't do this. please keep these sorry fucks away from the goodness that is STP. last year I did it and found the same dickhead ford f.350 driver following someone nearby to make sure their little precious was okay. for fucks sake, if you are going to do this ride, do it like everyone else. pack a shit ton of food in your fucking bag, or bring some fucking cash to buy some shit on the the many, many stores along the way. but, please, don't think you need to have a fucking mini van full or your shitty wife and kids following you all day.please. That's exactly what I'm looking for. I love my krampus, but felt I needed a little more tire for some snow this winter. 

I got some gold weinmann wheels coming for it, they're heavy but I hear they're near indestructible too. Going to run a turbine cinch crank in the front with a narrow wide chainring, SLX rear der, SLX or deore brakes (depending on how much cash I have), and a king headset, since I've always wanted one. Thinking blue atlas handlebars, blue chainring, and blue seat to be all matchy matchy. I'm really excited for this build. I'm going to basically build it up one piece at a time as I can afford it this spring so I get my dream fatty. To be fair, I don't think it be much better to ride a bike off a cliff.Haha, thanks for the laugh.A lot of us in /r/mtb are honestly afraid to ride on the road.  Throw myself down a mountain, no problem.  Ride on a street in rush hour, hell no.  You roadies have guts. ISM AdamoThis was my exact thought. Good to see that I'm not the only peloton nerd hereThanks! Looking to those awhile ago. Thinking of getting the microshift but saw a claris around 90$

Swap 'em for some conti GP-4000's!

Sweet bike!Been trying to use some myself, good luck!!!

I find looking up, like others have said, helps. Also, get your wheels spinning as fast as you comfortably can. I find that helps. Minneapolis rider here.  Winter biking is fun!   The cold is hardly bad at all once you get going and generate your own heat. Wind can suck, i'll give you that, but when spring comes you'll be loving what that wind did for your legs.

This winter has been a piece of cake. I was actually praying for more snow because I have studded tires and am not a fan of rolling them on dry path... also too lazy to change them out until spring.

Just get out and enjoy it.  We are stuck with a long winter, might as well take advantage of it.About to do the same thing myself... /r/bicycling is filled with car apologists, too. Plenty here defend the following of car-centric road laws when the laws are attacked for their absurdity, without taking an equally critical look at the absurdity of such laws.http://i.imgur.com/W1RqoBn.jpgYou know, a lot of reviewers have been saying that the ICT is basically a fat Krampus, which is actually really rad. I haven't ridden one myself but hear nothing but good things about them. What's the rest of your build look like? Hehe, well it just means you are now challenged to get out on yours and take some even more awesome bike/scenery photos!It was almost a tie for me between *Somuch* and the winner. *Somuch* has a cleaner, more refined look, but the colors and pattern really pop with the winner.

What are the chances of you submitting a design next year?His upper body does not move, it does not carry any inertia relative to his hips or shoulders, so there is no mechanical stress besides the weight of his torso vs gravity. Anybody with a strong core who is flexible enough can hold this position on the bike without risk of injury.I don't know about iOS, but on Android I regularly run Endomondo and Strava at the same time with no problems.   No compromise necessary.Thanks again for putting all this work into the whole process! Thanks! I'd be lying if I didn't say the color played a big factor. That along with being symmetrical unlike the pugsley and moonlander. The front thru axle I also liked so I can go to a bluto in the future, and the MDS is awesome. I love how flexible the frame is. 

I also really like the the rust resistant coating they paint the frame with. There's a lot to love about the ICT.

I forgot to add, the geometry played a big part too. I have a krampus and really dig how it rides, and the ICT is closest to that out of all the fatties. Finding errands to run or commuting via bike is a good way to get all over the place.  If you can do everything on a bike, then every grocery, library, anything trip becomes time to bike. :DWow this is reaaaaly similar the velocult logoIt was definitely the best design,  I can see how it wouldn't appeal to everyone but it was the best. I also think this subreddit has a lot of serious cyclists, probably just not as fast as you though. Cheers. Thirty years of daily biking &amp; I have no issues. It's like a cat scratching post.Just got on this 2004 Carbon Scott CR1. 
I had been in the market for a new racing bike since I joined the cycling team at USF. 

Big step up from my 1999 Allez (aluminum).

She has a Mavic Ksyrium wheel set with bladed spokes. 

Full Ultergra components. Not going to upgrading this puppy for a LONGGGGG time.... Although I'm thinking a new pair of slicks would do me well. 


Edit: actually not positive about the name of this wheel set. yes microshift is pretty good and really cheap. its at least as good as the A073 if not a bit better. Ride your bike there.NICE! What made you go with the ICT over other fatties? I've been eyeing some Salsas pretty intensely over the past few weeks.I have a Garmin 510 and use Live Track
Why were there a ton of people/cops near the end?The contact patch is entirely determined by the pressure. It's literally pounds per square inch. So if your wheel has 100 pounds on it and is pumped to 100 psi, it will have a contact patch of one square inch.

Just because your tires say 95 psi max doesn't mean they will explode if you use 100 psi. That's a minimal difference anyway, so go ahead with 95 if you want and rest assured this will give similar performance as your old setup.+1 for Glympse. I use it twice a day on my commutes as well as long rides. Only drawback is the 4 hour max sharing time but if you can stop during your ride at least once every 4 hours you can reset the expiration timer. &gt;i can't find any brand that support 21 speed/3x7.

Old shimano stuff will do it (but not dura ace). 8 speed microshift will too. Or even more modern claris and sora.

 Should be the same spacing as 8 speed anyway, so any 7 or 8 speed stuff will work just fine.

See the comment above. It will be on reddit marketplace. Stay informed with the google group:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reddit-jersey-announcei can't find any brand that support 21 speed/3x7.I have a pair of sure light slip on shoes that I strap to my belt I put my cell in(it's a running belt because I don't have a kit) if I think I might be riding into sketchy situations. This one I figured would turn to dirt somewhere just not as soon as it did. If I get a flat or break something I can walk out without dying. What exactly irritates you?It's illegal to ride on the sidewalk in most places.That's what I use. 

Is there an Android equivalent?Thanks! Bike rides like a champ too!!Is microshift good? I saw it while browsing before.just a heads up:
http://www.snopes.com/quotes/twain.asp

still a cool quote tho, but definitely not true.

(source: born and raised in SF)Why?fuck yeah! I hope that cop actually did something. I had a similar thing happen, but I think the cop must have got a nice bribe or somethingDefinitely agree with this.

It would be perfect and make much more sense from a style point if this were the case. Whoa...your top speed is 23? I live in houston and its bothing but flat...hit 34 on the way home from work...whoa...i'm alot faster than i thought i was...i'm sorry if i'm mean...My topspeed is twice this. :DPurchased because I wanted to upgrade from my '13 Specialized Roubaix SL2 w/ 105 which was slightly too big for me and didn't inspire too much vigor or enthusiasm. 

I looked at several bikes: Giant Defy, Cannondale CAAD10, Giant TCR, Cervelo R3, Trek Madone, etc. I was open to any and all possibilities, but as I kept doing my research I saw that Cervelo made my ideal bike, so I started the hunt for an RS. After a few weeks of scouring craigslist, eBay and PinkBike on the daily, I found this one with Zipp 404's and full Ultegra at an amazing price that I couldn't pass up. 

I have wrapped the bars in Lizard Skin and added some Speedplay pedals to the bike. I have some new wheels coming (H Plus Son Archetypes w/ Ultegra/DT Swiss hubs) and I intend on selling the Zipp wheelset this month. After that, this bike shouldn't see any changes or modifications for a long time. 

I ride anywhere from 20-60mi on weekends, and my round trip to work is 20mi. I don't intend to race it, I ride for fun and to challenge myself. I'm not looking for a hardcore racing bike, but one that allows for a fun, nimble, comfortable ride. Becoming uncomfortable in the middle of a route has the capability of ruining the whole ride. 

If I could change anything, I'd keep these amazing Zipp hubs instead of selling them with the wheelset. When my new wheelset comes in, I'll be 100% happy with the bike. I've done this ride before. Find a pace line that's not making you work real hard to keep up and enjoy the draft. Take short turns at the front. With 10k people you should need to be in the front of a pace line for long until after 100 miles or so. I love the colors and patterns, but why is "/r/bicycling" cutting across the lines on the back when "reddit" on the front is fit inside the lines and parallel?Poor little guy. That's probably the reason why you didn't see any, because they are all too scared to go near the roads ! :DHave velosurance and am currently going through a claim, will update you on how it goes &gt;I have a thumb shift on my bike and I'm planning to upgrade

So you have thumb shifters on drop bars? Thats really strange but i guess not unheard of, if its the weird stem/thumb levers. If its not clear, you won't be able to properly use road levers on flat bar. Just making sure you are aware of that.

&gt;STI A073

Just buy some used better shifters. They will be better than those crap ones.

Used tiagra, 105, ultegra, should be able to be purchased for &lt;$100 on ebay and craigslist.

or you could buy new microshift levers, anything is better than that stupid shitty pointy lever on the side.

(Not dissing campagnolo style, they actually have a great thumb lever, i prefer campagnolo)For the love of god don't spend your money on the A073... just go used on CL or ebay for something better or even the Claris which I think is super smooth, you can also give Microshift a try but the non-paddles on the A073 I don't think will give you the full Brifter feel. This happened to me once while going up an overpass,  it's surprising to say the least I live on top of a hill. Going down through the neighbor hood streets I hit around 35 each time. Its really fun until after a long ride, then you get the joy of riding up.It was eerie how little wildlife we saw. This was basically it, and it was dead!It's not comic sans, but the much more appropriate VAG rounded that reddit's logotype is set in. I like this face because it feels much less gendered than 2012's ultra-masculine selection, and because it has a stronger visual connection to the reddit brand than the script face used in 2014. That said, I would have liked to have seen the same weight used for "reddit" across both the jersey and the website.Will do! My second to most recent video I have text on the screen instead of using those lame annotations explaining what is happening in each clip. Glad you enjoy my videos, always love to hear that :)had to look up "brifters" turns out all you meant was integrated brake and shift levers.

it seems people love 'em!Which one did you vote for and why do you see this as unappealing?RIP Mr. Raccoon :(Haha awesome. I like watching your videos. Quite entertaining. A little info on where you are headed or why you showed that clip would make it more entertaining :)where/when can you get this?I don't race or ride long distance. I just use it for commute.Ah, my bad. Looked a lot like comic sans first time I lookedSPACE HORSE!I'm pretty sure that's [VAG Rounded] (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/vag-rounded/) - the same font used in Reddit's logo. oh... well you're welcome lol.

But yeah. Triple cranks suck. They're more work to clean, more work to shift, theyre just a waste of metal. Look for bikes that have a wide-range cassette (like 11-28 or 11-32 cassette) which will give you the same super wide gear range as a triple crank does. Guys, can anybody explain to me why Wiggins's lower back posture on that picture isn't super unhealthy?  I'm fairly new to cycling and not too knowledgeable about technique yet, but from my background in other sports this feels like a great way to get injured.I was very close to getting that exact kind of bike after commuting via MTB for many years as well. I ended up going with just a crossrip instead. (Which I know is not a road bike of course, but not super different especially compared to a mountain bike).

I really love the difference after so long on a mountain bike. So much nicer! The thing that really took some getting used to was the difference in gear ratios. My legs were pretty used to the good pickup of the lower ratio of the MTB, and then to suddenly go to the much higher ratio of the cyclocross bike really left me sore for a few days.

You're going to love it though. Much more spritely.Reminds me vaguely of the old Rabobank kits. Not in a bad way. I got it at a local shop so I'll probably go back and see what they have. I'll definitely look into the fitness hybrids as they're right in my budget.

Thanks for the tips!Generally, when there are no reasonable alternatives, bikes are allowed on interstates.   I know that in California, near Camp Pendleton, sometimes the roads through the Marine base are closed to traffic.   During those times, it's legal to use I-5 as that's the only route through it.I also considered the Straggler but got the space horse.  i got the horse because of aesthetic and more braze-ons.  The Straggler still has a place in my heart though.  I have a 56cm 2010 Tarmac and am 6'1. I wish I had gone for the 58cm and just used a shorter and slammed stem.  58cm would most likely work out for you once to set the correct seat and bar position. I'm either going to work, classes, home, bike session, or going out to eat somewhere. My bike is my only means of transportation, so I use it to go everywhere. Where are you going? As noted above its common for cyclists to use this bridge and it's encouraged for them to do so. What I can't gather us if the guy who got hit is standing up, why isn't he down there beating the fuck out of the person who hit him. Or at least scaring the fuck out if them. When I came super close to getting tboned, I told the chick driving that I was a father and she'd nearly stopped my kids from having one. She was blubbering and shaking so I hope she got the message. No, Your bike is not a bad build, missing holes, or have a tube welded upside down. 

The bike in the picture provided from the trek website is a much larger size than yours. It has a longer seat tube that can accommodate water bottle cage bosses without them interfering with the mounting of the seat post. As you may have also seen, the bosses on the bottom side of your downtube are indeed supposed to be there as location for an additional bottle cage or other accessory.Comical, let's agree to disagree. That happened to one of us on a bike tour. Not fun to be in rural northern Minnesota and missing a pedal. We were pretty close to Duluth so we just had to have him wait while we sent someone into town for a new one.Brifters are awesome.  They make it convenient to shift.  A073 for $100 though?  Ehh.  I'm not sure that's worth it.

I would look at getting a road bike with brifters as your next bike.that's not comic sansoh god. guess im not buying onemaybe a dude with rubbing brakes or something
Why is the writing on the back in comic sans D:On the streets of San Jose, California. In some of the rougher neighborhoods there's lots of glass on the streets (I believe it must be from breaking into cars?). Though I also have had multiple flats from just plain thorns.  It could be that it was something of the past (around 2000 - 2005) and bicycle tires are much better now. I have about 800 miles on my current tires and have not flatted yet. EDIT: And I ride in much better neighborhoods now :-).Any anyways, I just double checked my calculations in Google Sketchup. I created a pair of wheels with a wheelbase of 110cm, each wheel had a diameter of 740mm which corresponds to a 700c rim wearing a 42mm tire, aka. a 29er. 

I then deleted the rear (depending on your perspective) wheel and replaced it with a 700mm tire, which corresponds to a 700c rim wearing a 22mm tire. 

This is the largest possible difference a typical consumer can reasonably hope to expect or tolerate. 

The result? An offset of 1.2 degrees, pretty close to my original rough calculations especially considering I didn't bother to google the exact tire measurements that time. 

So that means you could have normal tires (offset 0d), small front (-1.2d), or small rear (+1.2d), which happens to be three possible alternate head tube angles a person can choose from, should that be their main desire, with a total range of 2.4 degrees. So I assume that if a person had an extreme head tube angle to begin with, they could change a tire to help negate it, or end up with an uncommon headtube angle. 

Oh, [pics so you all know it happened](http://imgur.com/yuRS4LM). I'll gladly upload the file to anyone who wants to measure for themselves. Pedestrian lane.  Biker was in the bike share lane.I just started cycling for fitness. My next bike will be a road bike and I'm already making a list of things I want. Up until a few minutes ago I had no idea what a triple crank set was. Thanks for the input.I wish these incidents were relabelled as attempted murder.
Because that is exactly what it is.
We need to stop pussyfooting around with road rage, people die on the road.
This was not an accident, it was a clear road, the car was not involved in a collision with another vehicle which resulted in a secondary collision with the cyclist.

The fact the cyclist did not receive substantial injuries is irrelevent. 

Only when the legal system is able to take road rage drivers and those who drive with gross negligence off the street can we expect to see cycling on public roads become safe.I don't think millions of people around the world would be using them every year if they *weren't* worth it...

That being said, I bet you could find a used pair of Shimano Tiagra shifters on eBay or something for that much money (make sure you specify 'shifters' because they make reels of the same name).Three or more flats on a bad day.... I hope I never have a bad day. I guess it depends on what kind of surface you are riding on but on the streets I have a flat maybe once every 4000miles.I moved to SF from Portland. I only lived in SF about 6 months, and this was more than 10 years ago, but SF's weird is not the same as Portland's, like they don't mix. Portland used to be edgier - more libertarian than the hippies of California. I always felt like SF likes their version of weird to be more mainstream or clich. And people were not nearly so friendly.  Like they could tell I didn't belong. Im super excited for the Cap especially, I really hope it looks as nice as the rest of the kit. 
Your wheels weren't spinning fast enough.My only experience with that area is from touring down the west coast on the 101, and the section just south of Crescent City was probably the most difficult, confusing, and awesome part of it. miles and miles of climbing, drastic temperature changes as you get higher up, and (the morning i rode it anyway) the fog up in the forest drenches you. however, you're riding  through the redwoods and it's beautiful and amazing and i would absolutely recommend doing it.The only thing that's wrong with your bike is that triple crank *slaps knee*Still no. I did the drawing. The difference with a 42c front and 25c rear and a 1000mm wheelbase (More extreme than your setup) is less than 1. It's all in your head.True. Last weekend it was mid 60s. 

This weekend, 20's and snow. Ahh! Good for you.Thank you for your advice. I have taken a more defensive attitude towards school zones and bike lanes in general since this incident. 

The video does not show it, but there is quite a sharp negative incline to the road and so coasting does pick the speed up fairly quickly. I'm being extra cautious now. This is heavy-trafficked, 3-lane one-way road in the middle of town, that is heavy congested already. The only way they could add a bike lane would be to remove a regular lane. That's not logistically or economically reasonable, not when there's a bike lane literally one fucking block away.

Like I said, if you ride fast, ride the road. But if you're going 10mph, what the hell do you care about going a block out of your way?

American metropolitan architectural layouts and city planning is very different than in Europe. This is in a very dense part of the city. You can't just add a bike lane without fucking a lot of other shit up.yeah, awhile ago. you obviously weren't missing itAnd trolls. A lot of people get a big kick out of trolling that particular set of mouth-breathers.It was on a flat.I know they make cleat covers, but I would like to see whole shoe covers. Preferably clown-shoe-sized.You should be keeping your weight and grip on the hands pressing against the bars, and not the other side where your fingers touch the brakes. And if you're on a MTB, then you should only be using your pointer fingers to engage the brakes, gripping with your other four fingers on the bars... Should have no reflex pulling if holding your bike right.&gt; a full bike wash and a full degrease/clean/lube of the drivetrain

I know it can be done, and that people do it (as you illustrate), but the fact of the matter is that your drivetrain is still getting eaten up much faster than normal, even if you're cleaning weekly (especially with the slop we've had this year). 

I know, relatively speaking, that it's peanuts compared to car maintenance and yadda yadda yadda. I guess that's what separates the die hards (you) from the [mostly] fair-weather riders (me). I've no issue with bicyclists using the road, I bicycle many times myself, but if bicyclists cross that bridge so much, why haven't they created a designated path for them yet? I see the walking path, why not a bicycle path?!

And since this is /r/bicycling, I don't think it's necessary to say that in a lot of places riding a bike on a walking path can get you a ticket. Love the color scheme! The Bike looks fun as well! Trek makes some great bikes.Oops, incorrect unitI think your color choices here look fantastic. Ride on, man.110mm wheelbase? 3? No way, not even close, to both.I knew it would be this one. It's a really cool design. Can't wait to buy one.never mind than lolI used to skate board it frequently too, It's a breeze on a bike. You can easily keep up with traffic so just keep your head on the swivel, and be safe. It's a fun ride, enjoy!If you're riding similar routes frequently you should be able to cancel out some of the noise.  Yeah lots of things are always different on rides but if your last 10 rides were on average faster than your last 100 that's a good indicator.  Especially if your app allows you to group and compare similar routes.  I'm not sure if Strava does that.While the drive was wrong, why was this dumb ass on the biking not riding on the sidewalk?? 
Why the fuck would you attempt to ride slower than traffic on a busy high speed limiit road??? The driver and bike rider were both stupid.  Folsom bike lane blues? I love to hate it and hate that I love it.Something something dust caps...he was riding in the middle of the fucking road....http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vjmru/attempted_hit_and_run_on_a_biker_stopped_by_bus/coik7z5Have a support vehicle person/crew meet you at any stops you take. Ask them to bring your favorite goodies and their motivational speeches. Even though food is provided at stops, nothing beats your favorite food and friends and family to join in.

Coming from a racing and touring background, to prepare for a long ride, I will normally stagger my rides over a week or two (maybe three or four if you aren't as experienced). For example, the first week, I will ride six days out of the week, doing 15-30-45-60-30-15-rest. The following week will be 25-45-60-80-50-30-rest. I don't have any sports science to support this, but I find this a better method than cranking out two 100 mile rides and then being too fatigued for the rest of the week. Before last year's STP, I only did an extremely easy 10 mile ride after a rest day.When it starts fraying and shifting feels like crap, presumably OP will.On a serious note, I legitimately felt bad for him. It just seemed like he was really desperate for some form of communication from another human being.for science!!That's not so bad.

The other source of chaos is somewhat visible from the picture. There's a bus/streetcar island in the middle of the street, and all of the bicycles have to go straight from the right lane, which is shared by cars using it as a right turn only lane. Only taxis, buses, streetcars, and idiots can use the left lane. The right lane is also frequently very narrow to the point where filtering takes some serious effort. I've found it's easier to just hang behind other cars, but many other cyclists will insist on squeezing by to the front, using any means available: the bus lane, part of the island, the sidewalk...

SF has made steps towards reducing the amount of non-commercial auto traffic on this road; it would almost make sense to eliminate it entirely as it's a very bad car route, but that can't be done quite yet. Improving traffic crossing the street, since it's so centrally located, is almost more critical to improving this road than to making more changes to the road itself.2019, in Ann Arbor. :(If you aren't buying clip less pedals yet I would just ride with regular athletic shoes on the platform pedals until you are ready to get clip less pedals and shoes. As for good brands? I have no idea. I would just go to your local bike store and try a lot on to see how they feel. I have some pretty simple bontrager shoes because my local bike store was a trek dealer when I bought my bike. My new store is a giant dealer and sells a lot of shimano stuff. I am sure you can't really go wrong with either of those brands. Just make sure you buy a shoe that has the right holes for whichever pedals you want. Some shoes have both kinds of holes, like mine, others will only have the three holes for SPD-SL type cleats, while some will only have the two holes for the mountain bike type cleats. Your best bet is to ride around and get comfortable enough on your bike until you are ready to get clip less pedals then go to your local bike store and ask for help. They'll steer you in the right direction and help you find the best fit for your needs.mounting it on the hood is going to be a real pain.

but 3d printing anything in PLA is probably not going to stand up to abuse, just FYI

Maybe I will try them at 95 tomorrow.  It says 85-95 max though and they are much harder than my old tires and seem to be "rounder" (in the sense that they seem to maybe have a smaller contact patch like when I ride on skinnier tires on summer set up pure road bikes).Many bridges allow cyclists to use the entire right lane due to wide expansion joints, cables, and other tire eating monsters that are on the pedestrian side. I rode across many bridges and through tunnels like that on a cross country tour. Maybe there needs to be some better signage to let motorists know they may come up on a bicycle?I've always wendered about measurements. I sort of figured the measurement was done from the inside radius, then any material (both normal and inverted treads come to mind) would be the few mm wider that everyone sees. Maybe that is the case.  Good thought though I can't seem to find what the Specialized Borough CX, 60TPI ones my bike came with weigh.  My other thought was maybe the contact patch as these ones seem "rounder" if that makes any sense.The laws are sooooo fucking skewed in LA, you'll get one ordinance and a contradicting one in another.  Mine is definitely illegal as it's over 3" but I've considered having the blade shortened down but the gray area is whether a fixed blade can be carried- one says completely no, another says yes if it's sheathed and fully exposed.  
  
However my store sells a lot of shit to cops they say:  as long as it's not "overly" illegal and not used negatively, they're not going to just ticket somebody for it.  No but. That lane wasn't built for two vehicles side by side. You'd change lanes to pass a car, you change lanes to pass a bike. Most people seemed to get the idea.###Official Results:

Before that, I used Life360. It wasn't quite as good because it would only update every 15 minBy my (admittedly rough) calculations, on a bike with 42mm tires and a 110cm wheelbase, replacing either the front or the rear tire with a 25mm tire would produce about a degree and a half of change in head tube angle. That means the widest change in head tube angle possible, from fat front/small rear to small front/fat rear should be about 3 degrees. Seeing as the entire spectrum of head tube angles ranges from about 71 to 74 degrees, I would say that there is a very large effect on head tube angle. 

Reproduceable, anecdotal evidence: when i first put a smaller rear tire on (42mm front to 35mm rear) I was amazed at how firmly the front tire held it's direction while speeding. No-hands especially has a difference. Now flip, put the 42 on the rear and the 35 on the front. Suddenly my bike (beefy 29er MTB here!) feels twitchier than my Vilano TT bike. Riding no-hands becomes much more difficult, the slightest lean produces a wide swing of the tire. 

Edit: 110cm, not mmI'll ride down O'Farrell tomorrow to see how it is. If you read about someone hit by the 38, you've got that on your conscienceCongrats!Your comment about geometry makes sense. Thanks. I bet there's nothing wrong with the bike. I should have specified that. I meant all the laws in your area (city/county/state) rather than just the state laws.

CA is a pretty interesting example. Open carrying that in L.A. would be completely illegal.Those are some hip bikes.I agree, but that thermometer just makes me want to hibernate...Great bike but they often have rear shifting problems. This is a combination of full run cable housing and a sora level rear derailleur. It works a lot better with a better derailleur, good housing, and a thin shift cable.Im in Milwaukee.  Soooo stir crazy, I'm going nuts.  I have the necessities to ride in winter, and like riding in the snow, but these temps are killing me.  I can't ride when it's below 20 degrees.  It sucks....To be fair, the queuing here is chaotic too. That is, it also makes some sense. Traffic lights are a place where the fast can calmly get past the slow, since the latter queuing on the right while the former push up a bit and generally leave the intersection quicker.

Organized chaos.if they welded the tube backwards, there would be a bottle boss on the rear of that tube, right next to the rear wheel. that would be a serious fuckup and you should return the bike or talk to trek.

if there is none, if i had to bet it has to do with the size of the bike.

your bike is the second to smallest size, and perhaps they deemed a bottle cage to be too unwieldy/uncomfortable to put there given the frame geometry. and looking at your bike, i'd agree. putting a bottle there would be a pain to get in and out, and might interfere with your legs.

if you really want to know, ask trek, or ask the shop if the other size 17.5 trek 8.6 ds's have seat tube bottle bosses.

a lot of the other pictures i'm seeing of other 8.6 ds in small sizes seem to agree with this hypothesis:

http://www.evolution-bikes.co.uk/bikes/hybrid/mens/trek-86-ds-starry-night-blacktrek-charcoaltrue-blue-155/Yep... but more importantly is actually the county laws, not state laws.  "Most" states are actually pretty relax, however it differs county to county and that's where people usually get fucked. Thanks for the reply. I'd never seen bottles there that's why I thought they welded my shit backwards hahahah. I guess you learn something new eery day. I assume fenders are somewhat mandatory if using a bottle down there.Start out very casually, and give yourselves 20 min (time it) to find what pace you think you can maintain...then back off 2 gears from that pace, and stay there for the next couple hrs.Yes it did but a $1000 bike and a $1000 deductible renters insurance isn't much good. Plus they don't cover the bbike away from home, only in the apt. Velosurance has a $100 deductible and they cover the bike for theft and accidentsNot bad points but I'm usually on country roads that aren't very busy hence why there are zero bike lanes. I generally just get over if i ear cars coming but it definitely makes sense to stay further away from the side. Mostly I just ride around the roads off of the blue ridge parkway because they're just as nice and not as busy.Agreed, that is why I was wondering if anyone had some experience with a similar replacement set of tires, or just general knowledge that could back up or disprove what I felt.  Since I have traffic and weather (and just basic difference of how I feel at different times/day to day) I do not have a precise enough group of measurements to show causation in times I feel fast but Strava says are slightly slower.Congrats, just wait and you'll start beating that on flats.

I used to do 40mph/60kph down a giant hill onto a bridge every day. Best part of my commute. However drivers were VERY unforgiving and would often do shit like buzz me (despite the fact that I was riding at the speed limit).

Can't believe people...Your English teacher's head just popped.Gimme gimme gimme [Water bottle bosses.](http://www.tamiasoutside.com/wp-content/themes/paalam/img/wbcage4.jpg)You should really re-think how you ride, the way you are doing it is putting you in danger.  You have had so many close calls with cars pulling out in front of you because cars look towards the middle of the road for oncoming traffic not all the way to the right where you are riding, ride further from the edge of the road and you will have fewer cars pulling out in front of you.  Also cars coming from behind will pass closer and faster to you if you are close to the edge of the road.  If you ride just far enough away from the curb so the overtaking car must cross the center line to pass you then they will slow down and since they are already over the center line they will give you more room than if they think they can squeeze by you without crossing the center line.  The final reason to get away from the curb is in case you have to dodge something in the street, if you are as close to the curb as you can be you can only swerve out into traffic. That's always the problem for small riders. You get to pick;

Smaller wheels (nothing wrong with that) And or ....

Sloping top tube (nothing wrong with that either) and or .....

Toe overlap.

Four of my bikes have sloping top tubes and I have a custom road bike that has classic diamond frame, full sized wheels and NO toe overlap. It's an engineering miracle and a work of art. But anything that fits and works if you're short.I'm going to be honest, I only run red lights when I see no cars coming and it's been red for awhile. But, I don't fly through red lights going 20mph without looking. Fuck that! LolYes when I say times I mean on Strava.  Problem is on a day like today there is 17 MPH wind in my face on the way home.  Many factors change that.  Never really thought about sensors, good point about that.Here's another huge picture, sorry about that. Its missing the cage holes on the tube with the seat post. I thought maybe the welded the tube backwards. 


http://imgur.com/KiQMqQDbut bicyclists run red lights!  I saw one today! wharblgarbl!
I absolutely love my GoPro Citrus. but what if you hit a bump and reflex pullWell, if you break a spoke you could tweak the others to make the wheel usable. But it's not critical, same with the chain tool, just nice to have to be self-sufficient.I commute all winter in Minnesota, maybe 2/3 of the winter I have to wade through this salt crap. Then every Sunday afternoon I'll do a full bike wash and a full degrease/clean/lube of the drivetrain. Pretty relaxing and meditative if you make it a habit. The [Park Tool chain scrubber](http://www.parktool.com/product/cyclone-chain-scrubber-CM-5-2) is a must-have in these conditions.  Remember that if you keep a healthy chain, the rest of your drivetrain will stay happy for a long time.

Then for the other 1/3 of the winter the roads will be bare and dry so it's just like riding the rest of the year! Except for the loud buzzing of my studded tires...Awesome.  thanks--that was driving me insane all day.post a picture of where the holes are supposed to be, your current picture only shows the lower set.... not sure why you would post a picture of the lower holes when you are concerned about not having the other ones...

are you saying there are literally no holes in the frame for the bottle cage?

or are there simply no bolts in them?Source: http://www.twinsix.com/gear/mens-techok hit and runs are bad.  let me get that out of the way.

but this fuckin roadie was out in the middle of the lane... i'm not saying he deserved it AT ALL, but fuck me man, get the fuck out of the middle of the lane.  have some gd courtesy. How much does your head tube angle change between a 25c and 42c tire?  I haven't done the math but I'm guessing it's negligible and not noticeable but mere humans. And rotational weight doesn't only affect the drive wheel. You have to accelerate both wheels, so no difference in acceleration, weight, or climbing.Here's the Salsa;

I think Garmin has Live Tracking.Yes, it is "ciudad de mexico". We usually don't call it that way. Since it is also called federal district or distrito federal we shorten it df. But your translation is correct. :)I only have one set of holes for the bottle cage, not two like the website shows. It makes me sad to acknowledge that this is true in Toronto. /sigh
So you're saying you don't have holes to mount a bottle cage?

what do you mean by both are "inside the triangle"?

don't know what you mean by bad build.

edit: after doing more research it seems like those holes are for another bottle cage.

still not sure what you think the problem is, your picture only shows those holes.

i highly doubt trek could fuck this upIf you're going really remote then a SPOT might be a good idea.  You can send several pre-programmed messages (OK, please call, non-emergency help, etc.) as well as a SOS beacon for serious shit.

saddle and bars seem too highNaw, they don't fight for a spot. They seem to refuse to queue in any sensible manner, though. There's also a decent amount of car traffic mixed in, but some blocks have a decent amount of room isolating bike traffic into its own narrow-ish lanes.You should know about http://www.geartrade.comGood idea, I'll bring a patch kit too.

I just plan to wear my bike shorts and jersey and maybe a base layer depending on the weather.Man, you're missing out. Flying down o'farrell is a great ride. I love riding down from Larkin to union. If I'm going west I ride golden gate though it is definitely not as nice of a ride.This might be a PSA or something.  That cop was there entirely way too fast, as well as no traffic buildup.  Seems kinda staged.

Hit:  3:06:33 PM

Bus Stopped: 3:06:44 PM

Cop Talk: 3:07:15 PMI think I could manage walking for a ways..and worse case I'm a max of 7.5 miles from civilization so it isn't that bad.

How essential is the spoke wrench...I don't even own one right now.  Should I?A might fine [opinion](http://img.pandawhale.com/102690-tipping-intensifies-gif-neckbe-HLOi.gif) you have there!I just realized that the website shows the set of holes under the frame. Im still missing a set inside the triangle.  The first time I rode clipped in it felt like I had 4 legs. That's gotta count for something!Whats up guys, i just discovered these 1/4-20 threaded holes under my bike. I wonder if this is a bad build. The bike webside shows two set of holes on the bike and they're both, "inside the triangle"

Here's the bike on the website:

Ps, sorry if the image is huge, uploaded from my phone. 
use your elbows and shoulders instead of your hands to steady yourself inside the door frame ....in a post-apocalyptic world.Doesn't need to be posted at least not in my state.  That is one reason I hate those signs, I may always use full lane.It's true. There's probably almost no one in the world who's top speed of all time is lower than that.I also have a 64cm bike that I'm happy on. Cool.

Random question I was thinking about earlier today: "Mexico city" in spanish is..."Ciudad de Mexico?"  Do people normally call it that or do they shorten it in some way?  

Like I said, I had this question flit through my brain earlier today, and I can't pass up the opportunity to ask when I just happen to cross keyboards with somebody who seems to live there. :) 

Also I apologize for my high-school level spanish being completely terrible. more *is* teenage males.Out of curiosity, why? Cyclist mentality? I find it hard to imagine people fighting for a spot on while a bike.If it is the same company, Elgin was a decent American watch and clock maker.  Didn't know that they made bikes.Could you give some examples of how it's the anti-Portland? 
(just curious)too much text, I assume it said something offensive, so screw youUnless they're treating it as a speed contest, if anyone rides about the same pace it's delightful to cycle in. Note that this spreads out rather significantly when the light turns green. It's just that at stops it all squeezes into one tight mass.&gt; commute race

Race? Are most of these trying to ride as quick as possible? I can imagine that being annoying.

If so, imagine a future where everyone just wants to get where he needs to be, but not at sweaty-high-speed. Just waits for their turn, all ride in a line. That'll come, just give it time.One minute response time by the police...not bad. Would have been 6 o'clock by the time they arrived in my town.It is hard to see, but (I'm speculating) it looks like the car was tailing the bus really close + picking up speed, but as the bus started to turn left because of the cyclist, the driver of the car probably didn't see him until too late crashing into him...really reckless and then trying to flee. The bus driver did the right thing.   that's how you do it, in the doorway.  keep your head up as already suggested. just don't get drunk and think "now would be a great time to ride rollers."  it's not, trust me. Bar end streamers?Coulda shoulda woulda. Safety first. And this is America, that's 35mph, which is travelled at 40-45mph usually. Well, how to avoid traffic when I bike to work during the summer?@.@Agreed. I would take the sidewalk.In all fairness, they threw the book compared to most prosecutions.Sorry, no pictures yet.  I'll try to get a few tomorrow.  I'm really just looking for any info on the bicycle that I can find.  They have the paper work for it and know what the year and model are...but I can't find anything online for the year and model combination.yup, I've had that couple times! Can be a pain that's for sure.Work on market, live near Alamo square - its my most direct route without riding on geary/O'Farrell/golden gate

Let's ride some time!Its almost here man. ALMOST!
If you don't want to let your "friends" see your route you can just give your wife your password. Mine logs into my account to check on me while I ride.I can't speak for Zen, but I'm doing around 100 miles a week at this point, just waiting for better evening light to get to ~150 a week. That's going to be my weekly goal as soon as light allows for it.&gt;1. top ten bikes on the market?

Doesn't matter if your shop doesn't sell them, nor if your customer doesn't want that.

&gt;2. most cutting edge innovations in the technology in the last few years..

Doesn't matter if your customer isn't looking to spend $2000-3000 for a bike.

&gt;3. valuable trending sound bites/topics

Don't try to be that person who knows the buzzwords but doesn't know what they mean.

Learn about what you're selling. Know it inside and out, from the bottom of the range all the way to the top. Know the differences between Steel, Carbon, and Aluminum.

Know the difference between gear ratios and how/when they are used.

Know the Shimano/Sram/Campagnolo component hierarchy. 

And know the names of all the parts. (Rear derailleur, front derailleur, crankset, brakes, cables, housing, pedals, cassette, headset, seatpost, saddle, handlebars, stem, wheels, hubs, spokes, rims, tires, tubes, tape)

Know the brands your shop sells.

eventually learn how to recommend different frame sizes.

All of that knowledge about bikes will help you sell them most effectively.

Its also important to understand what kind of shop it is. Is it a super high end shop that caters largely to wealthy people? Is it a place in the city that is focused on fixies/track/singlespeed? What kind of bikes do they stock? Tri/TT bikes? Is it more of a Mountain bike place? 

Make sure you know what accessories go with what, and how they are used, and suggest people buy that stuff from your shop.

edit: also know and understand all the wheel sizes
To all of the folks who are doing a one-day this year (and especially are newbies...), my buddy who started this thread and I are doing the one-day ride. We're both virgins. We're both crazy.

I *think* the goal is to average 14-15mph on-road so that our four stops don't keep us from getting into Portland in time.

Anyone want to join us?!Like when you're at the beach and you get too close to the surf.  It's like taking a bath bro.Can confirm: am bike.For recreation, there are some really nice trails. Unless by complete chance they don't take a direct path anywhere, but there are definitely plenty of trails in Omaha.

I like to go places, so for me it isn't great, East-West is the primary direction through the city and the trails mostly go North-South.

I live in Lincoln, and have only ridden some of the trails in Omaha. Someone else in Omaha may be of more help.&gt; We have a damn video and people are still saying people should ride like this.

A single data point doesn't mean it's a bad idea.I hope no stupid people injure themselves and sue the owners.That is definately something for a mountain bike. The fastest I've gone is 83km/h I live in a hilly area out in the country and we have a mile long 16% grade strait. It goes by so quickWhat? No pictures?I wear a helmet on mine! Your rental insurance can be updated to include a high valued bike. Talk to your broker about adding a named peril to the policy. Essentially you add your bike specifically to the policy which will increase the premium a bit. You usually can decide in the deductible on it as well. Typically a much cheaper option than a bike only policy.Great read.
I think social evolution "isn't there yet". We've come a long way from black slaves not being considered as people to where we are now. Today if you're openly racist, sexist or homophobic you get fired. I hope the next thing modern civilizations throw to the curb is toxic behaviors and overall being an asshole to anyone for any reason. Patience though, it might not be in our time, but let's work toward it. You don't want to be on the wrong side of the debate in history books.Hey how's the biking in Omaha? I might get orders there. Looked like a nice park on the south side for cycling...[Glympse](https://www.glympse.com/what-is-glympse)"it never gets easier, you just go faster" - Greg LeMond, nice one OPI think you commented on the wrong thread...Generally you can get specific riders for this sort of thing cheaply, even if it's not in the stock plan.SF is so weird, but in an entirely predictable way.  It's kinda like an anti-Portland in that regard.  Portland is weird, but in ways you'd never possibly imagine.  SF is great for some people, but irritates me to no end in many ways.It's a troll. This thread is exactly the kind of attention s/he wants.Endomondo does this, you can restrict it to friends (a second account for your wife) and its free; the downside is Endomondo is really lacking for cycling compared to Strava. 
https://www.endomondo.com

If you're okay with not using the realtime Strava segments stuff, and viewing you're strava uploads after the fact, you can use Tapiriik to sync Endomondo uploads to Strava.
https://tapiriik.comStrava itsself won't do what you want. I can't talk about free apps but I have a garmin edge 1000 that has a "live track" feature that does exactly what you're looking for. I think the edge 810 also has the same feature...Thanks you two!lols, almost spring, I don't think your anywhere close to New England. Well, you could let her track you via "find my iPhone".Unfortunately, that extends itself into animosity towards any other form of commuting or dissenting opinions.What is evoo?Used to be, Now south park hill Denver. Similar shit, more dentists and less Campagnolo.I can't believe this actually exists.I want to go to there...NO. Fucking 10000 times NO. If you do lawful things and don't care about the consequences, this happens. We have a damn video and people are still saying people should ride like this. If you do, you die. PERIOD. REAL WORLD &gt; LAWS.It's sad and annoying how some people are like this, they need to realize that bikes are allowed on the road just like them, depending on the laws in the area of coarse, I would be furious with this guy if it were me &gt; when he ran over the manager of the LBS

Say what? How does... but what... and how... what?Yeah for real, I always try to ride as ckose to the edge of the road as im comfortable with too when theres no bike lane, which there are literally zero where i live. And I've  still had so many close calls, mainly people pulling out in front of me thoughThat's why you ride fixed/SS in the winter :)Tandem has 4, so... we're almost there.So nice to see lycra and high-vis free bicycle commuters, the UK could learn a lot from thisYes and this video proves these people exist. That means we should not do unsafe things like the rider did. If we do, we may die. The equation is very simple.Yep, flats. Thanks. :)Guess who is not giving a shit. ME.I'm up for the challenge!I think I'll have to write my mom a card with that written on it. I can just imagine her confusion and pride at being referred to as a homieApparently the separated lane on that bridge is for pedestrians, and the road is a designated and well-traveled bike route.-Adolf HitlerDo not try to use your logic here. People think laws will protect them magically in physical world. I upvote you.I have to say the drivers in Pennsylvania are pretty good. I'm not saying they have much experience with bikers, but they tend to towards polite and respectful.
I've bombed down Franklin street in SF, ridden through Boston, explored the excellent bikeways in DC. PA drivers tend toward the nice. MA here, it's not looking good for spring anytime soon.Sure, but I'll take that one.I used to live in that area and had to cross that bridge if I wanted to go for a run or bike in the park that's near there. People treat that stretch of road like a highway!SkylineMy typical commute hits 30-31 and I live in Houston with few hills. Find a good hill and you could double your top speed. 

Don't worry, you'll increase your top speed soon! That's a great start as it is! As you mentioned assuming the condition, yes that is a fair price. Be certain they are not very worn though!steep + race I will try to go out this weekend. Thanks.I had a chunk of medical bills sent to collections. They were doctors fees so they got treated differently than other medical debt. My credit is garbage. I finally got approved for a credit card with a $500 limit. I'm 30. Got smashed by a car when I was 22. Hopefully by the time I'm 40 I will be able to buy a house.I do live in minneapolis area. Maybe I will bike to work this Friday.I'm not concerned with cyclists having a good name or not. I do care that people learn what's actually safest when riding.

There's no duty for cyclists to not "impede traffic" and it's clear that traffic was flowing fine in the video so that wasn't the problem.

And he was working with traffic. He was riding lawfully and predictably. 

The only person who did anything bad was the driver who apparently didn't have the patience to make sure the lane was clear.

The cyclist did nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing. Just because you wouldn't want to do it doesn't make it a bad idea.I'm an avid bicyclist, and I do feel for the guy...and the driver was wrong -

But isn't that a bike lane people are jogging in next to him?Ha!  I did it!  Registered today!Another notch in the 'ole seat post.Man get out on the trails, you really warm up quick.  I Just went on a ride from NE across the Stone Arch bridge and back.  It was epic so windy but had  a beer and a ride.  No regrets. my guess would be Speed Play pedals.This looks like the Edgerunner by Xtracycle. The rear wheel is 20" lowering the deck which is better for handling the squirming live load kids are. It was designed by Naked Bicycles Sam Whittingham. [I speak not a word of English](http://youtu.be/6vgoEhsJORU).Folsom is way better now with the buffer. Used to be a god damn war zone, and I rode on Mission since it was way more predictable.I live in SF. I avoid Market St. If you're a more confident cyclist, there are lots of other roads to take where I can keep up with if not go faster than traffic, and let me avoid routes that are cycle traffic heavy like Market.There are a lot of great stops set up for socializing and eating (especially the REI in Kent). Don't stay at any one too long as the longer your wait, the less happy you'll be when you get back on the bike.  Also, stretch whenever you're off the bike.  Also, practice riding in a [paceline](http://www.bicycling.com/training-nutrition/training-fitness/9-paceline-rules)./r/theydidthemath Working on market means riding on market. Most direct route from my apartment would be Geary and there's no way I'm riding Geary. It's in compression if the front wheel is braking and it normally takes torsion too.This is some arrogant BS, and exactly the type of thing that gives cyclists a bad name in the first place.  Don't be stupid just to be right.  This guy is clearly not using sound judgement and riding in a way that impedes the flow of traffic.  A smart cyclist works with traffic, not against them.  
  
You have shown us nothing here but the A B C's of your arrogance and stupidity.  
  
Awesome! I just got a 2011 Synapse and I'm waiting for the first ride just like you. :PJust got a Fly6 v2 and am using that.  No video posted online to share, but my experience so far has been good.  This is South Bethlehem right next to Lehigh University. It's crawling with cops. Watch for cracks, check after every ride. As long as it isn't near any welds it's alright. Closer to the middle of the tube the better. I've been riding a CX bike with a dent half the size about 2 inches away from the toptube/seatube weld and I haven't seen any cracks yet. If you are ever unsure ask your LBS.I've got a couple of similar pictures 
Then I got cocky and got stuck in the middle of a field of clay mud. Wheels literally jammed in place and couldn't free them up for more than a few feet.

Had to carry the bike 4 miles, in mud, on road cleats, till I found a road and a stick to clear it out.

There's now a metal tyre lever in my kit for just that purpose (I'm always ready to fix the LAST problem, the next I'm sure will be something new....)Ah yes, the cat 6 commute race. As much as Folsom sucks to ride on, it's a little nicer than Market due to relative lack of congestion.Congrats ;-) 
A pb is a pb and worth celebrating.

There are people faster than me and slower than me, that doesn't devalue any of my achievements and neither should it yours.

Well done - time to start aiming for 30. Doable on a flat sprint on an allez, easierdownhill of course (tailwinds are always useful too)6 inches? Tell me more about these fantastic drivers that leave so much room. Around here I'm brushed by side mirrors if I don't take the lane.If you want to objectively measure faster/slower, get a computer or run an app (Strava, Cyclemeter, RidewithGPS, etc).  Then you'll know.

GPS isn't accurate enough for acceleration though.  If that's of interest you need sensors (either standard with the computer or bluetooth/ant with the phone).How so? He was riding safely and legally.She needs Dura-Ace pedals, too much power output for anything cheaper. ;)Psst

/r/fatbikeI don't know man, staying away from short girls is kind of a tall order (   )Is that a Short Haul Trucker?Mine's actually 210! But it also has external headset cups which "add" 10mm each end (sort of not really).Alrighty, for 90% of the year fixed gear bikes get a lot of hate in this sub (sometimes deservedly so), but imma grab a soap box real quick and say that this is the weather fixed gear was born to do.

Cheap parts, strong parts, simple parts, less parts, and really really nice control over your rear wheel. I love a good gear change, but in the winter it's all about about fixed gear with SPDs.

Just make sure you stretch your quads/knees right after your commute!I hit 29.4 last weekend! 30 should feel great! Let's do it! Howwwww?? My top speed ever 70km/h and this was going down hill drafting a truck. his looks bigger. 200-210mm
yours looks about 180-190.
your tube size is more narrow giving the appearance of being longer but the any road has a HUGE headtube even for the smaller sizes so the bars sit higher.what the hell is on there? just dirt and ice?I think traffic creates more variance in times then tires.He steps on the clutch and the toilet goes flush..Also don't watch a bike race on the tv. When they go down a hill from motorcycle view you will turn with them and fall.Just don't ride your $100/ea sweet summer skinnies and you'll be happy as a clam on rollers. they have less damage to tires than road but since they are completely smooth why bother with high tpi babies?I peaked at 60kph.  It was a great feeling after a 45minute climb at about 15kph.You went from a wire bead tire with unpublished weight to kevlar bread tire with published weight of 430g. You likely dropped a bunch of weight thereby reducing rotational inertia. this means your wheel will accelerate a bit faster so it may feel a bit faster of the line.  Your top speed will be minimally affected if at all.This is an x-post from JusticePorn.  I posted it earlier giving credit to OP and was downvoted: http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vinuu/bus_stops_motorist_after_bicycle_hit_and_run/i thought that was 4chan? 

trolling has gone meta.Yea exactly.  Problem is since I ride in a city i'm rarely at the same cadence for any extended period of time, and in the winter the wind around here (Chicago) gets pretty serious.  

I guess what I feel is that in the same gear I spin up faster and easier, but for some reason my times are slower.  Wasn't sure if someone had experience with these tires or similar ones and could speak to which one "should" be faster.need to figure out how to do 3 pedals at the same damn time. make a lot of money with that ideaSorry link added. Bus Driver Uppercut!I say we have a collection and buy this guy a bike. That's a negative on all 3.

It'll help you make the case that you're less safe on the sidewalk than the road as well as show her that you're aware of the most common types of collision and how to anticipate/avoid them.

Also, you can find some stats that show you're more likely to be hurt or killed in a car vs on a bike, so as long as she's statistically cool with you riding in cars on the street, she should be cool with you riding your bike there too.Whoa, I finally "wrong threaded"!  My bad.I personally just let it melt off, dust off what I can, occasionally clean the chain and lube it up. 
I usually get a year out of front gears and cassette, chains every 6 months or so, and brake pads every few months. With Marathon tires my tubes never puncture and the tires last forever. So relatively speaking it's almost no cost. 

If you're smart the bike won't be some 10k carbon wonder bike so you can just treat it like a car. Regular maintenance and replace stuff as it wears out. Triathlete?  Definitely spend the money on the helmet.  If I've learned anything from tri-highlights it's that you'll spend way more time falling off your bike than riding it :P.&gt; The difference between a bike and a segway in the case of an impending accident? You can jump off a segway; whereas it is almost impossible to quickly get over the center rail on a bike to get off in an emergency. 

Apparently this person thinks it's normal to just jump off a moving vehicle whenever there's an emergency. Yep, see my other replies.These are data, not stories or accounts; different studies yielding slightly different results does not make them anecdotal evidence.

Buddy, you can start riding again right now! (Ok maybe skip tomorrow since it'll be below zero). 

Coincidentally, Friday is [Winter Bike to Work Day](http://winterbiketoworkday.org/) and MSP is at the top of the leaderboards in the US. If you live in Minneapolis, the MPLS Bike Coalition is doing [a big group ride](https://www.facebook.com/events/782736445134095/) from city hall to Midtown on Friday.

That said, I know how you feel, it's been too long since I've been out on the nice road bike.I don't know. That sub has a pretty even split of misogynists, latent homosexuals, and guys just wanting to up their game.&gt; I feel like these new tires roll better and seem slightly faster (might just be in my head), but my times on some of my normal rides are up.

The sensation of speed is tricky. You'd have to base it on cadence while in some known gear or the sound of the air past your ears with no wind.

What you might be experiencing is a different vibration from the tire tread.So this new info just makes that driver an even worse person

Hit a bike in a bike heavy location, and tried to run away in front of a police station.  Darwin award nomination, anyone?I hit 40mph on my roadie going down a nice little hill. Pedaling of course We also have water to drink and farm with ;pIf you want a starting point, check out a Trek Domane 2.3 or if you are a woman, the similar Lexa SLX. These are endurance road bikes aimed at people like you, and within your budget more or less (there are cheaper versions of each, too).At first I thought "well he is out in the middle of the lane". But if its posted "May Use Full Lane" then it is what it is. 
I don't leave that bike locked up in public.. I have a $10 bike with a mix of parts that I ride to the pubThanks for the response. I've been fitted before, but still experience some numbness when riding on a Fizik saddle, kinda been wondering if the ISM saddles are worth looking into.You can ride the first 100 miles easy with very little training!  Try doing the whole thing in a day in that condition and you might have a bad time.

source: me last yearYou're getting a lot of hate for some reason, but I appreciate seeing what a potential dooring looks like from the cockpit, thanks for posting!

I suspect some people on here may like to victim blame because it helps them feel like they're less likely to get hurt because they follow all the "obvious rules that will keep them alive" when in reality you can do everything right and still get killed by a rando.  I think that's a scary thought for a lot of folks.Sounds like you've pretty much got it sorted. Ensure you have multiple CO2 canisters, or a pump as mentioned by the other posters, and get out there and enjoy!Can confirm that this a an accurate and very reasonable list. In particular, note the recommendations for breaking the laws well - that's a very Dutch attitude, but one that works.I thought was OP was overly polite letting all the cars through the pinch-point first with nobody letting him in.  If that's me, as I approach the construction, I'm taking the lane so I don't get squeezed out like that and then, no need to shoal, as he would've been through the intersection before all that truck nonsense.

Nothing wrong with shoaling through traffic at a stop though, it lets you get started ahead of the cars (and so more safely) and it's also eases up the congestion as you can get through and let cars fill in all the "waiting in line" spots.This is [Mxico City](https://www.google.com.mx/maps/@19.410596,-99.172602,3a,75y,15.28h,54.73t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1symvKZ3P8M7rVHpNBdkhmeA!2e0?hl=en).

Nearly shit my bibIf your going to make such a ludicrous argument at least back it up with some good examples.  share the road and thank the cyclists trying to think of your children's future. Is it easy to make a loop in google maps? I feel like I'd have to enter point A to point B, then B-C, then C-D, then D-A, stopping at each point to pull out my phone. 

I found http://bikeroutetoaster.com/ to be even better than MapMyRide. I then export the TCX file and import it in to RideWithGPS. Hahaha my thoughts exactly.My comment was more about the visual design.

I also do wish for laces, as the velcro is wearing out and isn't as easily replaceable as laces.  Of course, laces bring their own issuesfor sure.

You're a pro now.I find it's split 50/50 in /r/winnipeg , not hit and runs, don't know anyone who would advocate that there, but 50/50 int he sense that 50 % of people find them annoying and wish they would only use sidewalks

However the me and at least one other mod are big into cycling and we make that the conversations don't get out of hand, and we promote cycling activities if and when they arise to help raise awarenessIn which parallel universe is this??Ok then...Go biking bro! Don't let the winter keep you in from biking. It's been in the single digits here a few times in Chicago and I still went out biking, with plenty of others too. Just wear a lot of layers and you'll be good That's why single speed road is inferior except for commuting hahaThank you so much! \o/I've never thought my Sidi Genius 5s were uncomfortable to walk in.  Awkward yes.  Thank you SPD-SL.  But my feet don't hurt. There are some valid reasons to use higher speed streets though.  For example I recently figured out I could cut my time on a 600ft/180m section of my ride home at night from 5 minutes to 40 seconds using 35MPH streets rather than sticking to 25MPH streets.
You can put Wisconsin on that list! Madison is a bikers paradise in a lot of cases. Many small towns I've been to have bike lanes as well!Strange. Tried to link to this comment from this thread:

Apparently I can't reddit.

Edit: Don't mix the link with your punctuation. No fucking way! I bike this bridge often!Yeah but why don't the kids confronting the drivers just keep putting up make shift barriers? Seems like they would stop more drivers that way. The whole thing see,s more like people that want confrontation, rather than actual change. I'm 6'6 and comfortably ride a 61cm....Honestly, I'd almost be happy to be charged with "cycling furiously" for breaking the speed limit on my bike. It would be like a medal.Well, my comment was mostly a dig at just how ugly that e-bike is. Keeping in mind that it's an e-bike that was most likely designed to be eye-catching rather than being a real bike I would imagine it wasn't exactly designed for churning out the watts, and that most of the force would be generated by that big ass motor, which looks pretty sturdy.  It should be noted that I'm no frame design expert and I'm just speculating/talking out of my ass. Your comment links to this post
What were you trying to link?Google Maps for routing directions, Strava for recording? I pretty much just remember the route, and glance at the maps app occasionally when I'm in a new area.The back and forth on who is right or wrong and the cyclist should or shouldn't be there isn't important here.  What is important is that a driver hit someone and then took off.  No matter which side is right or wrong, an accident happened and one of persons involved fled the scene of an accident.Oh thanks :)I have this 1 mile 12% grade that I occasionally ride. After slowly making my way up, it's fun to blast down. I got to 49.5 mph last time without any pedaling. That was exhilarating. I hate to say it, but I hope cycling never gets that popular where I live.  I bike to *avoid* traffic like that.Yeah, but do you have the fat redpill virgin parts nailed down? We're looking for the complete package here!

More BATTLE ROLLERS!
Will do, thanksExactly, but I think that's the point.  Buy whatever bike you want, ride it however you want, and don't judge other folks for doing the same thing.  As long as you're riding, the bike is doing what it's supposed to do.I would never ever in my entire life ride on a road like that, I'd rather walk than put myself in such danger...The dictionary definition of anecdote is "an account regarded as unreliable", so yes, the conflicting sources make a statement of Mexico being higher than the U.S. a dictionary example of anecdote.&gt; What's the significance of yellow in Germany?

In Germany you get a yellow license plate when you fail the driving test three times!

No, honestly, the Dutch have yellow license plates. That was a banter between neighbours. I'm pretty sure that in the Netherlands and Germany such a road would not be free for cyclists. Of course we have bike lanes and alternative routes everywhere. But's the USA when it comes to cyclists: When they have the choice between building actual infrastructure and putting up road signs that pit cyclists with motorists, they will choose road signI commute every day from East Hollywood to Culver City and back.  The infrastructure is terrible and the cars hostile, but at least we have great weather for it year-round.  Because it's not easy here there's also a lot of hella cool people out riding in LA.Just watched better call saul.

&gt; Its 15 Fahrenheit outside, just drive your car to work!
&gt;  its raining, let me drive you home

The cold goes away by my first stop sign

And ponchos are great for rain :DIt's true. I live in a small (university) town in the middle of the US, and one street has a bike lane. It's not even a good street... there's just a random bike lane stuck to it for some reason. 

Also this kinda confuses me... we're a small university town with a beautiful downtown that has tons of local businesses and gets a lot of walking traffic. As far as I know we're the perfect town for bicyclists (outside of having no bike lanes)... but I see maybe one every other month. I don't get it. 

Then again, I don't know much about bicycles. I don't even know why I'm subbed to this subreddit. I think I just like talking to you guys. You're right. I'm not a big coffee guy...
That is the one! They were awesome through the whole process. Sell yourself on your ability to sell and gain trust from a person.  I've been a salesperson for 20 years.  Any good salesperson will tell you that a good salesman can sell anything, it doesn't matter what it is.  Sell them on your ability to learn, as well.  If you really want the job, have the interviewer tell you about any bike on the floor.  Then demonstrate how you would sell it based on what he told you.  He will be impressedI've found the 631 steel in the Aurora Elite (and also a Jamis Quest I have) to be very stiff, and not in a good way. It's plenty comfortable, though, when combined with bigger tires.Yeah ew, that awkward limping ride home is the worstOkay, that driver was an asshole of course and hopefully got what he deserved, but please don't tell me that this road is open for cyclists and that the the cyclist was allowed to be there! That would be like pitting cyclists against cars (with foreseeable outcome).

Edit: [Turns out this bridge is indeed meant as arena where cyclists are thrown to wolv ... I'm mean motorists.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2vjmru/attempted_hit_and_run_on_a_biker_stopped_by_bus/coik7z5) 

Edit: Some motorists in this clip act extra stupid though. They must have seen the cyclists from far away, yet manage to close up on him instead of, I don't know, switch the lane 100 meters in advance.Are the people hitting the thumb up trolls too? That's what is concerning me the most. I would think that an anonymous like/dislike system would be biased toward what people truly believe is the moral choice.Trailhead in Champlin, MN?? Great shop, enjoy the bike!If you are concerned, skip the co2 and bring a mini pump and one of those tiny Park patch kits (as well as a spare tube or two).

Also, don't over think it.  You're not riding across outer Mongolia.  I've got to imagine that in Texas, there might be a few pickups passing by.  Ease off on the day-glo neon Hi-Vis and hitch a ride if it all goes tits up.I have a good friend who lives in St. Paul and mostly bikes rather than driving.  She was hit by an SUV last year and now has a long-term disability (limited use of one arm) and chronic pain.  She regularly has close calls in St. Paul, it scares me to hear her stories.I wish I'd see that shit in MilwaukeeYour renter's insurance doesn't allow you to update the policy to cover such objects? It seems to be a psychological problem some people have. Like when a child gets extremely upset when an established rule is not followed. There must be name for this condition. Many adults seem to have this problem where I live. Those two tallies on my bike are the cars I've just killed this yearInteresting! Does that enable you to use more modern brakes? And how did you deal with the narrow width of the fork dropouts? I love how many fairly safe biking roads there are here in Minneapolis. You have places like Park Ave with a full, painted off lane marked specifically for bikes.

What's awful is when you have to bike out of the city. I've had a guy try to fight me while waiting in the righthand lane for riding in the street on lyndale in bloomington to cross 494.

The point of my mentioning this was that, even if you're riding safely (stopping for the lights and signs, signalling, etc) people just do _not_ want to hear it. "Get off the road!" You're going too slow for them, pretty much the bottom line.

St Paul is even worse for this kind of stuff, from my experience riding there. MPLS is doing a fairly good job. I just hope the trend keeps spreading around the metro area.Lets do the following weekend when i'm not so stressed out about my interview. lol. i'll text you.

&gt;No helmets are worn when cycling except possibly by babies and toddlers  
  
Ah, what it would be like to be treated like an adultIts the downtube I've heard this from a couple guys that use these and this same bit of advice was repeated by both of them...

Don't look down. Look straight ahead, just like you're on the road. Looking down is the wrong way to ride those.haha, or at least not a headwind... a nice lead-out helps too.From personal experience, get out and ride 15 to 20 miles a few times a week, so that your legs and bottom end are adjusted to being in the saddle. I hopped into a hilly half century after not riding for years and while completely possible if you're in decent shape, it isn't fun the next day. That aside, rink a lot of water and drink it before you get thirsty. Take breaks, and eat.&gt;Your quads will get too big for your pants.

ftfyOk after looking at the various sources, it appears that there is disagreement between them as to the actual obesity rates in the US and Mexico. The cia data says that the US had a higher obesity rate that Mexico in 2008, but the data from the [UN report](http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3300e/i3300e.pdf) says the opposite. So I can't actually say which is true, but saying Mexico is fatter than the US is still more than just an "anecdote".

Also there are a number of countries with a higher obesity rate both the US and Mexico, for whatever that's worth.For sure. Regardless of whether he's allowed to ride where he did, it's just ridiculous to slow down motoring traffic, AND put your life at risk in order to be a smug cyclist. Upon looking up this bridge on Google Street View, it appears that they've put in bike lanes and a share the road sign, so this guy at least has a lane of his own now.. If your bike is fit properly and you have good posture in the saddle there is zero risk of developing ED.

It's and old wives' tale.Waiting excitedly for these puppies: http://www.orfos.bike/

Stupid expensive, but so is being eaten by a car.I don't think /u/neonmelt actually meant engage the brakes, more like keep your fingers on the brake levers in case of stupid in front of you.Was that a pedestrian only sidewalk? What this guy said cyclist here.....but why the hell is he riding his bike on the road like that when there is clearly a separated lane for him to use. Oh man, you don't even know. When I did my double century last year I managed to get in the zone on the way home, and was able to maintain 25 mph for a good hour and a half on a long stretch of flat road. Best experience of my life. You completely zone in and become an extension of the bicycle. Hearing the noise of the road whizzing underneath you gives you a certain undescribable feeling. Once you get that momentum, you don't want to lose it, and you feel like you could go on forever.Drink before you get thirsty, eat something every 45 minutes or so, and just ride. Steadily increase the amount you ride, and tackle every hill you see.If you water it, it will grow...thats code for a beastly tailwind isnt itBeing too informed can be bad, especially when buying a bike. Everyone looks for different things on a test ride, bikes also ride differently for different riders. 

I can tell you that Pinarello, Cervelo, and Specialized bikes all ride really stiff and because of that they are uncomfortable to me. But someone else who has ridden those same bikes may love that super stiff feeling. 

What one person really likes about one bike, you may completely hate about the same bike. Thank you. Seems silly but this post just restored my faith in humanity a little bit. Needed that.

Awesome bus driver. Glad the cyclist was alright.Buss driver is honorary biker. thanks!Yea, it really is a "when" for us. People think I'm joking when I say I've been hit by a car. It happened within a few months of when I started cycling. It was something I could walk away from and I started cycling more "aggressively" when it came to ensuring my safety. &gt;Keep your fingers on the brakes

Actually, you really shouldn't your brakes other than some light feathering. Nobody is expecting you to have significant fluctuations in speed while descending.I'm doing STP for the first time this year too- but doing it 2 day. Good luck! 

Cascade has what looks to be a decent training program on their website for both 1 &amp; 2 day riders, and some good tips on nutrition and what not: http://www.cascade.org/STPTrainingTips[I think mine might be bigger](http://i.imgur.com/9vcyuLZ.jpg)500 dollars for killing someone, holy fuck.Wait, was this on the flats (in which, nice bro) or on a descent.Seriously, I feel incredibly short whenever I look at people's bikes on this sub.45 second response time?  I want to live there!If I ever get a speeding ticket on my bike, I'm framing that bitch and putting it on a wall.Mine was 49MPH and I was drunk so I wasn't scared at the time.  I also didn't realize I had gotten that fast until after the ride when I looked at the GPS.And then you realize that the pros AVERAGE higher speeds over hundreds of kms. They are truly beyond humanThat's disturbing. Do it drunk. Third degree. Year in jail but highly unlikely. Just lots of fines. This should be treated as intentionally hitting someone with a car regardless if it was so. If she cant see someone like that she is lying. 
And if she really did not see the cyclist she was too blind to drive and still did it. So she willingly accepted that she might kill someone. 1 year in prison is too short for that. And she didnt even get that. 
That's the one behind it with the cage mounts, you can see the seatstays behind and the top of the seat tube/seat cluster.i have a saddle like this - http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/cl/en/selle-italia-sls-kit-carbonio-flow-saddle/rp-prod120579

it's just as comfortable as a "normal" saddle.  i have no idea if it helps, because i have not had any numbness with any saddle.  but since i needed a saddle it seemed better to be "safe than sorry".

obviously different saddles fit different people.  but for me, that has been a great saddle - very comfortable.  if you (OP) are worried, why not get one in that style?&gt;Not even a yellow license plate would come close to explain that.

In the US, license plates are a whole bunch of different colors--[including yellow](http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/New_York2/ny2010fbr.jpg)--depending on what state issues it.  What's the significance of yellow in Germany?Use Alientube extension, replaces with reddit comments.That's a giant headtube!Some good advice here already regarding eating/drinking and pacing yourself.  Since you're beginners, I would also add that you should be comfortable making some repairs on your bikes.  Make sure you know how to change a flat, fix a broken chain and have some basic tools on hand.When's the next time Nebraska plays Michigan?If you feel like you need a longer stem, you should try backing your saddle up. It looks like its slammed forwards right now, which probably isn't where you want it.Know different wheel sizes, what kinds of bikes for what kinds of jobs, apparel, and how to pronounce bike names correctly would be my best guess for general sales staff. Any other specific questions on fixing bikes would be for the mechanics I would imagine. If there is sales staff it sounds like a larger shop. 
 Didn't even need a flair to tell me you were Dutch.I believe that's a felony, no?you might be interested in [this article](http://alittlemoresauce.com/2014/08/20/what-my-bike-has-taught-me-about-white-privilege/).I get a justice boner every time I see this. I think I've found a new fetish.I wouldn't trust a dent that large in the seatpost tube. 

Especially if its aluminum. Steel is a little more forgiving, but even a dent that size in steel I wouldn't trust. Hell, I'd add to that people should have to take mandatory bus trips, subway/train trips, and trips by bicycle before being given a driver's license. I believe complete lack of empathy is the main culprit for most bad drivers, besides maybe just being a bad driver in the first place, but I think this lack of empathy is mostly due to ignorance, not being a bad person.
The whole "walk a mile in their shoes" bit could do the world some favors.
You're frustrated that there's a cyclist in *your* lane, then you remember you could be in a cramped, smelly bus, taking three times as long to get anywhere, or could be out in the freezing rain on a bike, trying to survive your commute. All of a sudden that lone cyclist struggling up the hill looks a lot more like a human being to the motorist.It looks like the seatpost tube. &gt;Every single cyclist that I know has been hit. Every. Single. One.

Checking in!  

Luckily I've only been hit once, in November, and it was about as minor an incident as you can have. Left cross--I ended up on the hood of the car, but my (then) brand new bike had decent brakes, so nobody was hurt and (more importantly) the bike was fine.

If I'd been riding my old POS schwinn with its terrible V-brakes, I'd probably still be unable to ride.  Without a helmet I'd probably be dead.6'4". I even contemplated putting a longer stem but with this being my first "non Wal-Mart" bike I decided to take it slow. just sales staff...
In the case /u/transientapathy3 is describing the problem is people not using the existing cyclist-specific infrastructure, namely the parallel bike route. Calling it a 'detour' is a bit extreme, it's just an alternate route the next block over and from /u/transientapathy3's description it's unlikely that those riders are riding to or from someplace directly on that road anyways. 

However there could well be a problem with a lack of signage indicating the presence of a parallel bike route, which could lead to people to just riding the same route they would drive.  And you're within your rights to do so, unless it's explicitly illegal, and even then breaking the law is better than getting killed. In Denver it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk, except there are spots, often a bridge or underpass, that are signed as OK for bike use.

But projecting your own experience on that of this guy, who may have been safer on the street any other day is pointless. Maybe he's just sick of dodging pedestrians, or maybe he needs to turn left up ahead, is pointless.If your shoes are cleated, can you figure out a way to comfortably walk for a few miles?  EDIT: Stick a patch kit in your kit also, it's not unusual to have 3 or more flats on a bad day. Spoke wrench and multi-purpose tool. A bit of duct tape rolled up. Chain link tool if not part of the multi-purpose tool. Motorized traffic isn't allowed either. Must be 250ccs or greater, and cannot be a Mo-Ped. I like that the driver in the second car got right behind him and blocked him in.You link to an article from 2013 to show how the articles I linked from 2014 are out of date...What are you interviewing to do?Are you ever scared of someone steeling your saddle? I've been looking at leather saddles for a long time, but I'm scared of a ~150$ saddle being stolen....I like how he cites Segways as a safer option, but the founder of Segway died because he drove his off a cliff...&gt; Getting hit by a car is a matter of "when" for us, not "if."

This is a horrifically depressing fact that runs through my mind every time I strap on my helmet. Every single cyclist that I know has been hit. Every. Single. One. Most of them were hit-and-runs. Some, like me, were lucky and walked away with bruises. Some, like my friend, woke up in the hospital with a million dollars in medical bills.

Barely a day goes by without a near miss, a honk, a shouted curseword, or something thrown at me. It's to the point where sometimes I don't ride because I am literally risking my life every single time.

Fuck this city.I understand.. I just feel like its quite exaggerated, dont get me wrong, Im a cyclist commuter, I've riding my bike to work/gym for almost 12 years now, and I live in a big city (1m pop. aprox) and there are no bike lanesholy cow how tall are you?Wrong thread...I'm with you on that, which is why my Seek has a rack on it. Axiom also makes the Streamliner and Streamliner DLX, which attach to the fender braze on. The DLX fits on a Macho Disc and had no issues with my calipers (TRP Spyre).

I prefer to ditch the rack if possible because if you can carry your stuff with just fabric bags, it's considerably lighter than a rack and panniers.Use [**www.searchtempest.com**](http://www.searchtempest.com/), put in your zip, and search for Bianchi San Jose. It will find any in you're town or any town around you, you can even search all Craigslists if you so choose. Hopefully one is at least close enough you can pick it up or someone is willing to ship.YES.  

If I try to ride on the edge of the lane people won't think twice about passing me with literally 6 inches to spare.  If I feel threatened and unsafe I can take the ENTIRE lane forcing drivers to pass me by switching lanes.  

It's the law and my right as a cyclist.  This applies in the US and in my country Canada.
Thanks, that was a bit surprising. Sometimes a Singlespeed just makes sense .... Burden of proof lies with the arresting officer. 'Cycling furiously' would be almost impossible to successfully prosecute.ahhh statistics! that'll honestly be very helpful rather than "trust me mom I have a 16 year old friend who does it all the time"My friend hit a pothole doing exactly that. He just about managed to stay on the bike, but his rear wheel was messed up, a huge section of carbon brake track flaked off.

Your info from link 2 is from 2012. You are literally an idiot. Your third link is total, not percentage. They passed us percentage wise in 2013

[Here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mexico+passes+us+in+obesity+rates) is the information you are looking for. &gt;fuck any of you bikers who break the law and give the rest of us a bad name

I am both a cyclist and a driver (as are nearly all of us), and I can tell you I am an equal-opportunity law-breaker.

This is not to say that I am trying hard to be an asshole, but it happens both ways.  I am much more concerned about the cyclist who is much less experienced and unfamiliar with riding a bike safely and predictably.  Sometimes "illegal" cycling is the safest option available, and inexperienced cycling is often the most dangerous.I plug mine into a potato or a lemon.If you ride in New England, you haven't lived till you bomb down roads at 35+ while dodging 6 in deep potholes. That's why I never read reddit comments. I didn't even read yours, any correlation is purely coincidental.It's probably already on the books like you're saying. It just needs to be enforced. Writing a new law might help enforcement. It's frustrating.exactly, pedestrian lane. " Traffic laws in all states consider bicyclists as a vehicle and as such, must obey the traffic laws that motorized vehicles must observe"the vast majority of almost-incidents I've had in the last year were due to people on their phones.  They kind of slowly drift into the shoulder while looking at their phone.  At like, 2MPH, but there I am about to slam into their vehicle.Is it the downtube? That's in tension, so it should be fine (If you want to see how little downtube is needed, check out [slingshot bikes](http://www.slingshotbikes.com/)!

Also check over the rest of the frame very carefully, an impact like that could well have cracked the head tube.Wat

NOt sure how this applies to my comment.  I can assure you the law is not my moral compass.  Driving is pretty damn risky too.  As casual as everyone is about it, it's probably the most dangerous thing most people do.

If safety was a priority we'd start with discouraging driving and yanking licenses.It's bicyclist like this that gives us all a bad rap though. It's an xtracycle.  http://www.xtracycle.com/

I've been riding a Surly Big Dummy with xtracycle stuff on the back for years.  It's an excellent way to get around with my two little kids. Just pour it down a drain, it should be pretty runny.Man, I was in your exact same position as you a few months ago. After weeks of digging around it came down to two: 
Ultegra wheelset and Campagnolo zonda.

I ended with with the Zondas for a few reason. Same wheels as Fulcrum racing 3 that run 100ish more (Fulcrum makes some great wheels), slightly lighter than Ultegra (like 100g), tubeless ready (no rim tape needed), and they had a lot of very positive reviews. 

I don't think you could go wrong with either though. Got it from Trailhead Cycle on close-out because it is last year's model. I looked at road bikes and hybrids before settling on a CX bike.  If people would take a deep breath and relax a bit while driving, perhaps not always be in a hurry and generally mad at the world... a lot of things would work better for everyone.  

Drivers also seem to have forgotten the basic concepts of road safety, first being "pay attention and don't crash into things" which is closely related to "drive at a reasonable speed so that you have time to make decisions and not crash into things"

sigh.  

&gt; Because traffic is safer and more efficient when everyone on a given street is going a similar speed.

Well yes, which is why I pointed out that the problem are not cyclists, but the lack of cyclist-specific infrastructure. Cyclists should not have to take a detour to accommodate drivers - in fact, the opposite is true of good planning.

You will see that this is how streets are designed in places where cycling is common: bike paths are not only standard, cycling routes are also often more direct than routes for cars (and pedestrians, in turn, often have ways shorter even than cyclists). All the best with it!, I found letting go for a drink hard but just keep pedaling and it becomes stable.

I usually do 10 minute warm up then 25-30 in a high gear jumping up one gear every 5 minutes until the last 5 are in my hardest gear. I then do a 5 minute cool down.

During the season if it is raining and I can't be bothered going out I will do intervals, 1 minute highest gear at 110+ cadence then dropping down 10 gears. Another minute recovery then back up to the highest. Next time I drop down for recovery I only drop 9 gears so it progressively gets harder.


I would like to add I am just an average guy who doesn't race but pretty strong when out on the group training rides or chain gangs.The truck was in the "care, custody, and control" of the dealership and they have a duty of care to protect the property of others. They didn't fulfill that duty and you have been "injured" financially. Your right is to be placed back into the same financial shape you were in prior to the theft. Whether the dealership or their insurance company does that it is your right to be made whole again. When you buy new bikes look into a bicycle policy from Velosurance and all the mystery of who covers what goes away.&gt; you just put a tube in. 

Yes, but you have to deal with the sealant getting everywhere.I am not sure of the need for a training tire on rollers, the tires don't suffer the same friction as a turbo based resistance trainer.But you can get charged with "cycling furiously".Sorry old sport, across the pond we have this thing called 'bad weather' and it turns this whole cycling malarky into a bit of a pickle sometimes.I'm also doing my first STP this year, one day too! What kind of mileage are you used to? If you use the law as a gauge for your moral beliefs you're going to be pretty disappointed in yourself. I feel the same about my tires which measure to an actual width of 35, though they're listed as 700x33.333(repeating) :P That's right, the venerable [Jack Brown](http://www.rivbike.com/product-p/t100-g.htm) tire by Rivendell. Though I'd guess it's more to do with actual *volume* as opposed to width. A nice, round 32 might have better ride characteristics than something marginally wider, but with a profile leaving less actual air in the tire.
Also, I doubt my ass is really that in tune with the bike that a few MM really makes more difference than any other placebo. Either way I love how they ride on [my bike](http://i.imgur.com/StnS3N3.jpg)Those numbers are out of date, Mexico passed the US only within the last few years.

Riding a bike on a road where cars generally drive 75+ mph and do not stop or even slow down when entering/exiting is just reckless.that guy can do some serious hauling!  Anybody know the name of that rig?Home insurance does a horrible job when it comes to bicycle insurance. Velosurance.com offers a bike policy starting @ $7.83/mo Check out their 10 questions to ask your insurance agent about bike insurance and see how many answers your agent gets right. Cheers.that looks like it could scratch your paint and get the bike started on losing all it's paint, though.Plus, as a cyclist, you really should avoid roads with significant minimum speed limits. I don't know of any such roads here in CT (except highways, which cyclists are obviously not allowed on), but I too think cyclists should be as liable for minimum speeding tickets as cars.

But that's pretty much the only part of his rant that I agree with.Filtering is legal, passing on the right isnt. Its similar to a motorbike passing inbetween lanes on a highway theres a legal gray area at the very least in most places that allows bikes to move to the front of traffic at a stopped intersection. Both incidents could have been avoided by using the bike lane in a more controlled fashion. You know you're hemmed in by cars on both sides, and know that many people exiting parked cars do not check for cyclists, so why make the assumption that it'll be safe to go at high speed in the bike lane? And before anyone jumps on me, I ride 6,000 miles a year, I too caught a door prize many years ago by riding too close to parked cars, and I now ride defensively assuming 5% of car drivers will do something stupid enough to potentially ruin my day. The approach seems to be working....Building that would require valuing human life, in much of the U.S. People are just "human resources" to be exploited for profit in any way possible.It depends on the subreddit, hit and runs are almost encouraged in places like /r/Toronto.Wassup, LA-buddy!  It's getting better and better the more of us that're out there (I feel like I've seen the number of other riders double or triple in the last year and it feels like I'm getting more love from cars with the 3-foot law, and them getting used to seeing bikes on the road).  Keep riding and we'll have this town turned around in no time!Eh I mean where I live it feels like traffic laws are not existant to the police. I've never actually seen anybody pulled over for speeding or anything since I can only assume the cops hang around the seedier areas of town. Because traffic is safer and more efficient when everyone on a given street is going a similar speed. When such options are available (which is not always the case, but that's another discussion), people should take the slower street if they're going to be going slow, regardless of what vehicle they're using. If you're in an old jeep with a max speed of 45 mph, you should take the side road rather than the 75 mph interstate. Likewise if you're going to ride at 10 mph then you should take the side street with a bike lane rather than riding in the midst of 25 mph traffic. I thought it was the other way around? the "(le) reddit army" goes to youtoube to spam/troll.Ugh, the details of that case are pretty distressing.

&gt;Ytsma had been hit by a 79-year-old driver who said she never saw him. He had been riding on a bike route designated by shared-use arrows, using one front-facing and multiple rear-facing lights, and wearing a reflective safety vest and a helmet and glasses covered in reflective tapea police official would later say he was illuminated like a Christmas tree. According to an accident reconstruction, the car traveled 200 feet with Ytsma on the hood before coming to a stop.

&gt;The driver, Lucille DeMartin, 79, of Center Valley, told investigators that she never saw Ytsma. She was convicted of careless driving resulting in accidental death, a summary offense punishable by a $500 fine. Police also recommended that state transportation officials require DeMartin to re-take her road test, but are not able to mandate the test themselves. Schiffer noted that it would have been hard to prove that DeMartin was guilty of the more serious charge of reckless driving, which carries a likely sentence of one year in prison.I'm sorry, I live in [California](http://d35brb9zkkbdsd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140304_CA_trd-638x501.jpg) and some of these words are really confusing.  

What's a "puddle?"  "Muddy?"  ;)Don't be scared, its exhilarating!! Just keep your fingers on the brakes, pay full attention, and stay in the right lane and don't not do any of these three things. Also try it at a time when there's minimal traffic./r/bicycling seems like the only sympathetic voice to cyclists. its not justified, i know.. but.. right on the middle of the road, was that necessary?Since she is strong enough to snap pedals, we will need to see pictures of her thighs...I live in England. Speed limits do not apply to bicycles :)The bike's already much heavier than standard.
