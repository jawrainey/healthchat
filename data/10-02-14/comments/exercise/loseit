Nice! I've been hitting Subway about 3 times a week. I'm hooked on the turkey on wheat, double meat, no cheese loaded with veggies and brown mustard. Low cals and tons of protein. Don't look at the sodium though if you are watching that. I think you may need to focus on building your endurance instead of just toning if you're planning on climbing Ben Nevis!


It looks like it's a 10km walk with a 1.5km rise, and that most people take over 7 hours round trip. How does this line up with what you currently do? Can you walk 5km comfortably?  What about 10 or 20? Can you carry a backpack doing this? You'll probably need good, water, and some clothing (for when the weather changes).It's crazy. I'm actually pretty well-versed in nutrition. I have a pretty good idea of what macro-nutrients are in what foods, and what to avoid, how much you should be consuming.

But counting calories takes that to a whole different level. I'm been trying to stay under 1950, and I've been doing a pretty decent job, and I'm been dropping weight.

It's a lot easier to manage cravings when you KNOW that it will put you over your calorie limit. Makes it a pretty black and white issue that you can't really justify.Could not agree more! I have also done this a few times, and just as you say, when the logging stops, the effort (eventually) stops.

For me it's also important to step on the scale every day. I know I would get into a mode where having not been on the scale for a while, I would just not want to see the number, and so would avoid it. Soon a month, 6 months, year go by, and now you have to start over.welcomeYep! Same here. Its such a nice feeling. 

This week i've been feeling so fat (week before period so im bloated) and yesterday i had to put on an old belt (that used to be super tight on me so i never wore it) and i had to put it on the 3rd hole! Felt great.

And about bras. I bought a really nice $70 bra a couple of months ago and its becoming too big. I feel so stupid now for spending that much money on a bra knowing that it would be too big in a couple of months. 

But whatever, its all worth it! Keep going!I did Nutrisystem for a few months several years ago. To be honest, I thought the food was disgusting and I would dread eating my meals. The frozen meals are better than that shelf-stable ones but not by much. I couldn't keep up with it for very long. I found clean eating and calorie counting to be much more pleasant.AWESOME! I've started planning my meals out and it can be so hard to stay to the plan. Being able to see the calories (like on the bag of chips) can really help - I wish everywhere had the calories listed.Multivitamin and fish oil are the 2 that I take. Not really sure if they do anything or not. If your diet is decent you really don't need any. I recently convinced my boyfriend to switch to Jack and Coke Zero after he noticed the scale creeping up. He went from drinking 3-4 Cokes at a time, to a Coke followed by Zeros, to just Zero. Saves him over 500 calories on each drinking night.




Best would probably be if you could stick to sipping good whiskey straight though. I hit up [GDNF](http://www.getdrunknotfat.com) pretty regularly to check on beverages that I'm not familiar with.No, you shouldn't eat more. Your calorie limit is based on 24 hours, I assume.  If you're trying to eat every 3 hours that's fine, but staying up later shouldn't equal more calories. It should still be part of your "fast".  make sense?great job! I started at 386.6 and the first time I had been under 300, I weighed 299.6. It was a great day. Now I can't seem to get under 295 without rebounding back up to 305.I do the same thing. Also, if I'm so hungry that I know I'm going to give in, I go to bed early.GREAT JOB! Good for you!! Keep that good feeling going :)The treadmills in my gym face the weight lifting section so i just watch (not creepily) guys lifting while i run and it helps time go by faster. 

Or listen to music with pretty interesting lyrics and focus on the lyrics.

But yeah i havent been able to run for more than like 10-15 mins without getting bored.Make sure you check your new TDEE too! It won't have changed a ton in 15 pounds but that's going to start affecting your weight loss as you lose more.Tears, man! WTG!!!This just happened to me too. I literally freaked out for a few seconds like 2 days ago when I scratched my chest a felt a big bump right in the middle. Turns out it was just my sternum.  Ahh. I needed this. I just had a salad for lunch even though I really, really didn't want to. I plan on eating at maintenance tomorrow so I pushed through because I need to stay on track today to reward myself with maintenance tomorrow.Oh yeah, I'm starting to find that oils suck.That's huge! Congrats.You can make your meals as elaborate as you want. Cooking is an art form that should be celebrated....all you need to do is use healthier ingredients and watch your portions better.Honestly, I don't think he's started his journey yet. Give him space. 

If you were there with him, you could shop and cook healthier, and encourage taking smaller portions by your example. But you're not. 

Feel free to share your fitness achievements with him, but don't push him. If he's like me, he'll push back, and end up in a worse position than before you pushed. Nice job!  I'm about 6 lbs away from the same post!  I may steal the Twoville, I like it. It gets easier. I'm rooting for you!!OK.  Well, if you consistently eat that, you should lose weight.  If that's what you want to focus on for right now, track the calories in the lunch you talked about and stay within your goals.  If you want to focus more on macros as well, eat foods that hit your macros in MFP.as someone who has been tracking calories the last 3 weeks and has failed every single day at staying under 2000, I like this post. I cant wait for the day where I finally stay under 2000, hmm maybe today?7 months... Thanks!Bud Light is the most popular beer in the American market, and a can of it is 110 calories.  I'm just using that as a measure.  If you drink 15 of those 4 times a week, that's 60*110 = 6600 calories just in beer.  By way of comparison, that's 22.75 slices of Papa John's pizza (large cheese), almost 51 servings of potato chips.

Put another way, I'm a 6'3", 200 lb dude.  If MyFitnessPal is to be believed, I burn about 1000 calories running a 10K, so I would have to run 66K *every single week* to keep up with your consumption.  That's over 1.5 marathons.  

Every.  Single.  Week.  Just in beer.

Congrats on your weight loss, and I know you didn't ask for this advice, but "my friends do it" is a really flimsy excuse for binge drinking.MyFitnessPal (funchords)Start simply by logging and tracking your calories.  Worry about eating healthier after a week or too of just seeing what you normally eat.  When you do make changes to your diet, make small easy changes that you can live with.  Maybe instead of getting a bacon double cheeseburger you go with a cheeseburger and no mayo.  As you continue you'll find yourself wanting to make better choices.  Instead of a fast food burger you'd rather eat 2 chicken breasts some rice and veggies.  When I started I knew that pork ribs would have more calories then chicken breast, of course.  I didn't anticipate that pork ribs w/bbq sauce would have as much as 6x the calories of chicken breast. So chicken breast is starting to win when I make food choices because I don't want to be hungry all the time.  I still make room for sweets and snacks, just less of them.  I live and die by caloric limit.  For me my TDEE is ~1750  I try to eat 1350/day, 1450 on exercise days.  When I splurge I try to keep it under 1750 so I'm at least maintaining.  
  
tl;dr   In the beginning you don't need to make drastic choices, you just need to stay within your calorie limits.  Figure out your TDEE and subtract 20% and use that number as a goal.To tag on to this, remember that your "maintenance" level will change if you lose a large amount you need to recalculate your deficit. ie if your body maintained at 3k when you started it might be at 2k now and you'll need to adjust. And congrats on getting under 300, keep up the awesome work!I find that when I stop logging, it's the first step towards a binge. It's like I want to pretend that food has no calories.Usually my routine is :
1st meal 7am, then 10am, 13pm, 16pm, 19pm, 22pm the last one and I always eat the same thing, and then go to sleep but for example, on friday sometimes my routine start at 7am and I go out and get to sleep only 3~6am, Shouldn't I eating something after so long?Logging now is so easy it's hard to imagine not doing it.  8-10 years ago, counting calories for me meant work, or meant eating the same thing over and over because it was a known quantity.  Having the whole picture in a single place, plus the ease of just scanning something into MFP and boom, no+effort=tons(insight).Well done on hitting the 50s, that's awesome! :D I think you can get to your goal weight no problem, especially now you're seeing the benefits for counting calories. Here's what I think, and I'm not a doctor.  

First of all, we live in a world where 13 year olds are drinking morning espresso, and I can't get my head around that at all.

Second, I wouldn't worry too much about calorie counting, not at your age.  I would make healthy food choices as much as possible.  Eat healthy foods.  Proteins, fruits, and veggies are good building blocks.  Starches are fine too, but foods with protein and fiber will probably keep you feeling satisfied for longer.  Drink plenty of water.

Third, get active.  If you're going to be climbing mountains, you want to be in shape for that, but there are a ton of ways to be active.  Go for a good long walk around where you live.  Explore your town on foot.  Ride the exercise bike if you want to, but you don't have to.  Run.  Swim.  Do active things with your friends.  Play sports.  Make it a point to be active for a while every day, whether it's a game with your friends or a nice walk wherever you decide to go.

As you get older, life is going to be full of micromanagement, but now isn't the time.

I'm going to go not drink espresso.Come on 159 :D We can both to it!!

 I'm 5'2 so my GW is way down there in the 120s. If I can just get to 159 finally after all these years of yo-yoing, I'll know for sure that I can make it to 120 :DThis post has too little content  **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Floseit&amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2vo2ki/weird_question_but_has_anyone_notice_their_feet/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

I'm kinda hoping for the 160 plateau this time so I can push through it finally and make it to the lowest weight in six years while knowing that I had the strength this time not to give up! MFP spit that number out - a 1 to 2 lb loss per week puts me in a 1400-1600 range of calories a day.I truly don't understand why you would think you should eat more because you're staying awake later. If your deficit takes you to 2000, then eat that much.I've started doing a few push ups and pull ups to tone whatever muscle I've got, but I'm not going to bother trying to put on any muscle mass at this point.  From what I've read, it's extremely hard to put on any mass while still eating at a caloric deficit.  You can do it, girl!  

Being able to forgive yourself is important.  It's unrealistic to think that you'll go the rest of your life never slipping or wanting to indulge for a special gathering - you just have to make the commitment to getting back on the wagon the next day.  The worst thing you can do is say "I failed today, I might as well give up."  Because the one day of screwing up/taking a day off is not what's going to destroy your progress, but the giving up definitely will.  

If you're having trouble getting back into it after a few days of not logging, make a real effort to log your food *before* you eat it - it will really help you decide to make smart choices instead of just thinking "Oh God, what have I done" later.  And I find if I have my meals already planned out it squelches my inner Craving Beast.  

Good luck!  &lt;3  If you use MFP you can add the url for the recipe into their recipe section and it will break down the calories in the recipe.For a second I thought I was in /r/programming, since the post works perfectly there too.Awesome!  My go to weight has been 160 for years.  I've always focused on exercise and random restrictions (no dairy, no grain, no sugar) but never on calories until now.  I'm at 150 now and plan on going until I can hit my ideal body weight, I'm guessing 135 but I'm 38 now and haven't weighed that since I was 18...  
F38 SW 168 CW 150 GW 135Where'd you get 1600 as a number?  How did you make your plan?

*For weight loss*, calorie deficit is basically all that matters.  If you take in fewer calories than you use in a day, then you'll lose weight.  However, for nutrition, you probably want to make sure you're getting good balances of nutrients, which is why utilities like MFP count them.

So if your main goal is weight loss and you can deal with this a meal, then do it.Thank you! I'm blushing so bad this morning. Hmmm... that's a good question and honestly I feel stupid saying this but I don't really know.  My only main goals are to lose weight and stick to 1600 calories per day.  I don't even know what else I should be looking at...This just made me smile so big. Great job OP! It was wrong, but so so right (and it was my birthday, so psht!) Good luck!!That's one of my favourite things about MFP, and one of the main reasons I log every day - that streak! I'm only on day 96 myself, but it's still very motivating. Log everything as accurately as you can and use the bar code feature when you can as well. Good luck!!!This will sound crazy but I *love* butternut squash. Every so often I'll roast a whole pound of cubed squash and eat it all. The best thing -- it's 204 calories and 9 grams of fiber! Do keep track of the oil you use, though. I find that a tablespoon of olive oil + salt &amp; pepper is enough. Good advice haha I just feel like a water balloon with too much waterGood luck to you too!  The key is sustainability.  I know two people who have lost a significant amount of weight and have kept it off for 5+ years.  It's about making permanent changes, but ones you can live with psychologically. Do it buddy! im &gt;30lbs away from the 2XX's clubI prefer phoenix wings, buffalo style.Thnaks so much! I will be sure to check these things out. As others have said, don't eat back those exercise calories.  

Drink lots of water and weigh yourself consistently (same time &amp; under the same conditions) so you can have as close to an apples to apples comparison.   Even if you do that your weight will still fluctuate a lot.  I can be 3-4# different from one day to the next even eating the same amount of calories.  

You should also take measurements.  Don't let the number on the scale determine whether or not you feel like you've accomplished something.  You will feel the difference in your close before you see the difference on the scale.

Sounds like you have a good program/routine going, keep up the good work!I've been able to get up at 5:30AM for a pre-work workout for 3 days in a row now! I found that setting an alarm for 5:15, then 5:30 allows me to wake up and lay in bed for 15 minutes until I have to get up. It helps that I prep my food and clothes the night before. I feed my animals, blend my pre-made shake and go!You just reminded me of something I hadn't thought of. 

I completely refuse to talk about my weight issues with my family or friends, although in the past I've trusted partners enough to get them involved.

My friends tend to make rude comments about overweight people. They make them casually and I think they don't realize how wrong that is and how much that affects people. They're not bad people. They are generally kind of compassionate, but they fall into that common place.

My family does not care about my journey. They care about the number on the scale and the size of my clothes. They want me to be thin, not healthy. They don't care about the battle, they only expect results. So I've completely stopped talking to them about it, for years.

This makes me think that the attitude of the person willing to participate in your journey is very important. I feel the OP is truly concerned about her/his SO. That's a good start. But is only naturally for us to be reluctant to share this with others, so it has to be done with a lot of care.I popped in here to mention bringing lunch to school.  From what I remember of the school cafeteria, there's only a few "healthy" options and the temptation is always going to be to go for the food that everyone else is eating if you're getting your food with them.  If you're grabbing lunch with six friends and they all get burgers and fries, it's a lot harder to be like "I'll be over at the salad bar.  By myself.  Getting the wilted cafeteria lettuce.  :("

If you bring your lunch every day, you can be the table-snagger for the group AND avoid the pressure to not be the odd man out.  Plus, you'll be eating what you love, not just choosing from what the school is serving for the day.This isn't a great question because it doesn't specify anything about what "healthy" means?  Do veggies and hummus have a ton of calories?  Probably not.  Is it enough food to satiate you for a long time?  Probably not.  If you add fruit in there, is it going to bump the sugar content?  Probably yes.

However, in answer to the idea that you somehow need meat or a sandwich in your lunch to make it worthwhile, that's not the case at all.

If you could give us some idea of what your overall food plan is and what your goals are, that would really help.  Try to reformulate your question.

There is no way to judge a single meal, ever. Nutrient timing isn't super important so what you have throughout the whole day is what is important. Also, your specific nutritent goals (how much protein/carbs/fat are you aiming for?) is primarily how you would gauge your adherence.I hear unicorn meat and veggies is the best :)So true! Being aware of the calories you're consuming makes all the difference.

I've decided that instead of giving myself rewards for weight loss goals, I'm going to give myself rewards for logging consistently instead. I love fashion, and I especially love ModCloth. I've told myself that I'm not allowed to buy anything from ModCloth until I've logged my calories in MFP consistently. So far, I have one more week to go and I already have my reward picked out.&gt; The problem with weight loss is that it happens so gradually and you're forever looking in mirrors to see if you can notice the change, but it never happens. 

This is exactly where I'm at. Sometimes I wish I could wake up and be my old weight for just ONE day, and then switch back to where I am now so I can actually see and feel the difference.I think this is why it took me so long to get into any kind of food-related lifestyle change.  I couldn't imagine cutting carbs or meat or sweets out of my life completely - to do so would, to me, have been so detrimental to my quality of life as to make it not worth it.  So I just kept telling myself I would eat whatever and just try to burn it off.  

People used to doom and gloom about the calorie counts in the stuff I was eating, but because I didn't know anything about what was "a lot" it was more annoying and guilt-trippy than informative.  My mindset was "Why are you shitting all over my enjoyment?  I've already decided that calorie counting is not something I can do and still be happy.  Quit making me feel guilty!"  

Finding out I *can* eat what I want (just smaller portions and with a little bit of planning) while still losing weight was a total revelation for me.  And it's had the side effect of getting me to eat healthier too - not because I *have to* according to some misery-inducing diet rules, but because I can tell that some things are better at making me full at a given calorie amount, and I can *choose* to sub them in for the less filling stuff.Exactly.  My losses may not be a perfect 1.5lbs a week but the cumulative loss has been.  It's just so crazy for me to have it not be a mystery.  I've hit every predicted goal, not always on the exact day but always within a few days of the prediction.That's awesome!  :)

I set MFP as one of the tabs that automatically opens when I open Chrome, which is how I keep on top of it.  Even if I forget for most of the day, as soon as I sit down to check my email, it's right there, staring me in the face.  I log my calories/exercise, and then move on to what I actually meant to do.You're right, I should have specified while eating. 

I'll do more research on the subject and get back. However, I would just be weary of cold water while eating. I feel like you're on the home stretch this time around.  Your words have a conviction.  Good luck and thanks for sharing what this experience might be like so close to goal.I think there's value in doing it now and also next week. Knowing how "that time" affects my weight, water retention, etc. helps me to not freak out when it happens, and feel good about things returning to normal in a few days :)...I stress-ate 440 calories worth of cookies at work yesterday...Awesome! I'm also 180 (5'9" so somewhat overweight) and trying to slim down 10 pounds or so. Keep at it.Yes, you can't out run your fork as they say!I felt the same way yesterday, but I remember why I am doing this, and what I want, and how that donut or whatever is just not worth how i will feel. Keep your chin up there are rough patches Completely agree. I'd never dieted before and just started on January 14. I've logged *everything* since then and lost over 6 pounds! It's amazing to see how many calories things have. My previous breakfast was 7 servings of cereal and 3 of milk, for nearly 2000 calories, more than my current daily limit in only one meal!I'm 20, but in college. The biggest challenge I see that you would face as someone in high school is not cooking your own meals. I would say that you should tell your parents about your goals and I'm sure they will be supportive. Attempt to count calories as best as possible and try to take your lunch to school. The FAQ is great and just browse this page as well as r/fitness and r/fitmeals to get a better idea of what you should do. My biggest suggestions are to find out your BMR and TDEE (google if you don't know) and eat at a caloric deficit. Good luck mate!Awesome!  I just updated mine today too!Thanks!I second this plus pita everything! You can put so much stuff in a pita pocket and take it to go, I'm obsessedA nursing class. I'm a versatile person.Kawrae :)
&gt; No more working my ass off and hoping it works.  

THIS.  I'd tried exercise programs for a while here and there, tried to make healthier choices, but never knew whether it was working or how long it was going to take.  It's amazing how much easier it is to commit to something when you *know* it's going to work.  I agree with you completely. 

The surgery might help, but if it doesn't go hand in hand with a change of mentality and lifestyle, it will ultimately fail. You can count on anything called a "calorie burning &lt;insert gadget name&gt;" to be complete bullshit. What is your username? It is always helpful to have friends for accountability! :)I reached my first goal weight (166 to 135) back in October.  At this point my weight loss had slowed to a crawl both because of my much lower weight, and getting bored. I decided to take a break and ate at roughly maintenance for 3 months.  Did not log or weigh myself often, and while I stayed aware of my calories, I didn't obsess over them.

My weight stayed stable the whole time, even over-eating chocolate &amp; cookies at christmas like it was my job.

I got back on track in January.  It was a little hard the first few weeks because I had gotten a bit sugar-addicted again, but now I'm smoothly losing at about a pound a week again when last fall I had slowed to less than 1/2 a pound a week.

Glad I took the break, and I'm *very* glad I've started up again instead of deciding to be happy with a barely healthy weight.  I'm 8 pounds away from my new goal weight of 120.What rolls down stairs

LOG FROM BLAMMO  But to me, that's why a lot of people that try those diets can't maintain their weight. They gain it back once they stop paying attention. Should you count calories for life? Absolutely not! But doing it that way has taught me how to be able to "eye" portions, especially with my veggies and fruits This is encouraging.  Brad Pilon's explanation seems sound but on the other hand, he hasn't weighed more than 180lbs his entire adult life so in a way I guess I didn't feel like he was 'qualified' to address what might make a difference to someone who has 130 lbs to lose, if that makes sense?  Thanks for sharing your experience. :)  And your vicarious cheesecake.
So you set activity *and* you're eating back calories, you're double counting. For most sedentary is the best activity level as the activity levels tend to overestimate and if you pick a level other than sedentary you don't also eat back caloriesYep, just go to diet coke. Cuts out a majority of the calories. I believe a regular Coke is 160-180 calories each with a 100 per shot of whiskey. so you are looking at around 520 each for a double tall. If you use Diet Coke you are looking at 200 each.Yeah, this is the first time in dozens of attempts of logging that I've logged everything and stayed under my calorie target for more than a day. Day 4 at 1800 cals plus p90x3 and its amazing how much easier it is if you have a plan and stick to it. Logging is awesome, knowing how much I packed for breakfast lunch and snacks makes dinner an easy decision. I even had enough for dessert last night which blew my mind. Logging is the best!Downloaded, and on my homescreenMy boyfriend and I recently went for the weight loss together and we are seeing some progress. It's really something you have to think of as a lifestyle change and not a diet - if you keep saying diet, you keep thinking temporary and it needs to be permanent in your mind so you can stick with it. 

We cut out bread and sugars entirely. Now that's extreme but super effective right now - we are both down over 10 pounds in a month. We have definitely had cheat meals though, but overall we look at a meal and say ok I need a lot of veggies and some meat, anything else is a cheat. 

Clean out all the temptations from your fridge and pantry, make it easier to eat healthy than to eat unhealthy, do a cooking class together or something! Or really I know there are a ton of recipes out there that if you follow, you will be able to do! Feel free to PM me if you have any questions on how to cook something - I love cooking and have really just gotten into it in the past year or so

I will get downvoted for this probably but take a look at the Paleo diet, it is pretty restrictive but the basis of it is good to keep in mind - Veggies are number 1, then meat, then fat. I'm happy to send over some recipes for tasty vegetables, they can be hard to adjust to at first for sure. I've recently done this as well.  At 295 now.  Started at 320.

Can confirm, used my fitness pal and strive for around 1880 calories or less per day.

Took me 2 months.When I was training for a longer race, having a fuel belt (belt with water bottles and a pocket for a snack) was really helpful. 
I browse [sparkpeople](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/)Congrats! Damn it feels good to hit certain milestones like that!He whines about how his feet hurt from walking... because his license was suspended from double homicide. He wants us to ignore the fact that he killed two people and sympathize with his little feetsies. That's pathetic. He complains MULTIPLE TIMES about how his feet hurt after mentioning the killing of two people ONCE. He killed two people, which is no big deal, but his fucking feet hurt and he needs to tell people how much they hurt. He brags about how far he walked to work, but are the people he murdered complaining about their walks to work? No, because they can't walk, or complain, or see their families, or breathe, or taste, or love. They're dead. He killed them both and took everything from them, then complained about how that double homicide led to foot pain for him.Thanks,

I think accountability is going to help with me, I'm going to try to be active on LoseIt and other related subbreddits. Maybe the pressure of putting up progress pics will help motivate.

Speaking of motivation, I don't know if anyone else has tried this but when I went on a little health binge about a year ago, I would listen to these playlists of motivational speeches (e.g. http://8tracks.com/mrtalented/motivational-speeches) and it kind of got me in a positive mind set enough to workout and eat healthy everyday. Rather than listening to music during working out I would listen to these. If you can't find them on a music app try Youtube or something and search "motivational speeches" Some of them put a chill down my spine.
I completely agree with this! There have been days where I ate complete garbage but logged everything and it really put things into perspective! I would look back and usually it wouldn't be as bad as my mind cracked it up to be. Log4lyfe lolthat's great! It's amazing news. Nothing like a this to keep you going. Feeling good about what you are doing is the best motivation. I'm not saying he can't make up for it elsewhere or that he can't drink.  What I'm saying is that consuming 3500 calories over maintenance of Jack, Coke, broccoli, or pure unicorn meat will cause you to gain a pound, more or less.  The balancing act is for everyone else to figure out.  I mean, hell, I eat fast food a couple of times a week.  We all make our choices. Burning off 1 pound a week *without* a vest is really pretty easy work for most people. Even if this works I feel like the sort of person who buys it will just eat back those extra calories thinking they found a good deal. I'd rather be comfortable and warm for 2 hours and just sacrifice eating a bearclaw each day. I realized this morning that my jeans are quite loose around my waist, and went to cinch my belt enough... and ran out of holes.

Gonna need a new belt soon, and probably new pants.Hey this inspired me to go check on my day count on MFP and I'm on day 213! I feel exactly the same way, I don't know if I'll ever stop logging. Once I hit my goal weight my maintenance calories is 1500 (if I don't work out) and I've sort of just accepted that counting my calories will most likely be a permanent part of my life. Congrats!! I hit the 160 wall, too. I know in the past I've not passed it because I was content with where I was and didn't want to put in the effort to go further. But I weighed 160.8 this morning and I am not content! I will reach my goal! And I'm totally looking forward to your post when you finally see 159, too :):-) cheersDon't give up this time. Keep going. You can do this. Everybody hits a plateau - maybe yours won't be 160 this time. Who knows? But you can get through it. Come here for support. You're at 168 - that's awesome! Sorry about the cat pee...maybe store this scale off the floor :)Even if it ends up burning more calories, you'll just feel hungrier and thus eat more.Great job!I'm just saying, you said he was atoning for what he did. Nowhere did he say he atoned for it, or felt bad, or did anything for the families, or anything other than how it affected him legally. There's no reason to assume he even thinks he did anything wrong, based on his post, so I'm not sure why you say atonement is any part of this. His tone suggests the opposite.I had no idea about water retention from weight training, thanks so much for the tip!Me too! It's already helping me out a lot. :)I agree, it's a mental game. And I also feel like doing stupid food things when I'm feeling upset. Sometimes I just power through it which makes me usually in a worse mood, or I have a small fun snack which is usually enough and cheers me up a little. But it's a tightrope walk. So easy to turn 1 small snack into 10.

Let's hope we all kick February's ass!On MFP I selected 'Lightly Active' and it tell me 1,690 is how many calories to consume to lose 1.5 pounds/ week. What do I have to be afraid of? Shit that'll fuck up that meat-covered skeleton.Same here, McDonald's and just shit food every day, as long as its under 1500 I go down. Its awesome , other than being hungry a lot. All I can find on the subject is that cold water can disrupt digestion if you drink while you eat. The reasoning is that the water will pass through quickly, flushing out digestive enzymes along with it. 

In terms of temperature, it says that cold water slows down digestion, but I'm not sure exactly what this means. 

High fiber foods are said to digest slowly and help with satiety and avoiding overeating. This is perceived as a good thing. 

Also, does "slower digestion" equate to "slower metabolism?" I'm not sure that these two things are linked at all. I've tried working out and stuff, unfortunately I think I need to start slow. So I've actually JUST downloaded MyFitnessPal and it seems to be helping a lot, eating about 1300 calories a day. And trying to work out as much as possible. Also trying to eat less rice,potatoes,bread and all that stuff. I hope you don't mind but I've decided that you'll be my inspiration! 

I'll be following you and rooting for you! Thanks for the tip on the FAQ btw!
This is pretty much what happened. I was heading to work on the interstate and another car slid on black ice running into me.

The police wouldn't even of known I was drinking if I didn't live in a smaller town. I was heading to work and barely over the legal limit at the time. I registered a .09, and when the police arrived on the scene they were never even gonna breathalyze me. However one of the officers who had multiple run-ins with me, arrived on the scene. He knew more than likely I was at least over the legal limit. Yeah,  at 24 I lost 85 pounds to drop to 195. I was considered overweight, still.  I'm large and broad,  and i might have had another 10 pounds to lose,  but 160 would be a 21 bmi for me,  and to think of losing another 35 ppounds from where I was,  it would have frightened me. In a deficit you are not putting on muscle, your strength gains are coming from CNS adaptations. I would err on the side of caution, and not eat back exercise calories. Keep it simple. 

edit: I also forgot to mention the part about water retention from weight training, when you lift, your body will "swell" slightly (the same as when you are injured) to help those muscles recover. This can account in some cases a stall in lost "weight".What activity level did you set? If you continue to gain I would reconsider the calories.  You haven't been losing what you expected to which seems like a clear sign that it's too many calories I'm having a small food/coffee/water/sleep habit slump because I began in January and work has been busy, but I'm still going to the gym. I found if I don't do a small bit of cardio every other day the cravings for fun food are more frequent and persistent, and it's harder not to eat at night, even though I have workout appointments 3 days a week. Those alone aren't enough. So I'm surviving it and looking forward to the end of the slump.

I don't count calories or pay attention to what I'm burning in the gym, I find it doesn't matter nearly as much as what I eat, when I eat, and whether I go to the gym or not.

Great that you've set goals, congratulations and good luck :)Weight watchers would have a similar list that you may have more luck finding - it would be most of the non-starchy vegetables and some fruits, spices, herbs, tea and coffee (though must count sugar and milk/cream), mustard, vinegar and probably a few other minor things. Can't wait till technology continues to reduce the effort of logging. Would love to just be able to take a photo of a meal and get the caloric info and stuff.p.s. One more thing. I've had to learn the difference between "good pain" (aches from using muscles) and "bad pain" (impending injury). Don't let good pain scare you off of doing things. It'll pass. Or at least move around. :)I 100% agree. Last I heard was that it burns brown fats which many people don't have much of after infancy. Grats. I'm 10lbs behind ya.Well, we're all different, that's for sure. 

But sometimes not being able to do one thing can mean you can do something else. For example, I can't squat well. So if I drop something on the ground, I don't bend from my knees or hips to pick it up. But I'm really good at bending over from the waist to get it!


I'm really enjoying using weights at the gym. The machines go as low as 10lb, and the dumbbells can be as light as 3lb. Just 'cause someone else is using more doesn't mean you have to start there!

Be brave. We can do this. thanks for the heads up. i'll up my water game. currently i hit 64+ oz a day.This doesn't work directly like that. I'll try to find the article but drinking cold water is fairly unhealthy in terms of taking away blood from digestions, slowing your metabolism. There is, like anything else, a balance that needs to be struck. Where did he brag at all?  And if he's not in prison any more what the hell else is supposed to do than better himself?  Stay an alcoholic, continue to attempt to drunk drive?  This is what humans are supposed to do after they've done wrong and been punished for it: get better, don't do bad shit again.  It's a waste of money. If you want a strong fat burner. Pick up ephederine or DNP at your own rizkI've heard of these kinds of things before. It will work, but only for what's known as "brown fat" which most adults do not have a lot of. Other than that it will just make you cold. It is not worth it and I would label it as a scam. However long it takes, you're going to get there, and we will be here waiting to greet you!Congrats! I restarted at the same exact weight as  you, and have the same goal as you. Keep on keeping on! It gets harder and easier at the same time, but being under 300lbs is awesome! I did a similar happy dance when I saw it tilt under 300!If you want some help, this hypnosis change what you eat from high-carb to veges.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNPND9FfqUGood for you!! You can do it! Running is so awesome because it gets better the more you do it (okay...that's probably true of anything, but I really love this about running). Keep it up and you will totally be doing a 5k this spring! Absolutely, or men! As mentioned by others, as long as you're happy with your body that's what really matters. My favourite cookbooks ever, are the Looneyspoons collection. I think they are Looneyspoons; Crazy Plates; and Eat, Shrink &amp; Be Merry. They list the calories and macros, and what I really liked about them (aside from the recipes being really tasty) is that they used a number of the same ingredients throughout the book. Not in a way that made them boring, but in a way that you could stock your pantry once, and be all set to make a bunch of stuff. 

I also like these websites, and they list the nutritional info of their recipes:

Thank you! I wish I lived close enough to work to do that haha. I love listening to podcasts while I walk!The calories were set for me via the LoseIt app (and I double-checked on the MFP app, it gives me similar numbers).This is /r/loseit, not /r/letmetellyoumylifestory in detail.  We've only heard a snipet of the story. The simple fact of all this is, we've no idea of the specifics (if he only got 6 months, there's a decent probability that maybe he didn't cause the accident but during it was caught drunk ) and because of that I'm not going to wish him a slow death like person I replied to and hope rather that him kicking the  booze, getting in shape and trying to better himself is part of the process for doing anything he can to make a horrible situation a little less horrible.It's nice to feel comfortable in spaces.Walking on a treadmill is about the only thing I *can* do, judging from my experience thus far. Unrelated health issues earlier in my life left my lower back muscles incredibly week, so I can't lift weights or anything like that without pretty serious discomfort. I have considered trying yoga or something like that, but the same health issues left me really unflexible too. I suppose over time I could regain some of my lost flexibility though. Maybe I should just really look into things I could do to strengthen my poor back. D:It sounds like you're saying it's easier for you to give up something you enjoy than it is to develop more self-control...so yeah, I guess that makes sense.Better off with the whiskey, forget the soda. No carbs, different sugars in the boozeThank you! I've always wanted to visit Portland! I guess I never thought about how difficult it would be to get out and exercise if it was wet outside all the time haha. I realized this about myself yesterday. Not only do I have to keep logging. I pretty much have to log all of my meals and snacks for the entire day for it to work. This way if I feel like changing something, I can look at the rest of my day and figure out how to make up for it before it happens. That makes sense.  I'm a believer in second chances myself, but I couldn't help but be curious.It took me awhile to get into it, too. But I definitely like it for finding other people who eat like I do.  
Anyway... really, feel free to email me anytime. Even if you just wanna rant but spare the boyfriend. I'm here!I have a few, but I suck at linking things, so bear with me if these don't work, but they are accessible with a quick google...

Enjoy!you can probably absorb a few drinks once a week. just try to drink a ton of water with them to minimize the water retention. sounds weird but go with it. the more water you drink, the less water weight you will gain. Last week I got into a fight with my mom, ate cupcakes and muffins, only made it to the gym twice and moped around. Then my husband went grocery shopping and only got junk, pasta, boxed food crap. So I went and bought my fruits and veggies, got mad, went to the gym and felt great. I will eats the veg and go to the gym everyday this week. I'm over my slumpI would definitely swap the regular Coke for diet if you feel you can. Coke has a lot of sugar and calories. If you're having, say 2 pints of Coke that's basically 100 grams of sugar. I think the Jack's workable in a diet if you plan ahead for the calories but I would definitely cut the normal Coke, especially as you drink it every week.No hope involved, it really works.  Just be honest with your intake.  Also don't let a week or two determine if it's working or not.  I say give it 30 days.  Another thing, don't compare your losses to others and don't let fluctuations up or down freak you out.  They will happen and it will be discouraging but just remember it happened to every single one of us and if you push through, you will succeed.word. i'm working out and eating between 1200-1600 a day, even on workout days. losing at about 2lbs a week from 198 with a goal of around 160. Same.  I feel like an idiot but this made me tear up a bit.Tuna "meatballs" with curry-tomato sauce .. yummy.
No, the maximum muscle gain especially in a deficit for women is 1/4 lb a week. However the gain could be water weight as lifting is associated with water retention. Are you taking measurements? 

I would stop eating back exercise calories, even if conservative you're likely overestimating 

Also how did you set your calories? 1650 calories is probably a 20%ish deficit about 400-500 calories a week which is less than to 1 lb loss per week 

I think you need to reduce calories **You don't have to walk.**


It used to drive me nuts. "Everyone said" walking was the easiest exercise, and it would be easy. Bullshit. 


Try something that interests you. Keep doing it if you enjoy it. Just 'cause you're not ready to compete in the Tour de France doesn't mean you can't ride a bicycle... or a recumbent bicycle, or a geeky adult tricycle if you want to. I ended up on a recumbent because I found the height of a regular bike/trike scared me. So what? I got on my funny looking bike and rode it. And I got all sorts of compliments on it too. :)


So go ahead, try belly dancing if that sounds like fun. Or maybe you'll like lifting weights at the gym. Or bowling. Or scuba diving!


Just 'cause we're fat it doesn't meant we're limited to walking. 

I ate about 150 over my limit twice in a row... That hasn't happened since I started keeping track LOVE the feeling of changing your flair! Congratulations, keep going!!Whats your favorite way to log?thank you for all of the information, as I said above I think I was just deluding myself and thinking I was tracking everything but it was very vague at times. For example I know I wasn't measuring the cream I use in my coffee, just "guesstimating" it. I didn't actually realize those small miscalculations can add up to no weight loss...but that makes sense. I will definitely try to stick to the 1500 max and give exercising again a try to help with those cheat days. Thanks!#####&amp;#009;

That's AMAZEBALLS! 

Congratulations, what an awesome way to stay motivated and on track!Nothing but excuses. No one cares how big you are or what you look like. Get over it.First off, great job on your choice! Second, everyone else that has responded has really great tips! I am personally a chip-a-holic. It was always my weakness, chips. Something I found that can replace them is the veggie straw chips. There is no redeeming nutritional value to them, but you can have 38 of them for 130 calories, and for me it really helps that craving. Another thing I really like to snack on is triscuits and cottage cheese. I will have half a cup of cottage cheese, and 1.5 servings of reduced fat triscuits for a total of 290 calories. They are so tasty together, and really satisfies that chips and dip craving. Good luck on your journey, stick with it!haha that's the best way to describe it!You are right, I was just deluding myself and thinking I was tracking really accurately when even last night I had a glass of wine and just guessed how much I drank. I think that is happening more often than it should and probably is what is causing me to stay at my weightYes. "DUIs are super dope." is exactly what I took from this dude's story. A+ reading comprehension, you beautiful snowflake.Where did he atone in the original comment? All I see is acknowledgement that he killed people. Atonement would be working to help the families of the people he killed for no reason other than his lack of self control. Atonement is not posting on the Internet about how double homicide made him a better person.thanks for bringing this up- I usually eyeball it, I think weighing ingredients would be like the next step up for me.Great progress! Nothing quite like seeing your jawline resurface. How is it hypocritical? Are you saying that everyone in this thread has killed people with their bad choices? Because I haven't. I haven't committed a single vehicular homicide.

It's great that you can forgive someone for doing something that didn't affect you, though. I'm sure the families of the people he murdered are right on board with you.Felt my chest just now and there was a bump too. But unlike you mine was a man boob :( at least it's smaller than 6 months ago...Well, I'm not consistent with counting- and I get more swept up into the cooking. I need to step back and not be thinking about it all the time, because thinking about it makes it harder to remain disciplined. Does that make any sense?Congratulations! I've lost 78lbs in 42 weeks so far, and though my SW was a lot higher (283) if you knuckle down and go for it, no excuses, you can do a lot before your wedding.

It's very easy to make some simple dishes from scratch. One of my go-to recipes is a can of tuna or salmon, a bit of rice, cut up spring onions and red pepper, and 2 tbsps of soy sauce. Takes all of 5 minutes to make and is delicious and healthy. Most of the dishes I make using stir-fry bags of veg and take me less time than delivery from a takeaway.

One of the things that helped me enormously is support from other slimmers, both on here and at a weight-loss support group I go to. It gives me accountability while at the same time helping me through rough patches and bad weeks. Their encouragement has often saved me from ditching the whole thing over a few bad choices.

You can 100% do it if you are honest with yourself, make the changes sustainable and draw the line immediately under any binges or bad choices. Of course life will get in the way sometimes, but if you're sensible and realistic and take it as a change of life and not just as a crash diet before your wedding, you'll walk down the aisle at a weight that you are both comfortable and happy with.Inspired to commit your own double homicide? What is inspiring about a drunk driver who shows no remorse about killing people?This helped me.  Thank you.  I never thought of practicing eating, but you're totally right.The mental battle is really about 90% of losing weight and it is the hardest for me. It's so easy to throw the towel in when you feel bad about yourself/your choices. Negativity breeds negative habits - I try to recite this to myself (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt!) I don't think 3lb is too bad though, and I think you'd be very surprised how quickly you could get that off. I'd also be very wary of thinking that you gained 3lb of fat, it's going to be a lot of water weight if you had a bit of a binge and ate salty food or had too much booze etc. We shall try and try again!unless he takes those calories out from somewhere else in his diet. meaning if he works out, or cuts back on something else he can "fit" those jack and cokes in. Although it is not the greatest use of calories, it is important to keep that balance so we don't go off the rails. 
Congrats on getting away with double homicide. It's great to hear how you murdering two others hasn't held you back at all. Here's to you mowing down several more families and dropping a few pounds with each one!

You fucking scumbag. What kind of piece of shit BRAGS about how killing people hasn't affected them? I hope when you relapse and murder another couple people, it makes you just as happy as it did the first time.Many people think so, but the only ones I've found were when I was changing a workout regimen (likely water), or haven't been good about hitting my goals. I've never had a plateau when I've been 100% responsible in my eating, and without changing my workouts.My birthday was the 5th and I took 7 days "off" (4th-11th) from my restricted calorie goal and ate at a maintenance level. I still logged all of my calories, but let myself go over my calorie goals and ate what I wanted. I'm now back to my deficit and I can already tell it helped jump start my system. Breaks are needed sometimes, especially if you're plateauing! Oh, and I weighed last night and I didn't loss or gain, so I'm calling that a great success after the piece of cheesecake I ate on my birthday lolWay to go! 

i am 20lbs away from "Twoville" this morning. can't wait to get under 300. I agree with the posters here (and especially with u/audiojister regarding weight being tied to shame- not just in our own minds but reinforced by society/media/etc.), and just wanted to add one more thought.  Being overweight for so long, I've had a whole lot of stops and starts at this; so many that it got to the point where I felt that the people I usually confided in were tired of hearing about it only to then see me fail again.  Now, that might not necessarily have been true, but the thought of disappointing someone close to me who genuinely cared about me again by reverting to old habits was too much to bear.  I'm not saying this thought is rational at all, just that that was one reason why I was hesitant to talk about it with my friends and family.  Just make sure to reinforce that you care and you love and support him no matter what- even if his journey were to take a long time or he messes up a lot or what have you.I personally consider anyone who has a complete disregard for their life and the lives of others as a threat. Anyone who drives drunk is a sociopath. Anyone who drives drunk, kills two innocent people just living their lives, and then comes online to brag about how double vehicular homicide hasn't held them back from living their life is the scum of the fucking earth.Great job! Keep it up!Your comment brings to light an important aspect of weight loss I think.  I too am fairly happy with the way I've chosen to eat (except for more cake- I could eat cake every day).  I didn't mention that I was thinking of 'maintenance' weeks lining up with holidays which tend to have splurgier food choices.  I think if I chose an ordinary week to eat at maintenance, my maintenance would just be more of the same good choices I ordinarily make.  Thanks for your insight.WTG yourself 95lbs is a ton!  how long did that take you?Like most weight loss scams it is only really effective with a balanced diet and exercise. Another effective way to lose weight is by using a balanced diet and exercise. Yes! I have come to terms with having to log forever, it is such an insignificant price to pay for good health!MyFitnessPal!I've used MyFitnessPal in the past, but somebody mentioned that LoseIt app recently, and I'm giving that a go. They're very similar, and very easy to use. You just search for what you're eating (they have TONS of stuff preloaded), and if you can't find it, you can scan the barcode and it'll automatically populate the nutrition information.Awesome! Great job, and thanks! Hmm.. tudorland is good, but what about twoville; a play on Dr. Seuss Whoville? That's the wittiest thing I can come up with, thanks to my 4 yr old son. Good morning! 
I am a long time loseit lurk, so I figured I would sign up so I can actually partake in threads. I am a 26 year old mom of one living in the Boston area, and I am beyond fed up with my physical state (5'3" and 157lbs). 
Long story short, I've always been on the athletic and smaller side. I have pretty terrible body image issues that probably stems from my childhood but I won't go there. I sustained a bad sports related injury in 2002 that required multiple surgeries and led to being very sedentary. I stayed home from school a lot and eventually recovered but I no longer got involved in athletics and just I just really loved food, for every occasion and emotion. I was also diagnosed with depression around that time, as well. 
Fast forward to 2010-2012 and  I got into the absolute best shape of my life and felt amazing. I was in the gym almost daily and used working out as my all around stress reliever, antidepressant, everything.
I met my son's father in October 2012 and found out that I was pregnant 3 months later, and everything began to spiral downward from there. I ate whatever and whenever I wanted and went from 117ish to my now 157. I can't wear the clothes I want to wear and hate how I look naked, like haaaaaaate it. Even though I love my son more than anything, I've struggled with bouts of deep scary depression all along the way. I feel like I'm leaving a lot out but I didn't want to ramble for too long. I'm just ready to finally be at peace and feel good once and for all, but I'm having trouble getting there. I'm hoping that being part of some sort of community will  help me out of my slump! Nothing wrong with elaborate meals as long as you know the calorie content. I'd suggest knowing what your maintenance  calorie intake should be and weigh ingredients accordingly then weigh portions out. Preparing in advance is a good way of controlling calorie intake.You seem like you're in a great position, actually. You're happy to prepare your meals, and you have a history of successful weight loss. Frankly, all you need to do is consider the caloric value of all the meals you prep, which should be easy for you...is there a reason you aren't doing this? I guess there's something I'm missing, since this seems like an obvious solution...you don't need to stop prepping your own meals?I'm really short too, somewhere around your height give or take an inch, but unlike you I've always been really heavy. So I've always wanted to be one of those tiny girls who eats half a sandwich and is like, "Wow I'm SO full!" I would love to be just this little thing who can occasionally have a big meal but for the most part doesn't need much to keep going. And it's SO HARD. So I think that's my difference - my lifestyle change is also what I think my ideal is. It's all probably wrapped up in size issues and things (like I can't wait to be tiny enough that people can pick me up. I've literally never been that small. I mean I guess I was when I was a child but probably since middle school on I've been larger than my peers) but I love being short and I want to be tiny in every way, including my portions. I don't know. It's weird and I recognize that's completely different from what you even asked for, but I realized it as I was reading what you wrote. Anyway!Yeah, I have browsed through there a little bit, I was just not sure if there was anyone on here who was in a similar situation as mine, or similar age, who could provide so advice. Thank you though! What do you use to track calories?The same thing happened to me when I first started out. I lost the initial water weight, which is exciting to see, then lost a couple of real pounds. I was so pumped! But then the scale just wouldn't budge. 

For about two and a half weeks, the scale was either the same number mocking me, or worse, it would be two-to-three pounds heavier. I was so frustrated that I said fuck it and had a pity party, complete with a sadness-fueled Mexican food bender.

The next day I stepped on the scale to accept my defeat... and I was down three pounds.

Stick with what you're doing! Lifting can cause your muscles to retain a lot of water while they recover. The weight will come off eventually, and when it does, you get to claim victory over the scale! Just remember, this is a war of attrition, so dig your heels in and know that you're going to come out on top.By gaining I mean 1-2 lb increase. I have a friend who has tried to get me to check into getting Topomax for migraines. I have another friend who actually takes it, and there's no way in hell I would ever do that to myself. The side effects sound worse than the migraines themselves.

I couldn't deal with the "topomax head" -- I'm a graduate student and writing my dissertation is hard enough without feeling stupified.Here's a great article about why exercised based diet plans don't work as well.  http://vitals.lifehacker.com/exercise-vs-diet-which-is-more-important-for-weight-l-1677532039Read the FAQ. Then read through all the posts below yours. Tons of information already on here. C'mon back when you have specific questions :)It is easy and I've been losing weight but all last week I hit a plateau and this week I'm gaining...I haven't eaten more than the 1200 calories per day, maybe it's because I'm not drinking as much water since im in jury duty? I don't know but it's frustrating and I feel like quitting. I've been good, yesterday someone brought donuts and I stuck to my own breakfast. I don't mean to whine but :(Agree. Logging is amazing. I used My Fitness Pal and although not every calorie is to the exact it's a pretty good rough guide. For example a tablespoon of mayonnaise is like 100 calories. If I didn't log that before I put it on my plate I may have just had 3 or 4 tablespoons worth instead.   
  
Logging also allows you to treat yourself! Without logging I would have guess I was at my target already by dinner - not 500 calories off which allowed for some chocolate cake!   
  
I feel like it gives me a purpose as well. I look forward to logging my meal in advance and then subtracting or adding things to make them fit within my calorie intake. It makes losing weight rewarding seeing your streaks come up or tracking how well you're eating. I love logging! 

Congratulations on the milestone!!

It's a HUGE deal.... but I may be slightly biased since the same happened to me today too!!

Welcome to "Tudorland" (since I can't come up with anything else that sounds like "onederland" for this momentous occasion lol)

Keep losin'! :)Maintenance breaks are a smarter way to lose weight both psychologically and physiologically. When I'm cutting I incorporate them but I just eat what I would otherwise eat just at maintenance as I don't really view the way I eat as splurge or not splurge. It's a physiologic effect for me that in most after but it can also have a strong psychological break for many. I have chosen a way of eating that I genuinely enjoy. For example, next week I'm on vacation and thought I would plan some "fun" meals, my meal plan looks exactly like what it usually looks like as for me a sustainable way of eating means eating foods you enjoy eating.  That being said, if you want to use maintenance breaks for special occasions that's fine but instead of framing it as an opportunity to splurge and creating an unnecessary dichotomy perhaps instead view it as "it's vacation, I will eat what I want in moderation to satiety with a goal to maintain my weight." A subtle difference but an important one to avoid the diet mentality which is often why maintenance doesn't work out long term.Oh, and congratulations on your pending marriage! That's v exciting. As I get closer to deciding to propose to my girlfriend, I definitely don't want to be the weight I am now if/when we get married. You can do this!A few things on this...

* I've found that there is a direct correlation between the distance I live from fast food places and how much fast food I eat. Maybe something to consider when you get married and move in with your soon-wife.

* Experiment with spices. I don't have an extensive spice rack, but a bottle of McCormick Caribbean Jerk and a bottle of Rotisserie Chicken spices, along with black pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes lets me do just about anything I want to. Most of my home-cooked meals are chicken, turkey, or burgers cooked in a pan on the stovetop, using some of those spices and seasonings. I'll also occasionally make a big pot of pasta and cook up some ground turkey or ground beef to add to plain tomato sauce. All of these meals are quick and easy to cook. Total beginner level stuff. For veggies, I just buy steamable packs and throw them in the microwave six minutes before my main meal is done cooking.

* I do breakfast and lunch easy. Breakfast is a little cup of granola at my desk with my coffee. Lunch is either leftovers, tuna lunch kits from the grocery store, or a deli meat sandwich.

* Track everything. Tracking calories should freak you out when you eat out and realize your small meal was 1200 calories on its own. Tracking what you spend, you'll notice that a home-cooked meal costs $1-$6, whereas you can easily spend $8 on fast food and $50 in a restaurant with the lady. It adds up QUICK, even if you just eat out once a day.

* Be patient but firm with yourself. You'll screw up. It's cool. Keep at it.

Good luck!Ooh I remembered another one, cottage cheese! and Greek yoghurtCall me a cynic, but anything that supposedly promotes weight loss that isn't diet and exercise sounds sketchy to me.I was surrounded by people without food issues, so exercise alone worked for them.  I however can only maintain healthy eating habits for a week or so before I start eating in secret, binging, and constantly grazing.  This is something I kept as hidden as possible from everyone around me.  Now my life is so different.  I've recognized and acknowledged my issues with food, and am working to change my old habits.  Tracking helps to keep me aware and conscious.  There are no secrets or rationalizing, just honesty, awareness and kindness.Roasted broccoli is amazing. I mix it with asparagus and some fat free cottage cheese and put it in the oven for 25 minutes. Amazing.Thank you, that's very sweet of you. :) Honestly I've tried Instagram before but it's not really my thing, I never have anything to post and it's not as easy to use as some other sites I frequent. I lost 8lbs in my first week as well. Even if it's water and not fat, it's still stuff that was weighing you down to begin with. If you can have it gone, have it gone! Keep up the good work!The [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq) is a great place to start. &gt;it was the logging that made them work and dropping the logging made it quit.

I couldn't agree with this more. It mirrors my experience exactly. I've come to realize that I'll be logging my food for the rest of my life. That sounds sad, but it really isn't. It's a small time investment in return for much better health.Topamax for weight loss only?  Ugh, gross.

Don't ever do that to yourself.

I was on it for 1 month for migraines as I have daily pain in my eyes.   I did lose weight during that month but I was already walking/counting calories/making changes, I wouldn't say the topamax did much beyond making me miserable.  The topamax put me on my ass - any energy I had was sapped from me.  Fatigue is not fun.

Also, it fucks with your brain.  I felt like a goddamn idiot for a month.  Topamax head is what my neurologist calls that... how delightful.Thanks! And, just like everyone else around here: calories in &lt; calories out = weight loss. Figure out your bmr and tdee and eat below that. I am usually doing about 700-900 calorie deficit, but I don't calculate my exercise in to the equation so I don't eat back those calories. Have you read the FAQ yet? If not, definitely check it out, tons of useful info in there!I'm more shocked with how many people are disappointed this is the answer I give them and don't want to hear it.I was riding in the car with my significant other (its weird to be 40 and call him a boyfriend or partner and even significant other is odd to say!) and I kept saying, "something is poking me in my back." I felt around behind me and it turned out it was my shoulder blades poking the seat. It was a good pokey feeling after that! Enjoy finding your rib!Congrats, buddy! Really happy for your transformation and new lease on life! Keep it up!I had gastric bypass six and a half years ago and have lost over 200 pounds. It was the best decision of my life. I was extremely overweight so I had to go on a special diet before the bypass and I lost about 40 pounds that way. Even with that weight loss, i knew that I needed the surgery. My blood sugar was out of control and my asthma was just getting worse. So many people think it's an "easy" quick fix but as with anything, it's all about changing your eating habits and living a healthy life. 

Yes, for the first year or so after surgery, you will lose weight no matter what. Just because you're so limited to the amount of food you're capable of eat. After that though, you're like a normal person. You have to work at it to lose the weight. 

I can't say enough how much this surgery gave me my life back. I no longer am on any meds and my asthma is completely gone. My quality of life is a million times better. When it comes down to it, it's a personal decision but the most important thing is to realize that there is no quick option to losing weight. It will be a lifelong journey! It was really eye-opening when I realized that the only thing stopping me from losing weight . . . Was me. There wasn't some cosmic force in the universe making me fat, it was me. I'm just in the beginning stages (I've been making lifestyle changes slowly so I see it less of a diet and more of a way of living) but this week I started counting calories in addition to working out. I really, really can't wait to see some results, no matter how small.congratulations! how'd you do it! I'm struggling to drop from 230 lbs to 210 lbs. I can't figure it out! Learn some easy "cheating time" meals.

I eat Chick Fil A, Chipotle, Five Guys, etc.  After figuring it out with their calorie information, the meals I get from there are between 500-700 calories.  If what you eat is high protein and skip the bad shit, it's fine for your macros.

Just skip the fries / extra carbs if you have to stay low for whatever reason (height, no activity, etc).Thank you for your reply. Yes, I will decrease my alcohol intake for sure. I'm limiting it to weekends only. I bought some really nasty rice protein powder after reading your comment, to make sure I get my daily amount of protein. Thanks again!If you go that route find one with a little key pocket (speaking from experience) :)Just starting out with the whole MFP and counting calories thing... here's hoping :\This is also a good idea. I should ask about that. I think right now she's keeping her phone in a sweatshirt pocket (it's February in Michigan, go figure), but when it gets warmer out, an armband will be very useful.Goal for today is to cook a nice and healthy dinner for myself tonight instead of eating something on the go.What I do is I weigh in daily and don't think too much about what the scale says that day, I just calculate the general trend. I started my weight loss journey at the beginning of the year and the first month looked like [this](http://imgur.com/caZWJ5G). Yellow line is my goal, red line is the trend. Sometimes you can see HUGE jumps from one day to the other, or if I would only weigh in once a week it might look like I'm not losing anything at all, especially if I hit a bad day. But looking at the trend I know that I'm on track. They initially prescribed Topamax for me to treat my migraines and it was horrible. Yes, i lost about 20 pounds but that was because the medicine made me nauseous the whole time I was on it. Never again!!Does she have an armband for her phone to wear while working out/running? Maybe an iTunes card to go along with it?I lost 11lbs in my first week, not even kidding. I think it's the drastic change to your calorie intake and type of food you're now eating. As another poster said, fast food and junk type food have alot more sodium so alot of water weight will be lost one you cut back/cut them out but at least you're losing!  Well done on your decision to get healthy! I started logging yesterday for the first time in my life. You are absolutely right. Awareness is essential :)

Nutritionist, that's an idea. I've had a couple of opportunities to see one, but for some reason didn't want to- maybe I was too defensive to feel comfortable  talking with a stranger about it. But I should as you say just think of it as another tool. Good to hear you found it useful.Oh! I totally get that. Before I started to put on some muscle in these areas I felt that too. It'll definitely change. :)My sister and I have resorted to first-run things backed on Kickstarter for my dad. It's the only stuff he can't buy on his own.

Pretty sure we're going to try to do one of those "recreating childhood photos as adults" things for our mom for the holidays this year.Yeah i had a look and it's under "entries" saying when I've entered my weight and how many pounds it was. That's great, I would just prefer for it to tell me overall loss in my home icon but I suppose I started on a nice round number and can always work it out myself. I think the home icon is showing monthly weight loss for me. Thanks for your reply :) Weight loss is not linear. Plateaus are a normal part of weight loss. Give it some time and if the weight doesn't start coming off then decrease your caloric budget a bit and then reassess.Burned out...exactly.  After a lifetime of poor eating habits and a bad relationship with food, I went crazy with calorie counting and exercise and I lost all the weight in the span of about 7 or 8 months.  Then I moved to a new state and started a new school, which was very stressful.  I was fine for the first few months and feeling on top of the world, but once the stress from the life change kicked in, I crashed.  It didn't happen all at once, but a little at a time like you described.  I just caved, and eventually went back to my old bad habits.  It took me a long time to realize that I went about my weight loss the wrong way.  In hindsight I think the maintenance part is the hardest, and I wish I had seen a nutritionist at that point so they could help me reflect and stay on track.  Maybe that would help you too?  Now, while I am chipping away at this slower, I am actually very wary of calorie counting (although I know it is still useful), but I am trying to find a balance.  And when I make it to a weight that I feel good about, I want to reach out for help where I can so I have the right tools. I do not believe you can burn an extra 250 calories per hour, just by being cold or wearing a cold vest.Ugh, mine are the same way. Good for them, but so frustrating for gift shopping! Makes me want to give them stuff like "coupon for one free hug" or something, just to be all "you're hard to shop for!" :) I personally love zumba, the moves are always changing, it's a great workout, and I think a lot less boring than just running on a treadmill. They have vidoes on youtube you can work along with.I would suggest changing the treadmill for a while. I exercise at home like you. I don't feel comfortable doing it outside, not only because I feel judged, but also because I live in a big city with a lot of traffic and I hate the smog and the noise. 

I used to go to a gym before, but that's not something I feel comfortable doing right now. Like you, I'd love to swim, but I don't have any affordable options.

So a few days ago I did some research and found a video program to exercise at home. It's not aerobics, it's all about walking, but with a twist. I started yesterday and I feel very motivated. Jogging/running on the treadmill was always very tedious for me. I did it at the gym because I could move to other things after that.

Anyway, PM if want to know the name of the program.

In any case, I wish you luck. I know exercise doesn't necessarily come natural to many of us. It implies a big effort, and finding ways to make it enjoyable, at least until it becomes part of our life. Continue to count calories for at least a few months while in maintenance. Elaborate meals don't need to push you over your caloric intake for the day and if you keep counting they shouldn't be without your knowledge. When you look at your weight progress, it seems to default to showing you a small time frame like a week or a month. That threw me off too til I realized it was just showing me a week not all time. When you go to the progress section, there should be a dropdown where you can pick a different time frame to look at.Some people read as an option.  Books on tape and podcasts are great options.  I want to keep walking till the end, even though I am on a treadmill!I love the idea of doing some races together! I was going to do the Soldier Field run with her, but my roommate and his fiance decided to un-break off their wedding set for that day, and I imagine I'll be needed at that. Still, there are going to be tons of runs in the Spring, I'm sure. That's a great idea.

She's got an iPhone loaded up with music. I'll mull that around in my head a bit. My parents are pretty well off, which makes them difficult to shop for. Typically when they want something, they just buy it. I might check with my dad about the idea of more workout stuff or new music.I felt so good about myself and basically lost 5lbs before Christmas, maintained, lost slowly but steadily through January, but the first week of February kicked my ass. Put on 3lbs, undid about 3 weeks of work and I'm kicking myself for the bad, and frankly, stupid choices I made. Trying to put it behind me and think of the bigger picture but I'm still struggling as my brain is hardwired into the "you've failed so you might as well give up" mode. Still here though, and still trying. Onwards and downwards!I really appreciate your perspective. It's hard to tell where things are going sometimes. I'm clearly burned out the way you were- feels better to name it, now I can deal with it. That's a good point, I'm trying to undo a lot of bad habits in a short time. My behavior makes more sense now.It does, yeah. I've thought maybe automation could help me but wasn't really sure how to do it. I do have a slow cooker- that is a great idea. Also coming up with a pattern, I think, would be very helpful.* Could you purchase a couple of race entries for a race you could do together? 

* Does she already have an iPod? If not - get her one? If so - get her an iTunes card so she can get some new music? Or you could get her a playlist. The 2015 equivalent of a mixed tape. 

* I have a lot of workout clothes and shoes and I STILL want more. Cute workout stuff makes me want to workout. If your mom feels the same way, she might appreciate some cute new stuff, or a gift card for it. Funny, I'm the opposite. Progress pictures with a sports bra totally discourage me, but I think I look so much thinner with clothes on. But then, I haven't been putting any muscle on yet, so maybe that'll change :)Okay, I just want to let you know that I was at your stage at one point.  I was very close to my goal weight, keeping track of my food closely, and then I let the weight creep back on over the years.  I realized later that I had become completely obsessed with tracking food and calories and intake and it left me completely exhausted and ultimately I failed.  It was my fault - nobody else is to blame.  But what I didn't realize at the time is that I was trying to alter over 20 years of poor eating habits in just a few months, and I became obsessive about it.  I should have taken care of myself more, done more research, and been more gentle with myself.  It is awesome that you are reaching out now, before you are back where you started.  My best advice would be to not beat yourself up and just take it slow.  Still prep your meals, but rather than doing it on autopilot, maybe take one day this week to write down what is BEST for you and see if you can incorporate that into the next week.  Take it slower, but not so slow that you gain weight?  In any case, I just wanted you to know that you're not alone, and you are actually at a great point to reflect and stay on track instead of regaining like I did. :)This is going to be long, and I tried to do a tl;dr but really couldn't, so...oh well.

First, is he already working on losing weight or are you asking how to encourage him to start? I wasn't sure from your post. For me, deciding to start losing weight was a very personal choice. I don't think there was anything my husband could have said to get me to start -- he always went along with any new thing I was going to try (everything from C25K to green smoothies to complete sugar fasts, none of which helped), though. I was pretty quiet about counting calories and he kind of let me do my thing when I first started. When I realized this worked and got more confident about it, he amped up the support.

What really helps me is the understanding of my husband. When we're tossing around what to eat for dinner, he'll ask me how many calories I have left for the day, and if it's not very many he will try to think of things he know will fit in my budget. He likes to make big breakfasts on the weekend, but I've been eating smaller/no breakfast in favor of larger dinners, and I appreciate that he doesn't push it when I say I don't want French toast on a Saturday -- we just enjoy our coffee and time together instead.

What DOESN'T help is when I feel like he's policing me. I get really defensive -- I've discovered that I like to feel like I'm in charge of this myself and he's there to help, but he's not the boss of my weight loss. So while I like him saying things like, "Are you sure you want to go above your deficit today? We're going to a birthday party tomorrow," I really, really hate "You're having more chips? We had a big dinner..."

Also, compliments help. I don't always believe them, but they do make a difference -- especially passing ones rather than the "wow you look really good!" We were folding laundry a few weeks ago and he commented that he thought my new jeans would fit him. That made me feel better than all the "look how skinny you are!"s in the world. A few weeks ago I put on an old dress that I thought fit better than it had in years, and he mentioned something in passing that I'd have to retire that one soon because it was looking too big.

I don't necessarily think that there's any way he knows these little passing comments are the best support -- I think he just says what he's thinking and it ends up being what I need to hear.

It might be different for everyone. Maybe ask him what would be helpful. I thought working out with my husband would help, but it honestly kind of discouraged me a little. I joined some fitness classes with my sister, and am way more motivated to work out than when I did it with him. Like I mentioned, I like his understanding and encouragement, but don't like when I feel like I'm being watched. Blatant "you're looking really good," don't help me all that much (although they're still nice to hear -- I just feel like he has to say that because he's married to me, so I can't trust them, ya know?), but passing comments about clothes being too big or something like that can motivate me the whole week.I'm always shocked at how it's both ridiculously easy and yet kind of difficult.  It's difficult in that you have to be thinking about what you're eating all the time and because it's really frustrating when you plateau.  It's really easy in the sense that it's just counting, and in the end, it's a lot easier than most of the weight loss plans out there.i may go the the route of diet and jack. perhaps just diet soon... thanks.Hello!

First of all, congratulations on making the decision to be healthier and have a better life. That is such a big step at such a young age, which is great. 

My first advice is to slow down a little. I know you have a lot of ideas and goals, and that is awesome, but remember changing your lifestyle is a process that takes time. Make one or two changes at a time. Making too many changes at once might be difficult to keep up and it's easier to get discouraged. For example, you could start by cutting down the soda. Don't drink more than 2 for a 10 days, when you've achieved that, go down to 1 for 10 additional days. Finally, go down to no soda and all water for another 10 days.

Second, I recommend moderation. One-two hours of exercise a day might be a long-term goal, but start slowly. You could start by exercising half an hour every day or 1 hour 3 times a week. In time, as you lose some weight, you can exercise more. But take it easy, your body needs to get used to your new calorie intake and your new exercise plan. 

Finally, I'd recommend to set more realistic, healthy goals. 100 lbs in 6 months is excessive. When you loose weight to fast, you regain it easier. Losing weight is a long journey. You have to understand that in order to avoid frustration. We would all love to lose our weight in a matter of months (or weeks when the excess weight is not that much). Truth is it can take even years. And this is not a bad thing. The changes you need to make to lose the weight, and then maintain your healthy weight and stay healthy are forever. They will become part of your life. They won't be a temporary thing to lose weight. And you need time to incorporate changes in your life.

Cheers and good luck in your journey!


Maybe make them less elaborate? Can you involve the slow cooker? Then you just need to toss the ingredients in, and retrieve 'em when the meal is cooked. I make a big batch of something simple and then freeze it in single portions. Every day I grab a mini can of tuna, a frozen container of soup/pulled pork/chili etc from the freezer, a piece of fruit, and I'm all set. It takes so little time to do the prep, and then I don't have to think about it afterwards. Make sense?Fast food and processed foods have loads of sodium.  You lost mostly water and probably a bit of fat (depending on the number of calories you ate).  It's normal to lose a lot of water weight in the beginning.

A loss is a loss though!  Take it and be proud of your first week!Don't question it. Just keep going! Keep up your new good habits, and hopefully it'll stay off. About 4 calories per mL of coke and 2 per mL of whiskey.

It's a lot either way. 

Maybe Jack &amp; Diet Coke next time? Or just Diet Coke? It cools your core down which your body then spend extra energy heating back up to an ideal temperature. You can get similar results with taping some icepacks to a wet T-shirt and wearing it for a bit then refreezing it.

This doesn't promote sustainable, healthy weight loss. Save your money.This is huge!  Congrats!!Flair update **-95 lbs**I suggest avoiding these foods when you are with him.  You can be silently supportive.  It still respects his privacy without providing temptation.

Thanks! My memory wasn't far off after all! Hooray for high school science. :)Yeah ,i watch what i eat but i know that exercise is really good for you overall not just when it comes to losing weight but it can improve your circulation and stuff like that. 
Also i love swimming but i would only do it in a public pool if i could wear a t shirt which my local pool doesn't allow.Agree with read the FAQ ... get on MyFitnessPal which you might be doing already since you know your calories.  It's a great way to log your food.  My advice: never quit logging.  http://redd.it/2vngg1

Your exercise is not sustainable, but it also isn't primarily responsible for weight loss.  Do it because you enjoy it and it *secondarily* helps with weight loss.  But don't put the cart before the horse -- diet is primary.  We like to talk about exercise because we feel like we're publicly doing something where with dieting we're eating mostly in private.  

Keep going, you're going to do awesome!  

Low carb burger: just delete the bun ... another burger tip is to delete the mayo, use mustard or steak sauce or have it plain. Before I started losing weight, it was very rare for me to eat junk food. I didn't really like candy and chips etc, I just got fat by eating too much healthy food lol. Now that I'm losing weight, I'm getting cravings for junk food WAY more than I did before. It's so strangeOh me too. This is where I put on my weight. During grad school I made the "busy" excuse. Never packed my lunch. Lots of going out and drinking with friends. Only real exercise was from the car to the bar. 

So scary about your heart! Will you still have to get your aortic valve replaced? (That's my leaky one as well). Has your super sweet resting heart rate eased the problem for a bit? Did you have any symptoms from the severe leaking? 

My stats: F/5'3"/168. SW: 170, CW: 168, GW: 120  

Good luck, my friend! &amp; Cheers to a happy heart!

Edit: I keep gaining and losing the same 3 lbs. I think my recent switch to low carb will be a game changer, though.Nalgene water bottle is a brilliant idea. Get the wide-mouthed 32 ounce one. Heck, get two. Keep one full in the fridge at all times. You won't reach for a soda if you have cold water handy (if you're anything like me).

Replace soda with coffee or tea if you need to wean off the caffeine slow. I recommend black coffee. It's delicious, and something like 2 calories a cup.

1500 calories for a 6'3" guy seems really low. Bear in mind that 1-2 pounds a week is a good healthy pace to lose. If you lose a lot of weight very fast, it's my understanding that you increase the likelihood of loose skin.

Take your time, bud. You're on the right track, more or less, but you're still at the starting line. It'll take time to get going and get up to speed. Patience is your friend in this endeavor.Or men!... &amp;gt; Sweetie you don't look so good, your bottom lip is bleeding

~ 'Bitters &amp;amp; Absolut' - The NationalThere isn't much one can do past TV/Music to make treadmill running enjoyable. OP has already failed because there will be no option that he wants to hear.I like to dice up some carrots, potato and turnip, toss with a little olive oil, salt, spices. Throw in the oven at high temp 425ish and leave them til they just start getting browned. You're basically making oven fries out of different root vegI love that you brought out this topic.

First of all I want to point that these are merely my opinions based on my personal experience. Some people might disagree, but I hope it helps you.

You said something very important. A change needs to happen (I prefer the word "long-lasting" to "drastic", as the latter sounds scary). I also think that you need your family/significant other/friends/coworkers to be involved. As in any big change in your life, the more support you have, the easier it is. Sure, he is the one that needs to make the change and the effort, but others being conscious, encouraging, and supporting will help, for sure. If not, why are we all here?

I love your attitude. You love your SO and you're concerned. You want to help. This is great. The world is full of people who would rather give up on someone struggling with weight problems or shame them, so  I want to start by appreciating the fact that you are caring and compassionate. 

Being overweight/obese is a source of shame for many of us. Not only because it affects the way we look, but because in many cases exposes our lack of control (over the food we eat). Thus, the way you approach him about this must be very smart and careful.

I would recommend sitting down with him and talking about this openly, in a very caring way. I would start by acknowledging this is a personal battle, but you love him and you want to help him. I would also acknowledge this is a very difficult topic, but you'd still want him to listen to what you have to say. You could let him know you want to support him in any way you can. That you want him to be healthier and happier. You could discuss with him some ideas of things you could do together that would help him. Finally, you could assure him that you will respect his desire to do this alone if he doesn't feel comfortable, but that you will always be willing to help and support him if he needs it or wants it.

There is just one thing you must keep in mind. He will change his lifestyle when he decides to do so. No amount of loving advice or unloving criticism will make a person change if it doesn't come from inside. 

We are all very different. If I had a SO, I would love them to exercise with me, cook healthy food with me, compliment me when I achieve goals. That would motivate me a lot. But that's me. He might feel different about this. I think it is important to talk about it, but it also important to listen to him and respect his wishes regarding this.

Whatever happens, I wish you well, and I think you're a great person for caring and be willing to support your partner. 


Thanks for this! This is a great baseline, and inspiration. Winter is a real challenge for me...I don't do cold well. But I imagine that will get improve, too, as my metabolism gets better. I walk a few times a week as well as yoga, but I could do more. So I've recently started with the C25K app.

I just took my heart rate with my phone and got an average of 72, but I'm not sure how accurate that is. 55-60 is an amazing achievement! Something I'll be working towards.If you join a running group, it might be cool to NOT listen to music while you run with a bunch of other people who would probably talk to you to keep you distracted. 

Why are you super concerned with working out if you so clearly, obviously, dislike it? Losing weight is *almost entirely* about what you eat. I would focus on that instead of asking for advice and then not taking any of it :)WTG!!* Read the FAQ

* 1-2 hours a day is a LOT of exercise for someone who does not currently exercise much. Be aware that if you set very big goals right away, you will get discouraged if you don't meet them. 

* It's been one day. Keep going. Ah one of the reasons I LOVE this sub. Thanks - I needed to hear this! Some days are easier than others - some weeks are easier than others - this one has been a hard one! Onward and Upward!Every 3500 calories of Jack, coke, or any combination of the two that you drink will cause you a pound of long term weight gain.  You're right I don't like running, in fact i hate it. while i love swimming i don't have a private pool and I wouldn't feel comfortable being in a public pool. The running group thing isn't realistic at the moment but only because i don't have a phone and would therefore be unable to listen to music. But i might see if my town has a running group so when i get a phone i could check it out.  Thanks for the suggestion though.Definitly! Especially because that's all it takes. Exercise helps in other areas for sure, but weight loss is remarkably simple in practise - though it sure isn't easy ;sIf I recall correctly, the cold doesn't burn fat, it makes white fat brown (or beige).  I have to go to work now, but if someone wants to investigate further, the terms to start with are: cold thermogenesis

Anyway, this isn't the lifestyle change that we need.Right on! This is hard for me as well - especially at restaurants. I also splurged yesterday, got a giant burrito from a local Mexican place. BUT I left out the sour cream. Then I only ate half (which was still substantial in calorie amount I'm guessing) and stopped, which is unheard of for past me. I saved the other half - but honestly, the one half took care of my craving - so I'm fighting the obligation I feel to eat the rest of it just because it's there and I paid for it. 
wow. amazing progress! congrats!!It's something I tell myself, thought it might strike a chord with some people.Read up on VAP cholesterol tests and in particular have a look at understanding the difference between pattern A &amp; B LDL cholesterol - your test won't have that measurement for example.The per-slice weights for the brand of bread I eat are out by 50%. A slice is supposed to weigh 40 grams -- but actually weighs 60 grams. YES! I am shocked every time I step on the scale - I keep thinking it's going to jump back up to my heaviest - for no reason at all.  

Then that light bulb clicks on and you get it - it's amazing! And all through just keeping track of calories and moving more! I know, right? Cheese really isn't my crutch, but I do use it to get more protein because I get tired of meat and fish all the time. I'll use a bit of a nice camembert as my "dessert," for example.

When he asked about my diet, I told him I didn't really eat much red meat, because I'm not fond of it...but that I did eat a fair amount of cheese. He said that could raise my levels as well. 

We had the food discussion before the exercise discussion, so I think maybe just hadn't gotten there yet when he said that a low carb diet is "the best thing" one can do. I would think exercise. 

I do exercise, though. And I totally agree--it's amazing what just a little bit can do. Even once or twice a week yoga has changed my body so much. I'm getting my first-ever back muscles. THIS! I was so frustrated because all my exercise was getting me nowhere! I finally understand that you can't exercise out of a bad diet - at least one as bad as mine at the time! 

I just wanna say Hi! I can't offer you any solutions, but I'm happy to be a friend. If you ever wanna chat, you can email me (shannonf27@gmail.com) 
I also recommend getting on Instagram (SweatyGirl27 is me). It's fun as a hobby, but also offers lots of friends, motivation, and recipe ideas if you search the right hashtags. 
Let's say you got ice water at 1 degree celsius. To maintain body temperature, you will have to heat it up 36.5 degrees.

So if you drink 2L of water a day (a little more than the 64oz recommendation), then you're drinking 2000g of water. 

You will need 36.5 X 2000 = 73kcal/day to heat it up. One Kcal = the american calorie. 

So in this "I always have perfect temperature water available" scenario, this translates to about 7.6lbs a year. 

I doubt holding ice on your shoulders somehow performs better than this. Much of the heat will come from the environment, and your body doesn't always prioritize heating up your extremities - it focuses on your core temp. 

***

TL;DR - if you want to "cheat" weight loss using temperatures, then drink a lot of cold water, but don't overdrink because that's bad too.I have 115 pounds from my starting to goal weight, and when I first joined the sub I will admit I was a little taken aback by the people that came here needing to lose 10-20 pounds.  Shame on me.

Because now, I LOVE those posts. Please please please keep coming here! With so much to lose, I make mini-goals -- my next is 50 total pounds down at 195, which is still obese. And 195 sounds so, so, so good sometimes compared to where I was, but then someone posts their progress pics from 170 to 150, or 150 to 130, and I'm like, holy crap, I need to keep going! I'm going to get there someday and I'm thankful there's a community here to support those last pounds...and I can't wait to get there. You guys are huge motivation for me personally, and I'm grateful you're here. I'm looking forward to joining your ranks someday and posting my progress from obese to overweight, then overweight to normal, and then honestly from normal BMI to some vanity pounds.

If there's anything us "bigger losers" can do to help motivate you, please let me know and I'll be sure to be mindful of that as we all work on getting healthy!In my opinion, if you know you're below your TDEE, stick with what you think you can maintain. If you aim for 1200 and are always hungry, you're probably going to end up eating more, feeling bad about it, etc. If you can maintain 1500, great! You've got to aim for something that doesn't make you suffer, and you can maintain for a longer period, make sense doesn't it?

Also, remember your metabolism will *proabaly* get used to the 1500, and you may later be able to reduce it a bit if you feel like it. Important thing is if you do that and start having problems, it's probably just that you need the 1500, and going back to that is perfect.

I'm 24, 5'9, and started at around 122kg (265lbs), did 1500 for about a year, lost around 35kg (77lbs) that way, then decided to lower it to 1200, but I was already extremely accustomed to very small portions, etc. I would've never been able to start with that number.

Good luck!Do you know any more about the test? Or if there's a better one out there? This is actually the first time I've done the fasting blood test, so I don't know a whole lot about it. But I do know that the result was split into at least two different values (my good cholesterol was good, but the bad cholesterol was a medium-bad reading).Thanks! It's a great feeling. I got lazy and gained 10lbs back so I'm in the process of reversing that again but it's amazing what just a little bit of willpower and devotion will do for you Thanks :) I have been there before where I were pretty heavy, and the festival is amazing! 

So am looking forward to enjoy myself while there. Congrats! That is a great accomplishment! Last idea re: running outside, and then I'll let it drop - do you have any running groups in your area? Where I live (...Canada) there are tons of Running Room groups. There's a minimal fee, and you go once a week with the group. It's awesome because the leader sets the pace, so you know how fast or slow to go, you can meet new people or you can keep to yourself, and nobody would be "judging" you (they're not judging you anyway, I promise), because you'd be in a group. And the runs don't have to be long. If you can do 6mph for 10 minutes, you can do 5mph for 20 or 30. 

Every response to people's suggestions has been an excuse. I think maybe you just don't like running? That's okay. Try swimming. Try biking. Try anything. I think he was just doing a bit of troubleshooting to let me know examples of foods in my diet that might be causing it.

He seemed to be on top of his game, and mentioned the whole thing about the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee dropping the charges on cholesterol. Told me not to worry about eggs (unless I was eating a crazy amount), etc. 

But this is a good point. The cheese is likely not the biggest culprit. It's probably just being overweight and unhealthy-ish in general.I use the nuvaring and everything is normal with it, but I don't know how it would be without bc.. probably a hot messI lived in London for 6 years, and the gym I belonged to had TVs built into the treadmills. It was awesome. I didn't workout that hard but it made the time go fast... I can't stand watching tele on a small screen but thanks for the suggestion.I kept my pledge yesterday :) Thank you so much! It is a small but strong step towards my goal!I live in England and most of the television i watch is on the internet so i can't really do that but thanks for the suggestion anyways.I once fixed a whole in the wall at my gym got free shit for a year I'm not interested in getting much bigger as muscles go. For now it has no benefit job or health wise, as I already run daily so cardiovascular health is fine, and I stretch so my back muscles are also in good shape. That and I work everyday for 14 hours, so when I say I haven't got time for strength training I mean I've got about 30 minutes of free time a day I'd rather spend doing low impact exercise like running or stretching. Hello, thank you so much for replying.

I have been through what you described. There have been times where I've felt I need to throw up what I ate because it was so excessive. It is a horrible feeling. 

I will take your advice and find out the calories of fast food whenever I feel like ordering and eating it. One thing I did yesterday was block all the take-out websites on my browser and re-direct them to MFP. I think that will help.

Thanks for your support!That's shitty advice. See someone else. I go to a psychologist and have a separate doctor give me meds but I keep them both updated on what the other is saying/doing so it works well together. I'm more of an inside sort of person so I'm not really right for running outside, plus I don't like people judging me and it would feel like everyone looking at me would be. Also I can't keep myself paced properly when im running outside and I stop running far to easily' i find its better for me if i can just hit 6mph and just do that for 10 mins. Thank you for the suggestion anyway.Thank you so much! &lt;3Thank you! &lt;3Hello, and thank you for replying!

I started using MFP yesterday and I love it, I find it extremely useful, I think it will help me a lot to keep control of what I eat. 

I don't have any hobbies right now. I kinda lost interest in everything when I became so depressed, but I want to make exercising a daily activity that entertains me, helps me stay healthy, and also helps with depression itself. It will require a lot of discipline, but I'm determined.

Thank you for your kind words and feel free to PM too :)Use it as a realisation. The whole life is short motto and what not. It should spur you on to be as happy and healthy as you can beI haven't used Zombies Run! yet, but I'm half way through the Zombies Run 5K app. It's really fun, it makes me want to run more, I'm sad I have to take days off in between the runs. I can't wait to complete the 5k app so that I can start running with the regular app. I just bought new runners today. 
Oh, and apparently it also works on treadmills, but I still think outside running is way better. 

Two years ago I tried to get into running with a different c25k app and lost interest some weeks in, the story of zombie run really helps! 

edit: you can also check out /r/runner5 and /r/runner5k two subs about that app. 
I gained weight on sertraline but only because it didn't work for me and made me feel depressed when I never had been before (was given it for anxiety). I had no desire to do anything and my life was work, food, and sleep.. six months later my jeans didn't fit lol. So glad to be off of ssris.From a woman's perspective, I think she looks awesome in both pics. But weight is extremely personal, and everybody has their own goals. Looking good, dude! You look great! :DIt's not really worth it. I tried that with my anxiety until I was having daily panic attacks. It's a year later and three different meds and a therapist later, but it's finally improving. It was impossible for me to really deal with lifestyle changes on top of the anxiety and panic but now it all works together and I feel better.Soup! I have soup every day for lunch. Thai chicken curry, or chicken tortilla soup, or potato bacon (lower in cals than one would expect), etc. Or a big salad with roasted veggies and quinoa. And tonight we're having tacos with refried beans and tvp (textured vegetable protein - way, WAY lower in cals and fat than ground beef) with all the fixings. Go on Pinterest and look up "low cal dinners" - tons of ideas. SquatsSounds bogus to me. 500 calories is a lot of energy. That's 42% of my daily caloric goal and the entire deficit I'm try to make in my weight loss. That's the equivalent of me jogging for 45 min but I can do it without even noticing? Doesn't make sense. I'm going to notice when I have to expend that much energy in a short period of time. This line "So dont expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight." Also seems to be a red flag. I wouldn't be surprised if this product comes with a recommended diet to optimize results. Don't follow the diet? Than you haven't used the product properly and don't have a case for false advertising/non-results. I also imagine it's very uncomfortable which will prevent people from being able to "use it properly"."Oh no it's the cops! And a construction worker?" Just a quick recommendation: 1200 a day is really low when you're beginning. When your body is accustomed to, say, 2500+ calories a day, going to 1200 is stressful to your system causing you to get overly tired and lose the willpower to keep going. 

Depending on your height and weight, it might be better to start with around 2000 calories a day while incorporating exercise and then work your way down to 12-1300 over a few months.Thanks, I'll try this! I think there's an app which is a "run from zombies" kind of story that you can listen to while you run to make it more fun. It's called "Zombies, Run!" I don't have it nor used it myself but if anyone has used it they could chime in. For solids, always use grams. 

For liquids, either will be very accurate (making sure you're using a proper measuring cup though). From a mans perspective I've no idea why on earth you'd want to lose another 11lbs. You look great and I'd personally focus on trying to develop some performance goals now rather than keep slashing calories to end up skinny instead of lean.My $15 scale has worked just fine too. It's not necessary to spend more (though the bells and whistles of other scales may be nice to have)Is your rice cup maybe instead telling you how much raw rice to use to end up with 1 cup cooked rice? 

You should be able to pick up baking measuring cups at the dollar store. 200 Day Streak on MyFitnessPal today. Definitely the longest I've kept it up. I may not have always logged everything or stayed under my goal everyday, but I've actively made watching/being aware of my calories a habit and that's what is important.Based on your numbers, you were aiming for a 300-500 calorie/day deficit? If you managed to attain a 500 calorie/day deficit without *any* days that go over 1400, then you would have lost a pound a week. 

So if you're hovering between 1400 and 1600 plus once a week going not just over 1600 but over your TDEE (and you don't specify by how much), I'm not sure why you were still expecting 1lb per week loss. You might be able to eek out 1/2 lb per week at best in that situation honestly and again - depending how much you were over by you could be back to no weight loss. 

Couple this with what /u/Murf_ says - your TDEE given by calculators are just an estimate - so yours could very well be 1800 or even 1700. 

No add on top of that... just how accurately are you measuring every thing you're eating? Are you measuring the oil used in cooking? Are you measuring the cream and sugar in your coffee? Are you measuring every condiment and sauce you eat accurately? Any errors are going to cut into the caloric deficit you though you created. 

Increase the accuracy of your calorie counting, lower your caloric goal to a hard 1500 max and stick to it 7 days a week - not just 6. If you want a 'cheat' day then lower the caloric intake the other days. I am bulimic. Mostly recovering through regular therapy sessions. I was prescribed topamax and Wellbutrin. Apparently they are a popular combo for people with compulsive behavior issues.When I started my journey I had been fat for so long. I knew how to fix it, and that is what I ended up doing, so for me it was not ignorance that kept me fat. My lovely husband tried to nugde me in the right direction, I had help from outside, nothing helped.

The thing that worked for me was when I managed to get my head in the right space. I do not know even now 9 monts later why it worked this time and not earlier, but I was ready. I changed my eating and started running.

I have tried many times before too lose this weight, and like so many before I have given up and shot back up. I am now the lightest I have been since I was around 16, and i KNOW it will stick. 

What could my SO have done? I do not know, but I know he tried and failed. I needed to want this for myself. 
&gt; I try to compliment him on any weight loss I notice

I know if my SO had told me that, I would almost want to spite him, complement on other things. Like you look good today, that shirt suits you!

Unless you can make sure he never eats anything you havn't prepared for him, he needs to do this himself. Support him even if he does not want to do it your way. If he wants to focus on something else, encurrage that. 

If you want to try to make him eat better do not say: "Look hon, that is low calories, why do you not order that?" Rather something like, "Oh, that looks soo good, I think I will have that" Do not focus on it if he doesn't want to. 

Sorry about the ramblingThis is the only thing you can do to make running fun. Treadmills are absolutely the most boring thing in the world. Go outside, get fresh air, hear the birds chirping, see other people, be alone in your thoughts while out there. It's a good time just to get away from it all.Log, log, log -- even if you stop following the food program because of your crisis, log.   

I've been down this road a number of times: Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Low-Carb, Rotation Diet ... each worked (for a while).  Each program involves logging food -- and I'd get to this point where I felt like, okay, I understand my food now. "I've got this." And I'd continue but drop the logging.  Within a few weeks, the entire effort dies.  

So, of course, I'm logging again with this try but I looked back on those other tries and realized that it was the logging that made them work and dropping the logging made it quit.  This is day 216.  "I've got this" again.  I obviously know how to eat correctly to lose weight.  But I won't quit logging, not now and not a year from now, not five years from now.  

Logging is the thing that keeps awareness in my effort.  Awareness is the key ingredient to control.  If I'm having a crisis like you are, I'll eat whatever food comes whenever it comes because I don't have time or strength or care for control.  I will log it (which takes no time, I'm really practiced at it by now) and keep going.  I'll take my control when I can, and not worry at all about control when I can't.  My control will still be better here and there and will be entirely back as soon as the crisis is passed. 

So, my advice is to log.  Log like nothing else matters.  It's not magic, and it's not physiological, its psychological.  Awareness, then control. Found one on my knee. Turns out it's my IT band. It's misguided at best. 

I'm guessing that the "aim" is to achieve cryolipolysis, which is a procedure performed (I think) by a physician where they take a vacuum device, place it against your skin, and it brings a chunk of skin in there (say, your love handles).

When the skin is in there, it's introduced to cold temperatures. The device works in such a way that it doesn't give you frostbite, but chills your fat, it also restricts bloodflow from entering that area for the duration of the treatment. After a few treatments, you lose fat and weight because the fat breaks down. 

Treatments usually take about an hour. It's also quite expensive.

According to a number of studies (goto google scholar and have a look for "cryolipolysis weight loss"), the procedure actually works. 

***

Unfortunately, this vest will not do shit other than make you cold and possibly give you frostbite. The guy doesn't even use good "before and after" photos. He has a quote from a guy who went from the 300s to the 200s, and then posts a picture of a relatively skinny guy and then a girl who definitely look like they're purposely sticking out their guts. Unless one of these models are about 7 foot - 8 inches, then I call bullshit, or the seller is a charlatan who can't even write a decent kickstarter brief.

(Please upvote OP's post so that others can see the discussion behind this gimmick. Someone will inevitably stumble upon this and buy one unless they're educated on the topic).phew, as a keto-er, I would be only able to eat half of this (meat +veggies) anyway :) And to be clear, it was a splurge, it was just about twice what I would eat for a normal dinner instead of 4 times lol
The logic is sound - your body does use quite a few calories to keep you warm but we have no way to verify their claims that it would burn 500 calories in 2 hours but I suspect that to be a gross exaggeration. 

Every once in a while, someone posts that drinking ice water causes your body to burn more energy - which again is true since your body does spend energy to warm up the water to maintain your body temperature. *But* (and it's a really big but) if you sit down and do the math - which I did once - drinking the recommended 8 glasses of water as ice water instead of tap water when the math was done worked out to only an additional about 80 calories per day (sorry can't remember the exact, definitely under 100 calories, can redo the math if interested). 

So based on the ice water math, I highly doubt that 2h of this vest could burn 500 calories. 

Further, even if this vest burned 500 calories per day, does that teach you how to eat well for life, or do they expect their users to wear the vest for the rest of their lives? Any temporary change will only ever give temporary results. 

Edit: a letterThis post is especially for you. When I started doing this mindful, circuit-breaker method, I used to binge like you did.  Like everything else, it's a practice -- the first attempts won't be as good as the well-practiced occasions later.  Hope this helps you, too!Might have something to do with this http://www.livestrong.com/article/517370-taking-vitamins-and-iron-with-tea/#page=1Fixed your life after ruining 2 others. Congrats?Yep! Months in and I'm also still shocked at how few calories and how filling a decent sized, well balanced meal can be. Keep it up, OP!My exercise is walking. At my fastest, it is a moderate 3.5 mph but 90% of the walks are at a good 3.0 mph clip -- a 20 minute mile. At my peak, it is 5 times a week at 60 minutes each.

My resting heart rate was between 85-90 before I started.  At my peak, my resting rate got to 55-60.  Even now, its winter and the ground is snow covered, I'm getting out about 3 times a week and my resting rate is 60-65.  

A little mild exercise goes a long way for the heart!It had a lot of carbs the difference is I ordered steak fajitas instead of ground beef quesadillas and I ate most of the refried beans but left the rice for meal 2I have a friend at work who was complaining about her weight and I casually mentioned how well calorie counting has worked for me and she looked at me like I'd grown a second head. Well I've lost a bunch of weight so clearly it works...It's okay. I forgive him. Yeah, it sucks, but life's not fair and everybody makes mistakes. It's hypocritical to judge. 

btw it's pretty easy to kill people with a car even if you're not drunk.Hey, whatever works. I just rather blow money on video games than running shoes when I have perfectly good normal shoes.He blames his job for the weight; A job which he also claims he loves. He works anywhere from 60-100 hours a week in construction management. He hasn't had a raise or bonus since he started,  so that in itself is pretty demoralizing.  Since he took this position two years ago, I've watched the scale go up. The job has put a lot of stress on him, our relationship, and life in general. When stressed/depressed he turns to food. But, he refuses to change jobs because he thinks there is huge gain to be had in the long term. He makes very bad eating decisions and blames convenience or too busy to do anything more. He'll skip meals, order two sandwiches instead of sandwich and salad, etc because he says he's got be be on the road or job and doesn't have time to sit down and eat.I must admit I'm a spender when it comes to gadgets. I spent money on an aria scale and a fitbit, and on top of that a cheap scale for food.If you're losing right now, you have to remember that once you do reach your goal weight you can actually back off a little on how aggressive you have to be. Not too much or it'll creep, but losing weight is hard and takes a lot of focused effort. Maintaining is actually much easier (if your activity stays the same).ScamLet's give them the benefit of the doubt (this is the internet, we can believe whatever) and assume they're an empathetic human being - in which case, they definitely think every day about the lives they ruined. 

What do you expect them to do about it? Kill themselves? Well, I don't think OP's life is worth any less than the people they killed. Those guys deserved to live long, fulfilling lives, and so does OP. 

Every life is sacred, and completely writing somebody off due to mistakes they made is exactly the kind of bullshit people are pulling when they fat-shame. Yeah obviously there are degrees of seriousness here, but the underlying fallacy is the same. It's hypocritical - everybody makes mistakes.

Let's try and keep this place welcoming and encouraging.I started counting my pounds in terms of kilocalories, it makes me feel like I'm doing more when I look at my stats :-)
When I'm doing weights it also reminds me that just because I didn't lose anything this week doesn't mean I didn't lose fat, I can look down and still see a difference.I said together because I can't constantly be eating Taco Bell or cooking fried food at every meal, when he obviously needs to eat too. But ultimately I guess you're right, of he wants it bad enough, he'll ignore what I do in favor of a healthy decision.If it seems too good to be true, if is. There are no quick fixes in weight loss that are sustainable Drop your calories a little more? Increase protein? Drop sugar/carbs? These are all questions because I really don't know. Your current progress looks great, but I know what it's like to juuuuuuust want to take a little more off. Keep doing what you're doing, maybe it's just a plateau and you need to power through it! I'm guessing that with only spending 6 months in prison for killing 2 people, you spend a lot of time watching your back for friends and family of the deceased?I don't have kidsMy question exactly! I thought I was the only one struggling to sign up. My phone won't allow me. If you happen to find out, I would appreciate some help. Vice versa, of course. I don't have a phone to begin with, but that sure sounds fancy. My $15 scale is like the only money I've put towards losing weight, aside from new, smaller clothes.Good luck!! That festival looks amazing! Do NOT get a fancy coffee beverage with whipped cream. Already talked myself out of it once today...just need to do that all day. 

Lol and the more you lose the easier it is to keep it off, sitting down just isn't comfortableI'm not sure about more fun, but I find the time goes faster when I do intervals, or use my heart rate monitor to make sure I'm in the correct heart rate zone for my workout. 

I like watching tv while on a treadmill (as long as it's the tv right in front of me, or I tend to go sideways and fall off), but I find I get distracted (obviously) and don't pay as much attention to the stuff I need to, like heart rate and making sure I'm working hard enough. My elbows have always been extremely pointy and bony no matter how fat I have gotten. Is it a thing for meat/fat to go there on some people? There was a scale I would've loved to pick, but it was way too expensive for me: it connected with your phone using bluetooth, and if you gave it the name of the thing you were weighing (for example, raw chicken) it automatically added proteins and calories and the like to your MFP.Omg I thought I was the only one. I had been chubbier my whole life! I was like "how the f- do skinny people sit for long periods of time?" ... still not used to it but it's not a bad problem to have :)You could watch netflix on a phone/tablet. My gym has tvs on all the treadmills, which is really nice for relieving boredom.Run outsideSame with me! When I'm standing or laying down now I'll absentmindedly sort of tap/bounce my wrists off my hip bones just because they're there.

Then again, it's also made me realize how much extra bulk (you could say fat too haha) is really still on my frame :-/The pain in the morning after workout is indeed sweet. 

It makes me wake up with a smile, knowing that I have grown. That I have made progress. :-) TDEE is just an estimate and can vary according to the person and situation. If your weight is not moving you either need to eat less or move more. 

It's also worth going over your tracking with a fine-toothed comb - MFP values can be very funky. Don't discount cooking oil, alcohol, etc. Be pessimistic when tracking.

OP, do you account for oils when frying your food or in your salads?only semi-relevant, but you reminded me of on of my favorite quotes:

http://anniesiskwrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ghost-4001.jpg
My commitment for the next 24 hours is to research nutrition and motivate myself to want to eat healthy - as opposed to willing myself to eat healthy because I know it's the right thing to do. This right here is my biggest hurdle. I understand I should eat healthy, but I don't truly WANT to for some reason.I wish somebody would have told me sooner. This is like the best kept secret everThat is so awesome! haha I hope to have this happen to me! :DPita pizza.  One pizza can be made for a little over 200 calories if you buy the right ingredients.  I guess I should be happy for you, but seeing you killed 2 people while intoxicated makes me not like you. Sorry. Good if you turned your life around, but 6 months was probably not enough time for you. If he is no longer a threat than what objective good does imprisonment accomplish? 

I suspect you just want to see someone suffer, not see a benefit in the situation, as indicated by your wishing him to get stomach cancer. 

How pious and moral of you.I think one important thing is to **not pressure him into eating things he doesn't want to**. Not even a little bit.

You may currently structure some of your activities around food: cooking and eating together, going out to eat, etc.  This is very natural, as you may want to share eating experiences with him. However, as someone who is naturally thin, you may underestimate just **how** difficult it is to plan and maintain a diet under the best circumstances, even without having to concede calories due to outside forces. 

So please just don't do anything to undermine his diet. Be considerate about what things might undermine his diet without meaning to. This includes giving him food, insisting on eating the same foods as him, suggesting a bottle of wine with dinner, wanting to go out to eat, etc.as a society, as a specie, we need rehabilitation to work. otherwise we're all just going to end up as type two psychopaths. ever seen "the road"? horrifying.No, I don't think I'd be seeking revenge. 

If he can be reasonably deemed no longer a threat to society than he should be released. He has quit drinking and has lost weight, they could put a breathalyzer ignition in his car before they consider imprisonment. 

His intent was not to harm people so I do not think he possess an innate trait which makes him a danger to the public. 

My family has been effected by the malicious acts of others, I still don't feel as though that means they should be imprisoned for their entire life. Don't be so presumptuous.  

&gt;How do you know he is no longer a threat to society?

Can you demonstrate that he still is? He has quit the activity which endangered himself and others. Putting someone in a cell for the rest of their life is rarely a reasonable solution. 

What good does ruining another person's life do for society? Shall we lash thieves as well? 

Yeah, I'd say this. Probably the other car's fault but he got slapped with a DUI.I feel worse than before when it comes to my appearance.

I am healthier and can get back to my old athletic lifestyle but now I have loose skin on my abdomen, hips, ass and a bit on my thighs and pelvis. 

Quite honestly I despise how I look now except for my face. I hope my skin will improve on it's own significantly over the next couple years but as of now I am quite depressed about it. I am 20 years old and have the skin of an old man, I loathe myself for ever allowing my life to get so out of hand and I feel cheated because I will never have the body that I want no matter how hard I work. I question the extent to which someone can ignore appearance and often feel like I am going to be alone for the rest of my life, either due to the revulsion of others or my own disdain for myself. 

Realistically it isn't that bad, if it still bugs me I'll have surgery to remove the skin form my abdomen and hips but I am not fond of that idea or reaching that point. I try to focus purely on the objective goals I've met. I am faster and healthier now. I am going to work on lean gains for now.

I am 6ft. 6in. and went from 340lbs to 255lbs in under 6 months if anyone is curious. My understanding is that I will see my skin at it's worst due to the rapid loss but eventually it will recover to the same point it would have if I lost slower, at least I hope so. I hope to reach 210-220lbs by the end of summer. 

I don't see a difference in my appearance other than my face. 
I think Subway is my favorite restaurant.  I go there usually 4-5 times a week.  I usually get either the oven roasted chicken or ham and egg white with no cheese, add brown mustard.  I used to get baked chips but they honestly do nothing for me other than make me want another bag.  Great job on sticking to it!How do you know he is no longer a threat to society? Because he lost some weight and stopped drinking for a year?

I don't know what world you're living in, but I am uncomfortable with people drinking and driving, killing multiple people and getting a slap on the wrist. I suspect you'd feel differently if it was your family OP mowed down while drunk.No, I suppose some people support attonement and giving a person a second chance.What is the point in being in prison if he is no longer a threat to society other than your warped sense of justice? 
Eggs are great, nuts and legumes also but nuts are high in calories so eat them sparingly. Some vegetables have a surprising amount in them considering they are veggies! Spinach, broccoli - it won't be where you get your full amount from but every little helps! Milk and dairy although can be calorific, especially cheese, so watch them... I'll try to think of more but there was a brilliant post on /r/1200isplenty the other day with a vegan day which had plenty of protein in it :)Hi! You and I seem to be in the same place right now with weightloss (5'4" SW:242 CW:198 Started losing this summer).

Do you feel the need for bread, cheese, and sweets in one day? Normally I have a day of eating some portion of all of these 1-2 a week but usually I would rather have a larger amount of veggies/fruit or a fattier meat with those calories.

I also have generalized anxiety but not manifested as OCD. I calorie count religiously 6 days a week and give myself my busiest day as "eat smart and don't worry about it". I would rather wean myself off of MFP slowly when I reach my goal and can maintain without counting than hinder my weightloss.

Typically the morning for me is coffee and maybe a protein drink, lunch is stir fry veggies and fruit, dinner is chicken/fish/lean beef with veggies and a healthier carb (sweet potato, wild rice, whole grain bread), and I do sometype of dessert a few times a week (banana bread, smoothie, protein shake, sugar free pudding, etc.)

Good luck!Just being honest, you should be in jail for a long time and perhaps the rest of your life.

I hope you think everyday about the lives you ruined.Fat free 1/2&amp;1/2. It has fewer carbs than skim milk and to me it tastes better. If I feel the need for sweetener I add Stevia.M 27 5'10'' SW: 305 CW: 235 GW: 180? I don't really have a goal... just want to be more comfortable with myself.



ANYWAY! I was at 290 pounds when I went and met a bunch of new people. Met a really nice girl, who was then and is still completely out of my league. I didn't do anything about it, but I thought to myself, I don't want to be able to think anyone is out of my league, but I can understand why someone like her wouldn't care about me if I don't care about myself.  I started Keto the next morning. That was in November. So that was my first aha moment about getting serious about weight loss. Then about a month and a half in, I realized I was mentally a lot healthier on keto and I decided I do not plan on stopping this even after I'm at my goal. I'll up my intake and eat at maintenance, but it's not a diet for me anymore. 



The girl in question is now a friend of mine but I don't see anything happening romantically there.. Shux. I did learn last time I hung out with her that she browses /r/keto which is insane to me because she is tiny and I know for a fact she has no qualms about eating a bunch of cookies...It was truly is a relief to discover I loved working out so much. I worried I wouldn't like it or I feared the pain. Not the case at all, I relish the pain.  Every morning I wake with the ache of a hard work out from the day before it taked everything I have not to skip work and do it all again.I'm eating 1660 calories a day (because that's what MFP recommended for me) and I'm losing more than 1lb a week! It depends on your build and then number of calories you were eating before I guess. I'm F/21/5"8 and my starting weight was 204lbs. I've lost 11lbs in 5 weeks eating at 1660 and it didn't feel like a difficult change to make. I'm sure the calories will have to get a bit stricter as my weight comes down but for now it's working for me!There are couple of things I look forward to consistently these days. Exercise is one of them. 

I teared up a bit while writing this. I think its my body's way of thanking me.  MFP suggests nutrition goals. Being healthy isn't just about burning calories; it's about a healthy intake of nutrients that are in proportion with each other. You should aim to reach but not exceed the nutrition goals provided. If you go over or under by a little bit every once in a while, that's not a huge deal, but there is more to being healthy than having a lower calorie intake and utilizing the nutritional goals on MFP is a great way to familiarize yourself with that. I have a measuring jug that does several measures, and on it they have both American and UK cup sizes which differ dramatically. I never knew it either, but it was interesting to see!No reason to stop fapping!! Anyway! I can attest from experience and playing too much EQ / WoW in Highschool that you're making the right choice!  Far better now than in college when you really want to enjoy the world.I'm the same height as you and was almost the same weight when I started just over a month ago. 

I use MFP to count my calories and it said I should eating around 1,200, I also exercise about 3-4 weeks. I have started to lose weight and I'm sure you will to. Hello, I've browsed this forum for about a day before deciding to join. I actually stumbled a bit into wanting to lose weight, it's been something at the back of my head for a while. 

I'm R (F), 22, and I'm 5'11 and weigh anywhere around 90-100kg (I don't own a scale, but will head to my parent's next week and borrow theirs). Last time I weighed myself this summer I was 92kg/203lbs, borderng obeese if you believe BMI is accurate. My (ultimate) goal weight is about 72kg (160lbs), which I haven't weighed since before I was fully grown! In 2013 I lost a bunch of weight and was around 84kgs for a while, but then life changed, and I gained again. That time I didn't actively start trying to lose weight, it kind of just happened, but now I need to actively make that choice because as I said: life is different. 

I've kept track of my calorie intake, and  try to make it to the gym 2-3 times a week (mostly cardio). I'm a week in (or week 3 on exercise), and I'm already feeling a lot better. I feel positive about this. Since my goals are less number oriented and more health/feeling better there is less of a pressure to perform well, which has been my downfall a lot of times before.Ya you'll be fine, your skin hasn't been at its current stage for that long either.What does "vigorous" dieting mean and what is your training like? It's true that you can do a body recomposition where you eat maintenance calories and just exercise to build muscle while losing weight (however both are at a slower rate but at least you're gradually looking better), but if your program or workout routine sucks, it'll get you no where.

Id recommend bulk. It is far easier for most people to lose weight than build muscle. Eat a lot. And get on a program that focuses on big compound lifts, like SS, SL, ICF.Wow what a great turn-around, just be mindful as you go into maintenance mode, don't let old habits creep back! I think best thing to remember is 1lb is approximately 3500 calories.  Even huge binges usually don't get too terribly close to that number on a single given day. 

So, even if you have what you thought was a good day yesterday and then hop on scale and has a number you weren't expecting, don't worry, you didn't go super crazy on calories to gain 3 pounds in one day. The converse is true, if you had a day that got out of control with eating, you probably didn't eat 1 extra lb (3500 calories!) worth of food to cause the scale to fluctuate. Water weight is usually what you see (especially after very salty foods).

So i guess mainly, don't be discouraged, look at loss over time and try to stick to your plan!Exactly - There is huge doubt about the links between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol.

Not to mention your bog-standard cholesterol test is fast becoming outdated too.I'm at a plateau right now and it sucks. I lost 10 pounds last month. 11 Days into this month with no dietary changes from last month and I have not dropped a single pound. I have, however, increased my workout intensity, so I assume I am holding onto water-weight, but still its trying on my motivation to see the scale not budge even a 1/10th of a pound. 

From what I have read, plateaus will always pass as long as you are consistent and honest with your counting. *terrified shrieking*When I started, getting even this far seemed like a possibility, and to be honest, a part of me still believes that I won't get to the end. I have to break it up into smaller goals or it would be too overwhelming to try to achieve.Yeah, that's the one that people always ask me about. The reason I cut out rice is because I eat a lot of potatoes. Sooo many potatoes, that I really don't need the carbs or calories from rice. I suppose if you aren't eating a metric shit ton of potatoes, then you could probably eat some rice too and still have the same results.Man it really wasn't! I would let it go on for about 9-12 weeks, but anything longer made me really run down, so I would go to the doctor and get medication to stop it. I would take it for 3 weeks, have the heaviest and worst period of my life after, then one regular period, and then it reverted back to the 3 month thing. It made me miserable, and all I wanted was to take it all out cause I was so exhausted.

Now I feel like a different person! I love knowing that it's going to be gone in a few days, and that I don't have to dress like I'm going to a funeral for the next 3 months!This post has too little content  **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Floseit&amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2vmyao/does_it_matter_if_you_go_over_your_fat_on_mfp_if/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

As you suggest you're at a disadvantage for the actual contest but a big advantage for actually succeeding in real, long-term life which is far more important.No it's which serving size measurement to fall back on if they don't line up. It's not always cups, and in fact many of the foods I see just say one piece or one package.Body dysmorphia is a bitch :( I'm weighing daily right now but I'm kind of aware from reading here that it can go up and down. It's interesting what a difference it can make when I'm feeling a little bit dehydrated and I weigh myself and see I'm 0.5-1k lighter than the day before.

I think over time I will get bored of doing it every day and do it less often. It's just super important to know it's there to see that what I'm doing is working.Oh wow.

The realisation that half portion of a 'healthy option ' in a restaurant can be 900 kcal...A bad day won't undo all your hard work now! Do NOT give up! You are an inspiration to ME to have actually lost weight and also been going hard at the gym! I am nearing the end of my second day and wanted to binge so badly but I came and saw your post and it has inspired me to stay on track! You can do it!!!  
    
Remember if you gave up now, gained it all back and tried to lose weight in a few months time you would look back to this day and kick yourself. Tomorrow you'll be wishing you started yesterday! So you just realised that cups is a very poor way to measure anything. Grams and milliliters don't lie.I'm guessing that it was the kind of situation that could've happened even if not intoxicated. Maybe the accident wasn't his fault but he got sentenced anyway for being intoxicated? Just a guess.Awesome thanksHaha, know that feeling of people telling you shit. For years I thought I'd have to never eat meat again, start juicing every vegetable in the world and never even think about pizza.

Admittedly though, that's kinda on me. I never really get too "Oh I should've started forever ago" because I know I wasn't really too ready. If I was, I would've found this all out myself before I did. I could've just googled and found the information I needed, but I didn't want to. I kept "It'll be too hard" up as a protective barrier. Congrats on your progress, but I gotta ask:  how are you NOT still in prison?  Obviously, you're rehabilitating and there's lots of hope for you, but I would think that killing 2 people because of driving under the influence would warrant a lot more than 6 months incarceration.This could not have come at a better time. Gotten back in to losing weight after numerous strings of failure. By the end of this, if all things go well, I should be extremely close to my goal weight!  
  
Wishing everyone the best of luck!Ugh, seriously! This actually kinda makes me mad. People go on and on about how hard it is, and just always believed them. 

Yes, it is hard if you do it hard core right away. But if you ease into it (like everything other damn thing in life) it's not that bad. Obviously, generally speaking. 

If anyone, anyone at all, had told me just eating better would work on its own, I'd have done it forever ago. But no, everyone made me think I had to crash diet, I had to kill myself at the gym, and I had to never eat a carb agin if I wanted to get fit. 

Bullshit. 

I cut down on my calories and walk sometimes. Yay new body! I guess I'm just bitter that I could've done this years ago but didn't because I was terrified of how hard it would be and that my life would be miserable. Wow thanks. I didn't know it was that different, since looking at the cup looks very much like a cup, however from what I've learned it's less than half of a standard cup.Calculate your BMR using an online calculator and use that as your base rate. Mine has oz, grams, pounds, and ml. I wasn't sure if fluid ounces and the ounces in a pound were totally interchangable. And thank you, I needed to know which one to fall back on. Green tea (well, caffeine) is a stimulant and stimulants suppress appetite.  Just my guess.&gt; To be Normal I'd have to be low to a weight I can't consider healthy for myself. 

I mean, have you tried it?
DID YOU FUCKING MORONS MISS THE PART WHERE HE KILLED 2 PEOPLE? I HOPE YOU GET PAINFUL STOMACH CANCER AND DIE VERY VERY SLOWLY.Great going! I had a similar moment recently :)thanks for your advice.

I have been diagnosed with OCD so it's on my medical record. But I've also been told it's actually general anxiety disorder since it doesn't manifest as obsessive actions. But in that case I wish she would tell me that's the reason because I have had therapy for it and have no intentions of contracting an eating disorder on top of everything else.

Like I said lately I've been eating more junk food or street food like falafel although I try to avoid outright garbage like potato chips and chocolate bars etc. If I buy pastry I buy it in limited quantities so I don't just go to town on the box. Etc. 

You're right that we all have blind spots. This diet is just hard for me to implement. Maybe I should force myself to do it anyway but the reason I was successful with calorie counting is that I wasn't "forcing" it...That's what this sub is all about-- Support. I'm glad I found it as well, glad it's here and glad it will continue to be here.

I'm nearing 40 of my 120 lbs to lose, and that's just from my first goal weight. Patience is a serious virtue. 75lb gone, and I'm still like "Can't believe it was this simple all a long"Thanks for your advice. Actually part of the reason I wanted to go to a dietitian was to get a better estimate of how many calories I should be eating to make sure I don't undereat. Maybe I should target 1500 instead. Rice cooker measuring "cups" are different from US cups, due to historical/traditional reasons. That's probably why measuring with it gives you a weird amount. :)

http://www.usarice.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=74All right, more NSV for me. 
I realized my NSVs are a bit arduous when they are actually occurring! This ain't easy! And getting to post them here is like a consolation prize. :)

Grumpy now. Tired. Long day. Car in shop, had to ride bike to and from work. Means another step into being more active. Getting active again, like I always was, prior to that adrenal fatigue and sedentary lifestyle that hit me about 2 years ago. Really starting to feel it as a lifestyle, this being active--not something I am doing temporarily until I reach a goal. This is a good reframing of my thought patterns. It is really starting to sink in deeper now. This is not a sprint, it's a marathon. With cool people trudging alongside me. (Including you.)

Was about 1000 cal deficit at end of workday. Ravenous (!!!!!), wanted nice sweet yummy sandwich from coffee house, NOW!! So, I thought, I could eat just about any sandwich at 1000 cal deficit prior to bike ride home! But then, how would I log that, in my food log? God knows exactly how much of what they would put in it, to make it tasty. And so I ended up eating my pre-measured broccoli &amp; lentils from work fridge, before getting back on the bike to go home. More pleasant ride that way, when not starving/bonking. 

Got home, hungry. Not entirely trusting FitBit calorie totals, so have been trying to come in each day under budget. Just in case. Logged smoothie and skipped drinking half of it cause it turned out kinda gross. Then did more hooping in my living room, just to make damn sure I didn't gain weight today. Ended up at about 750 deficit according to FitBit (which thinks I drank the whole smoothie, and I think it also underestimates my exercise on the bike). I guess I'm in the clear. I mean, something good has to be happening here, right?? Am definitely more active, eating way less sloppily, than I was Before FitBit. As soon as I have time to get to gym (which is where the scale is) I'll do my first updated weigh in. 

TL/DR:  too grumpy to write one, grrrrrr!! but rambling makes me feel better; so please skip if uninterested. Breakfast I usually have a smoothie made from kale, berries and almond milk, plus a slice of wholemeal toast with butter.

Lunch is usually some sort of stew or soup but always with chick peas or lentils - something with protein.

Dinner, again protein, maybe an omelette, fish, tofu or cheese with lots of veg.

I also eat fruit as snacks - apples, mandarins, grapes.
I sometimes eat some rice or couscous alongside veg.
A glass of wine about three times a week...

It all sounds scarily healthy now that I write it down but, mostly it's what I like to eat. I might sometimes want a creamy pasta dish, or some chips, or a bag of crisps. So I have a small portion and then reduce something else to reach my calorie goal.

Hi, I'm captain obvious, and you're on reddit, and this is my comment.Hear hear. You want to help him, and that's great, but this is something he needs to do for himself. I'm a bit late to this party, but no, it absolutely does not have to be 1200. I'm 5'2" and about 130lb. I've just had to tweak my calories from 1800 to about 1600 to lose. (To be fair, I am pretty active and I have a decent amount of muscle - just trying to get rid of some of the chub that's covering it up!)

But yeah, I'm a short-arse and I eat a lot more than 1200 calories. The idea of 1200 You're significantly taller than me so I expect you'd be able to eat more. 

I think the most sensible approach is to reduce calories slowly. You'll find a sweet spot where you're losing, but eating enough to keep you happy. Why restrict more than you need to?I'm going to stay under my 20 grams of carbs and 1200 calories. I'm going to understand that it's not a big deal if the scale is a tiny bit higher than yesterday. Water weight happens, and unless my numbers are consistently going up, it's not something to freak about. This is going to be my lifestyle now, and I can't live a lifestyle where I lose my mind over tiny fluctuations in numbers.Trying to stay away from nuts. I'm already at two meals and have a physically demanding job, so I'm keeping them away.Awesome--congrats!
A sweet victory, and a pretty sweet username as well!Pistachios! A lot of times I'll substitute a meal for a cup or so of these.How does one figure out how many calories they burn when they aren't exercising? Narrowest point within 1-3" inches up or down from your navel. Suck in and push out. The spot with the most difference is likely closest. Narrowest point near your navel. This part of your torso is prone to being sucked in or pushed out. You should be relaxed. The range can be 4-5" between these two. Check yourself, suck it in and push it out. Measure both. Your real waist value is between these.I can't wait until I start to have this! Thanks for renewing my strength to trudge on. :)Sometimes, we have really, really bad weeks. It has happened to probably every person who has ever tried to lose weight ever. Here's the deal, though. What happens in your eating habits is between you and (presumably) myfitnesspal/Loseitapp/the back of a checkbook you count your calories on. There's no one that's going to make snide comments, or yell at you, or judge you in any way. Your only enemy in this is you. I know, at least for me, that my worst critic is myself. If I have a bad day, I just have to distract myself. Watch a movie, read a book, take a walk. Give yourself a break from your own thoughts.A further question if I may, any benefit for drinking green tea half an hour after every meal?Anyone know how to edit this Google doc on an iPhone? My computer is currently under the weather.

I did a quick google search but came to no resultsYou need a more tests, or one authoritative one. Look at ranges for lean body mass at your height. You likely dont have that much. That is over the top for someone 2-3" taller than you. Have your tried one based on body measurements?

You didn't mention your age or sex or ethnic background. All are important.What that means is when you lose to 150, your metabolism is naturally slower than that of someone who is at 150 and never got any higher.What's worse was leaning against the wall suddenly hurt my elbows. 

I wasn't even thin..actually at the high end of overweight by bmi standards. That had to be simultaneously awesome and crappy. 

I'm having a hard time balancing drinks on my stomach nowadays. I'm going to miss it, but I'll also love not being able to. That's awesome!

But uh.... what kind of class is this... *chef*?That's what trash compactors are good for! I have a really hard time seeing it when I'm wearing clothing. I know it's the winter and I have to wear jeans/sweaters all the time, but I still feel just as big as I was last year, even though I've dropped a few sizes. The thing that really makes me feel better are my progress pictures that show how much muscle I've gained in my arms, back and stomach. These pictures help put things in perspective! Steady, steady my friend :). Good luck!I've reached the point where I plateau for over a week, then drop a pound...plateau for over a week, drop a pound. I stick to my 1200/day pretty strictly, too. It was a little frustrating at first, but like OP said, you have to trust that eating at a calorie deficit *is* going to take the weight off. All plateaus end eventually!I lose weight much faster with a higher calorie limit. If I set it too low, I go over and get discouraged. I say "oh well, guess I'll eat 6 pieces of pizza." I had it at about 1550 for a month, but now I'm at 1350, which, frankly, is probably too low. Slow and steady wins the race. You'll be just as skinny whether you lose it all in 2 months or in 2 years.Exactly! I think problems I have had in the past have been binging for ONE MEAL and giving up entirely. You can't undo a month in one day but for some reason I always give up. This time I won't be! I can see where you're coming from with that mindset, though in all honestly the actual eating itself is the biggest stressor out of all the things entailed in this for me - I would rather just see everything as numbers and hope counting the calories will get me to a place where I can actually enjoy food again and not abuse it like I have been. 

Yeah, I am admittedly incredibly impatient. The biggest problem for me is that I had hoped to enjoy my college years to make up for the hellhole that was high school, and so far it really has made me more stressed, which I honestly didn't expect. I guess the tradeoff really is that one day down the road I may actually manage to be happy for once. That is so deeply inspiring. Good work. Thank you so much for sharing. I have been doing the low carb, high protein/healthy fat eating regime and it appears to be working. As a warning scales can be deceiving; I am a big guy and I do a fair bit of exercise so my weight bounces around by about 10 pounds depending on how much water I am holding. Exercise consistently and eat well consistently and weight loss is easy! Just dont kill yourself and not exercise for a week or binge like crazy and you will be fine!  I can understand the whole "my weight basically defines me" thing, that is exactly how I've felt the last few years of my life, all on top of highschool angst and anxiety and whatnot. It sucks and that's why I wanna beat it to the punch. 

I'll work on the hobby thing, I used to do all sorts of stuff but depression has kinda rendered it all boring and unfulfilling. Hopefully I can manage to rekindle an old passion. 

I'm gonna be totally honest about the friend thing, the problem now is that I feel like nobody wants to get to know me because I'm fat, but at the same time I don't want people to try and befriend me just because I got prettier. Confidence isn't really the problem, I don't think, I'm just a very private, very introverted person and that makes it hard for me to open up enough to even begin making a friend. I suppose beggars can't be choosers though, any friend is better than none.

I will certainly try your suggestion, though the campus I live on is not the best place to walk, it's like 80% hills and my poor lower back hates that. Even walking on a treadmill is killer... I suppose I just need to take small steps and build up some strength as I go.

Yeahhh tonight I actually flat-out ended the conversation and hung up while my boyfriend was on break at work tonight because I didn't want to start spewing negativity at him again, hence this post.

Oh trust me, the rambling is appreciated. Writing stuff out is cathartic and I'm both sad and glad that there are others who can relate to me in all of this. Thank you so much for your advice and kind words!

I have ADHD. Assuming you are using the term literally -- you have been diagnosed with ADHD -- it's not an excuse. It's not different from any normal person trying to change their lives. You have to learn to pre-portion your shit. You have to plan your meals. You have to exercise self-control. You have to be able to set out a plan and stick to it. You have to have a strategy for getting the munchies. 

In short, it is not any different from a normal person. You just have an added difficulty curve. So what? You can be angry about the hand you've been dealt or you can do something about it. I keep a notebook with me at all times. It has a to-do list on every single page. I program timers into my phone to remind me about shit I have to do. I make back-up plans. 

Take it seriously and commit to it. Lost 75 lbs a few years ago. Kept it off for 2+ yrs. Life got busy and I stopped calorie counting July 2013. I was moving locale a lot without a kitchen, had less time for exercise, etc. This all came together and I gained 32 lbs from my low, most of which I didn't notice. That's when I knew this was forever. It's taken the better part of 7 months to get back to where I want to be and I'd rather log every day than sobs half the year overweight and half at where I want to beExactly!   
    
Ugh I am hoping I lose fat around my face and my huge stomach. I am not in proportion I have thin arms and a "small frame" but a large protruding stomach and double chin. I obviously know you can't spot target weight loss but I'm hoping my face thins out and my stomach deflates a bit!Thanks for such a detailed reply! I checked my TDEE &amp; BMR so I feel confident I can up my calorie intake now! Thanks for that!Read some Lyle McDonald Calories are important but just as important is what what the calories are made up of! Eating 2 mars bars per day might keep you within your calorie goal but it won't be very healthy!

PS: muscle is heavier than fat and so you might not lose any weight, you could potentially just tone up! I try really hard not to think about it as me losing weight but learning how to eat.  I want to see results, of course, but after years of not being in control of my eating I know that has to be the focus.  My TDEE is 1700~ as long as I am below that I'm losing.  Maybe not as fast as I would like, but in a manageable, sustainable way.  20 years ago I would have killed for this information and technology like MFP and support like this reddit.  Don't be like me and put off what you can do today.  You think toughing it out a few months or years is hard, try 20, lol.  There's no hurry.  The slower your loss the more likely you are to keep it off.  So you may not be where you want by 19, but you can be where you want and in a position to keep it that way by 25.  That may sound like forever from now, but it happens fast and you deserve to be healthy, and feel good in your own skin!Wow that is brilliant! Well done on that! Thank you for replying too!I scratched my collar bone the other week and was shocked at how my collar bone was poking out haha. I know the feel. It's pretty sweet. I'm kind of confused by your post - I know I'll have to alter my intake once I lose weight, but I'm talking about right now. Also, 175 is the highest I've ever been - before I started college I weighed 125 and then I gained 50 pounds over 5 years, so I don't feel like I would have the metabolism of someone who was obese (could be wrong, I guess). Rowing machines are just... ow.If you're relatively weak for your size and not very athletic, what about working on those areas in your body as a modest goal? Getting into better shape (with associated muscle building) will help your overall body composition look closer to what it sounds like you want. Not gonna lie, time really does crawl for me. I do my best to log everything, even if I'm not 100% sure of the calorie count I at least try to guesstimate. I've done all the calculating stuff more than once (I tried and mostly failed to shed some weight last October) and since the 1600cal a day was sorta working for me I thought dropping it down some wouldn't be a problem, but I suppose I should try increasing the threshold a bit. Actually I have no idea why I didn't think of that in the first place! Thank you for your input and advice, I really appreciate it. :)If I could up vote this twice, I would. Congrats!If you know when you have these ravenous cravings, plan for them! Portion out your 'big dinner' to make it smaller. Same for when you have your midnight snack. A few minor cuts means you can still eat to satisfy the hunger cravings you have. BUT you won't go over your limit if you reduce the amount a bit for both eating times.It was extremely fun, even though I can barely dance.Thank you so much! I've been following /r/loseit for a while just for the motivation because it is all so inspiring but I will definitely check out those other subreddits as well! Thanks!23F, 5'7'' and 135 here trying to get to 125. Going to be honest, it has to be less than 1200 net. Why? Adipose tissues dont die, they expand or shrink and if you were fat before your metabolism is slower compared to someone else at the same weight that was never overweight/obese. To maintain 135 for you should be roughly 1600 net calories a day. If you want to lose weight to 125 and average 1200 a day, losing 10 pounds would take roughly 3-4 months. This is not counting plateaus and stalls.  So when you get down to 140s, weight loss is extremely hard and 1200 wont event cut it.Ate about 1600 calories a day for about 4-5 months, with a couple cheat days and junk food here and there. Lost about 60 lbs in total. Also exercised but not regularly enough for it to be a factor in weight loss. It's almost 80% in your diet whether you lose weight or not.Visit your dietitian to help you with this problem. Account for the donuts. Let the MFP spike up in calories for today. But stop right now. Tomorrow, get back on track. In 4-5 days you won't even see this spike on your eating trends, and it will not hurt your progress in any major way.

You'll get those blips sometimes, and that's fine; we're all human after all. Don't let the blips slowly transform into bad habits that endure, however. *That's* when you need to start worrying.always go by weight. this is why so many people suggest getting a food scale, because the labels are wrong 99% of the time. does your scale have an option for oz? if so, weigh your fluids that way, or exchange the scale for a better one. mine does grams and ounces but not mils. 8 oz of milk = 1 cup = 240 mls.How'd you calculate that BMR (or TDEE)? That seems crazy high even if you're a highly active teenager. And if you *are* a highly active teenager, 1300 calories a day won't be enough to fuel all that activity.

Also, thinking you're gonna' drop 5.5 pounds a *week* is misguided at best, and dangerously scary at worst.You got it!  I love thinking about how heavy the 45lb plates are at the gym :)

Haha! I did this when I first started losing weight a few months ago. I was standing without a shirt on, looking in the mirror and thought I saw something weird. Lifted my arms overhead and yelled for my husband to come look, I could see my ribs! He laughed, but holy cow I was so excited!Congrats!! I can't wait until I get there and know how great it's going to feel, so I'm especially happy for you! That's a great achievement :)I am 5'9"F and I typically eat 1200Kcal/day.  That said my current monthly average is about 1360 due to the occasional dinner out to enjoy.

I also run 25-30 miles/week.

If you have large calorie deposits on your body, ie fat, it's not a big deal to eat low so long as you are careful to get the right macros, micros and fibre.

It is not so good *IMO* to eat that low when you get into the 'healthy' BMI range because presumably you don't have the physiological reserve you used to and you're getting close to maintenance anyway.

As for feeling miserable, I do get a little peckish sometimes but not overly so.  Eating 1200kcal of nutritious food is different from eating 1200kcal of candy.

My dinner tonight, that is keeping my belly sated as I write this was:

8oz julienne zucchini
8oz tomato
3oz mushroom
2oz spinach
1oz feta
1oz sliced black olives

All this pan fried in a non-stick pan with a miniscule amount of olive oil, no salt.  Sometimes I add paprika but tonight I ate it plain and it was very satisfying.

So yeah, YMMV, eat to feel good and fuel your body and make sure you get all your nutrients in before you hit the treats to make sure you stay in your calorie budget whatever that might be. :)
Yes, on one hand it's bad to focus on exercise only for the reward of eating food. That could just worsen your relationship with food and lead to nowhere productive. What happens if you eat a big meal but you *don't* run?

Here's some practical advice:

* [Go here](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) and calculate your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). Calculate what it is as *sedentary* to get a baseline. It's very easy to overestimate caloric burns from exercise, so don't fall into that trap.

* Get My Fitness Pal if you don't have it and start logging what you eat. Once you know how *much* you should be eating, this app can help you track that, monitor your intake and stay on track. Don't be dishonest with yourself or only log when you have good days; that won't help you one bit.

When you know how many calories your body needs (and the subsequent cuts required to lose weight), you won't have to feel afraid when you hit certain caloric numbers every day.You have good days, and you have bad days. Focusing on past failures won't lead to anything positive. Recognize that you're human and *will* have bad days. But move on today and the next day and so on to get back on track.

Bad days are blips on the radar. It's bad habits that show up as enduring trends. Don't let your blips turn into trends. You can do this.Hey there, I'm turning 28 soonish and I'm 5'3" and my highest weight was 209. I wish, *I wish so much,* that I had my shit together and started counting calories 10 years ago like you are now. I could have avoided nearly 10 painful years of shitty crash diets and sub zero confidence. I really allowed my weight to factor into everything else in my life, how much space I took up was always on my mind and I never educated myself on how f-ing *simple* it is to just eat less (track calories) and move a little more. 

You are there, I wish I could go back in time and be there too. I know how hard it is to see how lucky you are when everything around you seems horrible but you are in such a great spot. You can sculpt your life into something incredible. 

- Try to find a hobby, or something you can feel passionate about that can distract you. Maybe volunteer someplace interesting, you'll have a reason to be social and around potential friends.

- As the scale goes down i'm sure your confidence will most likely go up and it'll attract a few friends, it's been happening to me a lot lately and it's freaking me out. 

- Try to substitute snacking with walking, or crunches or pilates. Try to train yourself to make the jump from "I'm sad/anxious/stressed so I should eat something to feel better" to "I should go for a stroll and clear my head." Look at fitness as therapy, it's helped me get over using food as a drug. 

I know how you feel about wanting to say it all somewhere so you don't have to dump it on your boyfriend, I'm exactly the same way. My SO is my only real friend and he gets an earful as it is, so I try to not overwhelm him with how bad I feel at times. The truth is, since I've lost some weight I feel *A LOT* better than before, and I'm sure it'll get even better than this. 

So okay I just rambled a lot sorry. I feel like I'm writing a letter to my past-self. Just try and take it slow so this change will be permanent, *do not* rush you *do not* want to crash and start all over. Invest in yourself, your life just starting up and it's within your power to make it a good one. Awww don't cry!!! We all need a boost sometimes and god knows I've needed my fair share! My boyfriend brought home thin mints today and I seriously sat in the bath and cried before promptly demanding he hide them until he can take them to work to put in his break room. We are at possibly our most fragile right now, and you know what? That's okay, because we're learning to be strong in ways we never even fathomed.

I totally get how you feel. My friends back home are naturally skinny or have gained so much weight we're just not allowed to talk about anything healthy anymore. It sucks! I'm totally on my own. Anytime I try to share my weight loss with my mom it is completely brushed off because she doesn't think she's capable of change. It is really effing hard to do this alone, but we're doing it and we're making progress and learning a ton about ourselves and those around us. I choose to see this as a beautiful thing. 

If you ever need encouragement PM me :) Seriously, I could use a weight loss buddy too. And don't forget that you are a badass :)I set the goal of 30-45 minutes of cardio for my workouts depending on my day and schedule, and then when I hit whatever my goal was, I put on the song 'Aside' by the Weakerthans and push myself as hard as I can until it's over.  I don't know for sure that you'll get the reference, but given your username, it's relevant.Should read the FAQ first. It covers a lot of what you asked.Here's a little [list](http://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/why-drinking-water-early-in-the-morning-good-for-health-p214/) of the benefits of Lemon and Honey water :)Thanks for replying! I have read the FAQ a few times now but I also read on a running forum-y thing that we shouldn't be tricked into thinking we can splurge on a huge (calorie wise) meal after running. As in like is my motivation to run so I can go home and eat more? Isn't that detrimental to changing the ingrained bad habits of my over eating already? I don't know I am confused.Don't focus on the scale, focus on how you feel.  My hardest weight loss was getting from 220 to 210, and that was after losing 60 pounds that came off effortlessly.  220-210 was a GRIND where it seemed the scale stayed put for weeks.  But I came to realize that I FELT better: less pain, more energy.  I stuck with it and eventually got past it, and you can too.  Set goals for yourself in what you can do, worry about your reps/weight, perfect your motions and ignore your weight for 3 weeks.  If you stick to that, you'll come back to the scale to see a difference, or else you'll see it in yourself and the mirror.  I don't know you, but I believe in you.i understand thanks. it's probably the latter in that my tdee is 2000 and not 2500 so therefore need to eat less or exercise more. I think you should read the FAQ and educate yourself on how caloric deficits work.  That will help you make a much better plan than you have.Do you still hit a weight loss plateau by counting? That's what im doing right now. 1400 calories a day + 30min workout 5-6 days a week. I'm down 6.5lbs in a month, but I'm afraid to hit a plateau...That's so awesome!! Seriously, splurges periodically are important. You planned and you rocked it. Good job. Having lost a lot of weight quickly and gained it back, only to go about the work of losing it again, I can only tell you that if you lose a pound slowly, you're more likely to keep it off.  Losing while maintaining healthy eating habits will prepare you for a healthier life when you've reached your goal.  Eat 1500 if it's comfortable, and sneak in a 30 minute quick-walk whenever you can.  I don't know if swearing is okay in this sub, but to heck with fast.  Slow and steady, and healthy.I'm actually crying, I really needed this. I just binge ate like there was no tomorrow and just stared at my belly pregnant with all of the food I consumed tonight. My friends are largely uninvolved in healthy lifestyles (most of them are either naturally skinny or overweight with no desire to change), and my family doesn't understand why I can't just not overeat. Thank you for all of your kind words, you rock and I hope you are able to continue your journey to a healthier you There's nothing about your post that you can't change with some basic planning and willpower.

If you buy too much food at the store, buy less each time and go more often.

If you eat too much, count your calories and stop when you hit your limit.

You stop overeating by becoming aware of what's going into your body and acting in such a way that you don't eat a caloric surplus.Congratulations!  I don't think I've been a normal weight since an early teen, even at my thinnest (195, 6'1") I would have been considered overweight.  To be Normal I'd have to be low to a weight I can't consider healthy for myself.  If you're looking to put on muscle, why wait?  You'll still be burning fat by exercising, plus it's something new to keep you motivated.   Girl, you're like half way there! I have zero friends other than my SO where I live, and the friends I have in my home state do NOT want to talk about weight loss. The best thing I did for myself was become my own support system. I'm gonna seem like that crazy girl, but I talk to myself regularly. I encourage myself to make good choices when I'm grocery shopping, I tell myself to hold back when I'm staring holes into my fridge, I tell myself to go just five more minutes when I'm out power walking alone, I give myself probably 5-10 pep talks a day in front of the mirror naked. 

So you had a few bad days. I have too. But you are the only person preventing you from turning that around. Tomorrow morning, log your breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks. Log it all with a smile knowing that you're breaking the cycle, starting fresh, and taking control over your health. Forgive yourself. This is not impossible. You know that, because you've already come so far! Put a bandaid on the cut and hop back on the bike. You've got this. It's you against you in this battle. Which you do you want to win?This is going to be my last post in this thread.  You should also read the FAQ, because it doesn't seem like you're understanding what I'm saying.

You are currently eating 2000 cal per day and not losing weight.  You claim to have been doing this for two years.  There are two possibilities here:

1.  You have some kind of medical issue that's causing you to not lose weight, like a thyroid problem.

2.  For whatever reason, your body just burns 2000 calories a day.

To lose weight, you need to create a deficit.  Since you're not losing weight at 2000 calories a day, then you need to create a deficit lower than that.  Either eat less than 2000 or exercise.  If you exercise, don't eat the calories back because you'll wipe out your deficit.#####&amp;#009;

So far I've lost band size but the cup sized has stayed in proportion!  Keeping my fingers crossed.but if im on 2000 kcal a day currently and tdee is 2500 and then incorporate exercise? Sorry I sound stupid but perhaps my tdee is lower than the estimates so yeah dont eat more after exrcise?You know what to do.  You messed up, no big deal.  You're still better off then when you started and this time you have more experience to help you succeed.  You can do this!
I'm 31 and I've never heard the term decolletage before. TIL.You're young, so patience is hard and I know if time is moving slow for 38 year old me it most be killer for those younger.  You have to give the process time.  I week is not long enough, heck 1 month isn't really long enough.  I'd say you have to be willing to invest time and energy into this process for at least 3 months. That means tracking and logging everything, even on days that you overeat or binge or feel like a failure.  Just keep at it.  Figure out your TDEE and try not to go over it.  If 1400 calories is too difficult up it for a little bit.  According to this calorie calculator you should be able to eat 1600 and see results.  http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/I have always believed that diet is the key to weight loss and exercise is the key to health.  Losing weight is simply a matter of eating less calories than you consume, and you can achieve that with zero exercise.  But seeing the number on the scale plateau or go up because of workouts isn't a bad thing.  Remember that how you feel is more important than the number on the scale.  Keep doing what you're doing, and eventually you'll see the results, even if the scale doesn't.Do you have any theories as to why he's been putting on weight? Maybe he's depressed and turning to food, maybe he's changed his routine and isn't getting the usual work-out, maybe he's crunched for time at work and picking up a lot of pre-made food? There are a lot of reasons why people up their caloric intake suddenly. Try to figure out what changed, maybe it's something you can address and not his actual appearance/weight. 

If you're up for it, read through the FAQ and get acquainted with how simple it is to lose weight, especially if it's slow and gradual like 1 pound a week. Maybe he thinks losing weight means changing your life over night but it doesn't, he just needs to eat fewer calories (500 a day fewer if he wants to lose 1 pound a week, 1,000 fewer if he wants to lose 2). He can still have pizza, just maybe not the soda, **he doesn't have to throw out everything in the fridge and replace it with kale and tofu.** He can take walks instead of getting a gym membership. 

I *WISH* someone had educated me on how freakin unintimidating losing weight actually is years ago. You can start so slowly, seeing the scale go down and the clothes get loose is a great feeling and it'll motivate him to keep going, getting educated and feeling commited is the hardest part. &gt;but in my opinion, a drastic lifestyle change needs to happen, which should involve both partners to make it last. 

Why though? Single people are perfectly capable of losing weight without a romantic partner involved. If your SO wants to do this by himself without you being involved, let him. It's perfectly possible. It's a very, **very** personal journey for a lot of people. Some may want to open up and talk about it and involve others, yes, but not everyone does. It's about his habits and his body, not yours. 

I'd be pretty annoyed if my partner disrespected my boundaries too. 

Be supportive by cooking healthily if you cook for him at any point, not tempting him with high calorie foods, and being open if he does want to talk or involve you. Try to push your way in there when he doesn't want you to may make things harder for him, or push him towards giving up if he wants to keep his weight loss personal but you're not seeming to let him. I'm sure he'll tell you if he wants someone to work out with or whatnot.

If you need to compliment his appearance, tell him he's handsome or something rather than pointing out the weight loss if those comments annoy him.. a compliment shouldn't make him miffed, so if something you say is doing that then it isn't a nice compliment so why would you want to say something that upsets him anyway..Can't enjoy being able to sit comfortably in any chair in the world, butt's too bony now :/I think it's great to engage friends/coworkers in a friendly contest like this.  It's always a big motivator to surround yourself with like-minded individuals.  

My advice for you personally would be to keep it friendly.  My guess is you don't really need this contest to keep you going down your path (you would be doing it on your own anyway), because of that you're set up to be a strong voice of encouragement to your coworkers, even if they are losing more weight than you.  

Remember that the goal is for each and every one of you to build healthy habits, not to out-lose each other.  

Encourage the others and be a cheerleader.  Everybody wins.  

Since I haven't answered your question though, yes I think you have a huge advantage since you've already got a head start on your habits.  Good luck!It might, but if you're 100% sure you're not overeating, you can either eat less or move more, and you don't need to replace the calories if you move more, because if you exercise and eat the calories back, then you're at no deficit.That's a good feel!

I loved feeling my hip bone again for the first time in a looooong time!would you say exercise would increase my metabolic rate?sorry I meant if I incorporated running so say an hour burns 500, eat 2500 or 2300 making it 2000-1800 as opposed to 2000 minus 500Amazing story. I guess your username doesn't really apply any more, huh? Keep kicking ass at life! You don't need to counteract the deficit if you're not losing.  If you're 100% sure you're not overeating, it's probably doctor time to find out if you have a metabolic issue.yes and have been for the last 2 years using digital scales as well as logging the amount in a notebook for each meal. I am 100% certain I'm not overeating. I don't know if I need to incorporate regular exercise into my routine and increase calories by 200kcal or however much to counteract the deficit. perhaps my metabolism is so sedentary that weight stays the same regardless of eating less than tdee

tdee is 2550 mifflin st joerThat's just awesome :-) 

Keep at it! Yeah you did.yay!  I am excited I wanted to keep my desire to lose weight a secret from my SO for a loooong time, mostly because I didn't want to admit (to myself and especially to him) that I was overweight and insecure. Obviously he could tell, but we never talked about it and he always told me how beautiful I was.

It wasn't until I had been on the bandwagon for a couple of weeks that I really confided in him. He knew I was eating healthier and working out, but he didn't know I was counting my calories or what I was doing to work out until I told him. I guess I just felt like I needed to be already on my way to improvement before I shared my feelings about it.

The best thing you can do is ask your SO how they want you to encourage them. Has your SO openly expressed a desire/active pursuit of change? It wasn't until I could see the changes in myself physically that I actually started taking my boyfriend's compliments as sincere, even though I know he was the whole time. Now that I am making progress, I tell my SO my caloric intake every night, talk about my cravings, talk about my workouts, in what small ways my body is changing, and every day I tell him what my small victory for the day was. He used to want to work out with me and I was way too insecure. These days I would kill for him to do yoga with me or go out for a long walk. He is teaching me how to build up muscle though, and I love it and don't feel insecure anymore. I feel closer to him.

Study your SO and his reactions to different means of encouragement and go with his preferences. It might take a while for him to open up. It wasn't until over a month in that I actually told my SO about when my overeating started and why. This is because every challenge I face in my weight loss, I had to come to terms with myself before I could share them with him. Talk to him about what will motivate him and what will discourage him, and really truly listen to what he is saying. Hope this helps.If you eat 2000 cal per day, even if you're sedentary, you should be losing weight at that rate of consumption, based on the fact that I'm 6'3" and 200 lb and my sedentary TDEE is almost 2500.

* I often miss my daily calorie goal for a 1lb loss per week, but don't often go above maintenance. 

* I don't exercise every day, and when I do, it's usually an hour or less. 

And apparently this means I lose weight and look better? Crazy!whaaaaat??? I didn't realize that was possible, I hope that was a healthy cycle for you, though I'm sure now it's waaaay healthier. my mom had long periods, but she had anemia and ovarian cysts What's the reasoning behind the honey, lemon, and hot water? Hey there!!! What's up, I'm new here, a 22 year old male 5'9'' and 195 lbs. Current BMI 28.8, overweight. Fair enough. I want to feel good. That's all, feel good, live longer, and just increase my awesomeness potential. My goal is to be lets say 75kg by the end of the year. Simple enough, and very doable. I dont want to blast fat, but make lifestyle changes. Something permanent, something that I'll love for the rest of my life.

I used to be a 1.5 pack a day smoker and quit, mainly because afriend did too. She was a new years quitter and i just couldnt stand the envy. Now I realize how important motivation is, and how...well for me envy/jealousy/competitiveness can bootstrap important decisions in my life.

So far I have cutback on unhealthy things in my life. Coke (regular), I don't take sugar anymore in my coffee, I don't ingest raw dairy and substituted soymilk etc. I rarely eat eggs, and when I do I remove the yolk, drastically reduced carb intake, and where possible substituted with whole grains......you know all the minor stuff.

So far so good. I want to make "low intensity" changes that I can sustain for decades at a time. This is the approach I am trying to take. Eventually this will culminate into bigger and bigger changes. 
I have seen too many people fall into the "bodybuilding" trap. They blast fat like there's no tomorrow, and eventually let themselves go. My professor in college used to be a fitness model and now....well.

I want to make lifelong changes that I will enjoy. I don't want fitness to be a chore, a job you get what I mean? I want to be like my other professor...he gets up at four every morning and bikes for two hours, and even has won state-level races. And he's as lean as a beef jerky.

So yeah, I know the enormous power a group can have on someone. Going at something, no matter how determined you are can be challenging. If you don't have atleast someone to motivate you and to keep tabs on you it is bound to fail. The human will can only do so much. After the enormous support /r/stopsmoking showed me, I am really blown away by how much kindness and motivation random strangers can show. I want to use that to my advantage. 
So.......Hi !!!


P.S. I might have shown profound ignorance of how fitness works, please be gentle :)[This is what I've been doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpqbzPj92HU)

I've been missing a few of the foods because I haven't been shopping yet, but I've been eating:

* Apples
* Prunes
* Green Tea half an hour after every meal.
* Honey + Lemon + Hot Water (Before Sleeping).
* Grilled Chicken

Gotta say, 3 days later and down from 304.4 to 291.6 I'm feeling much better about myself. Congrats on your weight loss :)Nice! Not only are you saving the calories you now have 2 meals for the price of one!Congratulations man. That's badass. You are amazing! So nice of you to do that Badass leggings!My breath.Curious that he said a low carb diet is best but then said cheese was the problem- because a lot of low carb diets involve consumption of cheese like crazy. One thing I think doctors and anyone can agree on is that lots of vegetables are good for you and your heart, regardless...even if they have a lot of carbs. Losing just 10% of your body weight if you are overweight significantly improves your health like crazy. You don't even have to be "healthy weight" to see so many benefits. Exercising regularly, even walking, is good for your heart too- we know that weight loss is pretty much dependant on diet but you gotta look at that exercise see all the benefits it has  for your body too. Now that's a lump i wouldn't mind discovering! I'm looking forward to the day my collarbone reappears.I completely understand what you mean. 

I've been in " I want to be thin " phase without actually working for it, for 4 years. 

My discipline and self control was in tatters. I felt miserable and looked miserable. 

I started following /loseit /getdisciplined /progresspics from Jan 2015 and my life seems more lively, peaceful and brighter. 

There is no turning back for us now. Its only going to get better. Right? :-) 

Edit : /bodyweightfitness too! Maybe he doesn't want to? Not everyone wants to be totally muscle bound. I'm a lady and I think he looks fiiiiine. Keep the goodness flowing :-)Your right, and for the most part I have managed to. But the urge is always there.I've wanted to change for years but this is the first time I've REALLY wanted it if you know what I mean.  As in, I want to be slender more than I want to eat any food I want.

Thank you!Wish I read this 15 minutes ago.  Stayed under my mfp goal, but not my personal 1500 goal.  Damn lemon bars.Keep at it :-) Similar thing happened to me.  Noticed a dark spot on my face.  Turned out it was the shadow of a cheekbone I never knew I had.I'd lost 35lbs and was well on my way to losing the next 95lbs when this past May my father got sick very suddenly and died six weeks later. I was absolutely devastated. Immediately after he died, my weight loss came to a halt. I didn't gain much (mostly because my emotional eating was paired with a re-appearance of an old, previously dormant case of bulimia - 0/10, do not recommend as coping mechanism) but I didn't lose anything at all. 

It took me almost 6 months before I was able to look in the mirror and realize that even though I'd lost 35lbs and mostly kept it off, I was still 235lbs and 5'3. My father died directly because of his weight (he had a heart valve replacement that got infected a year later, and his body couldn't fight the infection before it killed the liver that was already sick with fatty liver disease). I had to shake the fog of grief and depression (which told me that I was healthier than I was a year before and that was good enough) and realize that the weight I'd lost was going to come right back if I gave up now, and if the weight kept going up, I was very likely to die young and horrifically like my father did. And that frightened the hell out of me. 

If your father has already had heart attack, you're at a greater risk of one yourself. Your body might be healthy right now, but the longer you carry that weight around, the more you damage your body. And one day you'll have damaged it to the point where you cannot recover. 

Don't let that happen. Love yourself more than that. I re-started intentional (and tracked) lifestyle changes in January, and I'm down 10 more pounds since then. I've still got a long while to go, but the little milestones help a LOT. My first milestone was getting down below my license weight, then below my pre-grad school weight, then out of Obesity Class III and into Obesity Class II, then 50lbs down, onederland, Obesity Class I and so on... 

You've got your entire life to lose this weight... or not. But the sooner you lose it, the longer that life will be. Oh god, the cravings. I almost get shaky with desire when it comes to sugar craving.I've gone from a size 20 to size 12... he keeps pointing out men who are interested... it's his loss, not mine, lol![*sigh...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTgFtxHhCQ0)I think when you are in the process of losing weight, people aren't quite used to seeing you that way and have a hard time imagining you thinner but still healthy.  They probably just need to get used to seeing you like that.

I'm less certain on this second point, but I also think that you look a little more awkward when you are losing weight vs. when you've stabilized at a lower weight.  I don't have a great explanation for that, just anecdotes about people I knew who looked gaunt while they were losing weight but looked more wholesome after they had gotten to their goal and stayed there.I'm a huge Blackmilk fan, this is where my love of crazy prints comes from&gt; I very much struggle with an all or nothing attitude. I think the weekly goals might help keep things in check because it is a realistic time frame.

I was the same and it works for me. It isn't an instant process and took me a few months to get right but why this worked for me is because it changed my thinking from "I failed in my long term goal so therefore I am a failure why try" to "I failed my weekly goal, why did I fail and what can I change to make sure I achieve it next time. It has changed my life for the better so it can't help playing around with it.

I can't speak more highly of the 5:2 diet. The 2 days are pretty rough to stick to in the beginning because 2500 kj is not much food. But you get a sense of satisfaction out of sticking it it so boosts your motivation to stick with it.

Watch the link form my page, the documentary gives you a good insight into intermittent fasting.I'm only 5'4" but I've decided to go higher than 1200 - I eat between 1300 and 1600 depending on the day, and have lost enough so far that I feel good about that choice. I know it will make things slower but it will also make the whole journey more pleasant and sustainable for me.I think it's one of the best feelings I've had in a long time!1200 is the often quoted number of "minimum calories you need to eat to not die" so a lot of women read that as "welp, that is the number I need to go to" or are already so small and light that just to get to a deficit they have to go as low as a doctor will say is possible to go. I wish.. Taking a week off from the gym after posting steady gains all week long even staying in calories and eating right day in and day out. Some combination has to work, maybe mine is gonna be just eating betterOne thing I see it as is this: it takes a lot more gumption to lose a small amount of weight than a large one.

If you're only 20, 30 pounds overweight it can easy to ignore. "So what if I'm a little pudgy, its not like it really matters." But it does, because not tracking your health is how you wake up one day and realize that you weigh 120 pounds too much.

It's easy to know that you're extremely overweight when you have 100+ pounds to lose.

Although ultimately losing the weight is equally difficult no matter how far you have to go.I'm also in the medical field. There are some scary complications that can happen. Also, there is so "quick fix". Even if you decide to go with Surgery, you have you change your habits completely or you'll end up exactly as you are now. Same here! Or at least I hope they stay proportional to my body...

Edit: actually something nice that's happened already (only 8 lbs into my desired 40lbs loss) is the little pockets of fat below the underwire of my bra are disappearing, so even if my breasts have changed size (haven't noticed either way just yet) they look better.*thank mr skeletal*Yeah, but the point is that it was taught, so you can unlearn it.And that's why you don't teach your son a lesson...I'm going to be completely honest even though it may not be a good example for others.

I don't eat that well, and I still lose weight. I do it by exercising rigorously. I've gotten to the point where I can't stop doing cardio. It makes me feel so great. I wake up in the morning feeling okay, and then when I get my cardio in, I feel like I've come alive. 

I also manage my calories, but I can lose weight at 2500 a day so I can still indulge in my favorite foods pretty often. My diet didn't really change much. All I do is exercise a lot more, and avoid the horrible meals. I used to on occasion, go out to eat, have something like mozzarella sticks or wings for an appetizer, a bacon cheeseburger for the entree, and then have some big brownie sundae for dessert. And during that time, I would have 3 tall glasses of coke. Probably like 2-3k calories. So really all I do is don't do that, watch what I eat a little bit, and exercise a lot.

I realize this isn't the best plan for everyone, but it works for me and I thought I'd share. I've gone from 220-203 in 3 months doing this. I know I probably could've been 190 by now if I got my diet in order, but hey, I'm happy.The idea that resonated with me the most: if you eat one cookie and feel like you're going to eat the whole box, it's better to throw the whole box- it's not wasteful because you would have eaten the whole thing anyways. Overall, an informative listen.That is true.  How do you handle things now that leave you devastated, shocked, sad for several days?Yeah! That's what I loved about it. I felt very classy and elegant when I wore clothes that showed off my decolletage, neck, and shoulders. That's honestly part of my goals with this... I don't have a set weight goal, but a range. I'll know I'm there when I'm in the range and I see what I want to see.Is it winter where you are at?  Many people run low on Vitamin D in the winter.  This can cause lower energy levels along with deficiencies in Vitamin B12 (Vitamin B complex can't help if you are not absorbing enough B12).  I'm sure there are others as well.  I take a few supplements and take a multi-vitamin each day.

You may want to talk to your doctor and get a blood test done if you still feel sluggish after a few weeks. It's the best way to know if you are deficient in anything. How do you do this? Exactly. Even maintaining at 5'5, 120lbs, 1200 isn't enough to maintain weight, and if I'd continued to to stick with it, I would have slipped into underweight.

Part of losing weight in a healthy way is to create sustainable expectations and reprogram your habits. At 5'7, you shouldn't make it a habit to eat at 1200/day. Not only will it make you miserable now, but it won't even sustain a healthy weight at that height.

Side note: I do like looking at /r/1200isplenty, but only because of the low-calorie recipe ideas. The people there are adamant about 1200 not being sufficient for most people, and they *will* tell you if it doesn't seem like a good idea for your body type and fitness goals. I have also been struggling, mainly since Christmas. Managed to loose 13 pounds and now I've put 6 pounds back on. The late night sugar cravings are driving me crazy! I have recently started going to a gym three times a week and I am really enjoying it, but at the same time I am scared I will quit. I always do after a while. Struggling real hard to stay motivated right now. Thank you for the post! Also keep in mind that it takes a while. I just passed 100lbs this week. It took me 15 months to get there. There were weeks where I lost nothing and weeks where I gained. It takes time to get results so be patient. Me too. Not weird at all. The collar bone is a very beautiful part of the female form. (&amp; the male form! I just think it looks so elegant when a woman displays her decolletage.)These are strippers! Look how hot they are!
It's ok to weigh yourself often but better to set certain "weighing conditions". For example I only weigh myself in the mornings right after I get up AND only after a moderate intensity workout the day before. This ensures that I am reasonably dehydrated (a night of no liquids and sweating out from the workout the day before). I also tend to weigh myself with minimal clothing (or buck naked haha).

I do this about once a week, usually on a Saturday or Sunday morning right after I get up and before I drink or eat anything. This helps keep most of the important factors constant to get a clear idea of where your weight is heading.Yeah, I get so focused on the calorie counting and exercise that I forget to notice what's going on in the mirror and have woah moments. It's nice :) Obviously I think about being at my GW but I spend more time focusing on the here and now because thats how I'll get there!Those things get pretty annoying. Suddenly one day I couldn't use my computer laying on my bed anymore. My hip bones dug into my wrists. Don't apologize. That was a rude comment to you that didn't address your original question. Ick. I'm sorry. I definitely think that's more a society problem than a curvy woman problem. I know that sounds very /r/fatlogic but seriously, where people get the sense that they are allowed to comment on your body without restraint I have no idea.haha :)  I've considered that.  I'm looking for all types of groups.  I'm trying to get data from as many groups as possible.  everything from elite athletes to the average person.  The survey SHOULD distinguish between groups... hopefully....Medical complications. I would never alter my internal organs unless it was to save my life. The most important thing on a diet is sticking with it.  If for you that means 1500 calories that is great.  You will lose weight and maintain sanity.  

If you want to speed up your weightloss a little bit you could start or increase your exercise.  (downside is it might make you more hungry).

The reason you might see 1200 often is that short women have low TDEEs.  Someone with a TDEE of 1600 eating 1200 actually has the same deficit as you, and will be losing weight at the same rate.

1200 is an arbitrary number assumed to be the least one can eat and still have adequate nutrients.  I haven't come across any scientific reason it is 1200.  Not weirdWhat an awesome feeling! I'm a few months away from this victory but it must just be amazing. Way to go :)I can't agree with that because I  was never really socialized. I like to think I'm a special snowflake even though I'm not, but I have always had hunger issues, and really they are more of satiation issues. Growing up I was never "full" or "content" or whatever it is most people feel. I was never taught to "clean my plate" or "eat my veggies" because I was inhaling everything given to me as a child. Even as a child I'd stuff myself until I was ready to yak. 

Stress definitely though. Stress gets the hunger factor going.Black coffee made from a french press.  It will turn coffee time into more of a ritual rather than a grab-and-go deal due to cleaning out the press.  I can barely scarf down drip coffee black, but recently ground from a french press?  Holy cow that is good.  Wasa crackers are low calorie (60 cal for the multigrain, 30 for the light rye) and crunchy and high fiber too. They'd go really well with guac.Keep in mind we aren't really a random sample here :)It helps me to get a big bag, then weigh or count out the serving size of chips or snack that I want into a small bowl. I put the bag away, and all I get are the chips in the bowl. Works pretty well usually, and I seem to enjoy them more. Never ever ever eat out of the bag.You are my life style guru!  Thank you for all the amazing past advice and for this.  75 days in, no real binges, but I don't know how much longer I can last.  This advice really helps take the fear out of it.  Awareness seems to be they key to so many of my struggles.
Oh man, we are the same height and have the same start and goal weights! I hope to be where you are in another two or three months...

Also, here's an unsolicited relationship fact. Had your ex completely moved on and was happy with his life, he wouldn't have felt the need to text you 6 months after the break-up. He needed some form of validation for whatever shit was going on with his life at that time, hence the random insults.

Being mean to someone is just a small step below being nice. In both cases, the other person is constantly on your mind for whatever reason. Way worse than both is ignoring them altogether and not giving them a second of your day.I am 1 month into my journey now, and I have a similar goal weight to your current weight. I have around 50lbs to go... it's daunting. When I see people here losing over 80lbs it's really motivating, but I still feel my self confidence wobble. I have a personal problem of severely low self esteem, and I often feel like less of a person. 

Thank you for this. I feel more inclined to teach myself *not* to compare myself to others so harshly, and work for my own goals.Great job! It's the small decisions day-by-day that all add up.A relative of mine is a nutritionist. When I said I was doing 1200 calories (which wasn't working), she told me that that was waaaaay too low for someone of my height (and I'm 5'6"). She said even 1300 might be too low. So I try to stick within a range of 1300 to 1500 (varies by the intensity of my exercise that day as sometimes I just NEED more protein). I found that around or under 1300, I feel very hungry and tend to binge eat more frequently because of the cravings. But with 1300 to 1500, I usually don't get hungry at the end of the day and stick to the plan. Even with a deficit, you shouldn't be feeling hungry all the time... it's just not sustainable and you won't be able to stick with it.As someone who spent 20 years rejecting the idea of counting calories and only exercised as a way to lose weight, this way is so much easier and predictable.  No more working my ass off and hoping it works.  It's just crunching numbers, who knew?  Oh, wait, you guys did!  Thank you, I couldn't have gotten this far without you all.Thank Mr skeltal with calcium. I had lap band surgery in 2012. It's not magic, but it did help me with overcoming my compulsive overeating problem. I am still perfectly capable of overeating and eating junk. I've had to do a lot of work on my emotional issues and finding a diet that suits me.

I don't regret the surgery. It went well with no complications. I think the band is still helpful sometimes even though I don't have it very tight. It can also be a pain when I do have to eat fast. I've lost enough fat that the port can be seen under my skin. By the time I've finished losing, it will be pretty obvious in two-piece swimsuit, and even visible in form-fitting clothes.

Be very careful in this decision. By all means, go ahead and do your six month program. If it works, keep doing it. You don't have to be in a hurry. Remember, surgery is serious. A lap band may be reversible, but removing it is just as big a surgery as getting it put in, and insurance isn't going to pay to take it out if it is functioning normally.

Most of all, when you go to a lap band seminar, remember that they are selling a product. I was already sold on the product before I went based on my personal circumstances and conversations I had had with other patients (not all of whom had good things to say, by the way), but I was overwhelmed by how they make it look like it is your only chance to live a normal life. It is not your only chance. It is one of the choices available to you.
Yes! I'm still astounded every day when I get on the scales and the number hasn't gone up. I keep getting paranoid and thinking it's just water weight and it will be back, 

But no, you don't lose 10 kgs and 17cms (22lbs and 6.5 inches) of water!I've got the reverse feeling right now. When I look in the mirror, I still see slimmer me. And I feel that way too now that I've been working hard for the last few months. But when I see pictures, I'm pretty big, and am always shocked or surprised by what I see. I think we tend to hold onto a certain image of ourselves for a long time, and it takes a long time for that image to evolve and change.Nope, well for me it hasn't anyway in almost two years. At my lowest I hit 6% body fat and I could still feel fat (http://imgur.com/8OaOzKZ). Trust me, you may know, but your subconscious doesn't have a frigging clue. You could be like me, you could have body dis-morphia where you see your body completely different to how everyone else does.

I am still incredibly regimented with food, I'm currently floating between 10-15% body fat and yes I do still feel fat (even more so when I see that picture of myself at 6%). 

The problem with weight loss is that it happens so gradually and you're forever looking in mirrors to see if you can notice the change, but it never happens. The people who notice it the most are those you see infrequently. It's so important to keep progress pictures (like the one above) of your progress to understand where you're currently at, where you've come from and what your journey has been.

One of my biggest fears is becoming fat again after everything I've been through. I fight with myself on a daily basis to eat the right amount let alone in excess.

I do kinda look at it in a positive light though, keeps the weight off :)2spooky4meOoooh! Thanks for that tip to look at percentage lost of original weight! That'll definitely help me stay motivated and keep things into perspective.No resistance training yet, just trying to get the weight off.Congrats, keep at it.Hey, you don't have him to thank for your healthy lifestyle, you have YOU to thank.Yup.

Started counting three months ago, and I often don't even eat clean food. MFP knows about my booze and McDonalds. It knows I'm a lazy asshole. It knows I sometimes eat an entire cheesecake.

But as long as I eat less than the magic number, on average, I shrink. It's ridiculous that this works so well despite me.One of my favorite things about losing weight was feeling my hip bones while I was laying down. Looking forward to being able to do it again!HAH! That's wonderful! It's nice to start feeling/seeing a bit of structure again. One of the things that I miss about my slimmer days is seeing a little bit of a collarbone outline. Don't know if that sounds weird, but that's my thing.Signed up! Thanks so much for organizing this :)Oh definitely, I was just recalculating MFP calories today, and I tried looking at the BMR for men and women of the exact same age &amp; weight, wow.  Women are like little hybrids compared to man trucks.  Age didn't make as much of a difference though.5'8" @ 150 is crazy lean. Time to bulk up those abs and chest for the ladies. The calorie counting alone has helped me a ton! I work ~65hrs/week and this has helped a ton. Too easy to just grab some drive-thru between jobs. I've lost over 20lbs just since Nov 18. Keep it up! I don't think I've lost any weight at all, according to my scale, but today I fit into an old pair of jeans.  I grabbed the wrong pair out of the drawer by accident and after being kinda bummed about not losing anything, I'm super ecstatic and more motivated than ever.This is a really good habit to pick up in general, just the act of putting away all of the food *before* you start eating sort of keeps it out of sight and out of mind.It has been a gradual process. When I started out, I decided I would have a cheat day every month. But as I go along, nothing really seems good enough to cheat. A year ago, I would happily swing by whataburger and eat a large combo meal. Now? Shit, that is like a billion calories give or take a million. I'd rather have my homemade roast beef and veg! I appreciate the comment.  What do you mean "go wrong"?  As in complications or gaining weight back?They're copies of the blackmilk Mr Shark legs, not sure if they're still on the BM site but if not try Aliexpress, East Knitting do decent quality copies.

The same print also comes in shorts and bathers :)Thousands of years of evolution that said that consuming more now meant surviving famine later. Unfortunately that concept no longer applies in the last 150 years.The next step is being on first name terms with everyone. At this point change gyms, haha. I'm not joking, you usually end up spending half your time talking to people than actually working out. This is the reason last month I joined a new gym where I didn't know anyone.I used to let myself binge on white chicken chili once a week when I was younger :) Never impeded my fat loss back then really and sure did taste good. I'd never recommend that behavior to my current older self though.You want to pick something that should work in the long run.  1200 is inappropriately low for many people, although it's a common number for short, small framed people.  1500 is going to be much more manageable.  Man. Just from reading that text - what a scumbag. My big thing is prevention. I don't keep enough food in the house TO binge on! So basically every 4 days I go to the super market and buy about 4 days worth of food. Another nice perk is nothing is wasted or goes bad this way.

When prevention doesn't work, uh, yeah I don't know. If I eat the wrong types of foods or get in the wrong kind of mood I become ravenous and literally lose control over myself. It's a serious eating disorder that every therapist I've ever talked to just shrugs off, but when I binge I tend to binge until I'm choking on my vomit or am passing out. So yeah, the best way I know to manage, is to prevent. When you are going through rough times the rate of weight loss doesn't matter as much. 

* You have not gained weight 
* You have not stayed the same
* You have continued to lose 

Have you ever thought about getting a few sessions of therapy, to help you learn new and better techniques to cope with the good/bad emotions and challenges that life throws at us so often? Your obesity is an issue now, it is holding you back now. You don't have to wait for a heart attack, or diabetes, or anything else to prove it to you. Don't focus on how long it's going to take to get to your goal weight, that time will pass anyway. When you are making decisions to learn how to take care of your body, to learn about how to eat better to fuel yourself you are taking back enormous power. You will make mistakes, and it takes courage to keep picking yourself back up. But having a healthy body that works for you, that gets stronger and faster and better day by day, that is a wonderful thing to achieve. It's not about the big "I have to lose weight" decision, it's about the dozens of tiny good decisions you make in a day that will get you there.Sometimes at night I bang on arm on my hipbone. Hurts but feels so good too :)Cigarettes suppress appetite.  Its not uncommon to have to readjust your eating after quitting smoking.Hey there, F 27 5'3" SW: 192 / CW:149 / G:125. I think I had my "So this is life now" moment when my mom crashed at my place for a few days in November and I decided to try "maintenance mode" for the first time to keep things easier. 

Oh my god, **maintenance as a short girl is a bitch.** It is a lot easier to wake up and think "So, today I'm losing weight and I'm eating 1200 calories so get ready for veggies and small snacks and no XL pizza." At maintenance (which for me at that point was 1750) you have *some* extra calories, but not *all* of the calories. So even when we went out I'd have to eat half of what I wanted, even if we wanted snacks I could have chips *or* a cookie, even if we wanted dessert I couldn't afford a full slice of cheesecake. I wanted to go out with my mom and enjoy life but I had to police myself more than ever. It's enough calories to get tastes of everything, nothing has to be restricted, but you can't have it all in one day. 

When I hit my goal weight, if I don't work out all week, my TDEE will be 1500 calories. #$(@*&amp;, that's like a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee more than what I'm eating every day already. 

What helped is to stop seeing food as anything other than food. It's a yummy thing that'll make me not hungry for a while and nourish my body and that's it's only job. If I'm sad I'll go for a walk, if I'm anxious I'll go draw etc. I will log everything I eat on MFP honestly. Yes, I do the same thing, although I go with a weekly average. It's a great combination of seeing the fine details, but also not getting caught up in the minor fluctuations. Did he mention why he thought cheese was the cause of high cholesterol? There is quite a bit of outdated science lingering out there, specificially eating cholesterol equals cholesterol, which we now know isn't true. If anything the inflammatory effects of food you eat (specifically carbs) creates a nice, sticky, surface for the blood cholesterol your body makes. Just a thought.Hard boiled egg (80 calories or so) is my favorite thing to add to a salad. And green onion. I work in the medical field. 

I would never get elective surgery for something that I can fix on my own. This is just my opinion. I am sure those type of procedures work for people, but I have seen what happens when they go wrong. Hey 45lbs buddy! I'm maintaining now too :). Just know what we're doing is great, and we have accomplished so much! Also, everyone here with even the smallest amount of weight loss is doing so good! The weight loss journey is an emotional roller coaster, (I actually kind of miss my Sunday mornings jumping on the scale to see a smaller number, is that bad? haha) and everyone here can benefit from OP's wise words:)I cook a big pot of chilli on Sunday and freeze it in portion -sized Tupperware. 

Then I take 4 frozen packs with me to work on Monday (I don't work Fridays), buy sour cream and a four-pack of little gem lettuce and I'm sorted for the week.Spoooooky!Alright, I'm going to tell you what I wish I did. Find yourself a good regime such as Starting Strength (SS for short), and stick to it. You will progress so much more than on any brosplit. Head on over to the reddit fitness [Faq](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise) and follow there recommendations.

I wish I would have started earlier. Soon enough you are gonna know more than most people when it comes to lifting.

Also you don't have to actually buy the books, you can find them on various websites or even on reddit.I've always had large breasts and a big booty (whenever I gain weight it seems like those are the areas mainly affected), and personally I've always hated it. I hate the attention my butt gets, I hate that even the most modest of pants don't detract from it, and I hate the shit people say about it. Female coworkers/friends are always saying things about my booty (positive things, but I just hate that my butt was noticeable enough to be brought up), overly friendly friends will slap my ass, and I always catch male coworkers/managers and clients looking at my butt (and sometimes laughing together about it). It's just all around an uncomfortable situation and was definitely a motivating factor in my losing the weight.

That said, I did always feel more feminine with my curves (no shame for the less curvy ladies put there, femininity comes in all shapes and sizes!), and I do like being curvy, I just wish it didn't bring so much attention. The last time I had lost the weight, I really appreciated that I still had the curves, but they weren't so exaggerated. I actually began to like that I had a booty, because while it was still big, it wasn't cartoonish if that makes sense.There are some studies done on this and how it does not always work for everyone.  Here is an article explaining why.  The BMI system can still be used for people to track progress, but as a fine tuning instrument for what you should exactly weight it is not a good benchmark.  Everyone is different in how they are built underneath.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/19/bmi-why-body-mass-index-i_n_798775.htmlSome days are just bad days. Log it in your food tracker and then be done with it. It's ok to have a bad food day once in a while, just don't make it a habit. And don't get too down on yourself. We've all been there, and we will probably end up there again. 

The good thing is that you recognized it as an undesirable behavior and are aware of what you're doing. 

A big part of the weightloss process is being able to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. You can do it, you got this. :)A teacher at my school I've known for the last 7 years came up to me and said they were proud of me for loosing as much weight as I have and that it's very visible. Completely out of the blue, made me feel great for the rest of the day.I started at 538lbs and was considering surgery, but I knew doing it the healthy way would be best.  Today I am down nearly 200lbs from plain old hard work. 

If your health is in a dire state and lots of weight loss right away is needed you may not have an option. Surgery may be your only recourse. But if you an try to do it the old fashioned way it will teach you how to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle. 

My Aunt works at a clinic that does these surgeries and a whopping 60% of people who have one these procedures either don't lose weight or do but gain it back over time.  There are ways to cheat it and if you are not emotionally secure you are bound to do so. 

So before making this kind of drastic choice ask yourself if you truly have losing it the hard way a real chance. I love salad, mostly because I can eat lettuce until I'm ready to burst and it won't put me over my calorie goals. I have always loved raw vegetables, though, so if you don't like them salads might not be for you. I encourage you to try it though! My current favorite that I eat about every other day:

* Two big handfuls of romaine 
* A handful of spinach
* One carrot, shredded
* About a cup of broccoli florets
* Half a cup of cottage cheese OR one of those 100-calorie guacamole tubs
* 3-4 tablespoons of pico de gallo salsa
* 2 oz shredded chicken breast (cold)
* 1/4 cup black beans

It's so good...and HUGE. I eat it out of a mixing bowl. I use the salsa and cottage cheese or guacamole in place of salad dressing, and I think it tastes great. It's a lot like a chipotle salad.As a Californian, that makes me so sad :(Like from the restaurant? :YI weigh in mostly daily, but only record it when there's weight loss.Duckface!I used to go to chipotle and get a kids size bag of chips and salsa 130 calorie delicious snackI appreciate the story and suggestions.  I don't have any health complications at this point.  I'm 24.  My surgeon says, "you're young, motivated, and intelligent so you shouldn't have problem with the lap band".  We'll see how things go.A lot of it can be when you decide to change your life, when that "wakeup moment" fully commits you to changing. I have another 40 pounds to lose, and lost around 45. If I waited another 10-15 years, I might have had to lose 120 or 150 pounds as the weight crept on. If I started 5 years ago, I'd have 30 less pounds to lose. We're all facing unique circumstances and different positions in our lives. How much you lose doesn't matter as long as you're on the path to living a healthier life and getting to your ultimate health goals.
I will agree to that. My parents tought me to fill my plate and then eat everything on it. So between what you said and how I grew up it became where it feels natural, or second nature. Does that make sense?It's nice, haha-- I gym with my mom and it was 8 weeks till we got the "hello ladies" from trainers and 12 weeks till we started making friends with other notable regulars... NSV all around!

I'm going 5x a week now and it feels great. Who knew I could enjoy this change so much? [Reading the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq) after I found /r/loseit was my moment. I had stepped on the scale thinking I'd be a bit into the "overweight" range. I was much heavier than I expected, and my BMI was 30. I was obese and needed to change, my weight was only going up and it was getting faster. I decided reddit would be the best place to look for advice, as bullshit answers would get downvoted. Reading "For most people losing weight is roughly a 80:20 diet:exercise split" in the FAQ changed my whole outlook. I could focus just on my diet for a while and worry about exercise later. I didn't have to feel like I was spinning plates, getting overwhelmed with all I had to do. It's been great, over a year on and everything about my life is better. Stats: F 26 5'1" SW 155 GW 115 CW 119.5, I reached my goal but regained 5 lbs due to an injury. I'm on the way back down now :)Thank you! And don't say "only 12 pounds"...that's a lot! Look at how much fat that is https://sixpackali.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/yuck.jpg
Be proud!

Haha random sweating no more! :)I can fully resonate with your story.

I was 260lbs and then got to 180lbs. I then went up and down several times to 210 or thereabouts. Why? Because I stopping thinking it was a big deal.


I think a part of it is never being fully happy with my weight. At 180 I wanted to get to 170. Of course I'd be so delighted with 180 right now though!

I'm back on track, this is what I did:
1. I use a great app for graphing daily weight so you know you're 10 day average - Libra, this way I don't give a shit about daily ups and downs, unless there are a series of ups
2. I track everything I eat in MyFitnessPal, knowing that I can't eat beyond 1600 calories, unless I do some serious running.
3. I have signed up for a marathon on June 1st and am following a beginner's 18 week plan that builds up to 6 runs a  week.


I don't overeat now. If I am hungry it's usually because I need to eat. I don't get bored because I am doing running. I don't worry because Libra and MyFitnessPal are tracking things for me and everything looks good.


I hope this helps.pork grinds zero carbsThis is exactly what I do, Friday mornings. If it's not great one week then make an extra effort, of it's a good week then keep doing what I've been doing!Thank you! Haha and yessss, disappearing double chin is a favorite of mine as well. 

&gt; I was **loosing** weight

**Losing** is the word you want.  : )I'm sorry, you're right. A better lifestyle is not boring. Its simple. :)Thank you! Haha it really is. I feel like I'm beginning to see me now, if that makes any sense.I can't believe someone said that to you.  What a shitty person.

I gotta say, you were cute in your before photo, but your after is smokin hot.  Congrats on the hard work paying off.It's been 10 months since I started losing, it's been very up and down but I've got some momentum now and can't see myself floundering. That said I'm only 25lbs from where is was last April. It's all been experimenting and the right way of doing it for me, so yeah I totally agree that patience is key. Want to keep the weight off rather than yo yo like I have been, and as I've learned the hard way patience is one of the most important things in achieving that.That's a great goal :) 135 was actually my first goal, I knew I would be healthy at that weight but I wanted to continue to lose once I was there. this really resonated with me; in my first year of law school i gained almost 45 lbs from just shitty eating and making excuses (could've managed time better and just...didn't).

went to the cardiologist for something totally random (just a routine check-up because there's some heart disease in my family) and after the echocardiogram i have a severe leaking aortic valve that'll have to be replaced. it was a HELL of a wakeup call. 

i began exercising (insanity is my treat of choice) and MFP like a fiend and dropped the first 20 lbs; gained back 5 over the holidays and am back down the original 20 again and my cardiovascular fitness is incredible! At my original appointment, my resting heart rate was 76 BPM and after 1.5 months of insanity and dropping about 16 lbs, it was down to 65 BPM. 

I felt happy knowing that I'd reduced my heart's burden a bit :) 

Stats: F/5'6/210- SW: 210, CW: 191, GW: 130 Thank you so much :)Beans and guacamole go pretty well together. Beans, guacamole, salsa, and cottage cheese make a fairly high calorie but tasty meal.It's probably not fat, it's probably skin. Neither are you.

No, no thanks, ah no, no - no, no thanks, no - no, you're alright thanks but no etc.


Next tactic is to say you've been to the doc and he's worried about you getting diabetes. Seriously. Next time they offer just do an injection in the arm sign while shaking your head slowly and look grim as fuck.I've just stepped down my creamer. Every now and then I slightly lower the amount I put in my coffee. I'm trying to get down to a sane amount.


 On days it really matters to me I use almond milk, a smidge of vanilla, and done cinnamon. Tastes yummy, but more work than the creamer.indeed. aim for no more than 2 pounds per week. since you're younger it shouldn't be an issue. He'll be back. Be hot and with a hot boyfriend when he does.I'm 21 and I suppose guess I should pace my weight loss to minimize the risk?In general, probably. 
But I'm apparently a land whale and its definitely NOT easy for me to drop 3-5lbs/week. 

And as much as people want to claim cals in vs cals out, age and sex have a lot to do with it as well. I was in a very similar situation when I was 19 believe it or not.

I ended up losing 100 pounds in 6 months.  I would sneak away and started walking around our block, then around our town (it was a nice little square shaped town with one mile roads on each of it's four sides, a perfect square mile).  I eventually got a stairmaster in the garage and would get up at 630 every morning to do it.

For food I would eat healthy or occasionally miss a meal and try and eat as little as is polite around them.

Later, because they didn't see this actual effort, they thought I lost the weight because of drugs.  haCook something brand new, something exciting, that's low in calories, carbs, or fats, whatever you're trying to ignore!You know, when they started letting me through the gate without needing to swipe I felt the same. Accepted. Like I was part of something. Respected.

All the trainers know who I am and talk progress and sometimes just plain chat! Ah it's crazy, I love it.

I never thought I'd fit in in the mother fucking weights room though. I'm so happy these days. The gym has become my spiritual home.Try a protein shake, drink it down as soon as you finish in the pool.it really depends on how old you are and how fast you lose the weight.One group that you might consult is the /r/wls subreddit.

My story is that I was prepping for the Roux En Y Gastric Bypass.  My diabetes was getting harder to control and managing travel with insulin and pills was difficult. On July 9th, my surgeon's staff recommended MyFitnessPal for food tracking (because you need to track your food after the surgery). They assigned it as homework, along with walking 3 days for 30 minutes. It worked very well. I was down 19 pounds and I was pretty stoked! After the 3-week homework assignment was over, I kept tracking and walking.

In just two more weeks, I started having hypoglycemia. My blood glucose was in the 80s and I needed some sugar immediately. If you've ever had it, you know the feeling: hot, confused, weak, a little sick. 5 weeks of walking and doing fairly well on MyFitnessPal had changed my needs. I ended up dropping all of my insulin and most of my metformin. In two more weeks, I dropped everything. My blood glucose is in the high 60s and low 70s and I feel just fine. My HbA1C is 5.6 -- same as a non-diabetic.

I continued on MyFitnessPal and walking and I put my surgery on hold. I've now lost 90+ pounds in just 7 months and while I love the weight loss, the headline is that my diabetes is totally controlled with diet and exercise.

With the surgery would have come group counseling and education. Since I didn't have it, I joined TOPS or Take Off Pounds Sensibly for support and education. TOPS is a decades old non-profit dedicated to help people lose weight. 

That's been my program: MyFitnessPal, Walking 3x a week, and TOPS.

I went through the entire process with the surgery, except the surgery: all the exams, the reviews, the education, the psychologist (one-on-one and group), the cardiologist -- the whole maze. When it comes right down to it, if I wasn't losing weight this way or if it were to come back for some reason, I'd have the Roux En Y (preferring it over the sleeve because of better effectiveness and good safety). 

But what I've learned doing this has been life-changing for me. I am positive I won't have to have the surgery. Food logging gives **me** enough control -- it's not perfect but it's good enough.  It's not magic and if someone's right for the surgery and the surgery is right for them, it should definitely happen.  

Make sure your surgeon is as picky about his patients as you are about picking your surgeon -- that way you know you've got a good one who is looking out for your safety and effectiveness.  Those trying to do as many as they can to whomever they can are not the surgeons you want.Rooting for your success!Cucumber slices are great. I use them to make 'nachos' with refried beans and salsa :) Yikes, I did not expect you to say that :D

Carrots are good for you. Enjoy them! I don't think it's cheating if you take a bit of humous with them.MY opinion is that unless the emotional and psychological issues and hang-ups that underlie the weight management issues are resolved, eventually people end up right back where they started if not worse off for the additional stress and anxiety.

With that in mind, at 7.5 lbs/month, you're already well on your way to a sustainable program.My dad isn't dead yet.  We are suppossed to log our food. However, I got hit with a hard emotional blow from my sister two weeks ago and though I have not ate carb foods, I have quit tracking my food, ate nuts, ate too many crab cakes, etc.  I have still been losing weight but only .6 pounds a week for the last 2 weeks.&gt; I've never felt more alive, more energetic, and just happy with the world.

That says it all. Well done.


Any pointers you could give to someone who's never done weights, how can I start off?Hey man, I weigh that much right now just got out of a toxic relationship (dumped) and have been going to the gym almost religiously the past month.

I wanna ask, what should I do to tone my chest? I have somewhat of M'oobs and I hate that. But I've been doing exercises to help that and its getting better but tell me ya ways!!!

Congrats man! I dont know you but I'm proud of you for deciding this isn't the end of you and lifting yourself to a new plateau.

I'm sure the honeys are finer now also!I think I came into the process like that, but that's because I'm a self improvement junky, and self improvement is make permanent changes.  If you have been trying to engineer habits for a while, thats how you think to solve problems.  You don't learn productivity habits and then imagine that once you're caught up you'll go back to your old ways.  This is just how you work now.

I don't have a hard goal weight or schedule.  I do have a commitment to making sure any change I make to diet or exercise sticks and becomes effortless.  If I get to a point where I reach equilibrium, and I want to lose more weight or gain muscle, then I'll tinker with new habits.

For me it's really about engineering a healthy lifestyle and getting weight loss as a benefit.  It's a way that works well for me.Okay! I can try this. I do love carrots :) "I know how hard it is to choose portion control over your bodies natural desire to eat what ever."

This really resonates right now, as I sit and ignore my inclination to go to the kitchen and find something tasty rather than listening to my stomach, which is decently satisfied after a reasonable lunch. This is so much more mental than physical. You post it because you have no change why you are stupid. Seriously.  I hope that he at least used protection when he was cheating.  Ugh.

OP did a great thing by taking that negativity and redirecting it into something positive, woo!Pretty sure that's over estimating your TDEE unless you are working out (hard) for an hour+ every day of the week. That's about my TDEE at 5'11'', 198 but I'm at 10% bodyfat and I workout an hour every day.I have 2 aha moments that completely changed the way I look at living a healthy life (by healthy I mean mentally and physically).

The first was finding the 5:2 diet. I have tried every diet under the  sun and this is by far the best I have found. It is simple to maintain and only requires strong discipline twice a week. I have gone a bit further than the diet suggests to what I call the 4:2:1 diet, where I eat &lt;2500 kj for 2 days, &lt;8000kj for 4 days and don't record what I eat for one day. This has not been excessively hard to maintain and has been very beneficial to my health. In addition, unlike other diets I have tried it is backed by solid science; watch https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymotion.com%2Fvideo%2Fxvdbtt_eat-fast-live-longer-hd_shortfilms&amp;ei=td3bVOGQPOLbmgWQkoKICg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPV5RJ98QN14DiWPixY8AF-iRsPA.

The second was changing my mindset from focusing on long term goals e.g. I want to weigh 80 kg (Was 94kg last year now down to 86kg with 6kg to go) to focusing exclusively on achieving weekly goals e.g. Maintain a disciplined 5:2 diet. This completely changed my perspective and I no longer beat myself up for lapses in my self control. If I fail a goal I cross it off my list and at the end of the week I analyse where I went wrong and make changes to help me achieve it the next week. This has drastically improved my discipline as I was someone that beat myself up for slipping up on diets and made excuses for not going to training and losing motivation as a result. Now I religiously maintain my diet and train 6 times a week (I do braziian jiu jitsu). 

I have adopted this approach for all areas in my life that are important to me; relationships, career/growth, health and fun and have seen significant results in my life. Committing to this approach forces me to take plunges on things that I would have previously procrastinated on i.e. I started a blog, tell my family that I love them at least once a week (I live interstate from them), started learning Spanish (I'm getting pretty good), surf every week, do all my house duties (keeps the gf happy), drastically improved my fitness and have so far lost 8kg (since October last year and that includes the Xmas break where I purposely let it slip for 3 weeks and ate and drank like a king).  

Good luck with your own journey and if you keen to start exploring the 5:2 diet or wanted to start looking at focusing on weekly goals send me a message and I'm happy to give you some more info.Seems about right.  Yeah, with all the info out there, I'm learning more from posts like yours -- things that make it real and individualized.  That make me write out my thinking like I did above. That helps me fix it in my mind. You look excellent, great story!

I currently do not do weights. I have no clue how to start. Whether to do big weights or more reps etc. Any advice on how to start and how to learn about doing weights for fat loss?I need a belt to hold up my size 16 pants now!Stay on my calorie count!Measure your cream, count it in your daily calories. 

I take 1tsp sugar (15 calories) and 1 tbsp of half and half cream (20 calories). So a "regular" coffee has just 35 calories. Do you like carrots? Try eating 20 large carrots next time that insatiable hunger arrives. If you're not hungry for lots of carrots then you aren't really hungry.That's just good manners anyway. "Can I bring a side/dessert?" (Completely unrelated note: It looks good on you to let them bring a dish, anyway. If you make lasagna, you probably really like lasagna. If they bring roasted green beans, they probably really like those. In that case, even if they're not a super big fan of what the other person made, everyone there has at least one thing they like.)Also, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it easier to drop 3-5 lbs/week when you're a land whale, than when you've only got 30-60 lbs of fat to loose?Yeah I know, I'm not trying to lose so much as be healthier. I'm on this sub for tips and stuff. That's why I don't have a goal weight -- but I do want some idea of a goal, because it's hard to keep my current physical state in perspective My guess is you had been around 270 for a while so HUGE congratulations in the achievement of losing 40lbs. Anyone would be delighted to have done that.

You're now thinking you've an end goal to get to. How about taking it a bit easy on yourself and focus on losing 1lb at a time.

Personally I think you should enjoy and celebrate the 40lbs loss. You are well capable of losing 1lb more. And you're likely capable of losing 1lb more after that.

Have you been doing some exercise like walking or cycling or swimming or running? Exercise is great for your heart.

Well done again and hope you get on well continuing your journey.The leggings are off Amazon and the top is from Foreign Exchange (I bought it in every color - super comfy, flattering, and easily transitions from yoga to club to beach ) I don't think I had any particular ah-hah moment. However, I've worked really hard from the beginning at making my changes in the "mindless margin" - that space where I could really go either way. 

If I could park closer or further, I parked further. If I could walk/bike an errand or drive - I moved toward walking it. If I'm not really hungry, I wait a bit longer. 

The difference in calories between maintaining at 150 and maintaining at 120 is pretty low. Assuming you're sedentary, you're probably looking at 1520 vs 1680 calories per day. That works out to skipping a yogurt or adding a half hour walk. 

The only "I'll do this forever" commitment I've made is to weigh every day. Everything else - I'm trying on to see how it fits. 

Martial arts was great until I had a knee injury, now I'm trying swimming.
Calorie tracking makes me crazy, so I did an exchange diet. 
I did alternate day modified fasting. Then occasional calorie tracking and occasional intermittent fasting. 
 
Now I do moderation and food awareness as I kind of ease into maintenance. 

Because I made a lot of small changes instead of a few big ones - even when I "slip" most of the good habits are still in effect. I guess my misconception is that I "have" to eat salads. I love your idea for chips, I'm now thinking about making my own apple chips too.Or, if you're like my grandmother, all the recipes say "a scoop of this" or "3 handfuls of that." She's not a real precise cook. I just throw caution to the wind and make up a number for caloriesMakes sense. The gluten free cereal is the only gluten free food I eat just cause it really is fucking delicious. Like heaven in a box.That actually sounds like the way I should go. I'm already eating raw/steamed veggies but roasted adds a whole new twist. So Broil?
 I think it's a quote from Michael Pollen's book, "In Defense of Food"... "When you see the words 'low-fat', think, 'chemical shitstorm'." You take out the fat, you gotta bump up the flavour somehow. Sugar, fake sugar, weird stuff I can't pronounce... I think you just need to decide which battles you wanna pick, and what stuff you're comfortable consuming. And if you are not a diagnosed celiac, get away from the gluten-free business. Very nice. Multi and fish oil. Brand doesn't matter. Pick your favorite. 

Even if the science is bullshit, the structure and the act of taking them each day help reinforce my other good behaviors. This is the best advice. My biggest issue would be the inevitable sugar craving that comes after. Not more, but I do feel oddly smug about it. Had a Crunchie bar today, logged it, and had a slice and a half of pizza tonight (also logged it). Everything fit into my daily goals, and I feel good about that. Helps me feel like this is sustainable. I don't eat this stuff everyday, but I'm not feeling like I miss out on anything that I truly want.Two servings of pumpkin spice creamer. Keeps the white girl in me content. Yeah, I'm trying to keep my food the same, just less sugar, fatty foods, and snackage. I just don't want too much sugar to be the reason I weigh myself in a few weeks and have not lost a pound. You can  do this! All it takes is one small step at a time! You realizing that you want to change and rededicate yourself to this journey is an amazing step in the right direction!I don't get a lot of fruit, but my main snack is a gluten free cereal. Why would low fat foods be higher sugar?Honestly, your starting weight is in the healthy range, so you're not doing bad. You might want to work on building muscle more than just losing weight? 

Unfortunately I don't have any progress pics available to me at the moment but I can check through some old backups later. what the fuck does that even mean?Thank you!I would,but maybe do it slowly. Not helpful for the mental health issues to be lying awake for ages, thinking... I would suggest getting your mental health to a place where you feel it's improved, and then tackle the weight. Good luck!Probably? I've never actually looked. It may just be a little hidden.That's the best feeling. When I was in one of my classes the other day, someone said "Whoa, I can feel your suprasternal notch really well." "That's because she's so skinny!" I felt awesome.Wow, what a shitty text.  Keep it up! You're awesome!A lot of shorter girls resort to 1200 a day because that's the lowest they should go to create a deficit and even then it isn't that big of a deficit. My sedentary TDEE is 1650... so to lose 1 pound a week without regular exercise I should be eating 1150. So that sucks. I'm pretty comfortable at 1200 now but it was a struggle to find low cal foods I enjoyed enough to eat over and over. It sounds like you could easily lose weight at 1400-1500 so I say do that and focus on keeping it sustainable for the long run. I'm your height, your age and I was 175 when I started low carb. I usually eat around 1300-1400 calories a day, a bit more now that I'm running 4 days a week and 10-20 minutes of yoga a day. 1200 is what I used to eat when I wasn't exercising. Basically just eat at a deficit and you should be ok. I wasn't and had to go low carb to lose weight but that is another story for another day.Congrats. I love my morning walks. Can't wait to get off the treadmill soon. Portland OR here is awful wet. I feel like you need a new doctor. I love the two therapists I've had. If your doc isn't a good match for you, can you try someone else? Thus is serious shit. Thanks I went over and read it. Cheese is my weakness too, even though I know that I shouldn't eat it! (I have an intolerance to whey, kind of like lactose intolerance but to the protein rather than the sugar in dairy). But I think I need to keep that in mind, that I'm working to have as healthy of a body as I can. For me, vanity helps with the day-to-day choices, but picturing long term I want to be healthy. 
Go us!Dude, no worries, be a hardass all you like. I like the flavour, so I measure and count my "splash". A little goes a hell of a long way, We're the same age with the same body type! I decided to try and lose 2 lbs per week, and so MFP has me around 1200 calories a day (which is lower than I thought it would be considering my TDEE), and it's miserable. It's easy on the weekends when I don't work and can go a little hungry, but I find it very difficult (impossible) to do while on the job. Even making foods that are low cal and fulfilling, thanks to r/1200isplenty, doesn't really change the fact that I'm tired, hungry, and crabby all day. I think I'm gonna try and up it to 1400, because I just don't have the energy to make 1200 work. You'll be getting fist-bumps and "what are ya working today bro?"s in no time.I like what you said about learning more. I always love learning new things and just more in general. Sometimes I find it frustrating because there can be a lot of mixed information and a lot of articles boasting the next best thing or the 4 tips you just have to know. There's a lot to sift through out there. 

As for me: F 21 5'2" SW: 150 CW: 130 GW: 120
I'm little and don't do much I don't need or deserve large amount of calories. I know my maintenance will be higher that 1200, but not by a whole lot it seems. I need to learn how to make it work, long term.Myfitnesspal has the ability to track more than just calories. If you feel you're deficient in a particular vitamin or mineral then work on improving your diet. 

Vitamins are a stop-gap measure and without knowing what you are deficient in (if you are actually deficient that is) it's really just a stab in the dark trying to cover off what you may be missing blindly by just adding a bunch of supplements. OP said her father was in the hospital for a week, she didn't say he died, although the point is validJust a couple of weeks!? Good job! :D My BF is 6" taller and 20 lbs lighter, but he's trying to gain and I'm trying to lose. I can't wait for the day we switch places!!!It's ok he is gay and looks great.Don't know what kind of medications your doctor is thinking about, but I've used sertraline, citalopram and am currently using venlafaxine. I lost weight with all of these and gained only because I ate to much. Stress = binging, but I'm trying to resolve this with running. Work in progress, you can say... 
Just want to say:these meds will not make you fat. Maybe you feel a little more hunger, but proteinrich and/or fibrous food can help with that. Choose wisely and you'll succeed! 

Good luck with your stress and problems. Try to work on your mental health: it's the base for loosing weight. less than 20% of calories.Both of these are awesome. Sweet potato and beetroot chips are uhmazing. fparty -- feel free to add!According to the personal trainer that I was using, visible abs are simply a result of being at ~12% body fat or less (for males). 

Good job, and keep it up!Sounds like you need to lose some more weight, or start working on them pecs.I'd just go ahead and eat whatever wasn't moving to fast for the rest of the day. Get back to your diet tomorrow. No regrets! I find it doesn't effect me all that much. And lots of people will tell you otherwise but I know what works for me and a buddy of mine. We are both in keto and schedule cheat meals. I've held my weight for 7 months (lost 65lbs) and so has my buddy (85 lbs lost). My doc has given me that kind of advice. Then we laugh because he's joking.  If doing the obvious worked I wouldn't be at doc's. :p

Do you have any progress pics? I'm 5'5", SW 135, but honestly don't know what my goal weight should beI've been struggling the last few weeks. Our kitchen is being renovated... I cannot cook. No sink to clean things. I can't clean things in the bathtub because the floor in there has SIGNIFICANT water damage so we have to limit our use in there until we find out what's wrong. I'm struggling to find mostly healthy meals that can be heated up in the microwave or when we go out to eat... I'm sick of sandwiches and soups... I want greasy easy fast food but I just can't... I'm hungry a lot! 

End vent thank you for listening. I know it's a first world problem and I have no right to complain. The renovation is taking longer than we expected and have not had a kitchen for 2 weeks now... Samesies. I am 5'8 and 1200+ my moderate activity level just left me hungry all the time.

1400-1500 is way better for meDo you have a scientific source for this? Can genuinely tell you there is no photoshop. The lighting is pretty good in my bathroom and I did use Instagram (obviously) here is the original http://imgur.com/8JBxX3UI was going to reply, but TreeFIddy1031 said basically what I was going to say, lol. I check my weight daily but make my official weigh in on Saturday. The daily weigh ins help me stay focused on making my pound a week goal. 

Take it one day at a time. Eventually you'll be able to see yourself thin, because it'll be easier to picture. You'll see the results and it will be easier to take the additional weight off as you get closer to June. 

Hope this helps!MFP invite sent. My username is Hotcops, because I was watching Arrested Development when I set up my account :) 


Your story sounds a lot like mine (F29/5'4" SW 200 CW 195 GW 150). This is the first time all the pieces have fit together for me, so to speak. If I can make this change, you can too (so very cliche but true). Best of luck! I did pre log. But I went with 10 500ml to start off with. And 8 of these were had a friends house before we went to a pub and a club. I did mange to drink JD and diet cokes when I got to the club. So I have that going for me. 

And I am Irish so those who think the drinking might be excessive, lets just say its not to far from the norm.  Maintenance is a bit scary. I haven't been 185 since highschool so there is a doubt in my mind about maintaining that weight once I hit it. I mostly try not to think about it for the moment. I have maintained 190 - 195 for large lengths of time so I feel I could do 190 but 185 seems like a bit of a stretch.But again, I'll focus on losing the weight right now and worry about maintenance later. Today was my aha moment :/  

[Here's the post I just made about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2vkxyp/psa_lets_remember_that_were_also_doing_this_to/)
I'd much rather not eat pizza than have a heart explosion.

This is our new healthy life!Ding ding ding. We have a winner.Poke a hole in the top of the lid with a thumb tack or a small nail.  Then you take a square piece of electrical tape and gently place it over the hole.  Then you use the ziploc ~~penis pump~~ [vacuum pump](http://www.amazon.com/Ziploc-Vacuum-Starter-3-Quart-1-Pump/dp/B003UEMFUG) over the top of the tape and vacuum out the air.  The tape works as a one way flap.  It lets the air out but not in. To unseal it, just remove the tape.  The lids are re useable.  Removing as much air as you can from the jar will keep your greens fresher for a few days, enabling you to make salads for 5-7 days at a time.Fellow emotional/boredom eater here. I'm fairly new to my weightloss journey (41 days) but I have a few mantras that really help me:

"This isn't the last time I'll ever have the chance to eat ____. Its not now-or-never." 
"I've had that before, I'll pass." 
"It's not 'forbidden'-I could have it if I wanted. But I'm CHOOSING to eat healthy and I am in control. My emotions aren't the boss of me" I'm a little taller than you and when I tried eating about 1,200 calories I was super miserable and hungry almost all the time. Which caused me to binge and eventually give up tracking what I was eating so I put on weight. I would say it is better to eat an amount below your TDEE that you can stick with, than to be miserable and give up. Even if it takes longer to loose the weight if it is something you can stick with you have a better chance of keeping it off.   Not sure what kind of cook you are but there are ways to make lean versions of those. No the advice was just "Avoid meds, don't think about food and meditate. "

I feel like I need meds. That answers my question tooThis is NOT being crazy at all. You might be tempted to just let it go "for one night", but in my experience that's a slippery slope. If you're truly interested in making a lifestyle change, you have to figure out how to work that into every aspect of your life-special occasions and family get-togethers included. 


So do your best to enjoy the night with your aunt while still being mindful of what you are eating.Get out in front of it by saying something like, "Auntie, I look forward to spending time with you but as you know[does she know?] I'm making an effort to eat better. Please don't be offended if I only take a small portion/have something else instead/ask questions about the contents of the dish."


I experience the same thing with my inlaws. They're lovely people but not very health conscious. So when we visit, I make sure and eat a filling, healthful meal ahead of time and only have some salad or a side at their house. Good luck!  Big change, you look so healthy.Don't like salad, I dare you not to like this:
http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=437615

(Broccoli, Tomato and Feta Salad)Yup!  It's a long journey and the lifestyle changes required for fast weight loss can be difficult to maintain in the long term.  Just make sure that every day you're living better and making better decisions than you were before you started this journey.Nope 1200 is not required to eat at. It is just the lowest over can safely eat at on a regular basis before one starts to see the signs of malnutrition, generally. As long as you eat under your daily limit you are good. It isn't a race to lose the fastest, it's a race to live the longest (by reducing your risks by being at a healthy weight)Heavy or 'whipping' cream, 33 - 35 percent. Has much less carbs than light cream or milk.According to wikipedia (I know, a dodgy source) the average height of women in the US (assuming you're American) is 5'4 so I would assume that that is the average height of women posting here. You are clearly well above this and this probably accounts for your higher intake need. I would say stick to 1500 and forget about 1200. It's probably too low for you. You are 'known' to the gym people. Next step is become good friends with them and get free stuff!This. Gotta get my money's worth at the cost of my health. Where does this come from?Eat what you are comfortable with, not anyone elseGood plan. I get free food, snacks, soda, candy at work every day. I'm an emotional eater. I hate wasting food. I am actually heading out to a great restaurant with work tomorrow and I now have my game plan! Thanks!You put it on one pound at a time, it will come off one pound at a time! That is an accomplishment. I looked at the clock yesterday, and said "YES! In two hours I get to go workout!" 


I've never said anything even remotely like that before in my life. I've always been exercise-resistant. So looking forward to exercise is a victory for me. Because it wasn't helpful or because you couldn't do what they were advising?  :).   Not criticizing. I'm in therapy and see a difference between the two. In my own case my therapy is more about identifying causes than changing behaviors. Not saying one is better (this is only therapist I've seen). 

From reading other comments it seems you eat 3 meals and the third is at midnight. Is that correct?  If true maybe you could just time shift a bit and have smaller healthy and filling snacks around. Worst case you grab something of those as opposed to eating a whole meal. 

Alrighty that sounds good... I thought that it might be time for that anyways... Thanks a lot!!!
**SO REAL.** I hate eating other people's food! They always add unnecessary oil and sugar! I just stick to raw salads at the dining hall.Congrats man, you look so awesome! (you looked pretty good before anyway).

That text your ex sent you shows me how messed she was. If a girl sent me that I would have a really difficult time just brushing it off and move on. But you did and you showed her!This is what bothers me about my lower stomach. I'm working on toning it, but I have a lot of excess skin. It's the reminder of how long I was overweight and by how much. I'm starting to save to get it removed though. I've spoken to a physican already and he wants me to get to my goal weight, work on toning more, and then making my appointment to remove the skin. I don't think I'll feel 100% comfortable with my body until that's removed.

Anyways though, have you tried lifting weights? Gain muscle, not fat, and I think it will help you .Fear and Ideal Protein may have been your starting motivation, but it's perseverance every day that helps you to keep going.  You don't quit, you double down.  

Are you logging your food everyday?  Is that part of Ideal Protein?   Try a nondairy milk, like almond milk, soy or coconut.I have recently started doing zumba myself, at home, and I totally love it too! It is the most fun I have ever had working out!no, never. If I eat a bunch of crap, it is definitely over my goal&gt; a splash of olive oil

Hate to be a hardass, but this greatly increases the caloric value of the veggies. Roasted veggies are fine, but they kind of defeat the purpose of OP wanting to make low-cal salads better.

Cooking in general also makes more calories available than they would be raw- but the effect isn't huge.

My suggestions to make salad better: add vinegar or lemon juice, such as red wine vinegar (2 cal/tbsp), fresh ground pepper, and a greater variety of veggies that you like, such as raw grated squash, mushrooms, or jicama.HALLO!Age, height, sex, and goal weight? 

M 51 5'11" SW:298 CW:205 GW:185 here... 7+ months on MyFitnessPal, Walking, and TOPS

Moderation is the result, but learning about this has been an evolution.  Like you, it started with no control.  Then tight control.  Now I'm learning about more caloric food with reasonable control.  My maintenance calories will be around 1900 a day, but I'm learning that I'm going to regularly have 1500-1700 days and occasionally have 2100-2300 days because life is like that, it's not as regular and routine as we would probably like to have it.  

It hasn't been an aha moment, but there have been little discoveries along the way. Just relax and eat/drink what you want. Make sure to tell yourself that the next day YOU WILL get back on track. Being healthy should be a lifestyle change and it's okay to let loose every now and then. Salad is easy to make.

1. 50/50 romaine/spinach 
2. Fresh Black Pepper Grinder
3. Fresh garlic salt grinder. 
4. A little Parmesan cheese 
5. Fresh RED onion
6. Cucumber
7. Salad Dressing (I like lite balsamic or lite Italian)

That will make the most delicious salad you've ever eaten. 

I got my ass kicked yesterday with my first training but afterwards I never felt so good after a workout since high school training. It feels amazing and the soreness isn't nearly as bad as I thought! I am for sure going to stick that and weight watchers! Best of luck to the two of us!I work out regularly, but also have MFP set to sedentary. Do you have your fitbit linked to MFP? I do and it adds calories that I am able to eat, if I choose to. I typically eat back some of them. Sounds good. A tool like MyFitnessPal can really help you achieve this.  Set it to lose 1 pound a week.  Absolutely, and the less weight you have to lose, the slower it will go. I'm really happy with my average - it basically ended up being 5 pounds a month, though some months it was barely any while another would have been 8-9. It was a healthy rate for me, though it did make it hard to see results unless I dug up my old pants.It's funny, the biggest thing I ever learned was to stop thinking of dieting as 'EAT SALAD" and think of things mostly in terms of eating less bad while admitting I'm just going to eat garbage. 

Like a large coke and a large fries are 820 calories. So at some point I started getting diet coke and a 6 piece mcnugget (280 calories + sauce). As a side to some other meal. 

Like that is a savings of like 500 calories. That is an absurd amount. And it's still not 'GOOD' eating, but it's literally zero sacrifice of any kind and is the exact sort of change that I know ten years from now I can still be doing while a breakup with a girlfriend or a bad day might make me trade eating a bunch of radishes back for eating cookies. 

Honestly because junk food is a lot of people's major source of extra calories it's kinda super important to be the place you focus the most effort into learning exactly how many calories are in each item and how you need to fit the calories into a day if you eat this hamburger or that taco. Because the numbers are so big to start with it's the place it's the easiest to cut hugely without real sacrifice or hardship. Cutting it out forever would be better, but we all know you won't, so figure out how to live with it. Thin people go to mcdonalds too. Its all cool, no worry, now continue your regimen. I just barely got into the "normal" BMI range as well. congrats!There's no caveat there.  Don't make your mental illness worse by adding physical problems to it.

What you're doing doesn't work, you're right.  There's nothing to "tough out" here.  You wouldn't tough out cancer or diabetes, and mental health problems still kill tons of people.I can understand that. I told myself the same thing when I first started out. For me, I'm goal-oriented so I set a goal of getting to a certain weight and going after it. The hardest part is just maintaining for me, since that goal is almost a non-goal, as where is the goal post, or finish line, when you are trying to just stay in one place? So once you hit that goal, you'll be able to refocus, though don't forget to be happy every day for the accomplishments you've had on the journey.Thanks very much! I'm male and I haven't yet set a goal weight, and only looking for the toned up or semi defined abs because I don't want to really bulk upI agree, I think that's the best idea. You can let her know that day or the day before that you've prepared a salad to go with whatever she's bringing. "Oh, I had all this produce I had to use before it goes bad"I understand. I'll caveat my post by saying I need to lose around 20-25 pounds total. I'm overweight by like 15 pounds. However, I really don't treat my mental illness at all. I'm trying to tough it out as long as possible but... I guess it's not working so well ehThank you. It means a lot. I am going to post some pictures along the way. I just found this sub today and am ecstatic. Yes my family members and friends are supportive but my mom is 6 hours away and no one around me needs to lose weight so it's been hard. I just went through a big break up (which looking back I realize was the cause of my weight gain.. Don't pick up others bad habits!!) and I am SO ready to get back to my healthy weight! I'm at about 164 right now with a goal of 130 and possibly a tad more after that. I'm 5'6" and 22 years old. I don't want to spend my last year in college being ashamed of the way I look! 
My issue with seeing success on this sub isn't the # of pounds - because let's face it, most of us don't have 100+ lbs to lose (ok, actually I do but I'm not shooting for that anyway) - its the SPEED of the weight loss. 

It's just not realistic for most of us to drop 50lbs in 3 months. Or even 6 months. And especially not in a way you can maintain for the long haul. (Not saying it can't be done, just that its def not as easy as you might think from reading this subreddit.)

It is possible, but you're thinking too far in advance. Those machines measuring bf% are notorious for being inaccurate so honestly I wouldn't even bother basing anything off of it. Also a lot of things can change between now and getting closer to your goal weight. I would say wait until you're sub-200 then worry about this.  

Are you doing any resistance training? 

This post is 100% tough love, but you need to hear these two things:

1.  At 232 lb and 5'4", you're still extremely obese.
2.  Your dad would not have wanted you to react to his death by joining him.

If you want it in the front of your mind, put it there.  The path to health is stationary.  It never moves.  You choose not to walk on it.Believe me, Im not looking forward to spending the $ on one, but medical circumstances dictate I get one.I think carrots are good with salsa. The crinkle-cut carrot "chips" are good for dipping.  Celery sticks sprayed with a little lime juice go really well with guacamole.Thanks. Never owned one before and this is super helpful!I don't want to describe my particular circumstances, but my SO suffers from a medical condition where they need to be 30 seconds from a toilet at all times. Inability to leave the house are part of the equation that lead to obesity, a treadmill seems like a good starting point.Wow, TIL. That's super interesting...and weird. 
OP, don't let people tell you that you're not changing your life if you have some Taco Bell every now and then.  In a way, it's easier to eat things that lend themselves to precise counting.  

You can get fat making every meal yourself out of only the most wholest ingreidents EVAR and you can lose weight with some occasional Bell.  This has been happening to me too. I'll rub around my chest and feel little bumps. Or rub my neck and feel little bumps. 

I have a skeleton *inside me*, you guys. 

Congrats to you for finding your own skeleton. :) There is a tool they use in cognitive behavioral therapy called the Thought Checker. the idea is to have your thought, recognize it, address what that thought meant to you, rephrase the thought, and address what the new meaning holds. 


For bingeing, this might look something like:

thought: I've just eaten enough to fatten a cow for slaughter. I'm Worthless, and the day - and my diet, is ruined. Eating more won't matter, the damage is already done. 

meaning: I hate myself, and have just wasted all my effort by binging on crap.

NEW thought ('Honest' thought): I ate 2 servings of lasagna, summer rolls, and a twinkie. That was more than I intended, and I've gone over my calories for the day. But, this doesn't have to ruin my week, or even my day. I can stop myself from continuing, and rather than going overboard tomorrow and trying to 'burn off' all the extra calories (and 'burn myself out' in the process), I will accept what I have done, log it honestly, and move on.

NEW meaning: I did something I dislike, but it doesn't ruin me or my day. I will use this as an opportunity to see myself for the strong person I am, and move part it in a healthy manner. Today doesn't mean tomorrow.Well, you're very swimmingly attired! I bet you look forward to Discovery's next shark week!1. Your ex sounds like a real cunt (and I'm assuming you aren't so into those) so geez, dodged a bullet there.
2. Somehow you look younger now. That's crazy and awesome. 
3. Sounds like you had a full life overhaul.  Great job! Me too. When I was obese and gaining fast doritos were definitely one of the main culprits. I always think of it like this. I'm not going to fall of the wagon, since there is no wagon to fall from. It's just me, walking down the path towards a new life. Your will has taken you 40 lbs closer to your goal so why wouldn't it take you any further? You've got the heart of a fighter and giving up will only result in you falling back to where you used to be. At which point you desperately wished to be where you are at now. Does this make sense to you? 
Diets don't really cut it if you want to maintain a healthy weight, you need to change your way of thinking. There is no wagon to fall of, since you decided to walk instead. 
Hang in there OP and acheive your goal!You eat it because you have not change why you are overweight.

This will help you do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNPND9FfqU
So instead of going on meds that would make you fat and possibly solve your mental health problems, you self-medicated with food, which will never solve your mental health problems and also made you fat.

I fail to see how this improves your life at all.

Regardless of whether you eat unhealthy, you're still fat.  Your body will still break under the strain of too much food.  Food's an equal opportunity killer.

So, again, the advice still stands: treat your mental health problems or realize they're going to continue coming after you until you treat them for real.  

As someone who has lost 100 lb in spite of bipolar disorder and while on meds, I'll tell you there's no excuse for not being aggressive with your treatment.  It's in your hands.This helps. It hypnotize you to replace high-carb with veges...

And it will also remove one of the reason why you weight to much...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNPND9FfqUYeah I like weighing every day.   But I what I consider to be my weight is an average of the last 3 days.  So the ups and downs are less noisy.  
But weighing myself everyday is a great habit because it keeps me aware.  I hope I continue to do this long long after I've finished reaching my goal so I don't slip back up without noticing. &gt; but I cannot justify eating a bag of Doritos while I'm trying to diet

From your original post.  Just saying.  I appreciate the apology just the same.Part of successfully losing weight, and keeping it off, will be learning how to deal with situations where you won't know the exact calorie count of everything.  Just don't go crazy and eat seven portions, and you'll be fine!It sure is easier to count calories/macros when you eat prepackaged convenience foods. Even cooking for myself, I tend to eat simple foods with few ingredients rather than making something like a casserole and doing the math for calories/macros per serving. My dad is semi-overweight, he exercises a lot but he does not have a good diet. I know he lies about what his weight to me. Once, he half-heartedly mentioned in passing he needs to lose weight. I said "Switch to diet coke" (he drinks two 20 oz a day or more). "Nah. . ."  
"Ok, eat less at each meal, I just watched you eat four slices of pizza, eat three instead"
"Nah"

Sometimes their heart isn't really in it. I love my parents and I want to see them get to a ripe old age, or at least see my grandchildren. But I also know I can't force anyone to do anything but myself. 

I understand how much harder it is with a loved one, but they have to want the change. It's hard but true Your answer helped me today.  I always get down when I only lost 1 lb or none and forget that it's a long road and to stay with it. Thank You!It may be easier sure but it doesn't lead to a healthy lifestyle once your have reached your goal weight. You will eventually go back to your old habits because you didn't learn how to change those bad habits. You will always end up choosing fast food over making anything yourself.  

That doesn't mean you have to give up fast food completely. You just have to limit it to a meal every week or two I have a keurig and I got k cups meant for iced coffee and they're pre-sweetened so I just drink those hot, they're amazing! Only 80 cals and I drink one cup so that's not too hard to add to my regular dayI definitely recommend eating breakfast and planning your meals in advance the best you can to distribute out your calories. Can you go to bed earlier maybe? Or try drinking more water.You're rocking them!!! 
[Here's another awesome shark!](http://cdn-ugc.cafemom.com/gen/constrain/500/500/80/2015/02/02/09/f4/su/pown3ol80s.jpg)Look for vinaigrettes and oils instead of chunky, thick dressings.  It really brightens up the flavors when you have your favorite fruity dressing.

Here's my main three:
Spring mix with blackberries, balsamic vinaigrette, slivered almonds, and optional leftover chicken breast.

Spinach salad with raspberry vinaigrette and orange slices, pomegranate seeds, walnuts, sliced turkey

Romaine salad with lite italian dressing, boiled egg, artichoke heart, snap peas, cheddar

Small back story, I used to be 265lb, went to 213lb. Relapsed during my move and eating in vegas, am now currently 232lb and back on the wagon. I know what it takes to lose the weight with most of it being diet but went you put in the work the weight will fall off, especially doing interval training like Insanity. I'm on my third day of Focus T25 which is Shaun T's other program but stick to it, his workouts are the best workouts I've ever done, my girlfriend and I get our butts kicked with it. Let's move forward and kick butt! Cool thing is if I lose 30lb it'll be the least I'd have weighed in years, I know if I stick to this program that 30lb is gonna fall off, I'm stoked.Mine'll always start with the little bags, then before I know it I'm eating sharing packs at a time. Best to stay away from them entirely for me. Would you suggest a better bedtime? I haven't tried it, maybe that will help?Like a quinoa bowl or salad for lunch , no breakfast, usually eat like chipotle bowl for dinner and then get hungry at 12 and eat again. I guess I dont drink that much waterI don't want to go on meds, I heard they make you fat. But at the same time I deal with intrusive thoughts all day about how miserable I am and blah blah

I don't eat unhealthy I just eat WAY too much... I use food to cope, which I shouldn'tFight the power bro, just keep at it. Fuck that bitch - wont matter cuz you are winning :DYesss! Congrats. You look amazing. Keep doing stuff for yourself. Last year I was 265lb, went down to 213lb. Relapsed moving to Las Vegas (good fooood!), went to 236lb the beginning of this month, stopped the eating out and am 232lb. I started Focus T25 for my workout program cause I know that interval cardio works the best for weight loss. Got back on here cause I'm going to do it again and lose weight for good. So here is how I lost my initial weight. Start with your food intake. Drink more water, cut the carbs, treat carbs like a poison. No pasta, bread, donuts, tortillas, pizza, it goes straight to your hips and thighs. Find a salad you like. Make yourself eggs in the morning, snack on apples, oranges, bananas...that's simple right? Learn how to make yourself Chicken Breast, plop it on the tray and stick it in the oven, turn halfway through, cook through. Protein is going to help you with those splurging urges. Start finding yourself alternative foods, I found my love for almonds, avocado. Plan your meals, make a routine. Basically, the majority of your weight loss is going to come from dieting. Diet is about %70-%80 of how you are going to lose this weight. Running is hard at that weight, well for me when I was at my heaviest, so get on an elliptical and do interval training. Whenever you do cardio, do 20-30 minutes, make sure you do interval training.One thing I do is to take some psyllium husk fiber (I go for metamucil sugar free). A big glass of that stuff fills your stomach, and makes you feel quite full. Added bonus, I am as regular as the trains in Berlin. Just make sure to drink lots of water so it can work properly. Very helpful! Thank you.Maybe you have high body fat and low lean muscle (skinnyfat) and that's why you think you look fat in the mirrorGreat job so far! I am sure it can be even more discouraging with "less" to lose, but really just as much to gain :)I was visiting with my sister in December and told her that I'd lost 18 pounds. I was holding my 6 month old nephew while I told her this and she told me that he currently weighed 18 pounds. Mind you, my fat wasn't as squirmy as my nephew nor was it as cute but it was mind boggling that it was as heavy as him! Exactly! I'm only 5' and my SW was 120... I want to lose 15-17 pounds... that's it. Some people lose that in a month and I'm still not there yet (at 109 currently after about 2 months)  it was really discouraging but I realize that it doesn't minimize what I've been doing we all are working hard to do this regardless of weight the end goal is to be healthier :)I assumed you meant the share bags too. I have a serious weakness for Doritos. In my previous comment I was going to suggest getting a 30g single serving bag if you were really craving them. I've had to cut them out completely. They're not even that nice, but I can't stop eating them if they are in the house. Salsa, Avocado, Tuna, Cranberries, diced hard boiled egg (like a chef salad), and Rice Vinegar. I either do one or the other in my salad to make it interesting :). I'm not a medic, but the UK NHS gives clinical side effect data:

Very common: More than 1 in 10 people who take Orlistat

flatulence

headaches

infection of the upper respiratory tract

influenza

lowered blood sugar

oily discharge from the rectum

oily, fatty or liquid stools

passing stools more often than usual

stomach pain and discomfort

sudden urge to pass stools
I use [this calculator to find out my macros](http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/).I will stay under my calories and NOT give in to after dinner snack cravings!!!I stuffed my mouth with 5 pieces of pizza last night after a workout, don't let it get you down. I woke up this morning, drank 2 glasses of water, made scrambled eggs/salsa and am going on my third day of Focus T25 after I get off work tonight. Let's move forward and kick ass. Cake is simply a vessel for frosting. I'll let you know in about four more months... :)I still see myself as how I was almost daily, but then I'll see a recent picture and be like "holy crap!". This entire process is so mental and I'm still coming to terms with my new self. I'm not quite done either, but I think when I get to that point it will really help transition into my new way of viewing myself.I also am an emotional eater like yourself. Once I felt so guilty for having eaten fastfood that I almost made up my mind to forcibly puke it out. 

I cried my eyes out for the rest of the evening that day. 

I made a point to remember this miserable feeling. 

Whenever I feel like over eating or eating outside food, I think of that miserable time and convince myself than I'm better than what I was before. I convince myself to eat to survive and not to pamper my tongue's momentary craving. 



Or you can do another thing which is pretty effective. 

When you feel like getting yourself some fastfood when its not your cheat day, take your phone out and find out how many calories the food has. 

And then find out how much you need to work your ass off to burn those calories. 

I hope this helps you decide wisely. The under armor shirt was my security blanket for the longest time! It doesn't conpletly flatten it out, but makes it look like you have massive pecks! Be pre warned, you will sweat more than usual with them and they hold in heat a little bit. I wouldn't go without one for the longest time, but I managed to break free of them recently.So let's put bread on cake?Remember that losing 100, 200, or 300 lbs means you first had to have that much to lose, and that even those of us with those numbers eventually have "just" 45 lbs to lose, too.

I can assure you, 45 lbs doesn't look insignificant to me, not with 65 lbs between me and my goal.  At this point, every pound lost seems like much more of a struggle than it used to.  The first 100 lbs were easy in comparison.Yeah. Three donuts is no reason to freak out. Three donuts happens. It's not a big deal. What would be a big deal is letting three small measly donuts derail your success. You are still awesome!Yeah...she's not ready. That's okay. I know it's not ideal for her health, but it's her life, her body. You need to respect that and not make her feel more attacked and judged. Take care of YOU. You can control what you eat and what you do. Lead by example, try not to worry too much about your mom and what you can't control. Today I will:

* Log all of my food in MFP.
* Do my full workout.
* Drink 80oz of water.
* Stay positive.
* Like myself and what I see in the mirror. 
* Be an encouragement to others. 
I'm currently living in Germany. Whenever you order "chips and ___" you *always* get doritos. It's not good, man.Salsa is made of veggies. I have cooked healthy food in the past.  Once night I made a garlic lemon chicken breast with some vegetables and she *hated* it.  Said it wasn't enough food.  She shouldn't be eating Fritos *at all*, even if it's with a healthy chili. :/Remember that BMI is slowly being phased out of use because it is increasingly unreliable since it does not take in enough metrics.You can't convince someone like this. It really is a realization she needs to come to on her own.

Focus on yourself, make healthy meals and offer your mother some when you do. No 'Have this, it's healthy for you!' just 'Hey, I made some of this. Want some?'. 

Don't push the weight loss thing, she probably feels bad if she claims she's feeling attacked and not so many people are able to start losing weight if they feel like shit. They need to feel in a good place, supported, and prepared. If you keep up your own journey, she may join you. Especially if she likes the food you make :PYou are right although I thought about this fat absorber: https://www.medexpress.co.uk/clinics/weight-loss/orlistatYou can do it! Don't be discouraged, I had some rough times too but it's all worth it. Join the club :)i needed to hear this just now. thank you, and congrats!Stay under calories! I seriously needed this today! We have the same stats and its been super hard. I've lost a total of three pounds since the last week of December though I work out 4 days a week and eat around 1200 cals a day. Its discouraging for sure but I just have to focus on the end goal. Thank you for inspiring me today and congrats on losign the weight! You rock!Veggies with salsa? Hmmm I don't know about that one. 

lol @ the downvotes for me not liking the same thing you guys do. Ahh  Reddit.Nope, actually sent this to a friend of mine who works in Photoshop for a living... he said it looks altered. It sounds like she's not really in a place where she's ready for change. If she's not ready, you can't force it. 

What you can do is be patient, and try to help her any way you can. Can you contribute to the healthy food in the house? Could you offer to cook some meals, and do so in a healthier manner? I'm not saying you should be slinging salads at her, but make a roast dinner with veggies, or maybe a chili (which goes awesome with Fritos, FYI). She might feel insecure as a result of your weight loss attempts. 

I know she's your mom, but maybe just focus on yourself for a while, and offer her help if she seems interested. 

Also, when I eat breakfast at a restaurant, I totally order white bread for the toast. Just sayin'. My boyfriend is taking me to a restaurant that has published their caloric information for each menu item. I'm going to eat at maintenance calories for my ideal weight, which is about 300 more than my current intake. I've been super motivated to stay on track with my deficit and workouts this week because of it.Yeah, totally, I feel the same way when I'm lugging comparable weights at the gym. It's a pretty surreal feeling.It just stands as different for people. I know that for me I'm 240 (Down from 248 a few weeks ago :D) and I have a big belly but my shoulders are fairly fat-lessWow, what horrible things to say to you...or to any human being, really.  I'm sure he has no idea what he's obviously saying about HIMSELF with that text.  
But his cruelty to you ended up being such a gift! Hah! Light salad is not good enough especially if it doesn't have any protein in it. For lunch I usually pack a salad with a chicken thigh. Without the chicken I get too hungry later on and end up pigging out. What I do is cook the chicken thighs for the week on Sunday and throw them in the fridge. Then I just grab and go in the mornings. Am I the only one who thinks the picture on the right looks Photoshopped?Either a little bit of half and half, or a decent amount of soy. Both work out to the same amount of caloties, both thicken my coffee enough to give it a more pleasant mouth-feel. 

Cutting out sugar from my coffee was one of the first things I did, because I drink at least two cups a day, but I did it gradually. First two sugars, then one sugar, then half a sugar, and now, no sugar for nearly a year. How do you know what serving size I'm talking about? Many are supposed to be single serving packets, and are still horrendously bad for you. Edit: Sorry, that was a needlessly bitchy comment on my behalf. Even with a big packet, when I realise I shouldn't, I *will* just plow through them, half-consciously. Great job! You look great! I'm only down 12 and can already see face changes and am so excited for more. BUT I'm way more excited about the prospect of the random sweating going away!!"The only way your body will change if you give it no other choice"
I LOVE this, thanks xI've tried to drink black but I just can't handle the bitterness. I do a splash of almond milk and a packet of raw sugar.Nomoreshortbreaths :)I'm the same way.

I filled a trash can with stuff that I couldn't donate but wasn't going to eat. 

I took the pain of that and turned it onto "I'm not buying any of that stuff again so I don't have to go through throwing it out again."My story is similar!  I would love to get back to that spot I was at years ago, and have had many times where I just lost hope.

Keep strong, and keep at it.  I know I am!

Also, I love the No Zero Days post!
There's a whole subreddit for it at /r/NonZeroDay Hey do yoy have any tips on monitoring calories burned for non cardio excercises like weights?Thank you.The previous advice we've given you is still what you should be doing.  Read the FAQ and control your diet.

Remember the erectile dysfunction part.So not only you look amazing, but you seem to have a time machine device of some sort! You look so much younger and healthier! Congratulations!
Looking very good, your hard work is definitely paying off :) May I ask at what weight you looked in the mirror and noticed how far you'd come?Dude, that's amazing. Last pic looks great. I'm currently a little over 200 lbs at 5'11 and my goal is to get down to 185 lbs and start working on muscle.Why are you eating a bag of corn chips?  It's not meant to be a single serving package.  If you want some guac and chips, eat some guac and chips.  *Some.*I need to know where to get these!  Super cute and kudos on rocking the crop top with it. :)Are you counting calories? If so (you should be) then arrange your budget so that you have enough calories left over for a large meal and perhaps a snack in the evening without blowing your budget.&gt; I know how hard it is to choose portion control over your bodies natural desire to eat what ever. 

I don't think this is a natural desire.  I think it's socialized due to cultural norms and a lack of awareness of successful coping mechanisms for stress.

It's a hard process for sure, because it's difficult to undo the way you're socialized, but it's not impossible, and it's not natural.Duck face?Hey, I'm one of those people that lost hella weight. I went from 365 to 200 in about 13 months. Over the last six months it's been hella hard losing weight. I'm at 193 lbs. I'm not eating at a huge deficit, and I'm lifting a lot more than I used to, so my chest, arms and legs look muscular, but still it's hard to lose weight now. I'm the same height as you and know what you're feeling. I went from consistently losing a couple lbs a week to not losing anything in a month. It doesn't sound like you're treating yourself very well by sticking to a good daily routine and aggressively treating your mental health issues.  Why is that?  

At some point, you have to realize that you're reaping exactly what you sow.  You're living like a person who doesn't treat their diseases seriously.  Keep in mind that it's much easier to lose weight when you have more of it to begin with. As you get closer to your ideal weight it gets harder and harder to lose. I've been stuck trying to lose these last 5 pounds for months!What do your daily meals usually consist of? Are they filling and nutritious? Are you drinking plenty of water?This is amazing!45lbs of muscle!?! Dang, son, that's some gain.Doesn't sound silly at all - I have only lost about 12 pounds but swear I feel lighter as well!
You pee it out, sweat it out, and you can breathe it out. Why water weight sticks around for so long and what mechanism triggers it to be released is still a mystery. One thing I've found is that regular re-feeds once or twice a month can help with water retention for some reason.  &gt;I do not usually eat healthy I eat like I used to my whole life but now I count calories so I eat waay less.

Okay, that's a good start. But even though it's true that eating less calories than you burn will result in weight loss over time, not all calories are metabolized the same way. This is especially true for sugar for which a calorie is more likely to be converted to fat rather than being burned up. If you are eating a lot of sugar or even trans-fat (read fried food) then your weight loss is likely to be slower than if you substituted those foods for something healthier. Lots of ways to add some pep:

A little of any of these will help depending on the salad.

- brown rice
- nuts &amp; seeds
- avocado
- feta
- pomegranate seeds
- dijon mustard
- green chillies

I've lost 4 gallons of milk. 

I remember seeing this page posted a while back. It is cool but actually holding that much weight was like wow. I weighed 340 standing 6'1

I lost a little over 140 pounds in 14 months and got down to 192. I followed a lifting program. I think I only did cardio for the first couple months and hadn't touched it since.  I got real strong and lost a shit ton of weight really fast. I ate 2350 calories 5 days a week and whatever on the other 2. 

When I finally got small I just increased my calories and my strength, lifts and size exploded and I went from that 190 in october of 2013 to 242 this month with visable abs I didn't have even at my smallest.  

You can get strong even on a defecient. To get big you need more calories. Yeah, but the recipe won't really tell you how much butter she's putting in it. Or cheese. If the recipe calls for 1/4 cup of cheese, how much is she really putting on? I'm not sure you can really trust it.Splenda and cream. I'm down to 2 of those small cream tubs and 2 splenda packets per cup ~22 calories all together. I'm working my way to black. I'd start lifting and gaining muscle :)I really liked that one to.
It is not PC at all, but there is a line from those goofy "broscience" youtube videos that go something like "you know the difference between you and a mentally challenge person? the mentally challenge person does not complain about their genetics..." There are ways around most things, just have to find the right combination. Dude, leave those things alone.  Make the change a 100% natural one you can live with and sustain.

A great fat burner is a brisk walk 20 minutes after dinner.  Seriously.I want to know more about this 5 dress project but that link is broken in the blog. Google is no help. sidenote, why do the 'after' selfies always do that 'pucker my lips so I looks skinnier' thing?  Well, i guess I answered my own question, lol. * 45 day streak on MyFitnessPal
* A colleague told me I inspired her to start losing weight
* Someone I haven't seen in six months told me the difference was striking (well, for 35lbs, I hope so!)You're doing great.  Good work &amp; carry on.  If you want to do a little more, cut around 200cals/day and see it melt.
My days are typically between 1200 and 1400. MFP gives me 1800. I think most of the reason I'm over 1200 is because the wine/beer and dark chocolate I have.

It's not hard at all to still enjoy the things you like while losing weight. People think you have to give up everything. My office is a nightmare.  

Every day is somebodys' excuse to bring in chocs, cakes snacks.

It's a real mix of people, including triathletes, but the food they bring in is invariably the worst junk-food.
Thanks buddy, I shall remember that! :) Two suggestions:

* Make your own tortilla chips. Take a tortilla, slice it up, lay the chips out on a baking tray, spray with low calorie oil , turn them over and spray the other side season with salt (a little paprika or chilli powder is lovely, or whatever you like to add) and bake in a low oven until crisp. 

* Get a mandolin to thinly slice vegetables, have them raw with salsa, or prepare as above to make vegetable crisps. Carrots are brilliant raw, parsnip is my favourite crisp, but you can use try any vegetable. Just mind your fingers when slicing. I got this bag of chips recently called Falafel chips, they are amazing and go great with my hummus.As a 100lb'er it's not so much the number (although goal-oriented geeks like me like numbers) but the change in your body and mind.

The mind develops a better relationship with food and the body follows.

Log it and see if your day can be salvaged calorie-wise.  If not do better tomorrow.  Unless those donuts were 3500 calories you didn't gain more than a pound.  Hang in there, you don't have to be perfect you just have to do better tomorrow :)MFP invite sentThis! Fuck salad. There, I said it. Roasted veggies all the way.Thanks for this!  I just complained to my trainer about my anxiety that everything I'm doing will stop working.  It's been 75 days and I'm doing great but I'm terrified that it won't work.  He told me that the one thing that's guaranteed to stop my progress is quitting.  What I'm doing is healthy and beneficial regardless of the results or how fast they happen.  That's the benefit of making healthy lifestyle changes.  They are always beneficial regardless of results.  So I'm sticking it out and not letting my fear get the best of me or trick me into self sabotage.  If it takes 6 more months or 3 more years to get there I will get there if I continue making smart healthy choices for myself.  
F38 5'5" SW 168 CW 150 GW 135175 lbs at 5'11" is pretty good. Maybe instead of lowering your goal weight you could start replacing fat with muscle.OMG a few weeks ago someone in my office brought in homemade coconut raspberry tarts. Two of my favourite things! So I googled it, and sure enough, I find a recipe online. OK, I can fit this into my budget for today! I grabbed one and savored every amazing bite.

Later I thanked my coworker for bringing in the treats, she says "Yeah! They're so good, especially since I use double the amount of filling and topping the recipe calls for!"

Goddamn.I wish it was warm enough to do that where I am. Hurry up summer! There is something satisfying about fitting a trend line to all that noisy dataYeah, I have to be picky when I go to Chipolte. I get a salad now. No rice, sour cream, cheese, no tortillas. I usually get black beans, green pepper onion mix, corn salsa, and medium salsa. Oh and by the way, I do the same as you as far as trying to keep my breakfast and lunch down to about 300 cal each. I try to keep my dinner to under 500 cal, which leaves me 100 cal for snacks (I'm on a 1200 cal per day diet). 

Then any extra exercise I do, such as jogging, gives me a little more breathing room to go above that 1200, or I just bank the extra as additional weight loss if I'm not feeling hungry that day.Beanitos brand chips are much healthier unless you're avoiding carbs. In the case, Pork Rinds.I hate black coffee. Hate, hate, hate. So I've just focused on reducing the amount of sugar I put in my coffee. Right now it's three cubes instead of four. I just budget for the coffee. I know that I'll want, at minimum, two cups of coffee. Period. 

If I want extra caffeine, I'll switch to a creamer with 35cal/tbsp and use one tablespoon for a double portion of coffee.

You might try getting flavored coffee. Coffee snobs decry them as the handiwork of the devil, but snobs gonna snob. I am always hungry late at night, so to prevent going over, I eat a smaller dinner. I may be hungry a little bit earlier at night, but I just try to push it to a little bit later. While eating a smaller calorie dinner, I make sure to take a few breaks and chug some water. I will usually go through at least 16oz just during dinner, and then I feel really full when I am done eating. Hope this helps, and good luck!!If it's something you can't take a small portion of, like, say, pork chops, maybe she wouldn't be offended if you ate half and took the rest home. &gt; only for those with type 2 diabetes

Fair enough, there are other studies and I just googled that one up on the fly. But there's also [this to consider about type 2 diabetes](http://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/statistics):

&gt;Type 2 diabetes is a common and increasingly prevalent illness that is largely preventable. In adults, type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes; the remainder are adult-onset (or adult-diagnosed) type 1 diabetes, a  form of diabetes for which the cause is unknown.

&gt;    29.1 million people in the United States have diabetes, 8.1 million of whom may be undiagnosed and unaware of their condition.
&gt;    **In adults 20 and older, more than one in every 10 people suffers from diabetes**, and in seniors (65 and older), that figure rises to more than one in four.
&gt;    1.7 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in U.S. adults in 2012, and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is on the rise.Congrats!! I am also getting there :) I am 3 lbs shy for my first one ..Forgive yourself. Learn from the experience. Were those donuts worth the calories?  If it happens again, have one and eat it slowly. Ok, thanks a lot.When I actually have coffee (rarely do), I'll put almond milk in it. You could also try coconut milk because that will give you the cream and a sweetener. Almond milk is only 60 cals per serving, not sure about coconut milk because I don't have any right now. 

I have a friend that makes a coffee protein shake. Maybe look into that?Ahhh, gotcha. That's tricky. Makes for a late night and probably a short sleep. I can see why you'd be tempted to snack! Don't give up on the rest of the day! Eat what you normally would, and sure you may be over your calories, but not as over as if you kept going like that. Mitigate your damages... don't make it any worse than it has to be. Everyone has bad days, but you will be right back on track tomorrow! You've been doing this for a year, one day is only a pebble in your road, not even a bump.Based on the pre-packaged type of bread available here, that seems about right. If you go to google and type "bread calories" it should give calorie counts for a variety of breads, but most of them range from 250-300 cals per 100g.Thank you guys for the tips, it's very much appreciated!So constantly drink it each time? I've sort of tried this I just get so hungry lolFor branching out - [this might be an idea to try](http://www.weightymatters.ca/2011/08/are-you-setting-your-kids-up-for.html) - just got this off another thread. Basically the idea is retraining your brain to like certain things. You have to do it over a long period of time, but it might help you. Welcome!  

Whatever you do, make sure it's right for you to do.  I was almost exactly your starting stats +100lbs but am now 100lbs lighter.  

My loss was by around 1,200 cals a day of whole foods and fresh veg.  I ate carbs.   All good.

Keep on losing!
