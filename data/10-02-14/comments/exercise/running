Why do you believe that?Bring mace and a panic whistle with you from now on.* A few years ago, there was a problem with assaults and robberies along the American Tobacco Trail near me (note: it still is a problem just a much smaller one).  It runs over 20 miles just south of Durham and just west of Cary and is heavily wooded.  After enough complaints and bad PR, the county/cities finally stepped up active patrols and cleared a lot more brush to make visibility better, and added lighting in some areas.  They were nicely responsive, actually, and this is now the course of the USATF NC state marathon championship.As it's not always possible to run with a buddy, I have self-defense skills. It's about learning how to recognize situations and being prepared to do whatever it takes to get yourself safely away. dont ever run with a knife if you dont know how to use it! Most people who get stabbed get stabbed with their own knifes!! 20 years ago, a female track teacher at my high school was raped and murdered while running by a guy a who escalated to such behavior.  While your report probably won't lead to an arrest, it can help work towards ID'ing the guy and putting him away when he goes further.


Yes that is what I'm talking about and no they are not heavy my very weak girlfriend has no problem with it but hurts like hell to get hit with. On accident? I think you meant: 'by accident.'Well on the back of low mileage I wouldn't describe what your experience will probably be like as enjoyable, not till after the pain and misery wears off anyway :)I really hate hearing stuff like this. This is so much worse then the typical verbal bullshit you hear. "eeeeeeeey girl, you wanna have my baybays???" or "EEEY YOU LOOKING GOOD MAHMEEEE, come here, come over here, OH YOU TOO GOOD?" What the fuck is wrong with people? If someone grabbed me, I would love to think that I would be overcome with rage and break the fucker's wrist, but fear is paralyzing. I would be the one dropping the pepper spray then spraying it in my face on accident. To all the men out there, its SO nice to have a male buddy to run with because this shit just doesn't happen when your around. Always carry mace. I never leave home without it. Different shoe. Similar but more cushioning supposedly. Nike lunar glide was the old shoe. Asics gel nimbus is the new one. For the first one, I am not at all focused and worried about time. I just want to (hopefully) enjoy the race and finish the crossing line. #####&amp;#009;

But otherwise rather [normal](http://instagram.com/p/yQPpRVg7IJ/). Idk he's not mine. Maybe he's mixed Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP,_Inc.) what you're talking about? Are they heavy?I'm 30 and you got me by about 6 minutes and we run the same weekly mileage.  I'm jealous, good job. Shoulda kicked him right in his old man nuts!&gt;The one caveat I'll mention is that submitting proof of time is essential. I would not want to start one of their races from the back corral. Check out the event page for the event you are interested in for proof of time requirements.  

I can't agree with this enough! Because these races typically attract a lot of new runners, getting stuck in a corral farther back can be incredibly frustrating. Even at the Star Wars Half last month, the qualifying time for A Corral was 2:05, encompassing a spread of paces that was way too wide. The Disneyland Half last year was set up better, with 1:50, 1:55, and 2:00 for A, B, and C Corrals. So definitely make sure you submit your best allowable proof of time, but also be prepared for a lot of people dodging early on. If you can get past the crowds, the pancake-flat courses are fantastic for PRs!

I'm right there with out. Should be 135, but I'm going to try 140  this spring. :)Not sure I totally agree with this. Running every day, mostly at easy effort, works very well for me, and there are some people with very long "run streaks" who quite enjoy it without injury.

I understand your concern but feel like you're a little too categorical here.As a female runner, I sympathize with you and hate that we (women) need to worry about being attacked physically for who we are. We should be able to run / walk outside without worry. I probably don't do enough to protect myself as I usually run with music and alone as I don't want to run with someone else. I won't run in an amazing park near me if it is getting dark because you never know who may jump out from the bushes at you. Agreed, per kicking, biting / punching / scratching will leave marks if the person is caught. I was told to carry keys between my fingers pointed out while walking around at night in the city (when I was in University) but that's hard to do while running (and annoying). And yes, tell the police.Hi all, 

My cousin had CEO of Spartan Race, Joe DeSena, on his podcast. It was a great interview, but I'm also sharing with r/running because a few of you had questions featured on the show and r/running was mentioned on air! 

Also Joe offered a prize for the podcast's listeners -- TWO FREE CRUISE TICKETS on SPARTAN CRUISE to a private island in the Bahamas! 

Just thought I'd share... perhaps one of you might be headed to the a fun run in the sun! lol
I have certain shirts that rub, or sometimes a seam just catches wrong, or...I don't know, maybe armpit hair? Something was rubbing on longer runs. 

Body Glide got rid of it immediately. It really is amazing stuff. I typically feel weird towards the end of the taper. I usually run less than my program would indicate and have always hit my goals. I wouldn't really worry too much about running less than your program indicates, at this point your primary goal should be to remain healthy for your race.

Did you get the same model shoe as the old ones or did you get a totally different shoe?Get an ASP they are easy to care and no matter how strong you are it can break a leg or a skull in one hit. Also can be quickly deployedI think I put Body Glide on head to toe before my last marathon. 

Barely chafed at all, compared to my first marathon where I was basically unable to move the next day. You're running too quickly. Slow down.Prepare Race 2: 3rd Winter Series, 10.3km, 28/2/2015 (sub-50)

If you are a coach I highly suggest picking up a training book. [Jack Daniel's Running forumla](http://www.amazon.com/Daniels-Running-Formula-3rd-Jack/dp/1450431836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423760494&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=jack+daniels+running) is an excellent training guide.I honestly think it's at least as much that when people convert, they tend to start slow (as you should with any workout routine) so you build up endurance without overtraining or burning out. The other huge benefit is that people concentrate on form. Most people in traditional running shoes just go out and run. In minimalist running, you spent more time concentrating on holding yourself upright. You rely on your core more, which takes stress off of the rest of you body. You take more intentional strides and avoid banging down on your heel over and over. 

Bodies are incredibly varied, so I'm sure they work better for some people than others, but I think the best thing to come from VFF/minimalist running (and this is coming from someone who tried it and went back to traditional shoes) is that it has caused people to really consider form, to run with their eyes up, strong core, quick strides, etc. instead of the painful eyes-down, hunched over shuffle you see so many people running with. That's a great thing, no matter what's on your foot. So its basically easy pace that relies on heart monitoring?I'm so sorry.  This worst thing that happened to me was when I was running at night, alone, on a fairly well used path (I'm an average sized female).  There was a guy sitting on a bench who, as I passed, both spat and growled at me, like a real aggressive, hateful growl.  The look he gave me, too, was chilling, and as he started to get up and move towards me, I put the rockets on and bolted faster than I've ever run in my life.  As I came to the path head, I met another woman just out for an evening walk, and I warned her about the guy, so she obviously just turned around.  I didn't call the police, but I should have.  I would second at minimum filing a report so that in the very least the police know that that's an area to patrol a little more frequently.  Totally sucks, though, and having also been sexually assaulted one time in my life, I empathise with that feeling of lack of control and vulnerability.  If you find that it begins to affect your life (ie: you don't want to run anymore, etc.) please also consider seeing a therapist, if only briefly.  And my best to you.  Awesome. Thanks!Awesome. Thanks!Haha. I think they lean into people because they just can't get close enough. All of them I've known and one I lived with and trained did it, even when someone was standing. 

Is yours maybe mixed with border collie or Austrian shepherd? I've never heard of a Berner with blue eyes. Must be beautiful. Also, you're lucky your isn't lazy! especially with something that actually pertains to the sub that I posted in: RUNNING
wow, no shit. I'm pretty sure if I posted in /r/runningmusic someone would have the same opinion as you as well. So you're point is what exactly? I thought this was an open forum where anyone can state their opinion just as you had. Fuck me, right?
Well I don't know what the hell the dog is trying to do then. Truth is, he'll stop you from running.

And he's not lazy, but then again he has blue eyes. That's extremely untypical for the breed. Maybe he's just weird Are you familiar with the French Revolution? The French military have fought and won vicious conflicts throughout history. The American military hasn't won a conflict since WW2,  and they didn't do that alone...My wife used to often. 

Check your iron. That wasn't the whole story, but it was a part of it for her. Low iron means your blood isn't carrying oxygen efficiently, which can make it harder for the body to function when it's under duress. &gt; Didn't talk to anybody the entire time.

If I feel the need to start a conversation at a race I usually go with "do you know what the course is like?" or "do you know whether the course is hilly?" or something like that. Or ask them about their shoes. All runners seem to love talking about running shoes.

Crazy bad people do bad things everywhere. Report him for your sake and others'. Yeah, definitely this. It is extremely normal to feel weird during a taper. 

A few things are happening. One, our body runs on rhythms. It's pretty well established science. You have a certain rhythm of escalating difficulty (i.e. getting into better shape) while training. Training plans are built on a rhythm of push-then-recover. Basically during a taper you remove a part of your rhythm, and you're just in recover mode. The body isn't quite sure what to do. 

So you're burning less calories, but probably making the same hydration and dietary decisions, and it's really common to feel bloated, sluggish, and a general malaise during a taper. 

It wil be okay. The science is sound. Get that body recovered all the way, and once you start pushing again come race day, your body will snap right back into go mode. I don't think you've really thought this through, and if you're carrying a knife you really need to examine this a bit more closely.

* Knives are lethal weapons, which have different legal and psychological ramifications for their users.

* Knives require a great deal of training to be effectively used.

* Knives require agility and strength to be effectively used.

* Humans have a psychological aversion to stabbing other humans which must be overcome.

* Knives require that a wielder be in close physical proximity to a potentially larger, stronger, and faster opponent before it can be used.

* If she is disarmed, she has provided her opponent with a lethal weapon that can be used against her.

Can knives be effective self defense tools?  Sure, with proper training.  But given their inherent limitations they're rarely going to be the best option, and it's particularly ill suited to a novice with no training or experience.I really recommend a few counseling sessions to process too. The feelings of fear and powerlessness are real and if you work through them right away, they are less likely to grow and be really disruptive.I'd say to always bother racing - it's (imo) the best motivator for getting fit, and lets you actually see yourself progressing and getting better!As awesome as it is he's getting fit, I hope it doesn't encourage other people to go for runs every day. Running regularly to get fit and race is awesome and cool, running every day unfortunately leads to injury and will just demotivate people.Some tend to herd when bored or not properly trained. But if you're running them and keeping them tired it wouldn't be an issue at all. Most herding dogs will be the best running buddies. 

Berners aren't known as well for herding. Most of the typical herders are shepherd and collies. Berners are pretty lazy. GOD that effing sucks. And is super unfair. Being a woman is awesome, but it also really sucks sometimes. For awhile I carried pepper spray, and now I'm really intentional about what time of day I run. Earlier mornings and before it gets dark seem to be the safest times. I also actually turn on the tracker of my running app and share my location with friends/family, *just in case*.

Also, run without earbuds/only with one in, and be sure to have strong posture and to look over your shoulders/take in your surroundings. It decreases the size of the target on your back.

Also: Having to take all of these measures sucks, and it's not your responsibility to take them or report anything...it's the responsibility of assholes to not attack runners (especially women) who are vulnerable and often smaller in stature. But because that's not a realistic expectation, I suggest coming up with some precautions to be safer and to FEEL safer on your runs. Good for himThis, and also, carry pepper spray with you or run with others from now on. Is mace legal in all cities in the area? I'm out in Santa Monica. It's generally pretty safe here, but very early morning runs and a lot of homeless/not-so-stable people around...This is exactly why some people prefer to run on a 'mill in a health club: safety.

Sorry this happened, and good luck to you OPNot that's it's likely realistic for you, but thought I'd chime in anyway. I run with my German Shepherd. She's so sweet and gentle, but strangers don't know that. I feel safe running at night with earbuds in because I'll notice if she hears something and she would hear it way before me even if I didn't have earbuds in. 

I don't expect you to run out and get a dog, but it might be something to consider in the future. They make great running buddies and help make the home feel safer too. 

to expand on this, knives really are the dumbest form of self-defense. 

1. very few people know how to use a knife effectively.

2. even in an ideal situation, knives have no stopping power at all--its not unusual for people to not even realize they've been wounded with a knife. adrenaline masks the pain and even deep cuts are not particularly 'catastrophic.' even a mortal knife wound will not stop someone immediately.

3. in a self-defense situation, you want to stay as far away from your attacker as possible. using a knife requires the opposite. you have to get very close to use it. this puts you at risk of being grappled and taken down. it is impossible to use a knife effectively while being wrestled.

4. escalation. pepper spray is not seen as a deadly weapon. if you pull a knife on a mugger, you are seriously escalating the situation and putting your life in danger. i think we can all agree that being robbed, beaten, or even raped is preferable to being murdered.no, but could it be due to layering in your case?
[Oh No!](http://i.imgur.com/VmrQR75.jpg)I feel so safe when I'm running with my pit bull mix. Everyone thinks she looks terrifying. Her appearance is enough to deter creepers from approaching me. Little do they know that she is actually a lovebug who wants to be best buddies with everyone :) &gt; Unless she has training, a knife is hands down the worst option you can recommend.

Why do you think is it a bad idea? If you stab them with a knife, most people wouldn't pursue a sexual assault any further if they are unarmed.I'm often an idiot, so the math still works.People often feel tired during their taper. I think it's mostly mental, a combination of excitement, nervousness, and fatigue. It goes away when the race starts and adrenaline hits.

As for shoes, if they're the same model, they should be fine when they break in.  Sometimes it takes a 'dick' to make you realize that your music choice isn't shared by the billions of other people on this planet.Indeed...

1. run barefoot
2. not run
3. run in shoes the wrong size
4. fuck the sponsor

Still, if I were to sponsor an event like that, I'd bring shoes in all sizes, just in case...Ohhhh so that's what I'm doing wrong. 
Just because you are suppressing a family member touching you at a young age doesn't mean you can show up to this sub and be a cunt! Op asked a reasonable question and got a good suggestion before your whale ass squeezed in.I woke up in the hospital after running a full marathon last march... I don't remember anything past mile 24... the official race video shows me stumbling to the finish line and being place into a wheelchair by race volunteers. I wear a Camelbak (marathoner) and had never experienced any sort dehydration. It took me several weeks to get back to full strength after that... I am extremely careful and slow down anytime i feel like I'm straining... My ex has a Bull Mastiff who is also soft as shit but, as he packs 58kg of solid muscle, he scares the shit out of a lot of people. He gets very weird when he sees other dogs fighting and always goes hurtling in to break up the fights. Seeing him run at them the other dogs tend to run like fuck rather than risk that he might actually do them harm..Parkour. Somehow I knew that slight was unlikely to get laughs, but did it anyway. Sorry.Had not thought about thatIt still gets into the air. Not to mention the splash back from him getting hit.  The stuff is super potent. It would fuck up the rest of her day. Better than the alternative, though. [Hmmm.. ](http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420748733005/French-police-012.jpg)I'm sorry that incident happen to you it really sucks! My wife is an avid runner and happens to be 5 ' ft tall as well. When she's out running and I'm not with her she carries a mini taser. It's the size n shape of a lipstick capsule. 

Also report it to the incident to the cops, for your safety and other runners as well. The longest I've run with my dog (Australian shepherd) was 18k and he was happy the whole way, with a few short water breaks. It's on a trail and he's off leash though, which allows him to go at his own pace and stop whenever he wants. But we'd worked up to it, he started off the couch to 5k with me so he had time to build some endurance like I did.

Also depends a lot on the weather: that 18k was on a cool fall day, in the middle of summer I wouldn't go more than 4-5k.Friend zoned againI (m) used to run in the Rampart district at night and my strategy was to run slow enough so that if I needed to break out into a full sprint I could do that at any time.  It wasn't a very effective way to train, but the added adrenaline really ramps up the runner's high.  This is my favorite sort of achievement!Hope you're joking. If you're really coming to the home of 35-minute 5k PRs, you're way out of your depth. Thanks everybody for the nice tips. I will try them and see what is best for me.Whenever there is trouble, run the fuck away. 

-All French People.  Ever.Probably getting down voted because that sub is a jokeThis is the stupidest, most short-sighted argument in the entire fucking world.  ***BY DEFINITION,*** people who assault others don't give a shit about laws.  It's fucking axiomatic.  There's got to be regulation, sure, but an outright ban?  Get real.

&gt;My goodness, it's illegal to own a handgun without a permit in this city, and they won't issue me one if I tell them that I intend to mug people with it!  And of course I can't lie when I'm filling out the application form, where would we all be if everyone lied to the government all the time?  Shucks and fiddlesticks, I guess I can't mug people anymore!

...said no crook ever.  How are you allowed to drive if your brain is so defective as to let you think that banning things is a way of keeping people from having them?  Have you ***HEARD*** of Prohibition?  Have you ***HEARD*** of the DEA?I really don't think marijuana advocates are helping themselves here. It's a drug that a lot of people enjoy, and that's cool. It's plausible that it could be a painkiller, I can see how someone could enjoy it on a trail run, and so on... But can we stop acting like it's magically different in these ways than other drugs? No one's suggesting it's a good plan to do cocaine during a run for the energy spike or heroin after for the relaxation. The pepper spray I have is a gel. Supposedly, you can spray it straight into the wind.  Also, make sure you get some with UV dye in it so the police can easily id the guy later.I felt this way. Loved the second one and each race after.I will add to the report it to the police calls. It's important to let them know about this. He will keep doing this to others until caught.

I personally have never been assaulted but in the past my friends told stories about a homeless man in Piedmont Park in Atlanta who would chase female runners with his pants pulled down exposing himself. They were laughing about it because they thought he looked funny trying to chase them down with his pants down. We explained it really wasn't funny and just because they were able to run faster than him doesn't mean someone else could. They never thought of it that way and filed a report.I am so sorry he did that to you.  I've been attacked too (not while running), and it's horrible and scary, especially when it's not something you feel that you could have prevented.

I wrote this comment last time someone posted about being attacked.  In that case it was also a small woman, and she was chased.

1) Eye injuries are very painful and very easy to cause. Hurt someone's eyes -- poke them, scratch them, etc -- and they will not be thinking about you anymore. We have an awful taboo about hurting someone's eyes, but if they're attacking you, you don't need to fight fair. That guy was already not fighting fair, coming after someone so much smaller.

2) A chop to the windpipe takes very little force, and again, it's going to stop somebody in their tracks. ONLY DO THIS IN A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. It could kill someone. Use the outside of your hand. Do it hard.

3) Punching someone in the temple will knock them out, and also takes very little force. You can also claw someone in the face.

4) In some places, it's illegal to carry things on you for the purpose of using them as weapons. But think about the items you carry on you while you're running anyway and how you could use them as weapons. Keys make excellent weapons. You could put out someone's eye or stab them in the throat. Your phone is pretty hard, and you could hit someone with it.

5) Think about situations like this and make a decision NOW that you will fight to save your own life, so you're not caught up in "Should I or shouldn't I?" when you get attacked. Be decisive. If someone comes after you, be ANGRY that they have the gall to put you in that kind of position, and LOOK angry. Yell and scream at them. It is not your responsibility to give the benefit of the doubt to someone coming after you. Your own safety is more important than the safety of anyone attacking you, or the opinion of anyone who might think you're crazy.

6) That fear you felt today will serve you well. Remember it! I have problems with this sometimes, because I don't want to be scared and paranoid, but I also have no doubt that being rude to someone back in November prevented me from winding up in a bad situation. Always be looking around when you're running, and keep your music low enough that you can hear. It's okay to cross the street to get away from someone, even if they're probably perfectly nice. Even if they get offended. I was robbed a year ago, and as far as I'm concerned, they did me a favor, because I am far more wary now. Use what happened today to your advantage. It's a gift, and it might save your life next time.    I'm so sorry. I'm the same size as you and always scared about these kinds of things. I have no experience with anything of this enormity -- I've been harassed on runs in other ways, but not assaulted. It might help you to talk to a therapist. Tazers are bulky, heavy, and affected by heavy clothing.  They may also be regulated in many jurisdictions.I believe a lot of people run with a folding knife, pepper spray and in some cases a concealed handgun. Luckily I run in a nice area so I don't have to worry about this too much, plus I'm a 6' 2" male. But I have considered running with my handgun for some of my random runs where I'm not in a safe area. Get some MACE.I run with pepper spray.  It's mainly for dogs, but can definitely be used on other animals as well.  Be safe.

Edit:  [This](http://amzn.com/B0007VM8UC) is what I run with. Not bulky or heavy, clips nicely to a running armband for your phone, or to your waist, easy to deploy one-handed.They actually make different kinds of pepper sprays just for this reason. Such as the stream pattern, which police use.Run with a dog, terrible people like this are much less likely to approach you if you have a canine companion.  

And please report to the police, sadly if he has done this once then he has most likely done it another time.  The guy needs to be taken off the streetsQ'est-ce que "la defense franaise"?My dog is similar, super laid back. Lawn guys came into our backyard and were moving some mulch bags to the front, after the first one she got between them and the remaining bags of mulch and would not back down. She thought they were stealing our mulch. 

Also, my dad was making funny arm movements and faces at my new niece, my dog immediately jumped in between them and squared off for a rumble, thinking he was accosting the new baby. Dogs are funny like that. Depends on the dog!  I've got a friend who regularly does 10k with his "pack" but my dog starts slowing down around 5k.  It also depends on how long you've been training with them, dogs will build endurance just like people.I was unaware of the sub. thanks for being a dick about it.Yes!  Some breeds are just not cut out to be running buddies, and even if they are, go slow.  Pups need to ease into running just like humans - and they need to be full grown!  I get really sad when I see somebody out running with a 6 month old puppy, poor little guy's bones are just not up to that yet.Can I still bring up the owl attacks? I'm going to bring up the owl attacks! I'd fight a giant kitten any day. Screw those swooping scalp taking night pigeons![I'll see your skunks and rabid animals...](http://www.ktvz.com/news/big-cat-big-fright-cougar-caught-behind-se-bend-home/31020166)That is shitty.  Will do, thanks!  I want to add a marathon to my goals :)Then I agree with the other posters. You should be fine. A 5k won't affect you for a whole week if you're already running distances farther than it in training. Runchaku.I think people were going in and editing other people's goals which is extremely fucking immature. I think they locked it due to this. Send them a message and see if they can let you in.

I'm realizing now that I don't know who "they" are so if anyone can answer who created the 2015 goal sheet...that would be the person to message.Tazers aren't super effective especially in the winter months. If one of the barbs gets caught up in a coat, then youre shit outta luck. Mace will effect her as well (hence why cops have to be maced in their training so they can deal with it) but it shouldn't incapacitate her to the point she can't run away.No signs of mal ware? Good to know! I love my Merrells!How long can you run with a dog? I've thought of this before, but I've always wondered how long the dog could keep up.Good but a little bulky to run with.2X has a bad reputation, I guess some ridiculous posts went viral from there.  But really, there are a lot of reasonable people on there with experience to share and help. It's just a big sub so there will always be a few extremists/crazies.  Haha, awww. I love playing with my dogs in the woods and fields - it's not a serious business kind of run, just a "dog jog" where me and the dogs chase each other around (there is also an outdoor obstacle course thing in the woods near my house, so me and the doggies like to play around that - I try and walk across the balance bars whilst the dogs use them as hurdles - 110 lbs of golden retriever leaping half a metre in the air is a sight to behold). Dora mostly loves playing fetch and football - dogs can go fast when they want. I always feel like they're slowing down to my pace, heh ("Look at this silly slow human puppy, we must be gentle with it").I wish I could up-vote this more than once. I only took KM for a year before funds got tight, but it was an amazing experience. In addition to the self defense aspect of it, the training is a hell of a good physical workout. Two one-hour sessions/week and I was spent at the end of each. So many benefits.That really sucks. Consider running with a friend/group, running with pepper spray, and taking a Krav Maga self-defense course. I know the studio near me has women's-only courses/classes. KM is pretty much all function, limited form. It's designed to get you out of a bad situation ASAP. And it's designed to be easy to learn/get the hang of/recall in a stressful situation.

Edit: By "limited form", I mean there's not a lot of ceremony/Zen/meditation stuff with it. There's plenty of form in moves/strikes/counter-strikes. Just not a lot of other stuff. Which is what makes it effective.Oh I know...my old old dogs, Todd and Jess, were a rescue flatcoat/collie cross and a black lab, and they were the softest things ever. One day we were walking across a field and this huge rottweiler came out of nowhere and started growling at my mum, getting closer and closer before jumping at her. Todd went into full-on protect mode, leaping at the other dog and fighting it off. It was insane! Such a big change in such a gentle dog.

My old dog Ted was also a gentle giant, and very quiet - he didn't like to bark very much (I heard him bark maybe four times in his life - at things like feathers, balloons and paper bags!). I remember walking along the path with him near where I used to live and this man was walking along towards me, giving me a seriously weird look. Ted let out this brutal deep growl - I didn't even know he could make sounds like that - when the man was passing by us. Something about that guy really freaked Ted out (and me too to be honest), so I was glad to have him with me!

I think Buddy (the golden retriever) would surprise me less if he tried to protect me - he's quite hyper already, and likes to follow me around and keep me company. Dora is such a chilled out little girl though, and quite submissive with other dogs - not sure how she'd react.

I hope your kitty was ok! I'm super paranoid about standing on animal's tails - only did it once but the yelp she let out was awful, I was so worried I'd injured her badly! (She was ok though).Choose carefully, though-you don't want to find you've gotten yourself a big furry bundle of hip dysplasia as a running companion.Please report this to the police.  Like immediately.   Don't even reply to this comment just call the police right now.  But second you need to learn self defense.  I'm not saying you will ever need it again but it is a powerful tool.  It will also help you mentally heal and give you confidence to run again.  I live in the south so all weapons are permitted but i just don't feel comfortable carrying them.  I know extensive hand to hsnd combat and that is my weapon.  Is it perfect? Nope.  But its what i use.  Find a way to build your confidence up and get out there again!!!&gt; folding knife

Unless she has training, a knife is hands down the worst option you can recommend.

Airborne irritants are far easier to use and aren't lethal if misused. Yes, please report it to the police. A similar thing happened to me a few years ago. It creeped me out but I decided it wasn't "that big of a deal" and didn't report it. A few weeks later there was a story in the newspaper about the police trying to track down a guy who had been sexually assaulting women all over the city. I regretted not reporting it immediately - it could have helped them track him down sooner.

And I'm so sorry this happened to you :( maybe find a running buddy or a group until you feel comfortable again. That's why places with strict self defense policies like New York, California, and Puerto Rico are among the safest in the world, right?Sorry that this happened. It's total bullshit and something no one should have to think about when they are out minding their own business. Was there anyone else around who could see what the guy looks like for future identification purposes?  

In addition to calling the police, if you are a member of a local running club I'd put out a note describing what happened, when and where and to let other people know that this happened to you. It 1) helps other people identify what's going on out there and 2) might get other people to come forward if they have had similar incidents with this person. This way, when you file a report you'll have more people backing you and it doesn't become a you vs. them situation.  

Again, really sorry that this happened to you.Knife is always a bad weapon without skills. I think they make a pepper foam that's less susceptible to wind. Add in a cell phone and air horn, maybe? Keep the earphones out so you don't get surprised, and keep practicing the French defense.How tall are you?  Sub 20 min 5k at 250 lbs is pretty awesome.  I'm 6'-1", 205 lbs and would love to break 20 mins.   I was starting to think it would be really difficult without cutting further, but maybe not.   
Edit:  This got me a little curious.  I made a few assumptions and plugged your numbers into a VDOT/VO2 Max calculator.   It may get messed up at higher weights, but it looks like you'd have a crazy high VO2 Max.  Your VO2 Max would be higher than an elite marathoner.   See [here](http://imgur.com/a/QmzeT).   Maybe someone can chime in that understands the Jack Daniel's formulas better.  Note, I probably have something goofed up, and I'm not saying you can't run a sub 20 min 5k at 250 lbs.   Nuts, eyes, throat, nose.

In that order.They sell multiple types: 

* Streamers, which basically spray a liquid stream out in a straight line like a squirt gun
* Misters, which shoots a finer "mist" outward in a cone
* Gels, which shoot big gobs (think like a hand pump soap dispenser)

Which type you use depends on your comfort level, but I'd recommend that anyone who carries mace make sure they get a refill pack and *test their mace* before they're carrying it with them.  You don't want the first time you use it to be the time you need to use it. Starting the program is tough, more on the pride than anything. The fact that you feel like you've just been on a walk for the distance is good, you shouldn't feel tired from an easy run. With enough training this HR will require effort to run at as you'll actually be able to work at that rate.

Your HM time is not in line with your 5k showing a weak aerobic system proving further that you could benefit greatly from a plan like this. According to McMillan calculator you should be looking at just under 2 hours for a HM, and I believe that is within seconds of what Hadd would suggest as well. I try to think of it as an investment that will produce lasting long-term results. Keep with it, in time it will be worth it!Supplements have to prove that they are "safe" for consumption, not that they "work"Better not get a herding dog though. My friend has a Bernese mountain dog. That fucker will try to herd you when you're running. This means, he'll gently push you sidewards into the woods. If that doesn't work, he'll run through your legs and make you fall. 

That dog is dumb though. Maybe he's an exception. He doesn't do it with malice. He just loves herding shit.Hehe, your dogs are super cute. I have Great Dane, and a big one at that. Gentle giant. Well, gentle most of the time as he's completely unaware how strong and big he is. 

I'd love to be able to run with him, but he always takes it as a play and starts cutting me off and pushing down. :)Exactly. Here is where she came, why second guess her?

If I were to guess, she came here because she's a runner and was running when it happened and wanted to get the perspective of other runners.I'm pretty sure I know the stretch you are talking about. I remember running by a real creepy building off the left hand side of the trail (heading out of town), and just thinking "yea, someone pokes their head out of there I'm going to be hitting a PB on this run no problem".Yea, a knife makes you run faster, everyone knows that!You should call out to people, I'd be ecstatic to beat and subdue a potential assaulter til the cops arrive. I know others would too.Or maybe that giving people the means to assault others is a recipe for violence.keep in mind that if it's windy at all, using pepper spray can go horribly wrong.I use to gift [these](http://www.eurasianet.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/galleria_fullscreen/NATO%20Spray_0.jpg) to my female friends. It's a small and handy thing to have and solves issue quite fast. I am a guy with long hair and goatee and old geezers tried to grope me as well. Being the main street doesn't mean guy is sane. But I don't think you should create some sort of fear out of this.His previous post: "Im super excited to announce that I have been selected to join the Asics Campaign"

Yeaaaaaa surely it's completely unbiased review.

I think you'd be surprised at your dog's reaction to seeing you be in a threat. I've never been in that situation but my dog was really laid back, used to be hit for punishment by previous owner, and was BFFs with our kitty. One day a guest accidentally stepped on kitty's tail and the dog jumped up and growled at the first and we had to calm him down. Only time he ever did that.Carry mace. Continue running. Be safe out there.That's her. woah, you run with a knife?!?  Where?  I'm happy to try to look it up for you.&gt;relatively healthy


I'm curious what you mean by this. 


[Check this out.](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/MyHeartandStrokeNews/All-About-Heart-Rate-Pulse_UCM_438850_Article.jsp) There's a section about causes of high blood pressure and I guess lots of Thyroid meds can cause it.Sounds like you're thinking of the stuff police use on crowds, not the handheld kind, which is... more like a pressurized squirt gun.I am a 6' 1" male and I always run with a knife on me for this reason. 

You should buy a folding knife or tazer or pepper spray, the best option would be a concealed handgun.

Sorry that this happened to you, unfortunately every human has the choice to do whatever they want to any other human until force stops them, so you have to be proactive and protect yourself. Bring force with you, so you never have to worry!An avulsion injury is SERIOUS. Get to the doctor.They call it a "marathon" because it's one of the options. They'd be two separate races.In addition to seconding the suggestion to file a police report, if it ever happens again, make as much of a commotion as possible immediately.  Start screaming and try to get anyone anyone who may be within earshot to help.  Not only may you scare him off, you may actually draw some people in who'll detain this guy until the police arrive.  Society looks down on this kind of person, and does fight back organically.Wow, that's intense! But, it's good to know that it's possible to do multiple races in a week.

I'd say I'm pretty fit. I run about twice a week and I'm to 7.5km, but I also do parkour and I think I'll be picking up rock climbing soon.I didn't get that implication at all. I thought it was clear that /u/32154234325 wasn't implying that they're mutually exclusive. I'm sure Runnit has users that can relate to being assaulted while running, and I'm sure many 2X users can relate to being assaulted in general. It's not too bad unless you go to the far north end (north of the Farmer's Market, across Rogers). The stretch between the bridge at Grimes and the Rail Trail can be rough, but as long as it's light out I feel pretty safe. The only time I'll run there alone in the dark is this time of year when it's freezing and the creeps stay indoors.Simply because you inferred it doesn't mean s/he implied it. I didn't realize why the comment was getting downvoted until I read the edit.Good to know! The risk of injuring myself is always there since I'm a huge klutz, so here's hoping nothing happens!My co-worker designed these: 

http://www.amazon.com/Fury-Tactical-Kuba-Kickz-Defense-Control/dp/B00ETPGP3S

They are light, comfortable, and easy to wear on your running shoes, great to give you some distance to get away.  Just a swift kick to the shins, he would regret his decision pretty quickly.This is exactly why I enjoy my 5am weekend long runs. The chances of being bothered are zero. And if I see someone, they are typically running or up to no good. Easier to figure out, especially when you can mind-fuck them with your headlight when it's pitch black out. Engage ninja stealth mode.

I'm more worried about skunks and rabid animals than I am some junky or thug.Oh my God. I'm so sorry this happened to you! I'm a small female too and am terrified this would happen to me. I was attacked in college walking back from the T after pulling a long barista shift, and I just went medieval on the guy, stomping on his toes and smashing his noes with the palm of my hand.

Definitely talk to someone, preferably a therapist, so you can work out what you're feeling. You can't let that "gent" take away running from you, or he wins. If it's legal where you live, get a small can of pepper spray to bring with you on runs and carry it in your hand.

Sending healing thoughts your way. That's so scary.Hmm, really? My mace doesn't spray like a mist, it's like a stream. Hard to imagine that affecting you as long as you don't run in the direction you sprayed it.Should be exciting to watch!  There's so many big names, I don't even know who to root for.  I hope Lagat destroys the master's record.First, I'm sorry that this happened to you, and as others have said, this is not at all your fault. I'm very glad that you were able to get away as safely as you did.

I concur with everything that others have said. Pepper spray/mace, running in a group, with a dog, etc.

Would also like to throw out a recommendation for Krav Maga. This would, of course, be a longer-term solution, and one that would be in addition to shorter-term solutions like pepper spray or running with friends.

But situations like this is exactly what Krav is for. It's not a traditional Eastern David Carradine-type martial art with wind chimes and meditation. Ironically, that's what I was looking for when I found Krav... but I digress.

Krav is about defending yourself on the streets. Protecting family or friends that might be around you. But mostly, it's about getting home safely to your loved ones. And doing whatever it takes to get home safely. It's not about fighting fair. It's about fighting for your life. In a situation like the one that you described, I'd imagine a number of groin strikes (knees/kicks) and/or elbows to the face. 

It's very intense, but nobody has the right to get in your space and certainly not to put their hands on you. Once that happens, you have every right to do what's necessary to get away. Krav teaches you how to do that.

I'm a 46 year old man who's been doing it for ~4 years. Absolutely changed my life. My 12 year old daughter started doing it recently. And in a couple of years, so will my now-10 year old daughter.

Happy to answer any questions about it.Wow, I didn't know this. It's been a few months since I've run the B-Line, but when I last did it was right after Ferguson. I bet you probably saw the grafitti, but there was a bunch of "pro-murder of white people and/or cops" grafitti on the trail. Didn't exactly make me feel super safe at 6 AM. 

I always just hope that being out that early is too early for the crazies to still be awake.Sometimes there isn't much you can do to prevent an piece of shit from being a piece of shit. To increase safety and piece of mine you can carry mace, a small taser, or keychain weapon. If those things are illegal where you live (shootout to shitty laws of NYC) you can get things like Kevlar knuckle motorcycle gloves (similar to brass knuckles) or other creative solutions.Yes! Pepper spray has a 15 foot reach, as opposed to a knife where you have to be all up on the guy.I started running last Sept and I generally run twice a week at an avg pace 5'40"/km.There are a lot of US cities with stupid officials that think preventing people from defending themselves is a good idea.How is that?This is why I figured it made the news after /u/slacksonslacks mentioned how in Bloomington it happens often. I assumed it happened in an area where the better-off folks were. Something happens like this in Terre Haute and it makes news regardless because they'll find anything to report on that gets people feeling uneasy.The issue with mace is that as soon as it's in the air everyone, including you, is effected. I wonder if a tazer wouldn't be a better plan. How is tazer technology these days?Angeleno here. It's the only way to run.The Fishers/Carmel area is pretty affluent with million dollar homes and such.  Goes to show that you have to vigilant regardless of where you live.  Crazy folks are everywhere.  That's pretty vague. Depending on the country in Europe it could be from "no knives allowed" to "open carrying assault rifles is ok". Saying Europe is very, very vague.Probably a crazy or homeless person. Just a crappy, random encounter and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.I have been followed several times. One guy had a knife. My strategy in these situations has always been "find people" and to run straight to where there will be witnesses. Stores, busy streets, once I ran up to a woman on her front porch and pretended she was my best friend in the world. Once I am with people I reassess the situation and decide whether to call the police. I was lucky with the knife guy because a SWAT team just happened to be running drills next to my house. 

Try not to let it put you off running and continue to be aware of your surroundings. I'm sorry you had to experience this. Dogs make running better! Dogs make everything better :)

My dogs are two great big softies (golden retriever and labrador) but they're also fairly large, which is enough to discourage people from trying anything. My golden also has an absolutely ear-shattering bark, which probably helps. My lab girl will drown any attackers in saliva, whilst golden retriever boy will coat them in a thick layer of fluff to slow them down!

Plus they are good company :) The only problem with taking them for a run is that they will invariably stop and pee on things, or catch a nice scent and stand there for five minutes just...sniffing things... :p

[Buddy and Dora](http://i.imgur.com/VUzyoIX.jpg) hope you feel better soon though!

Another bonus: they will [carry things](http://i.imgur.com/epGzbxN.jpg) for you. Also they're [really smart!](http://i.imgur.com/9SqcsKC.jpg)
And seriously, I don't know why.. I guess my comment was a bit cold regarding the situation. But it's not a reason to insult me!kinda, I've had someone aim their car at me and I had to leap out of the way of certain death. I had a guy take a swing at me because I ran up behind him, a dog chase me and bite my foot, and a kid chase me down the road with his buddies. When I had long hair I was called gay and faggot also had trash thrown at me. As I got older I've learned to read the people on the sidewalks. Giving a head nod and a wide berth or even moving to the road to avoid city crazies.Sure, but /r/running hasn't set itself up specifically as a support sub in the way 2X has. They get a lot more of this over there and they might have more resources to help. A situation like this isn't about proving that /r/running can be just as supportive as 2X; it's about helping the victim. 

The fact that your parent comment is sitting at like -80 just for giving an alternative option for support is nuts. It will get better, promise. 

One tip I have is that it's not just about conditioning. Part of it is learning how to run more efficiently, and part of it is learning to run slowly without introducing "braking" to your stride that wastes energy and makes the whole thing worse.

Also, use the fact that you're less tired after runs to increase either distance or frequency. The volume is part of the benefit of training easier.Also, run with pepper spray.Seriously though, why the fuck are you being downvoted so much? /r/running is a great community but it's not a support sub. 2X sets itself up as a safe place for people who go through stuff like this. I don't understand how it's inappropriate to link there at all.I'm 6 weeks into my maffetone trial. At first my pace was barely tolerable, but it has increased by about 30s/km so far. Stick with it, your pace will improve! It can be traumatizing, maybe she wants to talk about it and /r/TwoXChromosomes is a great community!What a fucking joke! Take that bullshit over to /r/runningmusicIf you put the first slash in there too, it autolinks the subreddit: /r/advancedrunning/r/music or /r/runningmusic would be much better for this.Generally speaking, an indoor track is "fast" if the surface is newer technology (Mondo, I believe, is the name of the surface), and the curves are "banked". Indoor tracks are also faster if they are longer- a standard indoor track is 200m, but some schools/facilities have over-sized 300m+ tracks that tend to be faster than shorter ones.I'm a guy, and I'm 6'2", and there's rarely anyone else where I run, but I always run with a knife just in case somebody tries to do something, or the coyotes come after me. I'm really paranoid though. I also tricked myself into thinking that zombies were chasing me one day (which was fucking terrible) so if that ever actually happens, I have a weapon on me.I bet later on he went to a forum and wrote,  "why won't she love me, "type postI think it's just blogspam.Get some mace, I've known city girls that run with it in hand...I'm curious what runners mean when they call a track "fast". What elements make one faster over another?I'd recommend posting in r/advancedrunning as well they might be of more help.Are you in the US? There are very few states where pepper spray is illegal, and fewer still where it would result in a prosecution if a woman running alone used it do defend herself.

I live in Massachusetts, which recently eliminated the requirement to have a firearms permit to own peppery spray. For years before that, maybe a quarter of the women I know carried it anyway with no regrets.That could be helpful against aggressive animals as well.This. Plenty of people here and elsewhere will act as though self defense requires magic powers or is too difficult for most. If you have a fighting mindset, you've covered the prerequisite. Pepper spray is easy to carry, and while not foolproof, is infinitely better than nothing in the face of an assault. 

Consider carrying some in a way that keeps it handy.[There's always something more.](https://www.sabrered.com/pepper-spray/3-1-runner-pepper-spray-adjustable-hand-strap)I run with mace in my hand. Thankfully I haven't had to use it. I started doing this when someone blocked my way then tried to follow me home.Can't tell if ad or review...

Obviously sponsored by Asics. try using your HR monitor for brisk walks, hiking, etc and see if you're able to get above 60% maxHR for that, if so then I'd recommend that as replacement for some runs as it can be more enjoyable than running so slow that your form breaks down

It'll help you get more volume in, and Maffetone/LowHR training seems to require some sort of volume (4-6+ hours, people are different) to notice the effects from month to month.

after 4-6 weeks you should see some changes, so just try to do lots of volume for a month or so and do a controlled test every month so you actually can get some confidence that it works. For me it was the only way to convince myself that I wasn't getting slowerI got chased by a lot of street dogs the other night (live in India). I think that guy was a regular creep you should have definitely reported him. -a break-in at a liquor store

-a wild goat

-a pile of headbands (30 or so) still packaged, dumped in the snow.

-saw a construction worker get an arm nearly severed. An ambulance zoomed past me minutes later.I've found shortening my stride takes faster leg movements and makes my HR rise slightly over a slower stride at the same forward speed. By the way, what is the MAF target HR? I guess I'm lacking context here.

Edit: Oh, wow, just googled it  he's the webpage I found that lead me to my current target HR (155). Oops, forgot his name. Yeah, it feels really slow (now). 155 keeps me around 10:45-11:00 min/mile.H&amp;M! I'm a big fan of their sports bras, especially for the price (9.99) I have similar proportions and these have been the best I've tried so farIn addition to this maybe find a running buddy or group, people are less likely to be approached in pairs or groups especially in a situation like this. I always run with my cousin or girlfriend and we're almost never approached by anybody. Terribly sorry that this happened to you.I envy you for being 24. My MAF rate is supposed to be 135. I tried it at 140 (because I look way younger than I am ) and I needed 8 minutes per km. My PBs are pretty much in your range. I did. Shoes were the devil for me my whole life, so I wouldn't doubt that having a huge effect on why the Vibrams worked so well for me.Definite possibility, but the VFF made the transition feel much more natural. It felt odd doing the "barefoot" gait in more conventional running shoes and I couldn't get it to stick.I'm picking up what you're putting down, but I'd been running for three years beforehand and hit a flat plateau.I ignored a nagging groin injury going into a 2014 marathon. The first half went great! Then it started to come back and blew up by mile 18. Those last 8+ miles were the worst. It took me all summer to recover. Be smart about it and accept that you might have to skip this one, or drop out.Here in the Haute, I feel safer on the Heritage trail than I do running  in or around ISU campus. Then again, due to my build/size I can see why I've not had many problems. As my SO says, I look like a lumberjack with runner's legs. There have been so many people busted over the head and robbed on campus that it's getting ridiculous. Mostly people out walking/"jogging". I ran through campus once and never will again. My buddy got jumped and punched by a group of thugs while running in Baltimore. It was near his house, which isn't a great part of the city, but certainly isn't the worst part.  Neighbors helped him and chased the kids away. I love my city, but unfortunately this time it lived up to its stereotype. Expensive, but top notch. If you're a Disney fan already I highly recommend their races. I've done the marathon, Tower of Terror 10-Miler, and the Wine and Dine Half Marathon.

With the exception of freezing my rear off at the WnD all were great experiences.Agree you should report to the police.

But for the future, you may want to consider finding a running buddy of some kind, you might be surprised how many people would be up for it, keep each other motivated and safe :) Oh don't worry about it! I was just mentioning that because I don't want OP to think that he has to run 50 MPW or he'll be screwed. In fact, OP's times are really close to what I ran senior track season (down south there's no such thing as "indoor" [minus the 1 indoor meet we were allowed to run per year]) and I had run 55-60 the summer leading up to my senior cross season.  Unfortunately, a poor decision to not air on the side of caution with an injury cost me my entire senior xc season.... but that's a story for another day.  PM me if you ever want to talk about how your college running experience.  I'd love to know more about it.  I fear I made a mistake of not trying to walk on my freshman year.Bloomington has a really large homeless population, and the B-Line has become pretty unsafe at certain points. Someone was attacked and nearly raped (she got away somehow but he dragged her into the woods) at like 7:30AM this summer- sun is up, trail is fairly active, and it didn't matter.

The good news is, the police are increasing their presence and I think it's getting better. I see two or three guys in cars or on a little golf-cart cop mobile as early as 4:45-5:00AM sometimes.I had to ask myself what the hell the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had to do with this comment until I back tracked and realized my mistake.I know the local running store here organizes twice weekly group runs. If it was me, I would find it difficult to run alone again for a while, and it would help to have a group.

Not saying you *should* run in a group, just saying if you *wanted* to run with others for your own peace of mind for a while, you have options.That's crazy honestly. I didn't know it was that frequent down there, I never hear of these things happening around us. But then again, I'm not surprised either. I can say I've noticed an increased amount of female participants are using gu/gels.Amazing that it made the news- someone on the B-Line Trail in Bloomington (about an hour south of Indianapolis) gets attacked every month or so. I don't think it even makes the news anymore.That is definitely worth a thought. When I am able to get a dog a nice big one is my plan :) &gt; Hey thanks so much guys, very helpful stuff!

Exactly how helpful was it? Was it:

A. Very helpful

B. Quite helpful

C. Slightly helpful

D. Not helpful

E. Very unhelpfulIn addition to suggestions others have mentioned, running with a dog may be helpful. I run with a big black dog who looks scary to people -- a boxer or lab or similar dog makes a pretty good running buddy. You don't have to have your own dog. In my city, the animal shelter will let volunteers take dogs out for exercise -- or a friend may have a dog who would enjoy it as well.As someone who lives where none of your self-defense options are legal (technically "bear spray" is legal here, though pepper spray is not...there aren't a lot of bears in a city of 2.5 million) sometimes I just have to avoid certain areas (or only run there with a friend), curtail my early morning/late evening running (so I'm running where there are more likely to be other people around), cross the street if someone looks like they might be blocking the sidewalk on purpose, etc.  Self-defense sounds like a great idea but without training/practice, a person is likely to freeze and not be able to handle a threat even with some kind of weapon.

It isn't a perfect world out there, be safe, be careful, but don't let that stop your running if it is something you love. 

I have had similar experiences running. Used to go to the fields at varsity and run around them in the evenings when it was cooler. There are usually people around, but the one day I got there late and it was a bit dark and there was only myself and a guy there. When I ran past him, he was sitting on a bench and started calling to me while jacking off. I ran to my car and he followed me, but fortunately there were people around and he disappeared. I was determined not to be put off by the experience, so went again a few days later, but with a friend. He was there again, and followed us to our cars, but once again there were other people around and he vanished. A few months later a guy chased me around the field there one evening, same situation, there was no one around. 

Fortunately its never got further than just those few scares, but if there's anything I've learnt from the experiences, it's to go running somewhere where there are people around, and go when it's light. The place I go to now is near an old age home, and there are lots of people walking there dogs there in the evenings, which helps, and I make sure I'm not our there once the sun has gone down. This sucks.

Report this to the police. the odd are you are not the first to experience harassment in area that you were. Its worth your time.

The other thing is be prepared. Pepper spay was invented for just such an event.

I am a 6'2" 200 lbs man. I carry and have used non lethal deterrents in the past. I It's not a sign of fear. it just how I have learned to live.

Well time to go out and patent the pepper spray arm band attachment for runners.

I think this is overly cautious. 

4 months is more than adequate for someone with a starting aerobic base. I've run strictly at maffetone heart rate now for almost a year. I think it's the perfect heart rate to have you run forever. A trick is to really focus on shortening your stride. Like everyone said first things first the police. If mace is legal where you are consider that as an option, but make sure you know how to use it and can get access to it quickly. Nothing worse than accidentally macing yourself in a panic situation. Consider a rape alarm as an option as well.

 The best solution is to find a group to run with if you can. It also makes training more fun and you go FASTER.

Also never forget the pod shot option.This is extremely common. 

It takes a couple weeks to get to what you used to consider easy pace. Then more to get more efficient. 

Clearly you do not have to do it, that is your choice. Can confirm effectiveness; have been sprayed ear to ear with it.Jumping on the "file a police report" bandwagon.  You were assaulted, this is absolutely imperative.  You know where you were, you probably can give a good description of the perve and what he was wearing.  The sooner the better.

As for what to do, I'd suggest avoiding that street for a while.  And, as always when running: safety first (wear clothing that can be easily seen, if running in the dark, wear a small light somewhere on your person so cars can see you, try to run in well-lit areas, if possible when other people are around - though I know they clutter up the sidewalk, etc.).  If you can, consider running with a friend for your next couple of runs.  I'm the first person to say that the world should be a place where we can be safe wherever we are, doing whatever we want to be doing and wearing whatever we please....but this is the real world, not a perfect one.People are awesome, just look at how many people are trying to help right now!That is true, thanks :) I was just thinking now how scared I am of people but you make a good point. Thanks. Funny thing is it was in the afternoon on the main street of my city. I couldn't have done much more to ensure my safety. I think that's what is concerning me. I don't blame other people for startling me; I just bristled at the thought that people who have passed me think I was ignoring my environment and think negatively of me. I don't look disabled, and even after talking with me for five minutes, a stranger probably notices something is different about me, but unless they're autistic or an autism expert, their mind doesn't jump to "disability" or "autism", but rather "she's a bit daft" or "she's smart" or "she's rude" (when I don't realize someone is talking to me and so don't respond) or "she's stoned".

I just wanted to alert people that not everyone who appears to not be paying attention actually isn't.Pretty sure its not legal here unfortunately. It would be a good backup. My SO is similar. She's 20 yrs/old &amp; pretty healthy, yet her avg. HR is regularly above 170 on her runs, sometimes reaching upwards of 185. While the 220-age is a decent metric for your average person, every heart is a bit different. If you naturally have a high HR, that's fine. I would, however, consult your physician to see if he/she can identify any connections between your health, medications and your HR that I cannot.This is awful, i'm sorry you had to go through that. Don't lose hope in people though; when your out always remember that for every bad person, there are dozens who will help you out. Be cautious, but don't let this ruin your faith in peopleFile a police report. People who do stuff like this can, and often do, escalate to rape. If the guy was very old, like 70, he may have dementia, but that doesn't give him an excuse to hurt you or make him less dangerous.

If legal where you live, carry a pepper spray or a knife when you run. Try to find a more populated place to run.It was during the afternoon on a busy road in the area. Dude was pretty drunk and was part of a population considered to have social problems in my country. He kinda turned up all of a sudden. It was a really weird situation. #####&amp;#009;

&gt;__Crohn's disease__, also known as __Crohn syndrome__ and __regional enteritis__, is a type of [inflammatory bowel disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease) (IBD) that may affect any part of the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) from [mouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth) to [anus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus).  [Symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptoms) often include: [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), [diarrhea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea) (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), [fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever) and [weight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss).   Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include: [anemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia), [skin rashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_rashes), [arthritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis), [inflammation of the eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis), and [tiredness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical\)). The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as [pyoderma gangrenosum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyoderma_gangrenosum) or [erythema nodosum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_nodosum). [Bowel obstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction) also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of [bowel cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_cancer).

It's a really rough disease and we're still not quite sure what's going on. Here's a [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease) for you. Thanks for this discussion, juddbagley.   Chondromalacia ended my running career several years ago, although I'm not symptomatic as you.  I run about five miles a week but wish I could do a lot more. 

The link you provide is from 2009.  Betcha there's been further advancement in the technology and surgical technique since then. 

Sounds like you've already spoken to more than one orthopedists on this subject, and all said that running again is out of the question? 

Hopefully we'll get some other contributors to this thread with some personal experience in partial and total knee replacements and if they were able to run again. I just got the one with the hand strap as well! Now to test it out and to start carrying it with me!I'll be hitting 45 this summer and I know I can run faster. It just takes time. Hang in there and keep running.Thirding. Don't leave home without it. Safe to use on loose dogs too.People improve with Maffetone's training. So, it works.

People improve without Maffetone's training. So, it's not the only thing that works.

You have to choose what you want to do.She could also find support here.I actually assumed people would read the article because I thought it was interesting. Crazy assumption I guess.I just wanted to let you know that what you are experiencing now, I will be doing this spring. Starting over and running based on HR. I know I will have to walk at times, but people say that this is better than running too fast (which I've done by the way and over trained and not gotten faster just more injury prone). I'd say keep it up and see how it works for at least a few months and keep us posted on your progress.As others have said, report it to the police. He may have done this before/plan to do it again.

Second, research the legality of it in your area and pick up something for self-defense. Knife/pepper spray/stun gun, whatever you prefer. You shouldn't have to carry something like that to feel safe, but there's some pretty awful people out there.The hell is wrong with people. Go to the police. Report it. Carry a little clip on mace and rock that asshole if it happened again. Don't give up running.Seconding the pepper spray. I got some with that hand strap after I got out of an abusive relationship and it made me feel a lot more confident about running alone.
Foremost I feel for you. You should not have to experience this for doing what you love.  
Please don't have fear to run, please don't fear all men. Sexual assaulters are, after all, very rare isolated cases.  


On a sidenote: a friend of mine moved to a big city that is somewhat less safe then were we came from.  
I gave her a pepperspray and blinding flashlight. It makes her feel safe while she runs. Fortunately she has not had to use it.Or shoe companies have more money.  That's one thing about lawsuits -- if the company or person doesn't have any money, you're not going to get much for all the time and money spent on the suit.  Lots of companies get away with shit because they have nothing to take in a suit.  The fly by night contractors who pop up after a storm are famous examples.  Suing is pointless because it's a guy with a truck and a few tools.  Sue him and he declares bankruptcy and changes the name of his company to something else.Without telling us how fast you run, it's not easy to say. What's Crohn's? Also, is your thyroid producing too much or too little?First, this was not your fault at all. Doesn't matter if it was at night, or anything else. This is 100% not your fault. I am so sorry that happened to you. What that man did is totally wrong and unacceptable. 

As others mentioned, if you feel comfortable, you should contact the police. The man who did this needs to be stopped. You can think about self-protection later, but for now, be safe, and contact the police. I've always heard how dangerous a place Cape Town is, I never realized it was so beautiful.I'm so sorry you had to experience that. 2 women were sexually assaulted last year in my city (Milan, Italy). Now I only run that same route to make sure something like this doesn't happen again (Runner Vigilante?) 
Keep running and keep getting stronger, nothing will stop you! Call cops. Let them know about it. He may have done it to others in the area. Let's hope his behaviour doesn't escalate into a worse outcome for someone else.I'd recommend keeping your heart rate lower.  Maybe do a longer slower run or just do less in general.  Maximum heart rate for your age is supposed to be 200.  85% is 170.  Maybe try to stay around 170 for now.Yeah they force a runner to have impeccable technique. With bad form in minimal footwear an injury is a given. Did you run around a lot barefoot as a kid? Some people do seem to have naturally strong feet and calves, and natural biomechanics for barefoot running. Personally I was flat footed and a little bow legged (both improved since barefoot), and there was definitely an adjustment period. If I wore running shoes I could run faster for longer than I do barefoot. Shoes store energy and push back off like little trampolines attached to the feet. They totally alter the experience of running. lol..you know it is going to be $8 - $9. Not much to wait around for.

Oh, and did they really damage you or your feet? (If so, TMTS) Or did you just want to try to get some money back for the sake of it? Yes, please report this to the police.
Also, you can find support on /r/TwoXChromosomes 

Edit: No idea why I'm getting downvoted.. I just wanted to help and redirect her to a more relevant subreddit (I read similar stories and the community was very supporting). I hope she's ok and I am sorry this happened. Also, running with pepper spray, a dog or a buddy might resolve the problem BUT NOT the cause. This guy needs to be arrested!This type of thing happens to people, regardless of whether they were running. You should not give up on running, or going outside as a whole for this isolated incident.

Like others said, report this to the police, use whatever details you can: time, location, clothes etc. Try to write them down or such as soon as possible to best accommodate the police.

If you feel not safe running there again, just pick a different path, freshen up your repertoire, don't let this get you down. Glad you got away.. what a terrible thing to happen!  I just found this pepper spray online designed for runners.  Maybe you could take something like that with you for when you don't run in groups.

http://www.amazon.com/SABRE-RED-Pepper-Spray-Protection/dp/B00Q6RTPMUugh, awful stuff.

I should say that I have no training or experience or credentials on anything like this.. but my general recommendation would be to immediately report this to the police. From what you have written, it was clearly an attempted sexual assault from somebody that could easily strike again. 

Second, I would recommend talking to a therapist/professional ASAP. 


That's purely from a layman's perspective. More generally,  I'm sorry OP-- so unfair that something like this should go down when you are doing something so associated with good health, exercise and overall well-being. Hope  you can get through this and eventually are able to lace up and get back out there.. safely.
I cured my flat footedness wearing minimal footwear and running barefoot. That's all the evidence I need. Slower, yes. More injury prone? Not really unless they run through the pain. Have you reported it to the police? If not, go do that. 

And sorry that happened to you. That is disgusting. Sorry you had to deal with assault like that. Any chance you can run in a group or at least when there is more people out? If you think you might be able to overcome your social anxieties if you had a supportive training group, you should consider looking around for run clubs, especially ones that offer "intro-to-running" type experiences for newbies.  Unless you really don't plan on enjoying running and are only considering it for health purposes as the easiest cardio option you can think of.  I have never run with any training group (I *have* run with social groups that don't fit this mold) that wasn't extremely polite, friendly, welcoming and helpful to folks who had never run before but wanted to give it an honest go.  This guy is a member of my run club, to give you an idea (he can only run about 3mi @15:00/mi pace right now): http://support.smiletrain.org/site/TR?px=3539047&amp;fr_id=1480&amp;pg=personalAnother option, if he/she has a car, is to go to a rural area and get into trail running/hiking/walking.  Few people, hooray nature, and a lot more fun than a treadmill.Sweet thanks Both of you.By comparison, my "normal person" workout yesterday not at altitude was 7.5mi very easy (8:20ish) in the morning, then a 1mi warmup in the evening followed by 6x800 in: 2:55, 2:52, 2:57, 2:53, 3:13, 2:43.  I simply cannot fathom what they did.  I also can't fathom being an olympic medalist, though, so.........In fact he's gonna get there in slightly less than fifteen minutesOP meaning the person who wrote the article and headline? I'd recommend shock absorber bras. They're pretty much the only ones I'll buy. Really good quality. Can buy them off Amazon or sometimes sports shops sell them too. Try posting in /r/ABraThatFits they might have some good suggestions as well A granola bar and half a cup of water.  
I like these: http://www.walmart.com/ip/24017595?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;adid=22222222227017328721&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=40888268912&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;wl6=78818346272&amp;veh=sem

In general, I wait 2-3 hours after a full meal before running.  You are eating way too much and only giving yourself an hour to digest it.  Since it hasn't gone away for 2 weeks, maybe you should see a doctor...Ah okMaybe that headline isn't directly misleading, but OP knew damn well what everyone was going to assume.OMG JUST LIEK CROCS RITE??When it comes to racing I believe it does. That's why sprinter's spikes are nearly completely rigid, mid-D spikes less so, distance spikes even less. But all are more rigid than a pair of normal trainers. Yeah, normally lawyers are really loose lipped about clients involved in cases they have nothing to do with.So wait, you claim that the rigidity of the sole affects the power of your stride?Probably something like 2-3 miles jogging, a few strides, and some dynamic stretching drills. I was saying that racing flats are more rigid and responsive, not minimal shoes in general.It's not that Adidas fucked up, was Bikila was filling in for someone who dropped out lat minute.Since Adidas didn't allow him to run in his own shoes because they were the sponsor, and they didn't have a right size, Bikila didn't have many options.Thanks for getting back to me, and sorry for the slow reply, works kept me busy the last few days.

When you say up my milage slowly, what can you recommend? I was running between 3-7 miles per sessions before injury struck...three times a week.

Ys, running on asphalt and concrete requires padding.I'll come too to throw my 10 pair at you.Yeah that's what I thought months back and so I consciously try and keep virtually all of my runs at a very slow pace, doing speedwork once per week at absolute max and only after several weeks. Perhaps even that is too muchJust a matter of time before someone to claims they're a descendent of Greek Gods and sues Nike.  That's the thing. I start off with a very low weekly mileage (15 miles) and I only increase by 1 mile per week at max. Furthermore I seem to be the only person in my club who actually consciously tries to go slow and easy for most of the miles...
In terms of speed I was pretty much at the same place I was before I got ill last time...It sounds like you are training too hard trying to make up list time for injury. You will make more gains if you are consistent and don't get injured than trying to push the pace all the time.I'd recommend spending longer building up a base of mileage before doing a marathon and do more halves, but if you just want to get round and don't care at all about time it will be doable.Too-mer-ick is correct. The hardest part for me is lacing up my shoes. Once they're on, I tell myself that I've gone too far to turn back. And I'm out the door!Nah man, it's probably cancer.Welcome. Glad I found it. I've been looking for a new place to run so I can get off the pavement every now and again.No, you creepy shit.What kind of warm up do they do prior to a workout like that?There was a band from England called throbbing gristle.Yes. I did.  It was in the 5 fingers, or figures.  My name is Abebe Bikila, and I approve this message.What happened? I've never heard of this?  Did a 20 miler on the treadmill while watching 4 episodes of Breaking Bad.Well you asked:

FUCK YOU GO RUNEveryone has a different reasons that their running gears tick, but certainly none of us are perfect and few of us feel that it is effortless. I like to train for races to challenge myself, and I skipping days might mean that I will fail to improve on previous results. As I run more and more, the enjoyment becomes something I always look forward to. Recognizing your drive can be very important - whether it is completing a race, improving a result, becoming a healthier person, or even just beating those winter blues. Canadian here. I've braved some -25 degree Celsius runs so far this year. Start with a good base layer on top and bottom. I add a pair of running pants on the bottom. On top I add a running technical Tshirt and a fleece sweater. All breathable and close to my body. Light gloves and balaclava to keep extremities warm. 


Most nights, it's the first 10mins that are cold before my body heat warms me up. Don't strip down as soon as you get back since you lose a lot more body heat than you'd think. I probably ran 15 5ks last summer, some were a blast, I helped set up, socialized, raced awesomely, felt great after, loved every second. Some everyone kept to themselves, event volunteers/staff were cold, the race was grueling, I hurt the whole time, couldn't breathe, overheated, they were hell. My first race I felt really out of place and awkward, my last race prior to getting shin splints was great and I felt like I knew what I was doing. Don't judge yourself by where you place right now, go for PRs or fun, that's what I do.It was just whichever ones were at the REI in my town, I couldn't tell ya.I ran the Goofy Challenge a few years back. I went with a large group and we ended up having no time to go to the actual park between the two races for Goofy, plus we also did the 5km on the Friday.

The races were amazing. Super well organized and the cast members and crowds were really supportive and cheered a LOT. The races seem to go fast because there is so much to see, but you can also stop for pictures with the characters so don't expect to get a PR. My half marathon time was 3 hours!! (I stopped for pictures though, and danced with the Genie. I was there for the experience, not to PR.)

I had a blast, but you have to look at these 'races' as another way to experience Disney and not as a serious race. There are lots of walkers and lots to see and do and enjoy along the route. Just don't straggle too much or the sag wagon will scoop you up off the course.  I think I'd be OK with that
The miler.  Well what are you running currently per week?

Cross times differ, but it still gives everyone a good idea of what your potential is. Don't worry about the fartleks or tempo runs quite yet, just work on miles. If you're starting from ground zero then you've got a lot of work to do right now by just getting out and running!Nothing.  Just coffee.  You'll be able to FINISH.  But you won't be able to RACE it.  Well he will be a junior come cross season, but you're right, my advice was a very general statement and 50 could easily be too much for him. I was actually very under-mileage in high school averaging around 30 MPW, while still in the top 20 for my state. 

After running at the D1 collegiate level my entire idea of mileage has changed based on my coach, whether that be good or bad. His philosophy is miles upon miles and while it's difficult it seems to be what the top teams are all doing, and succeeding. Take Oklahoma State for example, their top runners average 100+ MPW and they're dominating. Sorry I know this is an extreme example, but if I could go back to high school there is so much more I could have done to further my success at the collegiate level. It really bothers me that I didn't try that hard and see my potential, and then when I got to college it kicked me down over and over and I kept having to push through. 

All I'm trying to say is that if you plan on running in college there's so much you can do in high school to prepare and you have to take advantage of it while you can. Sorry for the long rant, I just don't want others to make the same mistake I did!RunDisney events are nothing short of top notch in terms of participant experience.  I can't comment on planning a trip around it, because I live close enough that I don't have to.  The entry fee is comparatively steep but worth it, in my opinion.  They are not highly competitive events. There will be many run-walkers and walkers on the course, even for the marathon. Average finishing times are typically slower than other similar events. 

The one caveat I'll mention is that submitting proof of time is essential. I would not want to start one of their races from the back corral. Check out the event page for the event you are interested in for proof of time requirements.  "tempo"Heat stroke is when you don't even sweat anymore. Your body's cooling mechanisms pretty much are saying "fuck this; he's not even trying to get somewhere safe. I quit".It's what plants crave!Supplements are regulated. Not to the degree that they should be and certainly not to the point of pharmaceuticals, but they are regulated (scrutiny depends on the state tho). 

For example, someone I know is the head of r&amp;d at a respectable company that produces (among other things) herbal supplements. She's a scientist but 50% of her job is working with legal to make sure products meet regulations. Guidelines are strict, especially in a state like California. The products are backed by legitimate research too, which may surprise those that think it's giant snake oil industry. At my last 5k race, I think at least 10 guys over 40, including two guys over 50, ran sub 20. And that race was in frigid December weather so it didn't even have all the top local talent there. Not sure if you tried the first or second generation but I had problems with the first gen but not the second.&gt;  I suck at long, gradual hills, 

Everyone does.  Which is a good reason to run them as much as possible.  Same with running on grass.  If you start to get a lot miles on those, it will pay off in XC.

Look into "summer of Malmo".  It is a great base building program structure.  

Building a big base plus puberty can lead to huge time drops.  Good luck.I'm glad someone had a good experience with the trail gloves. The weird stiffness of the sole combined with that little arch support thing built in made them quite probably the least comfortable thing I've put on my foot. They are very rare here, but I think the lack of more forgiving or even running surfaces is to blame more than the shoes. 

That said, they're still feasible. I've run up to 5 miles on them on concrete on random occasions without injury and I rather enjoy tossing them in the mix. I like the idea of being able to run with more "natural" form (able to push off with spread toes), although it is negated a bit by the downside of concrete running with little padding. Check out r/runDisney! Its not as active, but I'm sure it has what you're looking for. 50 MPW might be a tad steep for a High school Sophomore.  I'm not completely disagreeing with this bit of advice but I try not to tell people  what sort of mileage they should be running unless I know what kind of mileage they've run in the past.  Some people can take high mileage while others can't. It's the same way with EP.  A couple twins that were two of the top kids in the state had an incredibly slow EP compared to what they raced, but it worked. Just my $.02Drink water 2 hours before run for an hour. Empty bladder over hour 2. source: lunchtime running in Australia. Run outdoor. It'll keep you in racing shape, and force  you to stay consistent with you training.  You could probably talk to your coach about running more 1600s or even some 3200s during outdoor season.  As far as summer running goes, I could only give  you estimates.  I ran similar times in high school, but that doesn't really matter when it comes to giving you advice on mileage, because each person's body reacts differently to mileage.  Respond here or shoot me a PM if you have any questions.
All I know is, inhaling anything into my lungs makes them tighter on inhalation when running, so fck that. (And it doesn't matter house "clean" or "pure" the weed is.)That guy is right, unfortunately you won't find a good treadmill for that money. I understand not wanting to run outside as well. What city are you in? If there's a TheGym location in your town I would recommend joining it. Membership is about 12, it's open 24 hours and entry is by pin so you won't have to see staff members everyday. They also tend to be massive with an abundance of treadmills that are often unoccupied. If you're uncomfortable with running even in a gym, they have a general usage tool on their site which tells you when it is busiest/emptiest so you can go when there is hardly anyone there. Not that anyone cares about people running in a gym anyway.

Good luck. (http://www.thegymgroup.com/find-a-gym/)I don't find minimal shoes rigid at all, but rather very flexible and not much support.The world record for your age is under fourteen minutes. You're not limited by your age. You're limited by how much you're willing to work. It's curios that they've sold so many, but I rarely see anyone wearing them. NYC runner here and we have a lot of road runners to observe.Pretty sure dietary choices that day have impacted my running performance, not just varying levels of fatigue. I have a decent sample size on this now and feel fairly good about the conclusion.

No claims made about fitness or health, just within-day performance.I broke my ankle in September, no surgery needed, and was out of my boot by the middle of December. I'm running now, but it hurts. 

It hurts when i start running, calms down a bit when i warm up (havent done more than 3.5 miles) and hurts when i stop. That aside, it hurts when i wake up, when i walk up and down stairs, when i cross my legs, when i spend too much time on my feet, and its challenging to stand on my toes (still cant wear heels). I feel so old and achy!! I didn't go to PT, my orthopedist wouldn't refer me, so maybe your recovery will be smoother if you do go to PT. 

That being said, a fractured ankle is a much longer recovery process than anticipated. There's a lot of strength lost in your muscles, tendons, and  ligaments that is hard to recover, and the bone is still healing long after it can bear weight. The stress you put on it day-to-day and the naturally worse circulation your legs have compared to tje rest of your body just makes it that much slower of a process. 
Thanks ! I am in the Northern California / Bay Area, so I guess one good thing is that heat will not be an issue ;-) 

Thanks for the words of encouragement ! One can never have enough of the blessings and motivational support ! They are much appreciated. Knowing the next run is another opportunity to improve. Also, brownies.It might sound silly or too cliche ! But I want to run a Marathon before I turn 40. It's just one of those silly itches :) Advise taken. I'll probably skip it.I guess I'll look into adding another day down the line. Not an option at the moment though. Thanks.I'm not following, what's not actually true? The Sketchers lawsuit or that supplements are unregulated? Both of those are true. And neither is in the article.Yes you can do it. Just spend the next 16 weeks gradually increasing your mileage.   Make one run a week a long run,  try to get it to 12 or 15 miles if you can. Treat each leg of the race as a run, not a race. Stay properly fueled and hydrated.  Nap if you get the chance. Have fun. Thanks! Yeah I'm looking to smash the time next race... which should be easy enough considering it's a month away and course is a lot flatter :PWhich is weird because I'm pretty sure I steal more than 95% of what I say from you.Dude. For a first race, and being a bigger guy, recently injured, and facing unexpected hills, 5:38min/km is pretty solid pace. Be proud. Remember that most people didn't even start the race.

Now you have a benchmark for improvement!/u/ForwardBound is an idiot.  We only agree ~95% of the time.

But yeah, you are doing pretty good for what you are doing.  Consistency is the key to running, so just start getting consistent and then worry about focusing on a specific distance.,Not actually true, but people read an article and are now experts. Awesome. Glad I'm not the only one who has already watched this today.I feel awful when I eat fat before a run so I stick to toast with jam or cereal with almond milk.I've had tendon injuries in both ankles and had success with myofascial release therapy and using a lacrosse ball on the tendon myself. There's a chain of chiropractors in my area called Airrosti that specialize in this but I think a lot of sports doctors do it. I spent $160 on a few visits but it was totally worth it to get back to running. I also learned that my hip is super tight on the leg that I have the most ankle problems with. So now I know that I need to work in that and also foam roll my IT band. My running has improved from it what it was before injury.Sketchers got hit with a lawsuit as well, for 40 million (10 times the vibram case) for unsubstantiated health claims. I wonder if that case made it obvious that shoe companies who make health claims are good targets.

Supplements are completely unregulated. They aren't even required to have the ingredients they say they do, and can almost sell whatever cheap filler they want as whatever they want to say it is. It's insane.How about a head lamp band? Hide the lamp under a horn or just cover it with something to be part of the costume. I've used them to run in the dark and they stay pretty secure.I've my ankle twice in the past year as well. I fractured a bone in the ankle a couple years ago. What I did is I took a while off with a lot of icing, and when I came back I started off with easier runs I would normally do. You should probably go see your doctor if it's an issue you frequently have thoughYeah, I use to use VFF's but found the little toe pockets to be annoying and didn't seem better than Merrell trail gloves.Yeah, I have a pair of Merrell's minimal shoes and they have no signs of ware at about 500 miles.Get a couple pairs of tights. I have some regular, thermal tights and some others that have softshell front panels to block wind/rain from the goods. I recommend getting some quality base layers too: Under Armor, merino wool, Nike Pro Combat fitted, etc. And lastly, you need a 1/2 zip and a windproof, waterproof jacket. If you layer well, the jacket doesn't need to be anything crazy. I have the Asics Storm Shelter jacket. 

I ran 14mi in the snowstorm that hit mid-Michigan a couple weeks ago, and I was toasty. Just to give you an example, here's what I wore:

* Nike Element Thermal Tight
* Lululemon Studio Boxer (under tights)
* Nike Pro Combat, fitted baselayer
* Lululemon Metal Vent Tech SS
* Lululemon Speed 1/2 zip
* Asics Storm Shelter Jacket 
* Chaos CTR Adrenaline Dri Release Multi Tasker Pro Balaclava + windproof insert
* Craft Siberian Gloves
* North Face beanie
* Thorlo Pads merino socksThe only thing to really fuss about is getting good tights. Everything else is basically just layering cheap stuff and you'll be find. No need to pay big bucks. I've been running double digit mile runs through sub-zero temps with a pair of thin dollar store type gloves and socks over top of them.What? I still don't get the joke.Buff is the best invention ever!I know this is a serious question and there have been lots of great answers BUT... I live on the east coast of Canada and it was -32 with the brutal wind today on my run. In addition to everything else my snot froze. Heat stroke is the least of my worries lol! Good luck with your problem though. Oh yeah, we did speak. I remember where I know your (real) name from now. It's too bad you've been injured so much. Must be frustrating not to be able to catch the PRs you sound like you're very close to achieving.

I just do the easy pace at whatever feels good. Seems like that can vary wildly for different people. Today I was doing 7:45 - 7:50, but another day that feels like plodding. I'm mainly training for the Run to Remember half at the end of May, but I also want to perform well at the YuKan Fool's Dual in April. And a few other hard workout-type races in between. Are you doing the Spring Classic again this year? If so I look forward to seeing you off in the distance.

Good luck at Hyannis--the weather seems to be a huge factor in whether that's a good race or bad one. I hope it clears up and the roads are widened a bit.Agreed.  Unfortunately, I have yet to see reviews of similar depth from a running-specific perspective (and certainly not this many reviews side-by-side).I have two halves coming up: Hyannis in 11 days and NYC in March. The first one will be just a hard workout where I may try to run the second half of the race at my goal pace (~5:40). I am little bit scared of the distance as I have done only one 12+ mile workout in the last 7 months. 

My weekly mileage has been 15-30 for these seven months, so I don't know what to expect. Last spring I reached 700 miles by the end of March, failed to improve my 5k/10k times (almost 2min short of my 10k PR), suffered from some kind of over-training for the next three months (ran a 1.19 half during this period), and have been half-injured since.

You seem to be training fairly hard, my easy pace was more like 8:00 last spring. Are you training for something? I think we actually spoke after Spring Classic last year.Two words: merino wool (as a base layer)Well it matters how much they made. Look how much Jordan, Lebron etc get paid for their name. Sure he's not them but it's his name on the shoe.Don't push an ankle recovery, take your time and let it heal completely before training again or you will have issues for the rest of your life. If you have to do physiotherapy once the cast is off, take it seriously and don't half ass it - this is your only chance for a full and strong recovery.

I had an ankle reconstruction (bone pinned and ligaments reattached) after severely rolling it in a basketball game. It took me 4 months before I could walk properly and over a year before I was running at normal pace again. Listen to your body and take your time, the last thing you want is a lifelong injury. http://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=chafing&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=allI live in rural Kansas, so most of my runs are either trail or dirt road, but thanks for the insight! &gt; they just make them slower and more injury prone.

Does anyone else remember how a statement like this used to lead to a flood of posts by barefoot runners citing some survey by the Italian Olympic team with a sample size of 12 as evidence of the contrary?

The barefoot running craze was seriously weird.Haha, thanks for the advice :)Supplements are such and absolute mess. Since they are not regulated by the FDA there are no truth in advertising requirements. This has lead to tons of fly by night companies being involved.

I suspect there probably are quite a few suits involving supplements, but they are rarely successful because the companies making them simply close up shop only to reopen under a different name in a different state.The starting line is a great place to strike up a conversation! For your next race just try saying a few words to the person next to you, introduce yourself, wish them a good race. In my experience at races 95% of people are happy to be there and are very approachable when you give them a chance. The other 5% are the douches that think they were one injury away from being an Olympian. Speed wise I think the highest benefit people are getting from them is that they're really light compared to traditional shoes. That said, the calf gains are a definite real benefit. 

Can we all just agree that Hoka One Ones are the worst thing ever when it comes to shoe gimmicks though?

Can confirm.  During the last snow dump (seriously, it can stop now) I thought "what a badass" at every runner.  There's this absolutely ancient woman who I always see running, and sure enough there she was running through the snow storm.  She' a BAMF.My best piece of advice for you would be to run outdoor. There is absolutely no reason not to (unless you were kicked off the team).

If you are set on not doing outdoor the do outdoor, the best way to improve your running is to have a coach help you though it.

If you WILL NOT do outdoor than I would suggest:
Find new routes - you seriously only have one route
Run more but progress slowly, don't want any injuries
after a few weeks add in a 4 to 5 mile tempo run
add in some intervals later, like 1000 meter repeats with limited recovery
do strides after all your runs
google search summer of malmo, follow that plan loosely
check out the letsrun.com boards, they have some great info I'd say there's no point in doing the speed stuff. You should be concentrating on getting the most distance in that you possibly can. Don't extend your one run too long, but yes, it's a good idea to make one longer than the others. Fit in a very short fourth run if you can.&gt;  I was an age group placer and didn't die so it was totally worth it.

*fist bump*
90 miles in a week on a treadmill?! That's amazing. I'm in awe. I actually don't mind the treadmill much at all, especially when the alternative is hop-scotching through snow and dodging cars in the street.

I generally don't use an incline on the treadmill I use, as I've found that my paces on the treadmill and the track are very equivalent, though I think I'm going to experiment with incline on a few upcoming workouts.

Thanks for the kind words! 8 miles @ 6:00 is extremely impressive. I hope to be up there in a month or two. My easy is mostly around 7:30 - 7:45. Sometimes I get down to 7:15 on long runs.

Are you training for anything in particular? Goal race for the spring?There's also the semi-popular Canadian band known as Swollen Members.Body glide.Soak them in cider vinegar, it generally pulls out the stank I might be able to help you with Running Formula. What makes it hard for you to extract a concrete plan from it? No, but it's what this thread is about.No problem. Good luck! I think you're going to be experiencing a lot of new PRs soon if you bump up the frequency.Below 0 degrees C or F? Below 0 degrees F isn't too bad to deal with, most of the time. You *really* heat up once you start running, so it may take less than you think!

What I wear isn't perfect, but I personally don't want to buy new clothes:

1. UnderArmour Cold gear tights. These are *awesome.* Get them or something like them! I've never worn a shirt version, but it'd be a good idea if it's that cold.
2. Sweatpants over top of the tights. A pair of wind pants would possibly work, depending on weather.
3. Balaclava. These things are *great*. They cover more than just a hat, and keep more wind out!
4. Gloves. I should have better ones, but your hands heat up as you run.
5. Tank-top. Cotton. As said, I could probably have better.
6. Northface Fleece. God-given warmth on the really cold days.
7. Newly purchased wind-jacket. Super lightweight, and cutting out the wind does wonders.
/u/ForwardBound saying same thing, seems to be something of a consensus. Thanks!Seems to be a consensus that I need to run more. Thanks for taking the time to reply.OK, so definitely possible, good to know.

Thanks for the advice!Which Ragnar are you doing? Any chance you can change which legs you're running? 

Ragnar is a grind, and it'll be tough if you've never been over 5K distance. You'll need to train yourself to basically be in half marathon shape. Near the end of your training plan (the 2-3 weeks before your relay), you should do some 2x runs (think 3  miles in the AM, 5 in the PM) to prepare for the low rest you'll get during the event. 

If it were me, I'd get started on a half marathon training plan, tweak as needed, and just try to SURVIVE the event. It'll be plenty of fun, but getting hurt would ruin it. 

Forget pacing, just take it easy and enjoy being out there. http://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=winter&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=allEvery run below needs a 10min warmup and 10min cooldown.

Sprints: 100m dash

 * 6-10x 60m or 10-15sec sprint with good form (bad form = trying to go too fast)
 * 1st 20m build up to speed and last 20m gradual slow down (stopping abruptly = injuries).
 * Rest = at LEAST 2min rest (should be back to ~90-100% before each sprint AKA full recovery; this is not meant to be hard cardio)
 * Can also use hill repeats either as additional training to sprints, or just hills alone. Same concept, except you run up a hill at full speed for 10-20sec (no reason to measure distance or start/stop slow since you wont be going as fast up a hill).

Intervals:

 * maximum 5min hard per interval
 * Rest time is same as time ran (ran 3min hard, 3min easy)
 * Best results with at least 90sec in duration (typically 400m up to 1 mile)
 * General rule of thumb: run them until you feel like you can only do 1 more and stop

Threshold (not necessarily HIIT) - AKA "comfortably hard"

 * Pace should stay consistent at a pace that you can hold onto for long period of time from 20-60min
 * Pace described as "only being able to talk 1 word at a time"
 * General rule of thumb is 15-45sec slower than 5k  race pace
 * Can split up into interval type runs with short jogs in between (5min Tempo, 1min easy), repeat until tempo total time ran = time you want for tempo pace.

Calculate your training pace:

1. Run a time trial of either: 1) A certain distance and time it, or 2) Run for a certain amount of time and calculate the distance you ran. This should be race pace; OR you can run a race as well
1. [Use a running calculator and enter your time trial](http://runsmartproject.com/calculator/)
1. Use the infor the calculator gave you for training paces and quivalences for varying distances for race pace.
Interesting point. You got me wondering, what about other famous names that are probably trademarked but also that of a famous person, whether coincidentally or otherwise? Does Tesla's family get a cut? Maybe lawyer guy/lady above can answer.Yeah, you are definitely right. I have been tossing it over since the race and it's making me want to get back out and try again lol. Next one is beginning of march and a bigger event. I'm not gonna worry so much about the social aspect, and instead put my focus into running a good race. If I happen to meet some people, great. But running the best race I can will be the goal :)I wouldn't consider myself fortune for having one. I worked for it. It didn't fall out of the sky.

Also, you don't have friends willing to take you? That's just...sadYeah, I think you're right. I'm just gonna have to get over worrying about "fitting in", get out of my comfort zone and see what happens. Thanks!Go for it!Sounds scary. Sometimes in the summer I have to cut my runs short because I feel like I am overheating. Increase your mileage and forget about the intervals. You don't run enough per week to get a benefit from them that couldn't be eclipsed by adding on more kilometers.

The coach for my run club could crush most of the members and he's 47. You definitely have a lot of years left to run faster.I took it. Lied. Haha, see that's the thing.. I could have ran 30 seconds faster and got a medal (the guy who got 3rd didn't even show up to get his! grr!)... but in the end 3rd or 4th out of 4. My pace still would have been over 5:30, not much different xDIf you did a 21 on streets, you can easily go sub-20 in a race maybe even sub-19. Go out in 6:20 pace (19:35 pace) and see if you can hold on to that for 2 miles. Push hard in the final mile, and even if you fall back a little, you're still setting yourself up for a huge PR.Honestly? In order for you to find out the questions you asked you would have to do some actual work. 

Want to know if more female runners are running marathons? Look at the results of 10 different marathons for the past 10 years and do the math.

Are more runners using gels? Look at the companies that sell them. Most 50ks and ultras are on trails so your road paces won't matter as much. There are many plans for a 50k but what worked for me was training miles maxed out at around 50 per week with my long runs building up to 26/28 miles three weeks before the event. In short, if you can run 50 miles per week, you can finish a 50k (IMO).

Also, if you sign up for a trail race, try to do your long runs (or longish) on trails. Every run doesn't have to be on dirt but the experience does help you get used to the different pace and rhythms. 

Your ultra will also be small. I ran Chicago with 45,000 people and my first 50k with about 300. The trail can only handle so many folks.

Would I do more ultras? Maybe. There are some great races I'd love to try. But I kind of decided my long-term goal would be Boston and training for that time doesn't really work with ultra training. I say go for it. I learned a lot about myself doing a 50k and I think that's helped me be a better runner.Thank you! Yeah... I didn't do any form of sports in highschool (unless you count partying a sport...). I wrestled and played soccer until middle school, then started smoking, ditched that about 5 years ago. So the whole being healthy/fit/etc.. i'm doing for pretty much the first time in my life.

I guess I hadn't considered how much of a leg up high school/college athletes would have, but that makes quite a lot of sense.You are flat lining because you don't have much of a base.  25k/week is very little running.  Focus on building that up and you will see improvement.Also forgot to add, if you are not running everyday, you can actually run hard/quality workouts everytime you run (besides the long run). The days in between your running days should be enough rest as these would be easy runs anyway.Sounds like a question for a physical therapist... Best 5K was probably a few months ago. To be honest I'm getting *slightly* faster, but was hoping for better progress.

Didn't know about the running calculator, thanks for that.

Many thanks for the tips, much appreciated!Sorry haha, I'm training for a 20 miler right now, I haven't gone further than 10 and my mile splits for faster 3 mile runs are around 7 and my longer runs are around 8:30 When was the 5k time trial you did? To be honest your age isnt that much of a factor as is your athletic ability. Your best bet to figure out what your 5k could be is to do a time trial. You can do a shorter distance if you want and get a theoretical 5k pace using a [running calculator](http://www.runsmartproject.com/calculator/)

For workouts you should do 1-3 quality workouts a week, not just one (sprints, tempo, intervals, etc.). Also should add more runs per week if possible. Only running 3 times a week you wont see much progression (which is why youre not seeing much benefit from the intervals because its the only thing keeping you in "fast" shape). That's not what the article is about.There is a master's runner under 15min for a 5k. I have friends who are in their late 40's running in the 18's I am sub 20 at 37 and 250+ lbs. Limits are things you place on your self primarily. I'd say you could go sub 20 or faster with correct training and a good plan for nutrition, sleep and the rest of your life. Remember all stress is cumulative and can lead to lack of progress. You body can only handle so much stress, so if you are stressing it with training adding in a stressful job may be too much, so square away your life, then square away training/nutrition/recovery with a coach and you will get faster. I don't think it's in the same ballpark as a biopic. They *trademarked his name* to sell their shoes. A name that the rest of the family still has, for one thing.Thanks for the tips. I'll be taking it nice and slow to make sure i adjust. 

I find the thought of running on a nice golf course much more pleasurable than running on roads. Damn, I don't know why people on both sides of the barefoot/shoe argument get so SALTY.

I wear shoes, but who cares if someone wants to go barefoot or run in those toe-shoes?

Oh, did they claim that training barefoot/shod is better? If only there were a way to settle these sorts of things in a way that's related to the sport at hand...

It's called racing.Poetry in motionOhh gosh, *so so* sorry, I misread that part of your original post! It all still applies though. Rushing into a treadmill really isn't necessary when you're starting running. You'll be going pretty short distances for short periods of time, so it'd be worth seeing if you even like running first. Maybe you'll do it a few times and say, "Fuck this, I'd rather get an exercise bike!" You could definitely stay within a short distance of your house, and it wouldn't take very long (since you're starting out, your runs will be short!).

Also, running often helps people with anxiety. So maybe it'll help you not freak out, and you'll realize you don't mind running outside. Or you'll realize you love running, and that it's worth getting a *nice* treadmill. As said, this question comes up a lot, so a search of the sub will have a wealth of info in terms of buying a treadmill.Nailed it.I went swimming once with bad shin splints and it almost hurt as much as running to be honest.. Maybe because you kind of flex your feet while kicking, I don't really know..I'm not overweight, I weigh about 110-120lbs and I'm 5'7!

Apart from that I understand what you are saying, I will have a look elsewhere on the sub-reddit to see what others say as well.That sounds like a really good base, stick with it!  I apologize for the interval/tempo comments then, as I said, I'm not too familiar with the beginner plans.  Throwing some 5k's in there is definitely a good idea to get you comfortable and more used to racing.  I so no reason, if you stick more or less to your plan, why you shouldn't do well in the half :)  Good luck!Depends on your fitness, I've done races on friday evening, saturday and sunday in 1 weekend, and ran 3 half marathons on 3 saturdays in October last year.

What do you think yourself ? Are you fit enough ? How many times a week do you run ? And how far ?This is absolutely what kept me in that cycle. Makes you feel unstoppable when you train that way, but overall very damaging.Why are you in such a hurry to run a marathon?  Take your time.A quick search of this sub will show tons of info about buying/using treadmills. It would be worth checking them out. I responded to one of those threads, so I'm not going to repeat the specific things to look for in a treadmill here. 


**In short:**If you do not currently run, it is probably not a wise investment to buy a treadmill. You will **not** find a nice treadmill for 400-500. It will be a POS.


Tons of us hate running on them, and getting a nice one is *expensive*. If you do not currently run, it is very likely unwise to spend a large amount of money on something you might not even like to do.

And to be frank, you're ~~overweight~~ out of shape. You will not be running long distances or periods of time, especially to start. I understand that you're anxious to leave the house, but we're talking 20 minutes within a half mile of your house. *Max.* I would at least spend a few days running to see *if you even like running*. Whoa! Bold take....Levins is the favorite at this point but I don't see a runaway. Hill, Lamong, lots of class in that race. Keeping track of my miles has helped me with this, if only to give me a quantifiable check against my own sense of progress, whether it is higher or lower than my actual progress. What I have found more often than not is that my sense of what is enough has increased with the mileage and frequency of running such that lulls that I have now are still improvements on the lulls I have had in the past.

How much running data do you keep? Can you compare where you are after the latest setback in relation to prior recovery periods?What are your goals?  That's kind of the deciding factor here. If you want to get faster, then you'll benefit mostly from (1) running regularly with higher mileage at a LOW intensity, (2) running hills (doesn't have to be anything structured--just chose hilly places to run), (3) sleeping a lot and (lastly) (4) maybe doing one tempo run/harder effort run per week.  Generally, I advise runners to avoid speedwork until they are comfortable with (at minimum) about 20 miles a week of running.I thought this was /r/nottheonion before I read the article A proper hill workout is hard running uphill and a slow jog down. Always feel like you could do one more rep at the end of your workout.It's clearly suggesting association and/or approval. They could have called them anything but they did not. Yes, douchey.Choose one:

A - Run easy and eventually you'll get faster

B - Run fast and eventually it'll get easier

Sounds like you've been picking B.  If so, try A.Certainly does sound like over training. I've ridden that horse, but I've swaped it out for a nice, trusty donkey. It's a slower life, but it gets me there.I'm right there with you. This was supposed to be the first winter I made a concerted effort to keep running since I started a few years ago - I got a gym membership and everything. 

In December I increased my weekly mileage too quickly and strained my calves. I donated blood after xmas and could barely slog through a couple of miles for 2 weeks. Then I got bronchitis in January which barely subsided in time for my half marathon. And since I hadn't done enough training for the half, I had to take another week off to heal after that. 

I need to move out of northern climates. I didn't mean program per se. Just like... routine. Would you recommend jog downhill, spring uphill or something like that? Or even just run both ways?Especially considering the guy's name they are using has been dead for 40+ yearsLots of people are in your shoes and they all get told the same thing. Build up more slowly because your legs clearly aren't ready to handle the workload you're putting on them.Thanks for the advice. How do you think I should get in the mileage, i.e. via fartleks, long runs, tempos?

I left out my 5k time because cross country courses, and thus my times, differ so much. My (not very recent PR) is around 18:25, but it was on a paved road race. FWIW, I suck at long, gradual hills, and running on grass drains me much more than running on pavement.thanks for your advicesA 10K a week after a 5K should be no problem.Suing for $15 million in damages seems a bit much.You sure it's not just because they totally changed up the way you run? You can still run like you do with VFF in running shoes."We're taking it in stride," says his dad.I often go back to this...

Think Easy, Light, Smooth, and Fast. You start with easy, because if thats all you get, thats not so bad. Then work on light. Make it effortless, like you dont give a shit how high the hill is or how far youve got to go. When youve practiced that so long that you forget youre practicing, you work on making it smoooooth. You wont have to worry about the last one  you get those three, and youll be fast.   -CB.It's not the running part that gives me anxiety...

I just have a lot of anxieties that build up when out, especially for a prolonged period, it's not unknown for me to start having a panic attack in public, and for now at least I would prefer to get fit at home.It depends entirely on how quickly you recover (which is mainly a question for your doctor). If you are fully recovered in April and able to run 10k immediately then sure. But my experience with injuries less severe is that even after you're recovered it takes 2-3 months to get back to pre-injury levels. So you'd be cutting it close.K. Maybe you are running to fast when you should be running easy. You could be tiring your body out which can lead to sickness and injury. Been there. Done that.Sounds like a pretty atypical race, also quite small. For a big race, 30 minutes ahead of time is barely enough :) You would not generally finish last in your age group at that pace, it's just with such a small sample of 4 things can get wonky. No shame in taking a walk break up a nasty hill!

I've rarely gotten into conversations with people, though the 10k I did I did run with 2 other ladies for a while and we chatted a bit.

If you want to meet people running, a running group would be the way to go. Lots of running stores will have casual drop in groups, I'm going to one tonight.Oh my van supposedly has a tradition where we will stop randomly and start a dance party on the roof of the van so I'll bring febreeze I didn't know what that was, but google makes it sound pretty terrible, and suggests that you see a doctor immediately.Thanks for the advice, just out of curiosity, I thought static stretches are not ideal if you don't exercise? Shouldn't static stretch be performed after running? Maybe I am getting something wrongAnything for a couple bucksWhat's wrong with Vibram shoes?I always thought it weird that Vibram was successfully sued for this when so many other products (*cough* supplements) make what seems like far more egregious claims. I respect going after companies making unsubstantiated claims, I just don't understand why it was Vibram specifically.You used the word marathon. Are you referring to either the 5k or 10k as a marathon or is this a different race you want to know if you should do the week after another? If the latter, then definitely no.I'm not familiar with that specific diagnosis, but I am familiar with twinges behind the knee. I've always stretched out my calf and hamstring really well. As I understand it, those two muscles connect at the ligaments behind the knee. My pain has come from those two being tight and subsequently tugging and straining the tendon. So let's of toe touches and calf stretches would be my suggestion.Details, yo.I think Levins will win this pretty comfortably. Chelanga or one of the BTC guys could cause an upset, but Cam ran really well at Millrose last year, and seems to be in even better form now. If you like running, then run. You don't have to race to be a runner. In my experience, you will meet more people running rather than racing. Like others have said, find a running group!20 broken up is not nearly as bad as continuous.  4 months is more than enough time to prepare.  Most 1/2 marathon plans are 12 weeks.  If you live in a warm climate you learn a few things. Drink water over an hour before you run, try and be in the shade, pay attention to your heart rate, run with money for an emergency drink or with water, and try and run in the am or pm. It's easy to run until you stop sweating without seeing it coming. If it happens you need to find shade and stop. Heat stroke kills people. Be careful.I think we would. How many injury threads are like: "I doubled my mileage and added speedwork. Now my knee hurts. Should I change my diet?"Well you've got loads of time so don't over-think it. I'd say just work up the mileage for a few months and gain lots of endurance. Since it's only your 2nd year running cross I'd say maybe slowly get up to around 50 miles per week and hold that. Around May you could start doing some intervals (say 800-1600) and work from there. 

It's hard to tell without knowing what you've been doing before or what you can run a 5k in, but this is a very simple plan to work with. 

Work up mileage + slowly increasing pace = endurance gains. I'm incredibly jealous of that milage given that I pick up a shin injury if I try to run too much. You can definitely run a marathon.

ps. 5min km = 8min mile

10secs in km = 16secs in mile. So 60 seconds in km = 96 seconds in a mile. 

So when trying to convert, work from 5 km / 8 mile. So if you're doing a 4minute km, minus 96 seconds from 8 minutes. IE: a 4 minute km is a 6min24sec mile. Or if you're doing a 6minute km, add 96 to 8min, which would be 9min36 mile.Thanks for the kind words :) I think I will stick to the plan atleast till SD Rock N Roll and then re-evaluate if I want to do the SF Full or Half !Awesome ! I hope to post something like this too later during this year :) 

I am 148 lbs with a little beer belly !! I am taking notes from the thread on what to do and what NOT to do :) I appreciate your feedback. Thanks for the pointers, greatly appreciated. This is the kind of stuff I want to learn from Runnit. Getting wiser, one pointer at a time, I guess :)

As I wrote in the other comment, I will try to get stick to the plan but target the Rock N Roll first and then evaluate if I should continue to do the full or just do the SF Half ! So you want to almost double your long run mileage in a few weeks? Good luck with that. You may be a tad sore afterwards.Thanks for the input. Feedback like this what I was looking for. Now scared, rather very motivated from all the feedback. I think I will try to stick to the plan till the RockNRoll and enjoy the running and then evaluate, if I should target the SF Full or just do the Half :) You don't really need an "HIIT program". Just take one of your running days and make it a tempo run instead of an easy run.  Or a hill day, intervals or a fartlek or whatever.
First, well done on the weight loss. At 6'1", you could have gotten a lot worse than 255 before you decided to do something about it, so well done, there.

Don't worry about the place in your age group yet. There's really two types of runners - those who ran track/XC in high school/college, and those that didn't. If you didn't you are going to have to work really hard for a long time to catch up to the guys who did it for the past decade (almost regardless of what age they are now).

My first triathlon I was 6th of 6. A year later, I finished 12th of 200 at Chicago, and a year after that in the top 11% at an Ironman. You just started your journey - congrats on your finish.Even if you're an absolute novice, a 5k will not burn you out. Doing a 10k 6days later will be absolutely fine, unless you manage to fully injure yourselfYou shouldn't always try to run faster....Yeh I mean you didn't exactly fill us in with details but if you're already into running, then you can train for it. But as Yellow_guy says if you're not a runner but just intrigued by ultras then you're going to have a very very bad time if you try one in May.

But either way, the obvious advice if you want to do an ultra is to start running more.Maybe we'd have fewer injury threads if more people followed that approach. (Probably not, though . . .)&gt; (Leaving the house will always be the hardest part)

Not true. Source: myself. The hardest part is making myself head back home.What exactly are you worried about?

I understand a dreadmill for cold/bad weather training, but there will always be people faster than you. Part of being a runner is realizing that you just let out a huge fart at mile 12, spit on some spectator's shoes by accident and have snot coming out of your nose.

It happens.Paraphrasing Marvin, the pessimistic robot from the Hitchhiker's Guide: The first mile is the hardest. The second mile is also the hardest. And the mile after that is also the hardest. And the mile after that...

Or, as they say: the hardest mile is the one you're running right now.I once heard that the first two miles and the last two miles are the most difficult parts, and after a few years, I'm inclined to agree...Thanks, that's kinda the stuff I was looking for.If you start from zero.......YES!Yes, he ran almost all his races in shoes. For this particular one, adidas had fucked up and hadn't brought any in his size.Right/left is what they promoted in the 1970's and early 80's, but new scientific insights show very clearly that left/right significantly reduces injury risk if properly alternated (this last bit is kind of crucial though). In a study conducted among 6 self-selected runners, none died within 4 months of switching to a left/right pattern, whereas more than 98% of the control group (who didn't run at all and reported a partially sedentary lifestyle) had died within 90 years, and runners who kept using a right/left pattern didn't score much better, with an average life expectancy of little more than 80 years.I imagine your best bet would be to find a sports-related doctor in your area and him/her for a reference for a surgeon that has a good track record with keeping patients active.And maybe it really is two 9ish mile runs with a rest, instead of "20.9 miles". But I've been injured in the past from too much, too soon. And I've seen it happen to many other runners as well.  This experience has caused me to adopt a conservative attitude towards training.I'm competitive by nature too.  Racing is competition, that's what makes it fun.  Sure you get to compete with yourself but you're also competing with other people.  Odds are there are always going to be people in the race faster than you, but in that race on that day you might be the person out kicking some other random person to the finish line and knocking them out of 3rd place for your age group.

It always seems like there's a huge gulf between yourself and the 'fast' people.  The problem is the definition of 'fast' is always a moving target.  I ran (err hobbled) my first half-marathon in 3:15.  Everyone seemed fast to me.  Running a 2 hour half seemed blazing.  Since then I've worked my half PR down to a 1:23 (and a 3:15 marathon would mean something went wrong), but those 'fast' people are still there.  I don't think I'll ever crack 1:15 in the half (1:20, maaaaaaaybe), that pace just seems far too much for my old legs... but I'll give whomever is running near my pace a run for their money.Obviously I don't buy something whenever I'm helped, that would be ridiculous.  There is a big difference between that and what we are talking about though.  

Try going to a LRS and, before you use their shoe fitting services, tell them your plan.  Tell them you'd like to get properly fitted for running shoes but, once you do, you'll leave and go buy the shoes cheaper somewhere else. See if they still want to help you.

Bottom line is the LRS provide that service because they are in the business to sell you shoes.  Not the business to help their competing online retailers sell shoes so, as I said before, you can technically do it but it is morally questionable.I placed in my age group (20-29) once, because there were about 4 of us in a local 10K.

Revel in it :-pWow, that almost sounds like the kind of gains someone would get from training.  I'm sure it's the shoes though.I see!..well I always mix stuff besides just water (electrolytes and some sort of calories).  I usually go on long runs and water is just not enough to keep me going.  I use a combination of Skratch labs(hydration) +Carbo Pro(calories).  But you are right, if you only put water in it you won't have any problems.  I really like this Salomon pack!Mirin' hard.

Just try that after college, kid...I had IT band syndrome which manifested the same way. Switching to minimalist shoes reduced the impact to my knees and helped some, as did roller stretches and other stretches that targeted the IT band. Even with all that I could only run on the treadmill for months. My doctor said in some cases a cortisone injection is required. So even if this is your ailment you should talk to a specialist.It gets easier every time you do leave the house. Good work :)Maybe I'm oversimplifying. It's been years since I did a relay race and I can't say I have a complete memory of how I felt afterward.Crazy as it sounds (and I'm bracing myself for downvotes), what you're doing seems absolutely reasonable so long as you keep your pace down and concentrate on simply completing the runs. I know a multitude of runner that started off with marathon runs but were cognizant of the fact that doing so at a high pace for a beginner would be disastrous.

TLDR; Maintain a lesser pace and focus on the distance.Not really that douchey. Trademarks are relatively limited. It mainly just means that another shoe company can't name their shoes the Biklia after they put their money into marketing it.One trend I have noticed is that running used to be thought of as having an extremely low or zero cost barrier to entry compared to sports like cycling or skiing. You just needed running shoes. Of course, you can still see [dudes in whatever they have lying around getting by just fine](http://i.imgur.com/QkvfX1F.jpg). But today there exists a product to satisfy seemingly every conceivable need a runner could have from head to toe, inside and out. Watches, socks, lights, belts, goos, sleeves, bumper stickers, magazines, bars, shades, rollers, race fees, headphones, underwear, outerwear, major motion pictures starring Kevin Costner, apps, and supplements get shoved in your face all day by the marketing machine that tells you what you need to wear to look like a REAL RUNNER. You identify as a REAL RUNNER, right?Wow, I feel so British. If I want people to get out my way, I'll normally shout "Excuse me" then thank them as I go past..yep. i have.  was in grand cayman on holiday.  a bit of diving in the morning.  afternoon on the beach.  easy 5 mile run early evening, super fast shower, immediately out to a bar with friends.  knew something wasn't right when we were walking to the bar but didn't think much of it.  standing there chatting, only a 1/2 beer in, got wicked dizzy, next thing i know i'm laying on the ground surrounded by people looking down at me.  the mrs. says i kind of mumbled something incoherently, went rigid and lights out.  one of the friends we were at the bar with is a local EMT, when we told him about the day at hand he was convinced it was heat related.Honestly, four months sounds totally doable if you don't skip training or slack off. Judging by the other comments, you're a cyclist so you've some endurance but running is definitely a different animal. I'm doing Ragnar too so I'm nervous as I haven't done a relay since high school many years ago. However, I'm starting slow with 15-20 miles a week and starting two weeks from now, I'm doing a 12 week marathon training plan. Honestly, just start and go from there. You won't know until you start running a few 5ks here and there and just build on it. Cheers. Fair enough. I think 20 miles is a long way to run AND feel good afterwards. To me, that's the key.You are right and I apologize.Well, OK. I don't think a relay like that is a huge deal for a healthy person.Such humble and great guys. Love to see them out there rollin through a sweet workout. While yall are at it check out nick willis's workout from last season where he runs then uses his baby boy as a weight during his core workout. What a great runner and father!I'm not worried about his lungs, though. I'm worried about the effect that running ~20 miles will have on his joints.That seems overly cautious to a high degree, if OP really is in good shape from cycling.I see. That makes a lot more sense.I passed !!! I gave it my all, and I passed. Unfortunately they didn't give us a time for any of the tests we did. As I said in my post, I think OP (or anyone else) can finish this in 4 months. But I think there's a high risk of injury.Great job. Remember to make a new thread every single time you run so that we can all congratulate you.When did you start running?

What has your training been like?Indeed! I own several pairs so I can rotate them through the washing machine! :DI think you'll be OK if you're fit now. Get up to running 5k 4 times a week and then start a 12-week half-marathon training program that ends on the date of the race. The mileage for a relay race might seem daunting, but it's actually far easier than running that same mileage all in one go, I've found. The toughest part about a Ragnar is holding your breath when sitting in the van that smells of B.O. for almost a whole day.in each case, the cartilage behind my kneecap was found to resemble "crab meat" and was significantly degraded. In parts, my kneecaps have no more cartilage. Microfracture was done to create a sort of backup but it's really not doing the job.Good job! Keep going!

(Leaving the house will always be the hardest part)I took 8 minutes off my half-marathon PB last year (1.34 at the age of 40) after wearing them for less than 2 months.

I've also had much less knee and ankle pain since I started wearing them - I used to get regular mild knee pain and occasionally quite bad and now I get virtually none.

I realise this is probably due to them forcing a better technique on me, and obviously they're not for everyone, but I love them.

Jeez do they stink, though :-)You really think a fit person can't finish a relay race with 4 months of training? I'm all for training properly but I think OP has plenty of time to get in shape to finish this event.The problem that led to the class action suit being settled was that VFF didn't have sufficient scientific evidence to substantiate some of the marketing claims that it made. 

They could be 100% correct in their claims, but they didn't have sufficient evidence at the time they were made. Stair climber.  The real one.  You don't often see them anymore because of how much floor space they take up, but wow can I ever work up a sweat on the one in our gym.  Pretty much the only cardio equipment I'll touch besides the treadmill.Cool story.Good work, keep it up!!Sorry to not provide anything useful but isn't runner's knee really synonyms with Patellofemoral pain syndrome which doesn't imply tissue degradation?Dave's killer bread (my favourite) filled with almond butter and bananas is always good. Easy on the stomach but enough sustainable energy. Also, some natural turkey jerky is great. Protein bars are nice because you can have a few bites at a time so you don't get that awful stomachache if you eat it too fast. Also, SKITTLES. I know it sounds like a joke but they help settle my stomach and if it works for Marshawn Lynch, I think there's science behind it? Good luck! I'm doing Ragnar in the summer... No idea how I got convinced to join so we'll see haha. Cheers. Seeeee!....you can do what's hard!!! Keep it up!I typically wear dry fit shirts; short sleeves and tank tops. 

I will try body glide! Thank you guys :)if you can currently run a comfortable 8 minute/mile, you will annihilate a 4 hour marathon, especially with running 75 mpw. even if your longest run has been ~15miles, your body should be prepped for a marathon after like a 2 week taper, since this is pretty much hansons' method.

with that said, marathon is a different beast and things come up over the back-end 13.1 miles that you never thought of, especially with nutrition.I don't know about you, but conditioning myself with Vibrams and with sometimes running barefoot has actually reduced my race times in sneakers.

You sound a little misinformed bub. You should probably take a lesson from the legend Bikila himself. Trust me, you can't randomly decide to run a marathon barefoot like Bikila did if you only ever wear sneakers. Try it, you'll injure yourself in no time. It takes some serious conditioning and strengthening of support muscles you can't get from only running in sneakers. Sure, he ran marathons in sneakers, but behind-the-curtains he put serious hours into barefoot/minimalist style training that improved his racing-with-sneakers performance.

I suggest spending less time reveling in sensationalist sneakers-VS-Vibrams drama and actually doing some research.Definitely! I am young, as well, (female, though) and assumed I would be able to push through. It's often too easy to ignore those cues your body gives you because you think you can tough it out. There will always be other days, other runs and other races. Listen to your body!I hurt just reading that It's technically correct, but not really suitable for this sub.Sorry for being vague. It's a little bit of both, in that my distance has increased and my mile times have improved. The more drastic improvement of the two is definitely in the mile time though. I used to peak out at around 7:30/mile, and after about three weeks of slowly integrating the shoes into my workout, I was hitting a reliable 7:05. I'm no speedster by any means, so that jump was enormous to me.Doable, perhaps, but don't just try to survive your first marathon, do well in it.

Look for a 16 week plan that starts at that 80 km/week level. Yes you can run more now, but a plan like Daniels, Hanson, Pfitzinger, etc... will require some speed work and you might not be ready for 120 km &amp; speed work. Dropping back to 80 km will give you a little more rest to recover from new speed work.Damn. This is crazy. Easily one of the worst scares of one's life. I'm a young guy, athletic, so i thought i was invincible running in the city heat. I now know better.TIL physical activity = taking steps&gt; my mile times have increased

Increased, or improved?

&gt; my calf-strength is through the roof

No kidding. My calves are the stuff of legends now.I must have the one pair of feet that Vibram had in mind when they designed these shoes. My chronic knee and back pains have disappeared, my mile times have ~~increased~~ improved, my calf-strength is through the roof, and I suffer no ill-effects of the shoes.

I get that they're an awful failure for literally everyone else, but for me they gave me absolutely everything I could've ever wanted out of running shoes without any of the drawbacks.

Edit: Clear up confusionThen he's gonna get there pretty fast.That's awesome mileage and provides a great base for a marathon. That said, it's almost impossible to understand the effort it takes to do a marathon until you do one, and not having put in the long runs needed to withstand the mileage will mean you're not going to have a good time. Kepe up the mileage, start a 16-week plan, do a marathon at the end of it and you might actually enjoy the experience.What the, what the. Your a brave man. I was kinda f'ed up a couple of weeks after. I couldn't sit down and watch a single tv show after, nor focus on work, or walk quickly. I'm just now feeling normal again. Scary shit.The worst bit is they literally trademarked the name. I love my Bikilas, but damn, that's douchey.They make morons who don't condition themselves and don't bother strengthening  support muscles in the foot/ankle* more prone to injury.

But sure, they do make you slower. I can always run a race faster in some kind of sneakers over Vibrams.Am I the only one around who genuinely finds them more comfortable than running shod? They definitely slow me down, but running shod tires me out much more quickly.I passed out at kilometer 36 of a marathon last June. It was a 35 degree Celsius day and an out of town mountain race where I had forgotten my hat at home but thought I would be okay without it. I am extremely fair skinned and haired and always cover up in the sun, so I don't know why I thought I wouldn't need that protection for a race.

I stopped sweating around kilometer 20, but continued on, chugging water and sports drink and stopping at every aid station for extra water. A medical team member gave me an assessment at kilometer 35 and gave me the 'all clear' to continue on if I wanted to. Less than a kilometer later, I passed out and fell down a small embankment to the left of the pathway that I had been staggering along. I definitely wasn't running anymore by that point. No major injuries from the fall, just some cuts and scrapes.

In hindsight, I made terrible decisions that day. I should have stopped when I stopped sweating. It took me a few days to recover with lots of rest and SO MUCH WATER. No lingering effects and I learned a lot about reading (and listening) to my body that day. Heat exhaustion is no joke. Take care of your body and always have lots of water on hot days -- in the summer, I always plan my long runs to include at least two convenience stores/friends houses in case I need to top up my bottles.This is great! Thanks so much. I think I'll aim for a base of approximately 20-25 miles a week (spread over 5 or 6 days) before I start the half marathon training. The trainings I've looked at start at approximately 15 miles a week and then top out around 30, so I'll be adding some miles, but that seems to be OK. I plan for most of them to be really easy miles, esp. since I'm such a slowpoke for now. 

None of the beginner plans have anything like tempo runs or intervals, so I probably will mostly stick to easy miles for my first half. I plan on running some 5k races for run as I train, so I'm hoping to see progress as I tack on the weekly miles. 
The problem was actually that Vibrams made it sound like they were *instantly* better, which if you believed could get you hurt if you put on Vibrams for the first time and ran a 5k. I had never done any minimalist-style running before, took me three months of adjusting/conditioning/getting stronger to be able to run a 5K in them.If you are putting in ~75 mile weeks, I'd say you are completely capable of running a marathon. This doesn't mean you'll get your sub 4 because I'm not sure of your race speeds but you are over qualified compared to some of the people around here who tackle marathons.Properly train for it. A marathon isn't just double a half marathon. It's a completely different beast.

Properly train, then blow a sub-4 out of the water.For actual running you definitely need some more thickness. I've been running in the same pair of mizuno flats since 2012, but I'll definitely look into the purrs when those finally fall apart. the thing is, I only feel the pain when I run. So during the four months, I feel nothing.Always following through! Quality .jpg!They only counted steps taken. I don't care about that. I care about the GPS tracking.&gt; just make...more injury prone

Only if you buy them and expect to run just as far in barefoot/minimalist shoes as in regular shoes.&gt; previously represented

I know, me too...I'm surprised they don't make one. I like the squish because I run in an urban area and find glass in the soles on occasion. Deleting this because you didn't read the FAQ or look at the sidebar.Me, 5' 7", a bit pudgy, age 44 at the time. I did something pretty similar and completed my first marathon. BUT: I was slow and it hurt. A lot. Especially after mile 20. 

On the other hand, it made me fall madly in love with running and I've run three more marathons, faster and much less painfully, since. 

As far as achievable, sure, I think you could do it. But set your expectations properly or you might hurt yourself. Paula kinda talks [about it on her website.]( http://www.paularadcliffe.com/serialisations-that-day/)Oh man! I was on the verge of blacking out after running a 50k in the dead heat of August last year. There are points at which I still have a hard time remembering bits of the end. Over the summer I had ran dozens of long distances in 80 and 90 degree temps but come race day I kinda forgot how important it was to pace myself and ended up all sorts of wonky after finishing. Erratic heart rate, dizzy, blurred vision, I had stopped sweating, puking up everything to the point of dry heaving, slurred speech, loss of motor functions and couldn't carry on a full sentence if I tried. Even a few hallucinations. Might have also been the tequila/magarita at mile 28 but I digress. Needless to say, I was an age group placer and didn't die so it was totally worth it.

My opinion is that if you are fine within a few hours after the race you'll be okay unless you have a history of heart issues. Then doctor, doctor, doctor. http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/relief-all-round-after-paula-pauses-on-road-to-glory-1-708248No we can't count this one. And I always thought she stopped to pee during that race. 

**edit** oh, Paula...You asked for it.....

http://www.bur.st/~kim/radcliffe-posterior.jpgGood luck.  I don't think you can't do it in six months.  There is plenty time to get a half and a full in IF you really want to.  So don't be put off!I wasn't necessarily trying to scare you off, but if you can forgo the "instant" gratification the experience will definitely be more enjoyable and involve less risk. Plus if you're willing to put the same level of dedication into training for that half marathon in six months as you'd put into the full marathon you should be able to crush the half, rather than just surviving the full. Sounds harder than Columbus. I saw some other posts here about first time runners completing it though. I think I'll go for it! Thanks for your input, I'll keep that in mind.Try to convince a friend or two to join you. I don't run the same pace as my buddies, but going to the race together is fun. We can hang out, warm up together before, and they are usually cheering me on when I finish which is nice. Of course if you are the faster one, you have to do the cheering. :)These are wise words, OP.  As tempting as it would be to tackle the challenge, you will most likely end up miserable, injured, or both. /u/philthycasual does this count?

&gt; Elite marathoner Paula Radcliffe famously dropped a deuce in front of thousands of spectators.

Also, why have I never heard this story? Anyone have any info about it?I really wish they'd make a pure shoe with that same 4mm-ish sole thickness like VFFs. I mostly wear minimal shoes for lifting/non-running stuff, and the lack of squish is crucial.You got this! I'll see you out there tomorrow.Thanks ! Let me build up some mileage first, by trying to do a half and then a full. Thanks Much! I think time to re-do the plan and focus on half then :) I love my Vibrams btw, no hate there. Those things are bombproof. I only really wear them for lifting+sprints, but my ankles/feet feel a lot more stable now. 

As for prices, I was almost always able to buy flats on steep sales, since few people bought them in store, while minimal shoes sold out so fast that you had to get them new, so I'm probably a tad biased.This is awesome, I haven't ice skated in years!Thanks ! I love Runnit ! Exactly the kind of feedback I was looking for. You guys are great !! Wow !! Maybe I should then just try for the Half ! Thanks ! Thanks ! This is the kind of advice I was looking for. I dont want to make any noobie mistakes. Maybe I should just look into running a half in July and then a Full in Fall ! No.  Your mileage is too low.  I have done a half-marathon while running 3 days of the week, but in addition to running I was doing about 6 other non-running cardio workouts per week.My understanding was that the problem wasn't that vibrams are *worse* for your feet but that Vibram claimed they were *better*. I mean, the evidence is shitty for any particular shoe. The running community has a long history of taking things with little to no evidence as gospel.That is very interesting insight. You make some good points. I'm right footed so I usually start with that foot first. DAE transition to left footed running? What are some good left footed running shoes for around $50?What you eat after the run is more important than what you eat before.I had the opposite experience.

Racings flats were expensive and fell apart after 2 seasons when they were being used exclusively for racing and a speed workout every other week. Meanwhile newer minimal shoes have lasted me over 900 miles, and a pair of (gasp) vibrams went for 2500 milesLiterally every boot I've ever worn in the army has had a vibram sole.Will Leer: Stud. Nick Willis: Olympic Silver Medalist Stud. Hell of a workout, especially at 7,000ft altitude

4 Mile Tempo: 5:08, 5:04, 4:59, 4:56 

6x600: 1:39, 1:38, 1:37, 1:35, 1:32, 1:31 (!!!!!!!)

4x200: 27.6, 26.6, 26.3, 25.0 (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Unreal workout.Interesting read. Unsurprisingly, my advice is of course YES! You should race again. And everyone else's responses will say the same. 

But I suspect we don't need to tell you...because for all the awkwardness that is the first race, I'm willing to bet you'll be turning it over in your mind, thinking about how you can do better, thinking about the excitment and nerves you felt before the race...


PS- When you do a race with more people there'll be plenty more people your age. And I too find that it can be hard to talk to people before a race, but I think that's because a lot of people are worried and focusing hard on what's in front of them. But if you strike up a conversation a lot of people are happy to relieve some of the stress and have a chat.According to the article he also ran his next race in shoes. Real talk: you are fucked.

To be really honest with you, this seems like a risky endeavor and I can't recommend that you attempt this race.  You probably CAN do it, but just because you can do something does not make it a wise decision. You are basically training for something in between a marathon and a half marathon. Generally, it is suggested that a marathoner have at least a year of running experience (at the minimum) and have been running at least 30-40 miles per week for 6 months before starting a training program. Lower-end programs max out at 50 mpw but 60-70 is not uncommon.For a half marathon, I think a program that has you running 40 mpw is sufficient to get you to the starting line trained.  So I think you'd want to be doing at least 40+ mpw.

Earlier today I was thinking about how an equation of minimum training volume=three times the race distance. This seems applicable.  A person can train for a 5K on just 9 miles a week. 18-20mpw seems good for a 10K. I think, as I said, that 40mpw is good for a HM. And ~80mpw will probably get someone through a marathon happy and healthy.

Now, a lot of people run races very undertained. I've heard many stories of people running half marathons on 20-25 mpw. Or marathons on little more than 30mpw. But I think that when the race distance becomes 50% (or more) of the total weekly volume that the chance for injury becomes really high.

If you are dead-set on doing this in 4 months, then so be it. I think your risk of injury will be high.  I can't emphasize this enough.  "Just doing it" should never be the goal. Completing the distance in relative comfort without injury (either in training or in the goal event) should always be part of the paradigm.If it was heat exhaustion/stroke, you'll be more susceptible to it happening again in the future.  You'll have to be doubly careful.As others say, achievable but just.

I'd personally be more comfortable with consistently higher mileage and more than one 20 mile run!

Do you feel you have to cross train?  Cross training can be really valuable for people who do high mileage and want a less stressful alternative one day a week but while your mileage is this low I'd be tempted to turn the cross training day into another running day so you are running 5 days a week and getting a better mileage.Brooks pure flow shoes are what you describe, but with a low drop, so not super flat, and some padding. They have a split between the big and the rest of the toes, but no pocket. Vibram has been making soles for shoes since rubber soles became a thing. I have always been a decent runner and in generally good health and when I see people who are overweight out there working at bettering themselves, it pumps me up so hard. I think I am probably normal in that regard, no one is judging or going to mock (there is the occasional jerk). Keep it up, and know that everyone you come across is probably thinking "you can do it!" And want to see you succeed!! I'm a fan of Petzl, personally, but beyond the basic specs, it's mostly just preference. IMO, if you want to go minimalist, most racing/XC flats are a lot better than most modern minimal shoes. I think most minimal models these days have far too much room in the toes, and not nearly enough durability for the dollar. 

It doesn't help that race flats are comparatively dirt cheap relative to inov8s or Minimus or whatever.Vibrams were meant as a boat shoe, and tbh, the separate toes are pretty nice for that. 

IMO, for lifting/running/fitness stuff, a separate big toe pocket and then one main toe box for the other 4 would be ideal.Dammit!Not what you want to hear, but if you've had the same pain for four months now, you definitely should be seeing a doctor and/or PT.Sprints work the quads, glutes and hamstringssounds like you might be a little biased toward your quads at the moment. Sometimes doing single-leg squats can help balance things, but some soreness/burn in the quads during sprinting isn't uncommon.All the data I've ever seen suggests that they're really pretty much equivalent, and whether minimal works for you or not is based upon your gait type and which of your joints is the most injury prone. I feel that it might be a bad photo. My arch on my right foot is much lower than the left one. Also I've had problems with my right foot a while ago when I was out running. Actually I had problems walking for a month because of my right foot. So I wonder if there are any good exercise I can take after. I was to a "doctor" that helped me with some exercises, most likely to make my foot stronger. But maybe there are more. :)Jeez, mention his name. He's only a fucking legend. 

He's Abebe Bikila, twice Olympic marathon champion, the first great Ethiopian runner. And it's right that Vibram are sued, I hate when these companies appropriate a dead person like this.&gt; Do you think this is achievable?

Yes.  Emphasis on "achievable" or "doable". As in, yeah, you can "do" this...

&gt;Too aggressive?

Yes, times 10. Way too aggressive. This has INJURY written all over it.&gt;Then all of a sudden it just gets kicked into high gear.

Well, that's a Hal Higdon training plan for you: start out at like 15 miles a week. Suddenly: 20 mile long run on a 40 mile week!Let me preface this with I am not a lawyer but I do work in the film industry and deal with licensing alot. This is going to be a challenging case to win as his father has passed away and legally his legacy and name have been passed into the public domain. Meaning after you die anyone can use your name or talk about your life in or for basically anything as long as it's not deamed defamation or slander. Basically that means you have to be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt anything nagative you state about the person is true. That doesn't mean his son doesn't have a case as life rights are crazy complicated; but it will likely be an uphill battle. It's for this reason multiple Steve Jobs Bioflicks have been/ are being made one that acquired licensing rights and one that did not. They both are in the right despite some being upset that a film was made without the families permission. But hey can you imagine how difficult it would be to record history if we had to get licensing rights for every single person. And just to be clear any copyrights or patents do transfer at death I am only referring to life rights. But let me reiterate I am not a lawyer. I am a film producer who deals with life rights all the time; but that doesn't make me correct. This is just my understanding of how it works. I have a lawyer who deals with all of this for me. While I feel you should always have the families permission before using their dead relatives sometimes that's not possible; but that does not mean the film shouldn't be made. I will be interested to see how this case is worked out 4 months and I'm a cyclist mainly so I am in shape just not long distance running shape I agree. I really liked seeing Deena Kastor and Daniel Njenga in the first one, but wasn't very interested in any of the people in the second, and I'm sure I wouldn't know about the triathletes. I thought others might be more excited, though.Filthy hobby jogger.Over-pronation is an entirely different thing. Yes your feet are flat, but so are mine and a lot of other people's. Nothing wrong with them, you just might want shoes with more stability.Yeah, I really like the feel of light shoes with minimal padding but the separate toes seems gimmicky as hell. So, YMMV, but anyone I know of who has tried to speed up a recovery by doing any number of tips or tricks has found themselves worse off. The best advice is going to come from a doctor, but a slow recovery that leaves you feeling back to where you started is heaps better than a fast one that leaves you prone to re-injury.I was just referring to how your long runs stagger -  7, 5, 9, 10, 7 etc.  I understand the thinking behind it, just not sure how necessary it is in this plan.

Most other times (and even in a lot of Hal's other plans) the long run climbs consistenty, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, etc. 

Back when I started running I used Hal's [HM Intermediate](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51132/Half-Marathon-Intermediate-Training-Program) program (but extended it by repeating some weeks) and really liked it.
I hope they do too. But I also hope vibrams stick around afterwords.  I don't have the money to hoard them at the moment.  Ha. I find that if you approach a Ranger style rely training like a half marathon, you'll be fine.  So you can use any appropriate half marathon training plan.

As for your knees, depends on why they are hurting.  If it is because you don't run much, run more.  If it is because they are weak, lunges are great, imo.  

As for shorts, whatever you want.  The number of people who care is exactly 1 - you.  Nobody else pays attention.  

You'll learn pace as you train.  

Basic running shoes are probably a good place to start.Shoes: go to a good local running store and get fitted. How they look is totally unimportant. Buy the right shoe for you, not something for the ladies (or fellas).

Shorts: 2 inches is kind of a long inseam, IMO. I'd go with 1" or maybe even 0.5". Really, the shorter the better. The main idea is to be showing A LOT of skin out there.

Pacing: Assuming you are sufficiently sleep deprived, I would strong suggest keeping ahead of the lions. Getting eaten would really put a damper on your time goals.  Beyond that, stay in a "conversational" zone. If you want, you can get a heart rate monitor and get into HR zone training--some people have a lot of success with that.  Look up "Maffatone" and "Mark Allen" (he's a triathlete, but he had a massive success with HRM training).

Beyond that, you need to get ready to run A LOT.  You are basically training to run 20.9 miles, total, in a single race. One option would be to look at marathon training plans. Another option might be to look at half marathon plans, but really looking at higher-mileage pans.

Hopefully the race is at least 6 months away.  I don't know what your current training is like. If you are already running 3 days a week, then start running 4. If you are already running 4 days a week, then target 5. For now, focus on a lot of steady-state running.  You can use a VDOT calculator to help you figure what pace you should be running your easy runs. You might consider running one speed workout per week (I'd suggest a tempo run) IF you are running 20+ mpw. If you aren't running 20mpw, then make that your goal. And if that is the case, SLOW DOWN. Most lower mileage runners run way too fast in training.  Most running should be pretty laid-back and easy.I think he means what are you putting in there to drink. Electrolyte powders can make the bladders really gross really fast. I only ever put water in mine and then I rinse it out at the end of a run and hang it to dry with something in it (I use a wooden spoon) to keep it from collapsing on itself. I have used the same pack for many years and have never had to do anything more than this. Oh, good idea.  I will buy some flavored almonds at the store today, thank you.Perfect, thanks!Ran across this myself but thanks for the response.They probably do work for some people! They sure did sell a lot of them, and for that reason I hope the Bikila family gets a nice chunk of money for the settlement.&gt; That shouldn't matter on the shoes should it? Or is a more barefoot shoe preferable? 

It shouldn't matter to the shoe.  Generally, you are going to get 400-500 miles on a pair of shoes, and if those are all 4 mile runs or 10 mile runs, it doesn't change much.

The preferred shoe is the one that you are comfortable and don't get hurt in.  For some people that is a "barefoot" style shoe, for vast majority of people, it is not.I can't speak to your shoe concerns, but I have made the transition to softer surfaces (for similar reasons as you, plus I enjoyed running on the grass!) and I will tell you that it might take a little bit of time to adjust. Your ankles and calves are going to be moving more laterally (side-to-side) than what you're used to. You might want to transition to a mid-foot landing, which is preferred over a heel strike- it's more stable and natural, especially on the ups and downs.That statement is extremely demeaning to the topic. These shoes do actually work for a lot of people. &gt; I've been relatively inconsistent 

That is step one, be consistent.

For increasing distance, adding a mile to one run/week is a decent rule of thumb.  I.e., after you get consistent at 4x2.5, you can do 3x2.5 and one 3.5 for a week or two.  http://www.runningusa.org/annual-reportsWhat kind of shirt are you wearing? For me that makes all the difference in the world. With marathon plans 18-24 weeks is considered the optimal amount of time for a buildup, but this typically requires you to have a base of mileage already heading into it. My suggestion is to focus on a half marathon in July and then train for a late fall/early winter marathon since it'll be easier to train once temperatures drop in the latter part of the year.

As far as the plan goes, I'm of the opinion that consistent running is more beneficial than overloading on 1 or 2 days a week and that you need to be running at least 50 miles per week before you can be ready to run a full marathon without completely bonking out. Does anyone ever feel "in place" the first time they do something?  I certainly don't.

Also, it was a 5k in February.  Those are pretty rare.  The month generally has horrible weather and most people just try to grind through training instead of peak for a race.  If they do race, it is a "get in, get out" attitude to avoid spending time in the cold.

And yeah, male 20-29 is a dead zone.  Being competitive takes its toll on you, so guys who ran seriously in high school/college tend to disappear for a bit.  Other guys haven't realized how much those nights of pizza and beer have done to their body yet (you yourself are 29, so you are just on the early edge of the curve).

As others have said, if you want a true social running experience, find a running club to do training runs with.  Spoiler: you'll feel awkward and out of place the first couple times you go to one of those too.  I have one that I will randomly go to, and I still feel a bit out of place even though I generally lead the front pack through the workout.  I just don't know the guys that well yet.That's what I've been doing wrong. I thought it was right/left. It is true, I am extremely lustrous.I did something close to what you did, going from barely being able to run a 30 minute 5K to a 3:45 marathon in about six months using a very similar schedule. So yes, it's possible. It's also brutal and risky. For at least six weeks I was battling a knee injury, and with this kind of schedule there's no leeway so I just kept running and suffering. 

So do I recommend it? No, not really. Do I regret it? Hell no! It was kind of stupid, but I don't know if I would have ever done it otherwise, and despite the difficulties I came out of it loving running more than ever. 

So you have to know yourself. Is it worth the suffering, and the risk of injury (potentially permanent) to do it so soon? 

As offensive as this comment is, it was also actually pretty funny. Begrudging upvote.30' is not too early at all. Seriously. I've been late once. ONCE.

Being at the back of the pack, weaving around people walking, not being able to warm up properly, not being able to go to the bathroom? All PR killing things.It's hilly! Going up to the bridge nearly everyone around your pace walks. After the bridge there are quite a bit of rolling hills in the park that will take your toll. Finally the stretch back towards the bay isn't that bad anymore. I'd download Snapchat for this!I'm in the same boat as you, but I do a lot of parkour so I'm doing additional cross training with rock climbing! (Not sure if that'll help with shin splints, though...)The Spirit of the Marathon 1 was great.  Spirit of the Marathon 2 was mediocre.  This Triathlon film might not be worth watching.Most of the posts I see are people asking if the pain in their legs is normal or what kind of GPS watch to buy... but outside of that I was just trying to compound what I've seen with other people's knowledge. I didn't know people would take it so poorly.Thanks ! Sorry but which Long Distance Cycling?
Is it for the "Cross training" ? I was going to look and research more into what cross training I can do to help me. :) :) 

For the long distances towards the second half of the plan is from Hal's plan here
http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program 

And that's why I wanted to get feedback from the guys here because you guys certainly know way more than I do at this point :) Thanks for your feedback. I am not too set on this particular race. But I know that if I "train for too long" I dont want to give up and loose interest. So after lurking around for quite some team and reading through some of the other plans. I thought that about 6 months should be optimum to train for a Marathon.

And then there's the motivation to run a Marathon before I turn 40 :)Heh, kind of my thought.  Through week 16 there are some pretty conservative increases (more or less). 10mpw to 25 over 4 months is reasonable.

Then all of a sudden it just gets kicked into high gear.

I say follow through with the half then be open to re-evaluating the marathon goal. 

Also what's up with the weird Long run distance cycling? The mankini is always popular.  http://thatdingostolemy6pack.com/the-borat-mankini-debacle/&gt; Too concerned that it could otherwise be patronizing.

I've gotten two compliments while I'm running in my life and they both were giant pick me ups. The first was when I was really pushing myself, the second was when all I had was to just do it. That second one got me the extra mile. I hear a left/right alternating gait has been all the rage recently.I have no clue at all about this but I would imagine that in this particular case you can compare for how much similar elite sporters lend their naming rights to companies selling gear. Let's say standard practice is x% of net sales when then you have a base line number that you can apply.

See....if you read this sub all the time, you'd be able to pull some industry trends yourself by looking at all of the posts. Or, you could google and get some answers. Or, you could go to a marathon expo and see which booths are the most popular. But that's like...actual work.Little late to the game, but I might bee interested! 

NE OhioJust wanted to highlight that first link. It's the best thing you'll read on this.

Consistency is the most important thing, then distance, then pace, then specific training plans.you could also look at the Altra one^2

they look like they'd flex a lot, and they have a very wide forefoot if you have wide feet

http://www.altrarunning.com/fitness/en/Altra/Men/one-squared-mensWelp, sorry. I read this sub all the time because I'm gearing up for my first marathon at the end of the month and just figured it'd be a good place to get a response from some marathoners. Apologies.You're welcome!Yeah I'm not sure what the deal was there.  After seeing you get filleted I just filled out the survey with "Obstacle races are retarded"I'd be worried about catching my head on fire.Honestly, at this point, no amount of training will do much help. It's possible it could help you mentally prepare, but there's a reason people take weeks to prepare for races. At this point you can just try and figure out what pace works best for you, figure out what works best with your inhaler, and hope for the best.This is right on the edge of what I would call achievable. Yes you can make it through it if you don't get injured, but with essentially zero base mileage on your legs, a 20-mile long run is going to be brutal, and that's entirely glossing over what the last 10K of the marathon will do to you. If you're dead set on doing THIS race THIS year, then good luck and godspeed, but if I were you, I would seriously consider training more over the course of this year and tackling the marathon next July. Respect the distance.I am the only one I know in my city that runs in the winter. I have seen a few people but I've never met them. 

A weird anomaly about my winter running: I bundle up like crazy to run in -30C weather, but I have never worn more than socks and regular shoes on my feet. Obviously I'm very aware of what's going on with my body, but I have never felt the need to do this. No damage, no problems. It's odd.  Bravo! Keep it up :). To steal a phrase from a totally unrelated social movement, "it gets better" ;)heh... people were not such big fans of [my response](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/2vjems/obstacle_race_survey_xpost_radventureracing/) to this poor guy's schtick. An overwhelming number of runners today started from a similar place as you. When I see runners who are struggling on their first, or tenth run, I want to high five them, because starting is so much harder, and I remember. 

I remember not wanting to go for a run, because I was afraid my nieghbours would see me leave the house, run halfway down the block, then start walking because I was just kidding myself. 

I remember feeling like a fool. I remember feeling like every runner was laughing at me. Then I became a runner, and I realized they weren't laughing, they were cheering me on. That the only way to do it was to go through this, and that *this* was how someone becomes a runner.

Endure. And don't forget where you came from when you are the cute, bouncy experienced runner passing someone struggling to start.Easily digestible carbs and protein are what you want. Pretzels, chips, peanut butter, bagels and the like. I started running again too after years of partying/smoking through undergrad, then wasting away in front of a computer with minimal exercise in grad school. Trust me, my lungs know what you're going through. The struggle is real.

Some commenters have touched on the fact that walking-running in intervals leading up to straight running works best to increase your fitness. I will definitely say that is the *only* thing that has gotten me back to running again. C25K is an awesome program and it has completely transformed my fitness and breathing abilities. I'm just at the end of it now and will be running a 5k race in a week.

Now I'm not a  doctor, nor a marathon runner. But my best friend is a marathon runner *and* a doctor, and I will try to relay some info she shared with me when I started up:

Don't go too fast. Try to run at a pace you could hold a comfortable conversation with.

Breath using your full lung capacity. As you read this, put your hand on your stomach and practice breathing to the bottom of your lungs, to a point you feel your stomach rise. Apparently, breathing all the way down to the bottom of your lungs is something experienced runners just naturally do. Pfft. For me, I hit points where I have to recite a little mantra in my head to pace my breathing. (Breath in "twinkle twinkle," breath out "little star.") if you feel yourself taking shorter breaths, try to gain back control as best as you can. In my experience, if I keep breathing short it will only get worse. If you simply can't--rest. But don't stop pushing yourself. Be patient, and keep going! :)

Edit: Not sure if this would interest you, but I cross train with yoga. Yoga is incredibly helpful for my breathing, as you learn to move pose to pose based on inhales and exhales.Hey thanks so much guys, very helpful stuff!Make sure you take enough electrolytes to balance with the water you are taking.If you're not aware that it's Bikila's family sueing over the name it's easy to think that it's about Vibram hurting marathoners or something like the top-level comment assumed. It's kind of a shit title and not really a huge news story IMO.It's kinda wrong to characterize him as a barefoot marathon runner (it was a one time thing, he didn't inhale) but otherwise the headline is spot on and honestly pretty unsensational for USA Today.So I just checked my inhaler and it's Albuterol, which is a rescue inhalor for after my run if I'm not mistaken.I have a Black Diamond Storm, and it is awesome.  100% waterproof and 160 lumens is extremely bright.  I've used a lot of cheap headlamps in the past, but this has been worth every penny.bleh... I thought this was over something other than a name. Nothing to see here.Please take my short survey, thank you. A lot of it has to do with weight as well.  I'm a a bigger guy at around 235lbs, and I eat through shoes at a pretty good clip.  I generally get a new pair at closer to 250-300 miles. Uh, how?  It accurately represents the case.[Sorry, but a sweet name such as Throbbing Member has to be taken.]( https://wastecase.bandcamp.com)Especially if that place is approx. 3 miles away.Definitely don't be disappointed in your pace - that's a really solid first 5k time! If you decide to keep it going, all you can do is shoot to do better next time. 

It took me until my 5th before I started feeling satisfied with my time, effort, etc.Sensationalist headline is sensationalist.I would imagine swimming is great. Even running in a pool would put less stress on your joints and stuff.Look up you tube videos on how to use it.  It really increases an inhalers effectiveness.  Most people use inhalers really ineffectively.I put a mix of warm water and dish soap. and use a sponge to clean the bladder. You can also mix warm water with a little bit of bleach (1/2 a teaspoon)Ahh, okay. It's all connected anyway. Still, the heat is nothing to play around with .Well, i guess i should be alright, still running, but very cautious of proper hydrationDamn I am in for a rough week. Lol But I need to do this, or it could be grounds for military seperation. It's only a few months old-ish. No more than 6 months. 

I have a spacer but I ~~don't really use it~~ have never used it.. Yeah, I mean I enjoyed the experience of running in a crowd. I think my expectations were just skewed going in and I kinda lost sight of why I wanted to race in the first place (which was more about doing something 'special' once in a while to motivate myself to keep up my fitness and as a barometer for my personal progress). I had heard other people talk about all the awesome friends they'd made from running and expected that to happen right away, which was obviously unrealistic.

Going to go into the next race (bigger field), without the expectations, focus on running the best race **I** can and not worry about anything else.What're you putting in there? I have a bladder with the same design and just turn it inside out and rinse it after each use.. My understanding is that exercise associated postural hypotension is frequently misdiagnosed as heatstroke or heat exhaustion. Weird that it still seems to be a problem, though.

After a spring marathon in heat that reached 89 (after training over the winter and cool spring temps that I don't think got above 70) I crossed the line, took water, and then began feeling nauseated after drinking a little recovery drink. I sat down for a few minutes and began to feel much better. Some med guys asked if I was okay and I said I was but could he help me stand up. He jerked me very quickly to my feet which caused a massive head rush and I nearly blacked out. I ended up in the med tent but was fine. From what I've read and understand, I was suffering from EAPH not dehydration or heatstroke/exhaustion.Not really. I run early morning or at night on hot days, drink water, etc. But I've also been fainting since I was a kid, so I'm not that worried about it.Body Glide is amazing.  Any time I run more than about 8 miles I start to get in pretty rough shape from all the rubbing. Body Glide eliminates the blisters, chaffing, and bloody nipples!How old is your inhaler?  You might look into getting an actual nebulizer.  It will deliver the med much more effectively.  Or get so ething called a spacer to use with your inhaler.  Anyway, this sounds lime uncontrolled asthma/being out if shape.Being ridiculously out of shape, it is possible for be to be able to run a 2-mile in 19:36 by next week? Complete objective opinion.I think this is the perspective I was needing and you really just put the whole experience in context for me. I'm going to keep this in mind for the next race, just focus on running the race and let the rest fall into place as it may. Thank you!Goddamn. This is some serious ish. I keep a water bottle glued to me now. So no lingering problems though? I have. I have done it 30 minutes before, *and* right after I got back. Neither really helps.I would use your inhaler BEFORE you run.  You are having asthma symptoms.  Talk to a doc, there are multiple inhaler meds that might help more.Requests for free market research are an increasing trend.fuckin' kids. gott damn

Edit: This is facetious bitterness...Yeah I think I'll do an easy 2-3k warmup jog next time so I have something productive to do rather than standing around looking lost haha.Haha! That's sounds like a good plan :)

Part of my problem is I'd looked up some similar nearby race results (and this event's results from last year).. and looked at how I would have placed based on my expected 5:15/km time, and felt pretty good about it.  I never really adjusted my expectations from that 5:15/km pace and somehow magically expected I'd hit it on race day even though I was still running slow from recovering form the illness.&gt;I started off at a good pace, about 8min mile, slow pace.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you're out of shape. An 8 minute mile, though obviously not a competitive time, is actually a pretty fast mile for the average person. You yourself say having that time before was the result of your basic... why is it surprising that you can't run it now? It sounds like you haven't done any serious running since October. You likely feel like crap because you're over-exerting yourself. 

I have no idea how PT tests work, but yeah, I'd say you won't be noticeably better by next Thursday.Racing may just not be your thing.

I have run almost every organized race I've ever done ALONE (save for relay-ing a marathon that my mom went to for picture-taking since I needed proof of my accomplishment for a senior project in High school) 

I don't usually talk to people, and I just sort of do my thing. For some reason this experience is a rush for me. 

I am decently fast, so when I get to the end I like to cheer for the other finishers (but once i hit the 20-25 bracket I stopped placing ha)

I often make a PR in races because the people around me push me to go a little bit faster.

That's why I like doing organized races 

You may not find any of those things particularly compelling, or the other reasons may outweigh those potential positives.

That's totally cool. 

My best suggestion is maybe to look around for a few more races and find out what past entry volumes were (how many participants in your age bracket?) and choose based on that. 

Also you can't usually expect elevations on course maps, but if you do races around your town you can drive out and run the course beforehand sometimes (depending where it is, obviously) 

Also, you could try talking to someone first! I say that, but I would never do it myself because I am scared of social interaction :PThanks for taking the time to respond with so much detail! This is really helpful.

I did recently get on Strava and joined a couple groups in my state, but haven't really found anyone in my area yet.

The running group nearby runs early morning, and I was concerned I might be out of place with the people there... but your experience is encouraging. I might give it a shot.I have! Doc told me to be careful running in hot weather, and to make sure I stay well hydrated. Scared the hell out of me. #####&amp;#009;

Depends on your goals, but that is plenty of training to successfully complete a 5k. But if you want to run a 5k fast, you are going to have to do more structured training and increase your mileage. Share your goals, and we might be able to provide some additional guidance.Breathe through your nose and keep your mouth closed, you will learn how to control your breathing. It's a bit of a training exercise... I was told this and never looked back, running just got easier! And when it gets tough because I go a longer distance or increase my speed I just remember to breathe through my nose and everything comes back into focus. Running can be meditative! I got into Buddhism through the Shambhala tradition and the leader of Shambhala runs and likens it to meditation, he even wrote a book! ( http://www.amazon.com/Running-Mind-Meditation-Lessons-Training/dp/0307888177) Still meaning to pick it up! He also has a interview on youtube if you're interested. :)  Ice skating! 

Seriously, I found that it doesn't put any stress on the shins, but it also works all the muscles in your feet in a different way than running. I think it is only beneficial to switch it up a bit. And if you can't skate yet, you will learn pretty quickly. Also, the fresh air is great in comparison to an elliptical in a dank gym :)

I've really got no particular desire to do a race. Haven't done one since high school. I don't like running with other people, I don't really like crowds...   I've considered signing up for a marathon, but even that would just be because there's planned water stations. I'm not sure if I'll do it. I *do* want to run a marathon, but I might just go run one on my own when I think I'm ready.

Also, I'm not sure if a race is the best place to meet people. If you're looking for fellow runners, a running club might be a better way to actually meet them. At least in my experience, a lot of people are race-focused on race day. Maybe a "fun" race, as well, like a color run or a tough mudder, would be better.Do I like to race? I dunno? I'm fairly competitive by nature so I think it would be something I'd enjoy. But when the gap between myself and the rest of my bracket is so large it's not so fun. The next event nearby should be a lot bigger... I also will cross over from the 20-29 age bracket into the 30-39 bracket (which I've noticed has a lot more people in it).

I certainly wasn't disappointed that I didn't talk to anyone DURING the race, it was before/after. There is a running club in a town about 30 minutes away, they run on weekends at 7am. I don't really want to wake up at 5:30am every weekend, and I'm doubtful that there would be any guys my age there anyway.. so I would probably just end up feeling awkward and out of place again.&gt; I appear to be in black hole between hardcore runners and older folks trying to get in shape.

I'll also note to me that sounds like the majority of runners I know. Out of us all, only a handful are hardcore and competitive, and only a few are older. I'll actually be in San Jose at this time so this is applicable to me! I've only ever ran the Columbus Marathon though which was flat and cold. I finished at 4:05 but could definitely do better (I had some injuries). How hilly/warm is it in SF in July?You didn't say if you were male or female, so I'm going to assume male. Possibly based on your 5k time (McMillan projects that you could run a 3:10 marathon with equivalent training), but you will have to have a successful marathon training cycle, which may be difficult since you have never run a marathon before. I'd say your best bet would be to find a legit plan that fits your training style and to schedule a test half marathon 1-2 months before your target marathon to gauge your fitness. For legit plans, I'd suggest Daniel's (Running Formula), McMillan (You, Only Faster), or Pfitz (Advanced Marathoning). Good luck!:) Great post. We've all been at the beginning stages of running OP. I'm glad a fellow runner could make you feel like you belong cuz anyone making the time in any degree def. belongs! Makes me think of my etiquette in and out of the gym. &gt; Showed up too early I guess (about half hour), and stood around while people showed up, felt out of place and awkward.

I don't think this is too early at all.  As you gain more experience, you will start using a warm-up routine.  Nowadays I generally need about 30 minutes to warmup, I run the course once easy, do some strides, do 2 2-minute repeats around race pace, and then do some more strides.  I like to get done with this 15 minutes before the race starts. I usually to get to a race an hour early (more if I have to pick up a bib).

&gt; Noticed that of the males in the race the vast majority were either considerably older or considerably younger than myself.

20-29 is somewhat of a desert age group.  Most college age serious runners are not jumping into random road races, post-college a lot of runners lay low for a few years.  It's not until later in life that most people are forced or compelled to take fitness seriously, so you see a large representation in the upper age groups.

&gt; Didn't talk to anybody the entire time.

Pretty common.  If you're looking for socialization, you might just want to join a club or find some local runners to connect with on Strava/Dailymile/something and build a loose-knit training group.  It's easier than it's ever been really.  But make cold contacts at races is kinda iffy (I've never tried it TBQH).

&gt; Course map had no elevation listed and halfway through I faced the biggest hill I've ever tried

Yeah, not knowing the hills sucks.  This is why I run the course for part of my warmup.  However if you're not ready to run that much as a warmup, you can always drive the course, run it a couple of days before, or map it in software and get your own elevation chart.

I wouldn't worry about your time too much.  I think you're probably still coming off of illness and the fact that you could run 5:15/km in mid-January tells me that you've got better fitness than your time shows.  5k is actually the most difficult road distance to run well, IMO.  Plus the hill killed you.

&gt; should I even bother racing? I feel awkward and out of place.

You don't have to race if you want to, many runners never race.  But there's absolutely no reason at all for you to feel awkward and out of place.

&gt;  I appear to be in black hole between hardcore runners and older folks trying to get in shape.

To me that sounds like a pretty good black hole to be in.  There's no reason you couldn't associate with either group, if you desired.

When I started running at 24, I started training with a group of 50+ year olds.  They taught me a whole lot.  It's good to get different perspectives.  Don't write off hanging out with old people.

As far as the "hardcore" runners, for rinky dink road races no one is really "hardcore".  It may seem that way at first, but there isn't some kind of line in the sand that only certain people can cross.  Some people take training and racing more seriously than others, and you're free to go that route if you want to.  I've never seen a "hardcore" runner sneer at or be hostile to a "lesser" runner, either to their face or behind their back (not counting internet trolls).I think in this case it would be an estimate of how much the family would have made if they had some sort of agreement letting Vibram use the name.  Probably a certain percentage of sales.That is FANTASTIC! Soon you won't give a damn about what anyone thinks. Your confidence will build as you learn that YOU CAN DO WHAT'S HARD!  Seriously, the other runners/walkers out there harbor no ill thoughts towards you b/c they know how hard it can be to get started. Any asshat that makes a comment is simply an asshat. Congratulations on your first day out and here's to many, many more!!!Yeah, definitely not "racing" anyone other than myself. I didn't really expect to be competitive with the more serious runners, but I was a bit surprised that there weren't more guys around my level (there were 2 of us).

As for not trying.. all I can say is there wasn't really anyone who seemed approachable, and I felt it'd be better to not try and feel more awkward than I already did.  I maybe shouldn't have picked an event in small town for my first time.

You're entirely correct about checking out the course in advance. That is certainly a lesson learned.your position in the race is meaningless... you were 4/4 in your age group, if there had been 20 people in your age group you probably would have finished 18th or something, who cares?

The BEST thing about racing is now you have a barometer to measure your own progress by. Do the race again next year and compare your finishing time to this year. Running is measured against yourself, and the first time you race you have nothing to measure against so you have to look at the other people around you which is a surefire way to feel bad about yourself. 

If you REALLY want to feel good next year after the race look up the finishing time of the guy who came in 30 seconds faster than you the first time, chances are his time wont have improved much and you will have blown way past him if you really put your mind to it and train hard over the next year. Then buy him a beer. Nothing wrong with showing up early for the race. Gives you time to do warmup, plus its nice to meditate a bit before and clear away everything else so you can get in to the zone. You're right! Thanks!Small winter 5k races are always like that. If you're worried about being alone convince someone to participate in the race and carpool. I would have pegged you as more of a crushed velvet kind of guy.I would like to see video of a 4-foot kid running 6 minute miles.  Would it be cartoon-like for his legs to be going that fast?Honestly you could probably run the whole thing without stopping right now.  2.5mi in ~25 mins gets you an average pace of 10min/mi which is just fine for a beginner's easy run pace.

BUT! since you are taking walking breaks it means your actual average "run" pace is higher, so just run slower at the start and push through some of the discomfort and you could probably run the whole thing through right now. 

Aside from that, no increasing overall run distance will help your training - even if some of it is run/walk. Who said you can't?In my experience it eased physical discomfort and made the music in my ear-buds sound awesome, but it made the run seem to take *forever*.  It wasn't a good trade-off for me but I can see how a lot of people would enjoy it.EPO and blood doping help manage my stress, cramps, and nausea during my runs. Why can't I use them? /sThis is the prime example of a typical first 5k race. You feel out of place. You feel slow. You feel like you're not supposed to be there. What you didn't realize that there were other's in your postion too and you just didn't know it. There was probably an old guy who was doing it his first time because he realized that he's not getting any younger. You probably missed the timid young college girl in the back terrified that somebody may scoff at her weight or how fast she was moving. You probably didn't realize that those more serious runners probably know eachother because they are the only friends they've got because they've alienated themselves from having other friends. Think about how all the walkers felt when this spry young guy (YOU) passed them as they tried to finish. 

I was in your spot too. Racing is something I do to keep the fire lit. I do it for myself. Everything that comes from it is just a bonus. I've made life long friends running 30, 40, 50 mile races and I've learned a lot about people in general by doing 5k's and half marathons. You are in a grey area that most runners find themselves in at one point or another. If you want to keep racing, do it for yourself or for a cause. If you'd rather just stick to going solo then go solo. Should you choose to race, remember that once your face become familiar in that circle you'll be just another one of the group. You'll get nods from others. You'll get pats on the back from the more serious guys and the older folks. People will approach you because you look like you belong. It's awkward at first. But after a couple of times, you'll fit right in.I run in silk. I avoid all peasant fabrics.Do you like to race? Some runners race just about every weekend. Others might pick a few races a year and focus on those. Some runners don't race at all, and that's fine too. 136 people is quite small; in a bigger race you'd be much more likely to have more competition around to motivate you.

If you want to meet people, I'd recommend finding a running group in your area. It's a lot easier to talk to someone on an easy run than a race where you're pushing hard for 5k.To be fair to the rest of the crowd, it sounds like you didn't actually make any attempt to have fun or meet people.  

Also, you shouldn't consider it racing.  You aren't competitive and won't be for some time.  Consider it running a familiar distance but with formal timing, and aim for personal fulfillment.

Finally, it's not like you couldn't have checked out the course in advance (unless it was really a very poorly organized race).

I say, consider it lessons learned and approach your next one differently.This was what I guessed, cheers!The fact that you were afraid of getting teased by teenagers whilst running just shows how fucked up our society is. Why should anyone mock someone who may not be considered 'healthy' whilst they are trying to do something about it. Should I aim to be able to run the whole 2.5 miles without stopping to walk before increasing distance?Same here. If it'll be an intense run, I find the OJ is too acidic, but for regular running I love the sugar boostIs this going to turn into the next "Fast jogging will kill you" trend?Thanks so much. I hope I can just find the motivation to not give up so easily!some other movie maker did that... it was the one released online for the chicago marathonThe Flex is a cheaper version of the Free- the most similar would probably be the Free 5.0.The slower turns into faster on race day when you push it! Or during workouts.

The reason for running slow to get faster is to get a ton of time spent training in your aerobic zone. Training harder will give you the same benefits as well as a few more, but will also lead to injuries and prevent you from training as much. All those other benefits aren't nearly as important as the aerobic ones. Run faster only when you feel really good, won't injure yourself, and won't in any way shorten tomorrow's long easy run.Yes, your easy pace should remain the same.  If you have trouble maintaining it on your long runs, get a heart rate monitor.  Your HR may be too high.Nah- Vibrams are shoes with toes in them. Racing flats are minimal shoes, but they have other benefits in addition to being lightweight. They tend to be more "responsive", meaning they are rigid and give you better push-off.I got into running after I quit smoking and a few months later I started using Runkeeper. I used the app to post my runs to Facebook &amp; Twitter (I think its the only thing I've ever done on Twitter) so the world could see my activities. In the end, it didn't matter if anyone was reading those posts or even seeing them, just the fact that I was putting it out there meant that I had to keep going. I could "feel" the judgement from my friends if I skipped a run, even when they didn't say anything. The reality was, most of my friends had gotten sick of the almost daily running updates and had blocked them from their feeds, but that wasn't the point for me..it was that I was getting out and someone, somewhere may have been disappointed with me for not running. 

So I did. I didn't skip runs. My calendar, for several years, was full of 4-5 runs every week. Most weeks around 20-30 miles. Minor injuries have slowed me for the last year, but now I'm healthy again and back to training.

TL;DR - There's something to be said for the social aspect of having a fitbit or using Runkeeper/MapMyRun/Garmin Connect/etc.Three or four times a year? That's a lot more running than I do. I really am a lifter at heart. However, I get what you're saying. Thanks for the advice man! These Asics have been pretty good for me since I've had them.Good site! Thanks for sharingYou don't need to make up the deficient in one day.This makes me so happy! Keep going - you are awesome for getting out there in the first place. They always say the hardest part of the run is getting out the door...

Every time I pass a runner, I try to at least smile, and every time I see someone working hard I think "c'mon, you can do it!". I'd yell it out to people across the road if people wouldn't think I was a complete loony for doing so.I eat zero dairy.  Dairy is not necessary.  Milk is for children.Eat sugar after running.  It is what your body is asking for. After your body gets the sugar it will stop complaining about food.[Body Glide](http://www.amazon.com/Bodyglide-Original-Anti-Chafe-Balm-Packaging/dp/B005L8YVRO)Also, check out /r/ultramarathon&gt; How do you keep yourself excited to run?

I don't. I just go run anyway.I make overnight oats. It really fills me up. Here is my recipe:

1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1/2 cup old fashion oats (do not cook them)
1/2 cup milk ( I use skim)
1 teaspoon honey
sweeteners (optional)
1/2 banana
1/4 blue berries (you can put any fruit in it)

make before bed and put in the fridge. This will allow the oats to absorb the liquid and become soft. This recipe ranges from 350-400 calories depending on what kind of milk, yogurt, and fruit you use. It is filled with protein and fills you up! I eat it about an hour before I run and feel great for my long runs.

Best of luck!
You don't have a breathing problem, but a fitness problem. Run slower, keep at it, you'll get back in shape, and when you do, the breathing will become easier again.&gt; Or is a more barefoot shoe preferable?

No. There's a sense out there among newer runners that the progression, as you get fitter, should be towards a more minimal shoe. That's not correct. I know some national class runners who train in pretty stout shoes. Nothing wrong with that.

The best thing I've found for preventing injuries is simply finding shoes that fit and retiring them when they hit 400 miles. Running is a relatively cheap sport, so new shoes three or four times per year doesn't break the bank. Plus, it's motivation to run more. Who doesn't like new shoes?Anybody uses other techniques or cleaning materias? I've heard of denture tables, baking soda and lime/lemon juice, but haven't tried them yetI love this post. I'm not the slimmest girl, but I've received nothing but admiring looks from other people when out running. One of the best things that happened was when I was taking a break after running non stop for 15 minutes (a major achievement), all sweaty and achey, and a bloke pulled up in a van to ask for directions. When he saw how dishevelled I was he laughed and said, 'You need to slow down girl!' It made me feel really proud that other people thought I was working so hard, and made me realise how far I had come in just a few weeks.Nice link. The only issue I see (and it is minor) is that it is not specific to running.&gt;  throbbing member

Just found a name for my new band! Not to contribute to a dumb holy war, but I get "more injury prone" but "slower"? Aren't racing flats and minimal shoes pretty much the same thing anyway? I don't know enough to give advice, but that's a cool video! Thanks and good luck.Your situation is very unique and completely understandable. But I have to ask, what are we supposed to do if all of our efforts to warn you (or anyone else) go unnoticed? It's not like we know you have an auditory processing disorder or that other people are deaf or can't understand us? I get that people have issues but isn't being startled just part of the deal if you choose to put yourself in a situation like we are discussing?

My original comment was targeted directly at people who are being completely oblivious of their surroundings out of sheer stupidity. I understand that people have issues but I'd be willing to bet that nearly everyone I've scared could hear and process just fine.

Just the other night I was running after the sun went down and in a dimly lit section of my neighborhood and I nearly gave an elderly woman a heart attack because she was dressed in dark colors and walking in the middle of the road. I fake coughed, I scuffed my feet, and I called out that I was passing and got nothing from her. So I ran to the side giving her as much space as possible and she screamed and clutched her chest. I apologized the best I could but she was the one being irresponsible should she have had a heart attack. 

And then we have the headphones blasting people... *shudder*... those people man, I tell ya!&gt;A Boston law firm that has previously represented Vibram said Tuesday it was not authorized to comment on the lawsuit.

Just my opinion.We should have one for r/running that would be cool. The r/fitness one is too much protein powder pictures so far for my taste...
I don't know how to set it up either. Top man, that'll do me. That's what I do, but mainly because I'm slow to initiate speech and often during a run am not capable of speaking (because of my autism, not because I'm running so hard). So I just run on the grass around them.&gt;But try not being a prick for once in your life, you might just surprise yourself.

Still not being original I see?

You can do whatever you want champ.  And if you ever post something worthwhile I will be more than happy to help.  Until then, I'll stick with being a prick and you can try figuring some things out. I read that before attempting a marathon you should get in really good 5k/10k shape. I *completely* agree that you should build mileage first. I had gotten my mileage the year prior basically to where I wanted to be for the marathon (in 2013 I topped out at 70 mpw, and only went to 75 as my max in 2014), so I was pretty set on that front. 

I think that when you have time, training in stages can be helpful--go from short and fast to long and slow over about a year, because the marathon-pace runs at 6:45 feel a lot easier when you're used to running 5:45s to train for a 5k. The training for any distance is basically the same when you're at an extremely amateur level like I am, so the 5k stuff really just counted as extra miles on my legs.

To be completely honest, though, I needed to step back from focusing on the marathon for a while, and I thought setting a 5k goal would help me reset. I ran ~18:30 in early January and 17:58 in April, and the training was a lot of fun, and left me very prepared for long tempos and fast-finish long runs that are the bread and butter of marathon training.Maybe she was unfamiliar with what that meant and thought you were telling her to move to the left, then to the right. I could see myself making that mistake back when I was sedentary (but had no car so walked everywhere) and was not familiar with the convention of alerting someone to what side you were passing them on. Consistency is key.  So work on that first, Do your 2.5 mile run every other day for 3 weeks.  Then add a longer distance run one day. Say

Mon |Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | Sun
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
Foo | 3 mi | off | 3 mi | off | 5 mi | off

or something. Stick with that for two weeks, then add another 3 mi run and up your 5 mi run. 

That's a good start.
For now, focus on consistency and building your base. Generally, you'll want to adhere to the rule of thumb to increase only ten percent per week. Perhaps start with 4 days at 2.5 miles each, then start following that formula. As you add miles, you'll want to add differentiation. Increase the mileage on weekend run first. Once you're at, say, four 3 mile runs and one 5-6 mile run, you'll certainly be fine to begin a half marathon plan. 

I don't think you'll have any trouble being in shape for a half in fall. When you're 18 weeks out, pick a Higdon plan that matches your base and go from there.

I  would also recommend some shorter races before then. They're fun!  See, this is why I love online communities - such brilliant minds. That's the pickle of public surveys, chap - I can't do them myself. I'm as entitled to join this community, politely request help and go on to browse the rest of the site as you are to jump on here and be less-than helpful, no? If you don't want to do it, don't. But try not being a prick for once in your life, you might just surprise yourself. 


Oh. "Famous" to the general audience. It is sad that running this one race barefoot is the one thing most people know him for, and using his name to market "barefoot shoes" is pretty fucked up IMO.I guess the other thing I should add is that I've been piling on the miles lately trying to build myself up to a full marathon, or a ten mile ruck run. That shouldn't matter on the shoes should it? Or is a more barefoot shoe preferable? I can't imagine that makes a difference, but it doesn't hurt to ask. What made you decide to focus on a fast 5k first? I'm hoping to BQ sometime in the next two years. Currently I've run a 20:30 5k, 1:35 HM, and I've never run a full. Conventional wisdom suggests slowly building mileage then adding speed. What was your 5k PR before you started working on it in the spring?You might look at what you're eating in the days leading up to the runs that leave you with no energy, rather than focusing on what to eat immediately before the run. I sometimes go as early as 4:20 am and don't eat anything. These runs will sometimes include fartleks or strides and I don't feel any low energy because of my overall diet. Try running on an empty stomach. You just might surprise yourself. I am autistic and have auditory processing disorder. Chances are I will be oblivious regardless of what noise is made, and people saying, "On your left" and similar doesn't help much because I just hear it as a jumble of sound, not as distinct words, and don't understand what they were saying until well after they've passed. (I don't hear consonants well, so it sounds to me like "AH-ER-EH!" but slurred together, not distinct syllables.)

I hear people walking or running near me well before they get to me, even when wearing headphones with music on (though the difficulty understanding speech occurs even when a stranger is talking to me in a silent room). I always startle when someone passes or yells out to me. Not everyone who startles is ignoring the environment or even listening to music (I often wear headphones without music).That seems like a lot to eat only an hour before running to be honest... try eating whatever you normally have but like half that amount? Or just wait a bit longer (you can even go back to sleep between eating and running). If you really want to eat right before you run just have a banana, SMALL bowl of cereal, or small energy bar (clif bars are still probably too heavy).All good points that irk me too.  Telling people to walk on ice is kinda douchey though. If they are walking they could get on a bike or elliptical machine though since they are just doing some cardio and not really training. My old work had a gym onsite with the same problems. Walkers sucked there too, especially considering you could easily walk around the campus inside and have almost a half mile one way. No need to take up a full treadmill spot in winter with your weird ass form while walking. &gt;avoid cotton and synthetics

Just breathe anyway that allows you to run comfortably. If you aren't getting enough oxygen, slow down.Congrats on starting to run again! I can't think of any reliable guides for breathing. Unless you are looking to become elite very quickly, or run the first sub 2 - hour marathon, what I found was the best for me was to run and try different breathing patterns until i settled into one that I naturally adopted. 

As to actual, medical, breathing problems, I'm not sure. Amazing job /u/ohfuckthisishard !  Don't worry about pushing yourself too hard for quick results; you will get there over time.  Turn exercise into a lifestyle by making it something you look forward to.  ie, even on days you don't feel like doing it, simply get dressed in something comfortable and head to the park (or where ever you went running), before you know it you'll feel gross when you skip your daily trip.

Here's a little motivation from a person who says it a lot better than I can: [Terry Crews](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2u6hoi/in_the_recent_ama_with_terry_crews_someone_asked/)

Keep up the great work and congrats on accomplishing the hardest step!  Please keep coming back to share your progress with us! &gt; You should go for an odd number (3/2,2/3)

Interesting. I've never had a problem with stitches, but I could give this a try. I'm so accustomed to my 3/3 and 2/2 on hills I think I'd feel really out of sync with an odd rhythm, but I'm willing to try it. It's worth being aware you probably won't be the slowest there.  Parkrun attracts literally every kind of person, not just hardcore runners.  And the ones that do beat you aren't judging you, they're just grateful to be beating *someone*!If you've worn a hole in the insole, I'm guessing the rest of the shoe is pretty well toasted.  

If it helps, I'm pretty sure the Asics Gel DS Trainer is the exact same shoe with a non-triathlon upper, and is a bit cheaper.  A quick look shows that runningwarehouse.com has both of those shoes for 70-80 dollars in a few closeout sizes.I'd look at the couch to 5k plan, which involves walking breaks between short, easy running sections.

Cold weather, sinus problems, and smoking will all make breathing more troublesome, but for new runners, the problem is often just that you're running at basically 100%, when you should be going at a relatively easy pace.  If you're huffing and puffing and struggling to breathe, you just gotta ease off a bit until you find a pace where you can breathe better.

Also lots of good info in the faq: http://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faqJust tell me where to send my dick pics, and I'm all set. Well the "Vibrams suck" lawsuit has already reached a class action settlement.Oh man! how great is it that you get to come to this community that you don't participate in or contribute to and get to badger us with all this free survey / marketing bullshit.

We're not your damn focus group and I hope you drown in a mud puddle. For anything 10 miles and under I don't eat anything. Just get up and go. For the longer runs I will have some oatmeal or a cliff bar and some coffee about 30 minutes before I leave and take some water or Gatorade with me. It's probably time to just buy some new shoes.  A year is a long time to run in the same pair of shoes, and once you're busting out parts of the shoe, it's pretty much done.

No need to switch up the model if you're happy with these ones (and I assume you are if you're still wearing them after a year).But but but but but but but but Born to Run!1!

... No, I definitely think Vibrams have been proven to suck, but I was all ready to roll my eyes at someone being _surprised_ that they suck.&gt; a guy who became famous for running barefoot?

He didn't become famous for running barefoot.  He became famous for kicking ass.  He was the vanguard east african distance runner, heralding an era that brought distance running to a completely new level.  Once he won gold, it was like the cat was out of the bag, and kenya/ethiopia just started crushing every distance event left and right, dominating everyone else in the world to an extent that no other sport has ever seen.

That he happened to run a single race barefoot because Adidas didn't bring any shoes in his size is a minor footnote.  It's only so well-known today because it's part of a marketing campaign.
Vibrams don't literally kill marathoners, they just make them slower and more injury prone. Duh.Expected this to be something ludicrous about how Vibrams literally kill marathoners, surprised to find it's a fairly legit claim by the family of an actually cool dude.I run daily, and while it's pretty much my favorite thing, no one's always super gung ho about getting out there.  For me, the trick to getting out there on days when I'm not feeling 100% yay about it is to change some variable.  Running a new route.  Or running something I haven't run in a while.  Or listening to music (which I don't usually do).  Or listening to a podcast (which I don't usually do).  Or running at a different time of day.

In your case, since you just moved, maybe the trick is to keep trying to find new routes near your new place.  What you've tried so far has sucked... maybe there's something else you can run?  Maybe there's a group you can run with?  Maybe it'll look prettier at a different time of day?Gotcha!You'll get better answers if you elaborate on what "hurt" means.  Shattering both ankles in a car crash is different than rolling an ankle on a trail run.About time. I've been wondering why this hasn't happened yet for quite a while now. Also, am I the only one who sees the irony of a *shoe* named after a guy who became famous for running *barefoot*? And that he didn't run this particular race barefoot because of some ideology, but simply because he strong enough to not have to rely on shoes, and preferred no shoes over the ones he had available at the time?Have a look at

http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/first-half-marathon-training-plan?page=singleNow kissYeah. Nothing drives the ladies crazy like the smell of week-old man sweat.

And yes, I am aware of the biochemistry.Numbers at the beginning of a legal suite are somewhat inflated, because usually you'll settle and usually settle for a fraction of the total based on some haggle of estimated odds of losing the suit. It's somewhat misleading for media to report the $15m figure without context, IMO.Definitally seems like you are overestimating the shape you fell out of. I had the same problem a few months ago.I have a cup of coffee unless I am doing anything over 10 miles. Over ten and I have a couple cups of dry cereal. I love corn flakes. Thanks for sharing. If I only had money for the trip, I would go there! Denmark - but I change between full lengt, 3/4 length and short tights, I just prefer tights to shorts.You need to tell more stories! We likey!The best training is specific. For example, if your 10K has hills, then you won't really be trained for them (especially running DOWNhill, which can be really rough on your quads).  Sooner or later you are going to have to get out there and run on the roads, so you might as well not worry about pace so much. For now, just run for time at an easy effort.You are thinking too much. Neither one is better than the other. I eat chews / chomps / jelly beans 15min before going, get dressed then run. Anything else won't stay down. Breakfast when I come back.This all depends on the person. Some people seem to think they need to eat and drink when doing easy 10-15 mile runs, others can literally go for 20-30 miles on little to nothing. Nobody can give you a solid answer about this because it varies so greatly from one person to the next. General rule of thumb is any run over 120 minutes you should be taking in hydration. Any run over 240 minutes you should be finding time to take in actual food. Personally, I do about 8-16 oz of water every hour (doubled if hot/humid), and about 150-200 calories an hour (300 calories an hour during races). This is zeroing in on my personal nutrition sweet spot. Then again, I run at least 25-30 miles every weekend and train for ultra marathons.I've been running for 4 months and I highly doubt I could do that! I am a well respected doctor and can tell you running it out can be very beneficial.

**edit** I don't know who would downvote a doctor, but shame on you. Also many times a slow easy run can really help to settle DOMS down. Yes, I get it now. I will do that soon. Thanks for the heads-up on this.I'm fairly new to remotely moderate training.  I started taking it more seriously last August (so, 6 months ago).  I'm just now reading the Hanson book for instance and learning how to train properly.  So, no, I don't do speed work at all as I was winging it and figured I had to boost my endurance for long runs before being concerned about speed work.  But perhaps now is that time it seems.
Thanks!Yeah, I think I do really need to slow down. I run by feel usually for 'easy' runs, but my calibration is totally off now, it seems. I feel great for almost a mile and then I feel like I'm going to die...Sorry for the double post, but the snapchat account is: r/Fitness. Take a look! In my experience, most trail shoes don't have all that much more soft-ground/mud grip than road shoes, and the ones that do are really only comfortable on trails, and mostly only in soft/wet conditions due to the luggy outsole.  If you want a fairly single use shoe, that might be ok, but I'm guessing you'll be just fine in road shoes.
YMMV, but I only run in my knobby trail shoes when it's a rainy, muddy, sloppy mess. Short of that I just manage a small slide or two on the wet bits in my regular shoes.  Some of it is just practice and technique.

If you want to look around though, the knobby trail shoes I have are often sold or labeled as "fell running" shoes over on your side of the ocean.  La Sportiva, Salomon, Innov-8 and others have a few models like that.  This matches my intuition.  I guess it's time for some proper speed work now that I'm "good enough" on long slow runs.  Thanks!Yeah, trail shoes are nice on grass, if it's steep or slippy.An apple.OK thanks I will try that!I have toast and a little jam, coffee, usually about a half hour to an hour before.  Never failed me.For sure. All easy runs should be done no slower than 6 minutes/mile. At altitude.220 minus age is horse shit. Ignore it completely.

Every week we get this question where someone used the formula and it didn't match up with their actual experience. As ofthers have posted, you have to measure your own actual max HR.Try a lube like BodyGlide or similar. I make my own. It's highly effective. It could be the muffins.

But think it is sleep. If you are eating dinner at midnight, then you aren't sleeping enough. Runners need at least 8 hours of sleep on a consistent basis.  And 9 or 10 is even better.  You just need to sleep more. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day of the week. That will make a huge difference.&gt; The pegasus is neutral, which isn't going to be stable enough for 80% of the population

I feel like that's a completely made up number.  If that were the case, the sales numbers for neutral shoes would be in the toilet.Look up hip flexor and see if that fits. If so, stretch!Oh now that's a good one!How are you still awake at all after all those muffins?OMG. Clearly. Corn is, like, so bad. When it comes to corn, I just can't even.I do everything in my power to not startle someone when I'm coming up from behind them. I scuff my feet, I cough, I clear my throat, I step on leaves and brush, I give as much distance as possible, I even yell "Passing on your left/right!". If the person I'm coming up on is completely oblivious to the commotion I went out of my way to make then I feel ZERO sympathy for them should I scare the bejeezus out of them. Period.That's a better question for /r/law probably! In this case, I would guess that the Bikila family could ask for a pretty large percentage of the sales of the model that used the family name without permission.a HUGE black wild pig, I saw it from a distance and thought well that's a big dog. After a while it went out of sight.

Then after going around a corner I was face to face with something like this http://www.sjamaanrudy.be/img/EverzwijnAttent.jpg. But it was more scared of me and ran away.Having goals will help, as well as just enjoying running.  Mostly though, not every run will be fun, but you have to run those anyway, or you won't be able to do the fun ones, or achieve the goals you set.Actually, an article in today's (Philadelphia) paper has the headline "That egg may be OK after all".  Apparently, dietary cholesterol is no longer a concern , according to "the nation's top nutrition advisory panel"

Of course, "nutrition science" is largely bullshit, anyway.  So take that with exactly 2600mg of NaCl.I'm a member up at the golf course so I know the rules and direction of the course. I won't be running over greens, just following the fairways. 
Like i said up there though, It's often wet under the foot (I'm in England..) so perhaps trail shoes are the way to go?I have always wondered how they reach an amount that will relieve someone of "damages". Thanks Slacks, I did try running with my normal shoes but found a few parts to be a bit dodgy. Perhaps it was all in my head, but I was a bit cautious around a few areas - primarily steep inclines with wet grass/mud. I should note, I'm from North England so the ground is always a little... wet.
Would you say trail shoes are the way to go in my case?Just to be super pedantic, deoderant is to prevent odor. *Antiperspirant* is to prevent sweat. Most products combine the two, but it is possible to buy deoderants that don't contain antiperspirant.

That being said, sweat isn't really what makes one smell-it is all the bacteria. If this is actually a concern to someone, their best bet is to take a shower before the run and wear clean clothing (and avoid cotton and synthetics, as they are both known to get really smelly)

Also, there is only one way to complete a running-date: Burn and Bury.

Gotta assert your dominance, bro.What is the rest of your training like (i.e those other 29 miles a week that you run). Do you do any speedwork? Are you allowed to run on the golf course?

As slacks said though, any road running shoe will be fine as long as it's not rainy and muddy, in which case I can't imagine they want you on the course, tearing up the green.Why is this tagged Training?I'm not a doctor and all that...

If it is just actual DOMS...then running is probably the best thing to do because it will increase blood flow to the affected area and promote recovery.

But if it is joint/tendon stuff, then I'd be careful.  I'd also look into what caused the pain. One thing I think about is predictability. I can predict that I'll be sore in the days after a workout. That's classic DOMS--if you ran intervals on Monday and now you are sore on Wednesday.  But your "normal" runs should not be leaving your sore. And if you get a pain DURING the run or right after the run, then it might be something other than DOMS and you might want to go through the RICE protocol.I love this. My son is 7 and loves to run. He beats me at 5ks already. The last one he ran 24:04 and I ran a PB of 24:30 just trying desperately to keep up with him (I'm his mom). We also went to the USATF cross country championships. It was a very cool experience for him and he's determined to qualify again next year and be top 25. It's such a great sport for kids.I think the FIRST plan would be most effective for someone who already has a decent base. For example, if you take a runner who's been running 30-50 miles a week for the past 4 years...well, they might have some success with the FIRST program. But I bet they'd have even more success with a traditional program that had them running more like 60 or 70 miles a week.

Now, some might chime in and say that running less is a "good idea" for "injury-prone" runners who "always" get injured when they run over a certain mileage. Which I don't buy. If anything, injury prone runners will benefit especially from more mileage (provided it is done at an actual aerobic rate and not some junky aerobic/anaerobic middle ground).  You have to train the entire system to race well.  Yes, faster stuff is good, but, fundamentally, it comes down to putting miles in the bank.  The idea of cutting out all the aerobic base mileage and recovery running and just doing a 3Q (3 quality workouts: tempo, interval, long) schedule...I would not recommend that plan.

I think a lot of runners get excited about the idea of running a marathon. And while I don't want to dissuade anyone from following their dreams, I do question the wisdom of attempting a marathon on inadequate training. If you only have 3 or 4 days a week to train, then maybe focus on the shorter stuff. Longer isn't better. Not by a long shot. Heck, there are runners out there who run 100 miles a week with 22 mile long runs on Sunday and they never race anything longer than 10-12KM.  They might not run long, but they are FAST.Strava recently added a crowd-sourced race discoverer to their website: https://www.strava.com/featured-running-races?utm_source=top-nav&gt; Thinking of begging my boyfriend (who's a very good runner so I'll be a bit of a charity case for him! :P) to come out with me some time soon and help me with pacing and form and the like.

As a guy with a girlfriend, I love it when she asks to run with me. Quality time and quality of health/life all in one date.

That said, my recommendation is to ask him on a "running date" every now and then.Just curious, but where do you live that it requires tights 10-11mo/yr?I wear compression underwear under tights, for two reasons.  

1) Tights seam to frequently have more abrasive seams than running shorts, and wearing compression underwear beneath them minimizes chafing.

2) I only wear tights when it's cold enough that having an extra layer of underwear beneath them makes me more comfortable.Regular, normal running shoes will be fine. Studded/spiked shoes are for racing. Trail shoes might work depending on how rough the terrain is, but you'll likely be fine with regular running shoes. I do a lot of my miles on a grass cross country course in normal running shoes.My only rule of thumb is to not buy white compression shorts. ... or white shorts of any kind ... or white tights ... or white swimsuits.  :)  I've had similar experiences (during the day) and gave up on "On your left!".  Now I just holler "Comin' through!" and let them decide which side to move to.  In all honesty, not saying anything and just running past is the simplest and easiest, but it does freak people out... for good reason.

My only other tip -- when passing someone walking a dog, always pass on the non-dog side of the person.I have a cheap Princeton Tec that's a few years old.  It works ok and takes AA batteries.  It's not bright enough for me to be comfortable on dark trails.  I just bought my wife a Black Diamond Icon for xmas and that thing is *really* bright at the brightest setting.  It also has the over-the-head strap to keep it more secure &amp; comfortable.  I don't *need* to replace mine, but if I did I'd strongly consider the Black Diamond Icon.  Definitely read the article on OutdoorGearLab.com linked above.Your heart rate doesn't "stay too low".  It's just that you've optimized your conditioning for long, slow runs and have been doing it long enough that it's not pressing your cardiovascular endurance.  The reason you can't sustain faster pacing for longer is because you haven't practiced running faster, or optimized your musculature &amp; cardiovascular system for running at speed.

I turn 38 next month and also weigh about 180, and run 40-50mpw.  My "easy" runs are at about 140-145HR, which usually puts them in the 8:15-8:30 range.  My threshold runs are in the low 150s and my tempo runs are in the high 150s.  I can sustain low 160s for about 3mi only, so I call that my 5k pace.  MaxHR for me is only mid-170s.

p.s. If you can sustain a "max" HR for a few miles, it's not your max HR.  You can only sustain your max for, say, 30-60 seconds.&gt; I don't like to do the "good job" sort of comment unless someone's obviously putting in a serious grind...

The motivation when you get that random "good job" or "go get it." when you have your nose to the stone when running any distance or race, in the last hundred yards... Sooo much adrenaline.Eat after.  Take an energy bar with you on longer runs in case you get hungry.Stability in shoes doesn't change your form, just how much you over pronate (which is more a biomechanical fact than anything, and can't be changed). The pegasus is neutral, which isn't going to be stable enough for 80% of the population. If you like nike, try the lunar eclipse - its going to be similar in terms of feel to the pegasus, but with a little more stability. The inspire really only has a mild amount of stability - the paradox is their high stability shoe. I'd play it safe and err on the side of stability, but hey - if it ain't broke - don't fix it!LolokI'm a student, so I don't really have a schedule and that doesn't help. I don't really have a time when I go up, and sit still a lot. That and depression (I think) makes for a bad apetite, and irregular meals. I normally eat pretty well, but eat fast food once a week or so, it's just nor regular at all. If I could sleep better I would eat better, but the running helps.Depends, what's your age/gender?I've been enjoying some OJ recently.Not *quite* funny enough to be that though.Read [this article](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Best-Headlamp).  Chock full of useful information (including how manufacturers lie to you about their battery life). It's just a small creek in William B. Umstead State Park in North Carolina.

Nobody has lived in that area since at least 1937 when the park opened. I am guessing it's just a meaningful place for someone who shared it with Lynnie.okay, i was expecting this sort og answer. I guess I'll either have to make room for more training or I'll have to postpone the plan. Thanks anyway.I to get stitches if I eat before so I just get up and run. Breakfast for reward.I always eat toaster waffles with coffeeYou have it in you! You just have to keep going day by day! GOGOGO!You're starting something awesome. You're at a point where a lot of us wish we  could go back to; experiencing how awesome running can be for the first time. Keep at it. It gets better.It's absolutely normal to land on the outside of your foot and this is not underpronating. Underpronation means that you dont roll your ankle inwards and push off on the outside as well. 

When you feel like you run on a line, this might indicate low hip strength. Strengthen your core  and abductors by doing side-lying leg raises, glute bridges, bridges etc. 

I don't quite understand the knee part, I guess your toes point outwards and your knee bends a bit outwards then, too? That's also normal if your toes point outward slightly.Soon, you will crave a run when you get stressed. The most constructive avoidance impulse ever!I don't have much else to do where I live that doesn't cost an enormous amount of money, so running is what I do for fun... Setting short term goals helps keep motivation up, and long term goals keep me going for the long haul. That said, I do it for fun so missing a run isn't the end of the world. As long as I get out 3+ times a week and my weekly distances keep growing inversely to my pace, I'm happy.if you keep up the routine over a long period of time and watch your diet too then you'l be like the girl you saw in about 1 year.That first run is in some ways the toughest but also (in many ways) the best!  Like you, I possess rolls of fat -- not as many as I once did, but I still possess them.  When I first began running, I was incredibly self-conscious about how I appeared.  Like you, I threw on anything that I thought would be "acceptable" to cover my body.  I did invest at the start in a good pair of running shoes purchased at a reputable store for runners, and I already knew the value of an excellent sports bra, but covering my body seemed essential for me at the start.

That was in May of 2013.  Then it got hotter outside in my climate.  At some point in August of that year, I just said, "Fuck it," and wore what was comfortable:  compression shorts and a short running skirt to cover, plus a short-sleeved shirt.  You know who noticed?  No one but me.  I was more comfortable and had better runs.  I felt practically naked that first time I wore compression shorts, but holy cats did I feel freer. 

Like you, I have found more experienced runners to be wonderfully encouraging and (for the most part) kind.  There are assholes everywhere, but just about every runner I meet while running is supportive in some way. 

I've been running for almost two years now and I still have weight to lose, but I am no longer self-conscious in any way when I'm on the trail or treadmill.  After all, I'm there to run, and running makes me feel better than nearly anything I've ever done.

And like you, my running friend, I teach.  Running -- knowing what my body can do now -- has helped with my self-confidence in the classroom.  I was morbidly obese once upon a time. Now I'm not.  Running isn't the only thing that helped me change that, but it has contributed significantly.

As others here have said, though, don't run to lose weight; run to run!  Running has become one of the great joys of my life.  This is something that surprises me, as I hated being athletic as a kid and I'm well into middle age now.

Congratulations on your first run and thank you for sharing your story with us!Side note: a 16 year old ran a 14:49 5k at the USATF National Junior Olympic Cross Country Championships.

That kid is going places.I've been relatively quickly progressing up from 5km to 10km and hit the goal a while back.
Ever since then I've had a pain in my left hip during/the day after running. The ache feels like it is literally in the joint...a very dull ache.
I took a few days off this week and went for a run this morning and whilst definitely not bad, a few hours later I can just feel it.
Any suggestions as to what it could be/how to resolve it?
ThanksOmg, without. I have been running pretty high mileage for many years now and I consider wearing underwear on s run nearly as ridiculous as wearing s fruit basket on my head. I suppose some kind of compression stuff is acceptable if you really think you need it, but regular underwear? Plz stpFair enough, I only have the CEP comp. tights:  
http://www.cepcompression.com/dynamic-run-shorts.html  
They fit like any other pair of tights.Are you from UC ?I love my Princeton Tec headlamp, but only for running. It says water resistant, but I wouldn't swim with itYou might not see this but you did an amazing thing by toughing it out and going for a run. I'm glad you encountered a girl like that, it's incredible what one small gesture can do. Sometimes I don't want to say things to people while running or at the gym but I will from now on. Keep on doing it, just a little bit of movement everyday makes a world of difference.You need to measure your max heart rate, or more safely and arguably better [your lactate threshold](http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/joe-friel-s-quick-guide-to-setting-zones), and base your training zones off that. Don't use that 220-age formula if you're even moderately serious about training.



Last fall I bought the Nike Lunarglide 6's and I absolutely loved them. My feet are quite wide and I still ran with a pretty heavy heel strike back then, so the Lg6's felt better than anything I'd ever worn before.

It was kind of heartbreaking when one of the shoes broke after only about 35 days and well under 150km which seems really crappy for a 130 pair of shoes. Something inside the outsole/midsole just popped up and now there's a hard bump on top of the midsole right at the ball of the foot, which makes it impossible to run or even walk in.

I went on to buy some cheap supermarket shoes with thinner and flatter soles which pretty much forced me to transition to a midfoot strike so I guess things worked out for the better.Keep running. Not to loose weight, not to be healthy, and not because someone say so. Run because you can. Losing weight or feeling healthy are just side effects of running. Healthy eating will come naturally, none of which  you have to struggle with. Sign up for a race to motivate you further. Eventually, you will find out that most runners do not judge you, a beginner...and this is when you realise that you are a runner. &gt;It feels good, but I guess it's the keeping-it-up that's the hardest so it's also intimidating because today was nothing compared to what's coming.

The thing you don't realise is that once you start you release all these endorphins (feel-good hormones) into your body.  After a couple of days they're gone, so you need to run again.  It is addictive, and as your mood starts to drop off, and you don't feel like running, that's *exactly* the moment you MUST get back out there.I eat very little dairy because I'm lactose intolerant. I can eat small amounts of hard cheese, but not milk, soft cheese, or yogurt. I drink lots of fortified soy milk to replace the calcium and protein. I eat tons of carbs, though. I would say carbs are essential for energy, but I know some keto types would disagree.Ginger nuts (a type of cookie). I let myself munch my way through one packet a week. I don't think it has any effect.Body Glide! Lots of starch, lots of veggies, some lean protein, very little fat. I typically eat a huge bowl of thick oatmeal and a banana for breakfast, fish with bread or rice for lunch, toast with marmite (no butter) in the afternoon, and veggies with potatoes/rice/pasta and maybe some tofu for dinner.

Honestly, though, I don't think it matters, as long as you get adequate calories.Personally, I'd rather not feel like I'm going to vomit. But I'm not anywhere near the head of the pack.I wear no underwear and loose shorts, but I'm female, so I don't have any need for support.I see your point. But the problem is, to find a better shoe (assuming there is one), it requires trial and error. 

You have to spend time to go get fitted, wear it on runs, and if it doesnt work, you have to hope you don't get injured. If you don't get injured, you have to ship it back or go back to the store (assuming they accept returns). Then repeat the process.

 Or, assuming your shoes didnt cause any problems, you can pick up a pair and continue your training. 

To each their own, but I've tried about 5 different neutral asked, with high cushion, and fell in love with the Brooks Ghost. I tried the 5's and they were wonderful. I tried some saucony's, and they were okay. I tried some adidas, and they sucked. So I tried some Ghost 6's, and they were amazing. So my plan is to stick with the Ghost's until they are no longer amazing.ThanksI think it's a lighthearted article to be taken in that spirit. The comments in the article were much nicer!Nuts. A good handful will give you 500 calories, and you will be more healthy as well.Point 2 is true, but none of my compression shorts have been meant to be worn alone (assuming you mean the shorts are unnecessary). Or:  
1. Put on compression shorts.  
2. Realize that the only people who will notice your manhood are people looking at your manhood.  
3. RunM/28 - I run in tights of varying lengths about 10-11 months of the year, always commando!  
When we occacionally get some heat around here, I run in shorts with built-in liners, still commando.  
When I started running, I ran in cotton boxer-briefs, oh the horror, never again!  Even if you're slow or a newbie, joining a collegiate team is a really big commitment. I was one of the slowest on my team, which was an NAIA school, probably equivalent to a low D3 or high D2 NCAA team. My PR for the 8k is 33:42 (6:46 pace), which was generally in the bottom 20% of races I competed in.

While I did more for the team outside of the running itself, the time commitment from the workouts, races, meetings, etc all add up *really* fast. It basically becomes your life outside of classes. That's not to say it's a bad thing- I loved every second of it, and my teammates were amazing, but it's not for everyone. You have to love running as a sport, enough that you're willing to sacrifice a lot of your free time.

All that aside, if you're interested then you should contact your school's coach. He or she will likely tell you what to expect if you want to walk on, but keep in mind 10-15 miles/week is a long way from what you'd do. Again, my experience is as a slower runner, and I started around 30-35 miles/week, and maxed at 55. So expect them to tell you you'll need to run more and possibly get a 5k/10k result to see if you meet their standards.Wow, I love you and I love her! Someday, I'll get the courage to do what you did today and I hope to encounter a woman like the one you did. Until then, I'll be subscribed to this sub, gaining the strength to begin, as you already have.To expand a bit; there is no formulation that will cover the entire population, all the xyz-age formulations are based on small sample sizes, and correspond to an average.  
Your max HR could be 160, it could also be 210.  
Without testing it, you wont know.I only have 1 pair of running shorts that have the built-in liner, but if I could I'd do that always. Otherwise, I use boxer briefs which work great for me.I would see a doctor and see if you should be wearing a boot. I broke my metatarsal last summer and was off of running for three months and on crutches/boot for two. For some reason whenever I sprint I feel a burning sensation almost like a cramp in my upper left thigh on the right side. Not entirely sure what causes it, because anything less than a 90% sprint doesn't trigger it. Anyone have any idea what causes it, or how to get rid of it? Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong area.My own son is now 3. I would love to be able to run 5Ks with him in a few years! (Maybe not as fast as *that* kid...)Where do you live that you have a pizza island?I have no idea what your schedule is but as someone who was really overweight and not for as well, the C25K programme was amazing. as a friend of mine said: it's like it tricks you into getting fitter! Good on you for overcoming your anxiety and getting out there, your body and your mind will thank you. What a stupid article.

&gt; DO wear deodorant

Hell no. Deodorant is for preventing perspiration, but for running, I *want* that sweat.

&gt; DON'T spit or blow snot

I've been working hard on perfecting my snot rockets; there is no way I'm not showing them off.

And, the centerpiece:

&gt; How to impress the shorts off any runner on a date.

&gt; DO dress comfortably.

Yes. Yes, that's how you impress people. I bet anyone I've ever run with secretly admires my comfortable dressing skills.

Oh well, what can you expect from a self-proclaimed "relationship expert"... (How does one even become one? By going through a lot of relationships?)Thank God someone else remembers this quote.Not if you don't improve. BQ is around 3h these days and everyone I know around that time is well sub 19' on the 5k.It's simple : do in your marathon as you did in your long runs.Don't think there's much consensus there other than that running through DOMS itself isn't necessarily dangerous, but can lead to indirect damage when it impacts your running form.

My personal approach is this:

* If the soreness is so strong that I can't move normally, I'll rest.
* If it doesn't get better with running, I'll rest.
* If there is any pain that can't be ascribed to DOMS, I'll rest.
* Otherwise, I'll run, paying extra attention to running form.
* Additionally, if I encounter DOMS and it's not the result of an exceptionally hard run, i.e., I get DOMS when I shouldn't, I take it as a sign to go easier, and adjust my training plan.I'd say if it's a first date probably best not to meet just the two of you too, especially if you're running through anywhere not well populated. Always best to make sure everybody feels comfortable. This happens a lot to runners. Don't worry. Everyone on my track team has had the same thing happen. If I think I am going to spook them out, I just try to run really far around them...Very good! Consider this: you have taken the most difficult step: the first one. Now your perspective is the following...
In some time you *will* be fitter, you *will* be stronger, you *will* be slimmer and you *will* be proud of your achievement when you cross the finish of your first 5K. All it takes is just going out again and run.Agreed with everyone here. I'm training for a half in April and my plan was 3 months and has me running 33 k a week right now. Sure you can up your training, but you will injure yourself if you increase too much too fast. I guess my major reason for writing you was to ask what's the rush? I know when you first start off running you want to run every race and set goals and be impressive and whatnot. Many people I know who have run marathons trained for 1-2 years or more for just the first one. Couldn't you work on half marathon time this year then move up to training of a marathon next year and ultras the year after that? It kinds of seems silly to bang out everything in the first 8 months or so even if you could or should do that...which I would say don't. Log tones of miles. Run your half. Maybe run another half in 6 months or so and see if you can improve your time. Good luck! And happy running!I'm still over-weight, but when I finish a 5K or a 10K I feel like a super hero. I'm hoping that as I keep going, I'll be able to gain better control of my body and health and my own destiny.

I hope you will feel the same way I do about running. And I think we all really have control. Just by taking that first step out the door, you show your body that your mind is in control. Keep going!Yay. Fellow runners.  It bums me out when people don't wave back.

I run regularly and I do it in old t shirts and excercise compression shorts I got at target.  Don't be afraid to look like a hot mess.  I
Your username is glorious. Thanks, I think that may have been what caused my worry is that my HRM and watch   had my training program times in it. So I was constantly trying to keep on track with what it said. Trying to do 5:45 kmph and hitting 7:10 due to a hill was just freaking me out! 

Suppose I need to relax. Just newbie nerves!Please never think of yourself as a charity case. If you think that's what your boyfriend thinks of you like that then keep running or anything and don't give up. You're better than that and you can prove it to everyone.I love My Fitness Pal! I save every recipe I make, so everything's already there. I very rarely have to search for foods anymore, take a couple of minutes a day and I know exactly where I'm at. 

With a regular running schedule and consistent counting I've lost 5kg this year. So I'd say it definitely helps!At least in my experience, they help keep you a little more loose on longer slower runs, and it seems like it's better the next day.

So in other words it's completely mental and just my weird running habit.Do compressions help with recovery? Or is it just something that is more comfortable for you?I'm a regular smoker, and runner.  Not sure about it's performance enhancing abilities, but it sure can help motivate me some days.  Sometimes I'll wake up feeling lazy thinking I'll just take an off day, but then I'll have a toke and suddenly start to think "wtf am I doing? I'm being a lazy pos!".  At that point I'll usually proceed to lace up my shoes and get to it.  Yeah man tomorrow is the big day, and last night I didn't give it my all. When I reached the 1.5 mile mark , I wasn't winded, or gasping for air so I know I didn't push myself. Tomorrow I'm going to push myself , because it's do or die. Thanks for the tips. You might need to move a bit quicker than that seeing as how that would fail even the Air Force's standards which are the lowest between the three branches that do the 1.5 mile run... and this is coming from an AF guy.Somedays my fat thighs like to rub together and chaff, underpants help with that but then i get wedgies

For tights: Compressions
For running shorts: Build in liner, occasionally compression under if it's a cooler day and/or more of a recovery runstories like this make me love this sub.
great to see something so simple, mean so much to someone.

point to us all, a friendly smile, a nod of the head - just general positive human interaction can make a change in someones day.

somedays i feel so good i want to throw a high five, but then think that i am going a bit over the top....

OP - keep going, you wont get great experiences like this each and every day, in fact i guarantee you will face some really shitty days when you just want to give up.

Dig a little deeper, remember that smile, and keep moving forward.Yeah still majorly weird.1) Invent time machine.
2) Go back in time 6 months.
3) Care about the things you asked so you can change them with proper time and training.
If 1-2 don't work, learn your lesson and just do number 3.Good for you /u/ohfuckthisishard

I find nothing more inspiring than someone trying to better themselves and their lives, however that is. We're all broken in some way. As Leonard Cohen says "There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in" 

Keep it up!
Just test your true max instead guesing. I am 37 and my max is 195. Try run cooper give it all and you will see where it bring you.It was about a block away from the hospital, kind of behind it. So, not exactly in the middle of nowhere, but still...Female here. I always go commando. Underpants=chafing, and there is nothing flopping around for me![starts to argue]

[sees username]

Never mind, good for you guys :-) Go forth and be tired.I've just moved across town, and at my old running track fellow runners always smiled or nodded when they passed. On my new route though noone will even make eye contact. It makes me so sad :(And it hasn't quite been that long:

But if I go out and buy pants, well I know what pants are supposed to be like. I can tell if they fit me. Nobody puts me on a treadmill and has me walk to see how the pants fit, etc. But if I went somewhere and tried on dress pants, had those pants tailored by the in house tailor, wrote down the precise measurements the tailor personally performed, and then went online I would feel wrong about doing so.

And my quibble isn't comparing two local stores. It was with the idea of using local knowledge and then going online. You will most likely find those same shoes cheaper online. And it is fine to buy those down the road. But that first pair, the pair they sold you and you liked and you want to go buy, those should come from the salesperson that sold them to you.Go to a physical therapist to see if it's just a matter of taking it slow, or inherent problem.

Also, high quality insoles (I love green super feet) help.Stretching, the stick, that's it. Calf soreness happens.Try running on it and see how it feels. Stop if it hurts and make it a short easy run so you don't get endorphins flowing and raising your pain tolerance.I'd only be concerned if you had other symptoms (heart rate is poor at adjusting up or down with increased/decreased activity, or pain, or irregular beats, or dizziness/shortness of breath, etc). Every heart is its own special flower.It's not good to smoke before your run or after, but otherwise it's not a huge deal. Tobacco - makes you slower. Marijuana - light usage has little impact.In a large local park, another runner, running with her cat on a leash. Oh, and in a suburban park in TN, a guy walking his dog by driving holding the leash out the window of his pick-up truck. Only if you are getting injured should you change you form imoYou can run long distance at a heavy weight. You just gotta go slow. I like running fast so I don't lift for hypertrophy. But one thing that's weird, it's a little difficult to lose muscle mass. For example if a 150 lbs xc guy bulks up to 180 lbs, even if he stops lifting it will be tough to get back down to 150. There's a tradeoff between strength and long distance speed.I agree, pretty foolish for a women to be walking out alone at night with headphones in so loud she can't hear anything.  Maybe you taught her a valuable lesson.  When I run at night I leave one ear bud out just so people can see that I'm aware of my surroundings. 

I almost maced a guy once when I was running at night, I saw him walking towards me and then jump behind a wooden fence I was running next to.  I slowed down, honestly got my mace at the ready, as I ran past I noticed he had a dog with him and was just getting out of my way :-} nice gesture, just not a good technique I just started listening to audiobooks while i run and I love it! Thanks for the suggestion!Oh man, just seeing those flowers in the rain and the burnt out candle, it looks so sad!Hah, yeah, after a run last night my wife spent like 20 minutes on the elliptical because she hadn't hit her calorie goal for the day.I ran in them once for cross country in high school. Never again. Went commando and never turned back.I've got the "Feed Zone Portables" cookbook, they have a bunch of "rice cakes" recipes - basically put whatever you want in calrose "sticky rice" (I like eggs, chicken sausage, and a little bit of soy sauce and brown sugar) smush it together into a bar, cut them up and wrap the portions in parchment foil.Running in boxers is a recipe for disaster. Google testicular torsion if you want to know the real reason.At what point does mid run nutrition and hydration become a must? I am starting to get into double digit mileage on my runs and it hasn't been an issue yet and I read about it here and there. http://i.imgur.com/gPbEGQr.jpgMaybe wear shorts over your tights?  No one has to know you run commando, the only way they'd find out is by staring intently at your junk, and then they're the weirdos&gt; I am very confident  that muffins don't make people tired.

Pretty sure my boyfriend would disagree with you. 

 &gt;  presumably dropped by an unknown number of migrating swallows.

African or European?I think running history and recent training done will help give better answers for this question.
