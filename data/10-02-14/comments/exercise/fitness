IME, there is no relationship between someone's title and their fitness knowledge, even among doctors. Some doctors will tell you squats will kill you, some physical therapists know more about your body than you ever could. It really comes down to people.8-9 am MWF.

Out of the two I would pick C4, but if youre looking for something to give you a ton of energy try Mr.HydeHey I actually watched the superbowl 100 percent commercial free for the first time ever this year. Partial thickness tear of my supraspinatus and a bone bruise 6 months ago now. Did about 6 weeks of pt. I'd say I am back around 80-90% now. Full mobility. The only things that can still bother it are back squats, just because of the angle I'm pulling my shoulder back at. And also weighted thick jump rope. And of course shoveling in Boston these days. Because people need to get worked up over trivial things to feel smarter than your average pleb.Surgery and a long rehab. Yeah I would eat closer to an hour before. I find that for strenuous workouts I start to get dizzy if I eat any earlier. Alright so I'm 17 and rather new to strength training/weight lifting. I'm 205 lb, lift 4-5 times a week focusing legs, arms, back etc. After my workouts (usually 1 - 1 1/2 hours) I take 2 servings of whey protein. I am primarily aiming to gain strength, so weight is not a concern. Is creatine a viable option to increase strength?not sure why you are downvoted. that is actually a good point. my bent bar works fine for me because i dont do those lifts. i want to replace it because i just like nice things. but for my lifts it functions 100% fine. but if i was doing power/olympic lifts where bar whip has an affect, it might not be.Oh, I agree it's nice to know all that stuff. Just tryin' to help out those who don't care.http://healthyhabitshotline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RotatorCuff05.pngI gave myself huge tendinitis with cuban press :/ Dangerous if done with relatively heavy weights.What's a good Pre-workout for someone just starting to take them? I've been working out for about a year now but never used pre workout. What would be a good one to start with?That's a good idea. I'll try it.You can do but it just adds an extra level of complexity to your math. Ie you have to eat not only a surplus for the lifting but also a surplus to take into account the hiit, both during and after the training. I would avoid it until its time to cut tbh.For just about anything related to gym-related health I would recommend a physical therapist. They won't tell you to stop activity, they'll assess your individual biomechanics and add or modify your exercise to fix your issues.

That being said, realize that their goals may not be the same as your own. For example, I've had three different physios tell me not to squat to or past parallel. They're obviously just trying to minimize risk, but that interferes with my goal of being able to safely squat deep.Not arthritis as such [arthritis affects joints], rather the acromion sometimes grows a bone spur down onto the supraspinatus tendon and impinges upon it, leading to tears. That would be fine.Cool, I hope it helps out. 

If you think this is the cause, here are some things that helped me with my tightness and pain:

[Pigeon pose and 'couch stretch' from here](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/08/05/undo-the-damage-of-sitting/)

Using a lacrosse ball on my TFL and stretching it, youtube search "tfl release".

Weighted back raises to strengthen my glutes.  Also, I changed the way I did back raises.  I never thought about my glutes before, I just ... raised my torso up.  I started thinking "fuck the pad", or if you want to be less crude, "Drive your hips into the pad" instead of thinking about raising my back.  This really helped me learn how to use my glutes.

Unilateral work (single leg work).  I'm guessing it just forced me to use my glutes more, since I had more balance to maintain.  I bet with some googling you could find a better explanation, or maybe it was all in my head, but doing some single leg step ups onto a box help me out tremendously.  

Learning what the fuck "hip hinge" means, and using it on my lifts.Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

Also might want to try some high bar and front squats. Protein powder is just an easy way to consume a lot of protein, it's not necessary. It is good for losing weight though because regular protein powders have some of the best protein to calorie ratios because they are so pure. If you get enough protein in your diet there is no need, but I find it hard to reach my protein goals while staying under my maximum calories without itusually do 9:30-11PM. I can't stand the crowds and theres something very relaxing to me about working out at night. When I'm done I can go home, shower, eat something then go right to bed. That's always a good feeling to me.I would just add to this that if you ever get a potential rotator cuff tear, get yourself to see a shoulder specialist ASAP. The supraspinatus does not easily heal without surgery as it has a very poor blood supply, and you will have poorer outcomes if you wait more than 6 weeks for surgery. Calluses take time to build up, you can either suffer through it, or switch to lifting gloves. In the long run your rough callused hands may be better for everyday life, but if you don't want that gloves will protect themHold your arms out in front of you with your fingers together and your your thumbs sticking out facing each other. Turn your thumbs down toward the ground = internal rotation. Turn your thumbs up toward the sky = external rotation. It's called a subluxation, and I had this problem for many years. I was a swimmer and I guess after many years of swimming my labrium was weakened. I went to PT and they prescribed the standard shoulder exercises to strengthen the rotator cuff. Well as time went on I would keep getting these subluxations and progressively over the years they would get worse and more frequent even while maintaining my shoulder exercises. The exercises helped with quickly bouncing back but eventually it was popping out about once a week or more and I'm sure as you know it sucks. 

I went and visited the sports physician and due to all these subluxations I had managed to tear my labrium from the 2 o'clock position to the 11 o'clock position plus I had fractured my glenoid at some point so I had what was called a bony bankart lesion. Pretty much my rotator cuff muscles were the only thing stablizing my shoulder since the cartilage around my shoulder socket was shredded. Elected to get the surgery. I hit the pt hard and bounced back after a few months. Was cleared in 6 months but still do my PT exercises to this days. No more problems with my shoulder but I do have a slight reduction in mobility in it (~95%). No problems with lifting or anything other sports I do such as mt biking and skiing so I'm happy I eventually got it done. Well for starters I would completely abandon "Phrak's GSLP" and make your own workout split. I don't know who designed that program but it's God awful. 

Design a program dedicated to your goals. I've been lifting for 7 years now and have never plateaud and I honestly credit it to the fact that I've personalized all my workouts contoured to my own goals. It's fine to base your workouts on others program but I almost never do the absolute exact program designed by someone else. I realize that a lot of people do follow workout and diet programs designed by someone else and have a lot of success, which is great BUT look at any top bodybuilder, fitness model, powerlifter, etc. They all have workouts customized to their personal goals (even if someone else created it, it was designed specifically for that person's goal).

I'm new to Reddit so I don't know where I would find a link similar to these but these are some great links I've used to help me in the past.I have a question on pre-existing injuries.  I have had a posterior and anterior labrum tear for close to 5 years now and I've always neglected to have it surgically corrected after my last tear ended with a botched surgery and very extensive rehabilitation.  

I've been slowly rehabilitating it over the years with what I learned the first time around but the same problem remains with heavy lifts in the fact that I can't do them. Call it fear or pain but when I really get up in weight on deadlift, military press, bench press or lat raises I can never go to muscle fatigue failure, it's always a failure from the pain or I'll start feeling something giving out or on the brink of giving out, not fatigue related, and stop what I'm doing. 

I'm an Ex-wrestling, lacrosse, football athlete and college wrestler.  It's frustrating being limited in any activity I do and at this point I want to continue to lift, but also be able to have a baseball catch with my future son (or current, I don't have any kids that I know about). 

I guess what I'm asking is, at a certain point do these stretches actually keep helping or do they just prevent worsening.  Is surgery the only answer in my case?

Thanks fellas, a pleasure as usual. 

i was responding to the safety of wood holding that weight. and i do agree there are flaws. one you are not loading the posts truly vertically. you load them in front so they will create a moment across the post, so you dont get the entire section in compression. some will be in tension.

the design of the pegs/holes dont have enough information to begin to look at, though i do agree they are the likely first place of failure. especially as shown i am skeptical of their strength. that being said there are tons of wood connectors/straps to design something that will not result in a failure you are describing. im sure someone smarter than me could come upw ith something adjustable.

but like i said, i was mostly discussing the strength of wood. not necessarily this design.How long ago did you quit smoking? I'm no doctor but it might take a while for your circulatory system to start recoveringNo doubt about it in my mind. Static stretching done as a warmup is kind of useless but actual warm up (including dynamic stretching) does help to prevent injuries. I noticed multiple times I got a stupid "pulled something" injury when I skimped on warm up. Especially shoulders.Didn't say they would be terrible for any situation. Said they are terrible when the goal is to compensate poor mobility. Atleast that's what I meant to say. :(I don't have any short ribs but I do have a big piece of beef I was going to make stew with tomorrow..might just some sort of fucked up korean beef stew with this instead.I don't go to someone who isn't a medical doctor to help fix an injury. Maybe once you're done seeing a real doctor and you're healed, you can go to a trainer to learn how to fix the problems that caused the injury in the first place. 

You're going to have slight soreness and discomfort when with exercise. Sharp pains that only come when you move a certain way are very bad, and you *should* stop moving that certain way until it heals. Dull, constant aches or soreness that go away after movement/warming up are fine and just part of the deal.Probably not utilizing your body to its max potential. A lot of people just "bench" and it becomes just an tricep workout. You should post a form check video to check if your shoulder blades are pinched/back tightness and incorporating leg drive. Maybe your body isn't responding to your program. Change it up and modify. Someone once told me lifting programs are trial and error. Best advice I got from a gym bro.I do it all the time, kinda pudding tasting
I suffered a small tear in my right rotator cuff during high school football. It wasn't discovered until I had an MRI w/ arthogram for a later subluxation, and it had already healed and what remained was a small tear. I was benching 240-260 before the tear, and I've struggled with anything around or over 200 since (sublux occurred about 2 years ago). Any tips on how to overcome this setback? I've been trying to get back into training but I just can't seem to get my bench max anywhere near what it used to be. I have used it frothing coffee and hot chocolate and it works pretty well, never for a whey protein shake though.

Another thing you could do is instead of adding the powder to the liquid and a little liquid to the powder first, mix it up and then pour the rest of the liquid. I honestly think it has to do with the coffee. Any protein shake I make using coffee gets foamy and starts to separate pretty quickly. Not sure how to fix it though. Drink fast?I'm calling you out. You did not read the wiki.&gt; Everything else is annoyingly angry and wrong.

/fitness/ logic - "I can't think up a good response so I'm just going to say you're wrong"

Sounds like you're on a program for more than just your workout.
That's true and its why you wouldn't work to exhaust the rotator cuff muscles, just warm them up before you lift. First off congratulations! 

Secondly, you are most likely hitting a plateau given your time frame, you might try switching up your routine by adding in new exercises, resting less between sets, lifting heavier, etc. You could also try adding in more cardio or a different type of cardio. 

Lastly take a look at your diet and see if it can be improved at all? 

Quick edit: take a look at some training techniques like super sets, compound sets, drop sets, super slows, and eccentric training, these may also help you to break throughThis submission has been removed.

5'6 22 year old in shape female looking to gain muscle. 

I found the tingling has become more noticeable as I have become saturated in it. Keep taking it for a while and if you still don't notice an effect then i guess stop taking it. 3-5 grams is the recommended daily doseRather than answer, let me ask, what do you think would happen if you did?The source is probably just someone's backside.Check the FAQ.  The first part. That 2011 paper used intense power training to achieve the muscle gain while losing fat. Also http://suppversity.blogspot.ca/2015/02/two-crazy-but-scientifically-proven.html

There was another on boxing I saw recently.  

I have always been told to do your single joint exercises last, and your multi joint exercises first. The rationale being that exhausting small stabilizing muscles first can lead to poor form in lifts that involve multiple joints. So having bad ankle mobility is ok and instead of improving it everyone should be using weight lifting shoes?No. If you eat that, you will die.False, I'm actually thick skinned.Resistance bands are also good, just tie it around a post and then the other end around your ankle while standing.No, I took almost 9 months off of lifting, except for some stretching and "rehab" type stuff.  I could have kept doing upper body, but the pain had gotten to the point that I just didn't want to do much at all anyway.

After 5 or so months it started to feel better, and now I am asymptomatic.  Started back in the gym Thanksgiving day (my gym is awesome and open).  Squats back up into the low 400's, and I pulled 455 pretty easily this week.  When I quit I couldn't even set up for a pull off the floor, or squat 135 - it just hurt too much.Thats why in Crossfit we blow them out with a gay swinging pull up.Fruit and vegetables, rice, beans, oats.  [Tortilla shells](https://allisonhurtado.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/photo-4.jpg).  Never added it up.  I remember reading somewhere that the minimum dose to get the maximum effect is 0.03 grams creatine per kg of body weight, which means 5 grams is still enough for you. Most people just take 5 grams because it's a standard scoop/teaspoon size and creatine is cheap. Great post! Except I just got done with an MRI and the doc diagnosing that I have a Superspinatus strain.
Note to Self: Check Reddit more often. It's free!As the external rotators become really short (in the last stage of the exercise where gravity isn't working against you) I find it really difficult to stop the movement becoming abduction. To be honest the cable version is, as you say, more optimal. But, I just seem to prefer the other.This submission has been removed.

My lockout strength and general tricep strength have gotten miles better since I've started push pressing. Haha yeah its always the ones that look like they don't even lift that tell other people how to lift. Good idea! I'll add it to my arsenal.Invest in a good jacketYou need to clearly define what type of results you want to see, size, strength, cardio whatever. Then research more specifically into those areas. 

As a general rule free weights (Dumbbells and barbells) are better than machines because they require more stabilization muscles, but since you are a beginner, machines are a good choice for a few weeks until You build some some strength 

Maybe they mean doing a strengthening routine versus a warmup or dynamic stretching routine.SAT word of the day, students, is pusillanimous. Added to daily lexicon.So I'm not an expert or anything, but this could be a sign of a sleep disorder. Other com mentors have suggested things you can try, I'd add that this can happen if you are consuming too much caffeine within six hours of bed time. 

What you can do is track what is happening, when times do you wake up? How many hours of sleep have you gotten? What did you do/eat/drink in the hours before bed time, ect. See if altering things in your routine helps (like less caffeine,  better diet, no heavy exercising within two hours of bedtime, ect) if nothing is then go talk to your doctor and take the information you've been keeping track of as they will probably ask you about it. It's a stimulant so if you take large doses at once it can have very negative effects, and yes potentially cause heart problems. Here is a good resource I found

http://www.hotnfit.com/ecstackThey are worried about putting extra work on the kidney and stuffs like that. Is this something to worry about?My point? 

The assumption behind the statement that he could gain material weight is that it would be lean weight (this is a fitness subreddit after all).

40 lbs of lean body mass does not have the same health implications as 40 lbs of fat. 

 I suspect most of the serious lifters here would fall into the overweight category of BMI and to imply that BMI is a good measure for lifters is, simply, wrong.

You got a source on this?I'm not natively speaking english so seems like people have problems with reading comprehension or I worded myself poorly. 

Anyways, my point was that if you have poor ankle mobility I'd not use weight lifting shoes to compensate the lack of it. Would improve the mobility to the point where you could squat deep naturally. 

Who the hell would squat heavy weights and have bad form because of bad mobility? 
Around 6PM on the way home from work.  I just don't have enough energy in the mornings to have effective workouts.  I've tried it and my lifts are all much worse.  By 6PM I've been up all day and eating a lot of food and it just feels right.  Maybe if I stuck with it for a while it would be better - it would be nice to have it out of the way in the AM, that's for sure.  All day with that post workout glow. The only real supplement that works for weight loss is Ephedrine. Caffeine can help a bit too but EC stacks (ephedrine and caffeine together) is the only effective "fat burner" supplement. here is some more info

http://www.hotnfit.com/ecstackAnd, like golf, this asshole rarely has any game himself.OK, I guess I might try it and if it don't work, I'' buy one of those ankle weights. You're right, they're up to 2 kg unfortunately. My kettlebell is 4 kg. Maybe it would be possible to put on my ankle two ankle weights?I'd just like to add that these are all correct exercises for improving your flexibility in your shoulders.

I've had extreme pain in my rotator cuff, so I had to go to the chiropractor to see whats wrong. He always started the session with testing my flexibility, like in OP's post. Luckily the damage wasn't huge, only a muscle that will not relax on itself.Not entirely. I agree on the cardio part. It is possible to influence how much weight gain or loss goes to muscle or fat through training and it is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.  We added a section to the FAQ to address that point.  The type of training that works is HIIT, sprinting, metabolic resistance training, high intensity power training, Crossfit and boxing.  There may be other methods as well. Anything that works is very hard and usually requires external motivation.&gt; when I internally rotate it.

Doing what exercise?I've lost a bunch of weight and gotten in shape and I still see my "old" self in the mirror but I get a lot of positive feedback from people that I look a lot better, slimmer and stronger.  Funny how my image of myself hasn't caught up yet.

The other funny thing is how people are dying to know what the secret is.  They keep thinking I'm on some miracle diet or weight loss pill or some other shit.  They look so sad when I tell them I walk, run, lift weights and eat less calories than I burn. Nobody likes the reality of what it takes to lose weight and get in shape.  It's hard and it sucks some days but then it clicks and now I feel crappy if I don't get to the gym for 2 days.it is when the number one question is "why I make no gains"? and the number one answer is "what program are you on"?Just film yourselfIt's not uncommon for supplement companies to recommend higher dosages to make you buy more. My multi recommends 2 a day but I only take 1, it's just an insurance policy if you are missing anything in your diet. 1 is probably good enough, especially if you have a decent dietLol mostly joking, you'll find your never healthy enough once you feel the difference in being over weight and being fit.Thanks for the advice. That was the initial plan, but you know, of course I'm impatient and I thought there is a "quicker way". But yeah, there isn't :)Out of curiosity, why do you prefer ER in lying down position? I was taught this is sub-optimal as the range of motion is only working against gravity for part of the movement. With cable ER, resistance is applied throughout the range of motion. I would like to see stretches that identify what parts of my cuff are tight, as opposed to just saying if I'm tight or not. That would help those of us with an imbalance to more effectively target our problem areas.&gt;Male, 5'9", ~149-150lbs

This is like literally average.Greek yogurt is great for me. I mix it with everything!

I make romaine lettuce wraps with a cup of Greek instead of sour cream.

I mix it with Granola.

I put a cup into my protein shake with scoop of whey and cup of fruits or I'll freeze it and eat it as an ice cream/sorbet.

I'll mix it with peanut butter and jelly or nutella.

It's great stuff. I love it! 

You can mix it with cottage cheese...man  the list goes on and on.

This is what I meant, I wil eat at a surplus but I will also do HIIT 2 times a weekBoth.  I've read (on this sub I think) that stretching doesn't actually do anything besides mentally prepare you, and in my experience it's never helped with anything.  So if I'm doing something wrong I'd like to know about it, but I also want evidence because I know a lot of people *think* stretching helps and have just never questioned it.

Also, the article above says not to do these exercises before a bench/shoulder press.  So if you aren't supposed to warm up your shoulders, why anything else?I just started. Just 1 week in I already see a difference.I haven't experienced being cold after caffeine from cofee...But the fat burner makes me feel cold for 20some minutes, thanks for helping with it.Unfortunately I don't have an answer for you.

However, could you elaborate on your desire for an erg? This is out of personal curiosity.Real talk guys, what's your thoughts on Fairlife milk, the milk that coke is putting out.

[Here it is](http://fairlife.com/our-products/fat-free/).  Nutrition info looks pretty solid, basically trading half the sugar for protein and making it accessible for the lactose intolerant.  I wouldn't mind using this in shakes, or on cereal, or oats.

Everyone I've talked to about is just saying "Yeah, but it's coke, and therefore bad" but I cannot find a REAL reason to dislike it.Ever since I've been lifting heavy (~6 months), I've been super twitchy and really active in my sleep, and it's been affecting both me and my husband to the point that I was considering sleeping in the guest room on my lifting days.  

I started taking 150 mg magnesium citrate on Monday, and have noticed a huge difference.  YMMV, and it might be placebo, but I've been really happy with it so far. Yes this is the best way to observe your gainsRule of thumb, if it doesn't hurt when it pops/cracks, then it's nothing to worry about. That's how I know I'm not trying hard enough.

**WHERE'S YOUR GAINZ MR. BLACK SCREEN?**

lift weights, don't hate.

Or keep hating and never get swole =)7 pm is pretty late to take EC. I take 2 doses a day, 1 shortly after I get up in the morning at like 6:30-7am, then take my second dose around 11am-noon. General guideline is 4-6 hours apart. Here is a pretty good resource I found:

http://www.hotnfit.com/ecstack/ec-dosagesIf it's painful, go to a physiotherapist.  Otherwise, go to a trainer.  Something is clicking/painful in my shoulder when I internally rotate it. Mostly avoidable and not excruciating, but I know that I'll screw it up totally if I don't pay attention to it.Phrak's GSLP is a variant of greyskull linear progression. OHP and bench are on alternating workouts, and it's not 3 days in a row. Also, SL 5x5 and SS are both proven programs for beginners that require no dumbbell work or incline.

Your only good comment was the first one, post a video. Everything else is annoyingly angry and wrong.Are you skeptical or just curious?Does anyone take fish oil supplements that has a fish allergy? I would have thought that the athour would believe that doing a rotator cuff routine prior to lifting overhead would exhaust the muscles meaning that they wouldn't fire during the exercise, when they are needed.

However, if this was the thinking, its incorrect. Doing a sub maximal rotator cuff routine prior to lifting would increase the firing rate of the those muscles during the compound movements. Maximal rotator cuff strengthening may not be advised until after compounds. 5 p.m., after work. I like the feeling of unleashing all my rage after work in a controlled setting. Then, I go home, shower, eat a nice meal and relax.Jumping rope.Coaches Eye on iPhone is convenient if you find yourself recording frequently.It's hard to sound like a joke/sarcasm online. You are misusing amrap sets - they are to gauge your progress and add a little extra volume with heavy load. But you had right intentions - benching more. Maybe the dumbbells weren't the best tool if your one side isn't lagging heavily behind. That said - drop a little more weight and work back with extra volume. Work in 8-12 range.

You could honestly use a belt and be fine. Just strap on the ankle, tie to the weight. As long as the weight isn't too heavy for you, you should be able to control the ascent/descent and not hurt yourself.People sticking to a program too much is not fittit's problem, homie.I drink a protein shake just mixed with water. Then later in the evening I make a fruit smoothie with greek yogurt and chia seeds.  I don't care much for the protein powder in a smoothie for some reason.I just want to say excellent job on making it to the gym! It really can be the hardest part, especially during the winter time. I'm a native Floridian transplanted in a northern state and I hate leaving the house when the temperatures drop even lower in the evening but with my schedule that's the only available workout time. Just making going to the gym part of your routine is a huge accomplishment and you should be really proud. 
That said, I really encourage you to look into the big three weighted exercises (squats, bench press, and deadlifts) and definitely the assisted pull up machines. For pull ups, you can use your initial weight to your advantage because as you lose weight, you're just going to feel yourself getting stronger and stronger, which will be really satisfying. The good news is that doing inner thigh exercises will strengthen the muscles in your inner thighs, which may make them look firmeralthough, as others have said, it won't take away any of the fat on your thighs (and you may not see the muscle gains until you've lost weight). So keep exercising, but also keep reducing your overall body fat, because the only way to lose thigh fat is to lose weight in general."The bike thing" ...it's a bikeThere's going to be a lot of pain at first.  Work through it.  Start off slow so you don't hurt yourself.  Focus on nutrition first and foremost.  he would be better off singling out the people doing this, as otherwise it just has a bystander effect. Even though everyone knows whos at fault. I don't follow lean gains and typically train in the evening. However I'm a college student and frequently my schedule changes and I don't have enough time for a full breakfast or coffee. I just use Amino energy in the mornings when this happens. Most of the flavors taste pretty good and you can control a dosage of caffeine in terms of how many scoops you want to use. This may or may not be an attractive way for you to use BCAA and still get some sort of "tangible" benefit out of it. Veggies, fruits and oatmeal mostly.&gt; (equal abduction power as deltoid)

This is definitely not true. Supraspinatus helps to initiate abduction but the deltoid is a much, much stronger abductor due to both a greater cross-sectional area and a more distal insertion point along the humerus. 

&gt; If you're unable to get the fingers to overlap, or touch, your flexibility is not good enough yet.

Good enough for what? I can't think of a single fitness or lifting related movement in which you need this much flexibility, and this likely isn't limited by your rotator cuff anyway. If you can move through the range of motion required to complete your desired activity, that's enough flexibility. Many people, despite all the stretching in the world, will never be able to touch their fingers like this, and trying to force it could be damaging.What is a way to check body fat?You're a fucking dick and exactly the type of person who gives fitness conscious people a bad name. i've seen some people distribute their weight from one side to the other to maintain balance (presumably?).  [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JppwI7Krsh0)As a physical therapy student, go to the physical therapist. A good amount of modern physical therapists now have Doctorate degrees and CSCS certifications. Some trainers just have a weekend fitness course that cost $500. I've had minor chronic injuries, went to my PT professor and he showed me the best things to do. Not only did he mention the exercises to rehab, but form to prevent. If it's a chronic injury you're best for a physical therapist. 
[This](http://www.walmart.com/ip/34719026?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;adid=22222222227023783005&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=40753969232&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;wl6=78604645952&amp;veh=sem) is what I get and yes I just mix it with water.Just got an email from BB.com about ERGO CUT. Anybody have any info on this? I read the ingredients and tbh I can never seem to trust what certain supplements claim. They always make it out to be all pros to cons with some info not even scientifically proven. It buy 1 get 1 free and looks decently promising. You can't blame them for not re-racking their dumb bells. People were sitting on the racks! You shouldn't disturb them while they're recovering between sets....Good plan.  I'm Tracking today's calories as we speak.  I haven't even eaten lunch yet and I'm at 882 calories already.  Holy fuck. Thank Christ I'm working out later XD.Yeah I would just do some heavy kickboard work with breaststroke and freestyle if you want to work on your leg strength.True, but I'm not sure if it would be safe. I dropped the kettlebell once and it almost hit my toes, so I'm rather cautious now. Also while being strapped to my ankle it won't be secure and can hit my ankle. 
Don't you think something like this would be better? http://www.allproweights.com/ankleweights.htmlTrust me I have good grip I can deadlift this weight on a regular bar fine. It literally just rolled out of my hand.I've had the same problem in the past. What has helped me is doing skullcrushers laying down with my hands parallel to my head (if I were standing my arms would be over my head) and starting from pretty much behind my head towards my neck and doing a skullcrusher from there. Don't move your shoulders and just use your triceps.

General tips to help would just be to improve form, with ideal form you shouldn't have much pain, don't let your ego get in the way and lower your weight, don't lock your elbows when at the top of the exercise, and finally if all this doesn't help than I'd stay away from them for awhile. Great, thanks man! I really want to get better at it, just needed someone to point me in the right direction! I kinda assumed it was a deadlift bar and was like "Oh shit this will help me tremendously." The minute I switched to mixed grip it started slipping.I'm aware it's pretty bro-ish. It was meant to be done while doing a large volume of running. Just curious about the source.Beans/lentils, oats/grits/bran, wild rice, lots of nuts, fruit, saladsserving size is 5 pills at 3.5. So I should take 8 everyday I lift? I can just take it in the morning with my other pills even if I'm not lifting til later that night? Nope. You basically need to eat more calories than you burn to bulk up. Cardio just burns calories so prevents you bulking as well.

What you need to do is go over your calorie allowance just enough to gain muscle but not so much as to add (much) fat. It is a balancing act but if you keep detailed notes and logs on food and training you should be able to tailor it over time.Just want to point out that Creatine and beta-alanine aren't timing dependent in terms of helping your workouts. They don't give any extra benefit in a pre workout than taking them any other time. Nothing wrong with having them in there if you want to take all of your supplements together thoughKekoslovakia. Wow.  I didn't think of that.  I've been sleeping like shit.

This is amazing, thank you so much!no.as a fella with low back issues (Degenerative Disc) i'm very familiar with QL's causing pain.

[And here's a video explaining.

Entire separate days for arms and shoulders, and then mashing chest and back together into one.That's great because breaststroke is my favourite style :)Yes, but it will of course vary from person to person. A more slow-twitch fiber dominant person, will probably find that their max is closer to their xRM, than a person with more fast-twitch would (due to their different properties).OK.  For two people that makes sense.  I've never been to any of the big name gyms because of all the stuff they "include" that I would never use.Did you need surgery?Gain about 30 solid pounds and see what that does for youON amino energy. Lets you work for longer periods, especially when working out fasted. Also gives you a nice boost with the small amount of caffeine in it. BCAA's and a good protein powder have done more for me than any other supplements. Never understood why people give them such a hard time.Using a wall or pole in front of you is fine while you work on your flexibility

You also may need to widen your stance. Think about squatting down inbetween your legs instead of sitting back.I'd be careful when "strengthening" your rotator cuff muscles. With respect to the anatomy of the shoulder joint, these muscles play a crucial role in stabilizing the joint. "Strengthing" the rotator cuff muscles improperly will cause imbalance and potentially further issues with the shoulder.
A functional assessment of the anatomy of the shoulder strongly suggests the rotator cuff to be muscles of stability - not necessarily for gross movement.
That being said, yes stretching is beneficial in increasing ROM, but strengthening them as you would a global muscle (power&gt;endurance) would be unwise. Rather, it would be advised to strengthen them for stability (power &lt; endurance).
This is simply my take based on my education and reading.You could get/make something to strap your kettlebell to your ankle.Can work for some movements, like lateral raises. But with squat, deadlift, or (debatably) good mornings, you have a higher chance of back hyper extension if you are looking at the mirror.It sounds like an ankle flexibility issue. If you have tight ankles you will tend to lean forward and have a hard time keeping your balance. 
For now, just go as low as you can while keeping your balance (no wall) and hold. You'll get better with consistency. A physical therapist would definitely be the person to go to for tennis elbow.All Max Nutrition manufactures Isoflex which I consider to be the best protein powder/replacement powder that I have used. It costs a little more than competitive products, but it's a much cleaner powder. All Max Nutrition also make a straight Whey protein powder that you may want to try. I am not affiliated with All Max Nutrition in any manner.
Its not breaking up the clumps when I did that. Used twice the amount of water with same results. I had the same thought and was reaaaaly confused and sad. Had to drink twice the amount and it still had chunks, hah.This post has been removed.

hatas gonna hate!&gt; There's no dumbbell work, no incline, and too much recurring exercise

Same as Starting Strength and Stronglifts. Are you suggesting that all programs without dumbbells, no incline, and a lot of recurring exercises are designed by morons?I was doing pullups about a month ago and felt a pop in my right shoulder. Only a slight pain in the moment. Now I feel pain every time I try to stretch my right arm up my back the way you described. Before the injury, I could reach and pull it a bit with my other hand. Now, I can no longer do that stretch properly. Otherwise unaffected in any lifting or calisthenic exercise. Any advice? Breaststroke would help immensely with hip abductors and adductors.Can you give an example of a positive development in language, and how it differs from this? Slang happens yo. Shakespeare made up all sorts of words, but what may have been nonsense then is regarded as classic work now. &gt;Nobody never tells me which of those thousand routines are for Novice/Intermediate etc.

[here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index#wiki_selecting_a_workout_routine)....Its not an all inclusive list.How's this different than an American gym? I seen a bunch of chicks laying on the floor taking selfies and dudes on machines playing with their phone. The comments in imgur are so biased and contain hatesWhen I put my hand on my neck and slide it up and down my shoulder pops out of place with a loud pop.

My doctor wouldn't even give me an MRI when I showed him.The Best Quadratus Lumborum Stretch: http://youtu.be/3NlugMEihG8I'm doing them right, but you'll hear a lot of novices complaining of pain in those areas, and it's widely unnecessary. You could just post a pic of your abs to prove how amazing an wheels are, and I'll do the same for cable crunches. Yeah fair enough. I have recently started to prepare my own meals and the prefer it much more to what I was doing before. I'll stick to whey and nutrition from food sources. Thanks for the advice dude. Thanks TonyOstrich, that was very helpful. I just tried it and the key for me was to engage core and squeeze ass. I'm not sure why it wasn't working before. Regarding the heels only contact with the floor that's the same suggestion that Rippetoe makes in "Starting strength" for squatting! Cool.
To explain the biochemistry simply the creatine does not passively move through cell membranes but is rather taken up by transport proteins and not released from the cells in any significant concentration afterward (but it does break down or get metabolized over time). Your body's naturally produced creatine actually originates from the liver and is taken up by muscle tissue from the bloodstream. Dont forget to include your own weight when squatting tooHave you used this before? Ikea is only like 10 minutes away so I might give this a go!Yeah, chocalate with vanilla yogurt almost tastes like coffee! Except once I used EAS Complete Protein and it absorbal **all** mouisture and turned into a rock... that sucked.Full scoop. It's literally just protein. Do they let you eat chicken or beans? Then they should allow you to have your protein powder.

Remember: the purpose of this protein powder is to supplement (read: add to) your protein intake so that you can make sure you're getting enough.It is natural fruit sugar without the fiber contained in the fruit, which would normally slow digestion and stop the insulin spike.

Fruit juice will have a similar effect on body composition as soda.

FACT&gt; n't open till 9AM. Usually around 10 AM on the weekend. I wish it opened earlier.

I just workout out in the weight room that the athletes used. Not sure I was allowed to do that, but none of the teams knew who was on the other teams, and I kept my head down and ran a reasonable program, so no one gave me any shit.It's common for both to be completely full of shit, by and large

What specific injuries/problems are you talking about?Nutrient timing is important for competitive bodybuilders where every gram of bodyfat and muscle counts. Its also useful with some PEDs. Chances are, you are not at that point, and jut need to worry about calories in vs calories out, and macronutrients.Probably a stupid question, but what's the difference between internal rotation and external rotation?Yeah the other flavors I've had aren't having this issue, but I don't want to waste the whole tub of protein!Sane with me Usually at work - No access to a blender :(Most people would write out either 19:30 or 19.30 tbh.

But I like the time machine stuff better. Gyms pre-iPhone generation were much less crowded. Also gotta reap those pre-birth benefits when you squeeze in those 1930 workouts in your schedule.I would really like an answer on this...I too only do them before an upper body day...sometimes after or on a day off.http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise

At the bottom is a bolded link: **try the [program picker website](http://rohitnair.net/pp/).** My gym offers a TRX class. There are some cardio elements to it (we occasionally do burpees), but it mostly focuses on HIIT with strength focused exercises. I take the class once a week to supplement a climbing, weights, jogging and ballroom dance regimen and find it really enjoyable. TBH I do the same set of stretches every workout, each workout I have 5 different workouts, I am most tight in my lower body so I will do: [hamstring stretch](http://www.soccermaniak.com/images/hamstring_stretch_7.jpg), [glute stretch](http://www.exrx.net/StretchImages/GluteusMaximus/StandingGlute.jpg), [calf stretch 1](http://www.docpods.com/images/Calf-Stretch-Step-WEB.jpg) and [2](http://www.racewalk.com/Stretching/IntensiveCalfStretch.jpg), [hip stretch](http://www.amongmen.com/sites/default/files/uploads/content/jock_yoga_tutorial_-_active_lunge_stretch_for_hip_flexors_2.jpg) and  [frog hip stretch](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-REbU0BauD7Q/TzSYRt4g9-I/AAAAAAAAANQ/2jztilg2U1A/s1600/frog1.jpg)

I feel like this gets all the major areas in my legs and I feel great afterwards. I think I'm going to add this lower back stretch in somewhere. My upper body usually isnt tight, sometimes I'll do shoulder dislocations but usually it's just those 5 stretches matched with each of my 5 workoutsIll give this a try! Thank you!No. Washing habits constitute such a small fraction of daily activity that this is not the case. Hence the downvotes. Thanks. Too bad not everyone thinks like this -&gt; she the "nice" post below...You should still add a little fat but HIIT as been shown to be the best cardio for bulking. I would do things like sled pushes and pulls for a 15 yard sprint.  If you don't have access to those just sprint balls out.Ahh...  I don't have a foam roller. Any way I could use the lax ball on my knee? Meh for what you want, I'd probably go PPL. Theoretically you'd get more gains from increased volume due to still being a novice.

However, it's probably a pretty break even split in all reality.I've got 4 kids under the age of 7 and I find time.i always tell people to go to costco and so they can buy a ton of lean ground beef, turkey, and frozen chicken.  it's much cheaper there.  they have oats and frozen vegetables there, too.  there are a million things you can do with it.  get milk, eggs and egg whites there, too.  Either around 11 because that lets me go to work (bartender) afterwards, or, if I'm lifting on my days off, around 2 or 3 because I have more energy if I eat lunch, and then have some tea or coffee or something. Also, the powerlifters tend to be in around then, and I training at the same time as them.I like modified skull crushers with two dumbbells. Put them together, so they touch, and start in front of your face (bottom of dumbbell should be parallel to forehead) at a lower weight so you get acclimated. Then, just keep elbows in and go back behind your head, then back to forehead, repeat. I don't know, it's worked really well for me and rarely hurts my 'bows.There's also running laps but I know how to practice those.Well... That's racist.&gt; I was stuck at 125 for 4 weeks

So, you deloaded when you failed and then worked your way back up only to fail again at 125, right?  Just checking...

Are you microloading? (adding 1.25lb plates each time you hit the goal weight for perscribed reps)?

Have you posted a form check?  You might want to.  The fact taht you are hitting a 100lb OHP for reps and you are getting stuck past 120 on bench tells me that there's something wrong with your form that you may be unaware of.  The only people I have ever met or heard of who had overhead lifts that were really close to their bench were people who trained almost exclusively in overhead lifts for their sport.  If your overhead and bench pressing volume are more or less equal and your form is good then, *generally speaking,* there should be a little more of a gap there.That is advice called wisdom. We may not want it but not looking will improve your form and overall condition. Why? You have to feel what your doing is right and what is wrong. I hate mirrors since theyre a distraction but I did thought I needed them. My gym has a whole wall thats placed with mirrors though.I have tendinitis in my rotator right now,  would doing all the above stretches and exercises help speed up recovery? My doctor has given me a few exercises and just the basic arm across the chest stretch. Been going on 3 months now.  Movement and pain are much better but still very painful if I try to push any heavy weight. C4 vs Nxplode? I've got c4 right now but I don't ever notice feeling any more pumped up other than getting that annoying itchy sensation. A while back I tried a one serving noxplode shooter and felt like I was going to have a heart attack but was definitely more pumped up. What do you guys think? Which do you prefer?First off, congrats on being under 200 for the first time in five years! 

If you're 19 and have been only exercising for 6 weeks than I highly doubt you've hit a plateau. This early a lot of the weight you have lost is just your body adjusting to the caloric deficit as well water weight. I'd check your calories and make sure you're at the caloric deficit you want to be at. 

Finally, there are so many things that effect how much you weigh. Just remember that the scale is just a number. Losing 10 pounds of just fat will make you look a lot better than losing 10 pounds of fat, water, muscle, etc. The scale is a good guide on your journey but don't let it alone dictate your success.He's american.He has wide hips and shoulders. And really, you are going to look disproportional if you are over 6 foot and under 200. Nothing wrong with it, if he is happy with his body then it is a moot point.

 I never even said anything about 40lbs of lean muscle, either. Some muscle, some increased bone density, increased glycogen, and some dreaded fat all combined after completing the novice phase of Starting Strength. 210 isn't an end point, it's just a complete guess at a set point.kYou need to take in 5g a day - timing doesn't matter, so any time of day makes the same difference.Sound familiar huh? hahaoh, okay; knock yourself out then if you're having fun, but don't stress yourself out about it was what i meant (and it sound like you're not, so great).Do you just mix it with water?

I had that misconception too at some point in time. Keep asking questions. The worst that can happen is you'll get answers. (: All of our journeys start somewhere.1. post a video.

2. stop with the cut/bulk bullshit. 

3. I'm always amazed at how many people stick mindlessly to a fucking program as if just following a guide some dude on the internet posted is going to change them into zyzz. Just fucking stop it, assess where your weaknesses are and work on them.

I had to look up [Phrak's GSLP](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OUcEY.png) because I've no idea what it is. It looks like it was designed by a moron. There's no dumbbell work, no incline and too much recurring exercise. OHP plus bench 3 days in a row? WTF? Just stop doing it - it's shit.Not really, if you are on a dirty bulk and are fairly good at tracking weight/calories/etc you can find a medium that will allow you to add cardio and strength training.

I do both to maintain my endurance while getting stronger but you have to eat a lot more to maintain/bulk.

However cardio is not a magic "fat only" type of exercise, it just can help you reduce excess calories you go over. While also having other benefits.The act of looking straight ahead at yourself in the mirror in the middle of a lift will change how your neck/head is positioned, and consequentially alter your spine position and throw off your form. Your coach is right. Have you been sleeping 8hrs a night? I've heard about a study where two groups who were both eating at a deficit, one sleeping 8hrs and one getting like 6 per night. The group that had less sleep ended up losing more muscle and keeping fat, while the group with more sleep lost fat much more easily and held on to their muscle. The reason I ask is that when I went through a period with depression and anxiety my sleep suffered. Incidentally inadequate sleep is a big risk factor for depression and anxiety as well. Sleep can go unnoticed sometimes, but I would check that first if you're ever confused about why you're not getting results. 
Long winded, I know, but it's what I would look into.i bet you can. Look around, right now small warehouse gyms are becoming popular and there's a spot in my town where the whole block is different types of warehouse gyms. MMA, Crossfit, etc. Look around. Alot of places have a really cool family feel to them too. Plus the whole underground, not shiny polished franchise gym, makes you feel a little more badassAthletic trainer here. Find a physical therapist who specializes in sports rehabilitation. If you're legitimately concerned about your health you go to the doctor, this is no different. A physical therapist will be much more likely to find and help correct muscle imbalances and deficiencies. A physical therapist telling you to stop an activity isn't a death sentence either. Take their advice and consider why they might be giving it, and form your own opinion. The police aren't going to show up and arrest you if you decided to squat after they tell you not to.
Stopped by to say to be careful when having your phone in the sauna.

I love baking in the sauna after a workout but I've noticed that my phone battery life has diminished.  I believe it has something to do with the sauna heat.

Ipod shuffles can be gotten for cheap.  Definitely not a hip pop, more like a shift.Add HIIT or metabolic resistance training, or sprints, etc. They  will help you partition calories towards muscle instead of fat.  Conventional cardio doesn't really help keep the fat down. All it does is cost you calories. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdVCfDioTcY

Arnold wasn't lieing.wasted.gifIt's a powder and it is around 4 grams a teaspoon. I have it three times a day. The vast majority of the fiber I eat is from food. If you download "Daily Yoga" for free on either the iOS or Android app store, they have this stretch and many others specifically on a 10/15/20 minute back yoga routine. 

I injured my lower back doing stupid leg presses with my lower back rounded back in freshman year of high school. Now it chronically hurts but 10 minutes of that yoga routine alleviates pain for a couple of days usually.Dang man, I have shoulder problems and have watched many videos... How have I not seen any of those?! Thanks very much! Makes sense I was just second guessing myself hahaThanks!It is nice. That is why I hate youBar can vary in weight so it's important to not only add the weight to your total, but to know how much your bar weighs as well.There's nothing wrong with it, and I do it occasionally. However, as a recovering skelly, I find it easier to get down the calories I need for my bulk if I just throw the yogurt in a blender with some milk, whey, PB, and fruit. Its just a matter of personal preference.Well obviously if one dude is 6 '200 he is going to be bigger than a guy who is 5'7 160, even if the little guy can bench a lot. But of two dudes of more or less the same size the significantly stronger one will look better.I do this. I'm sure others do as well. I use ON chocolate whey and to me, it tastes almost like a mousse.  You still have some beginner gains to make on bench press, so a cut shouldn't effect to TOO much. This is a heavily debated topic, so I don't want this to be the focus of the response. Assuming you're going to for 3x5 BP if you miss 3 reps during the workout, then you need to repeat the weight. If you miss one or two reps, I chalk it up to an off day, and I'll still up weight for next session. If you repeat the weight 3 times, it's three strikes and your out, deload 10% on your next workout and progress. Sounds like you've hit the wall and need to deload. 

A deload is NOT A SIGN OF FAILURE, it's a sign YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT!

Form could be part of it, but from my experience I've had to deload more on my BP and OHP then my other lifts, it's normal.I think I tried that once but isn't it like 6 pills for a tiny bit of fiber? How many do you take?Here I am thinking it's a nice place :( Yes.
Thank you for the info! I am looking at these changes as a lifelong goal so I'm hoping I don't reach that point. I also do yoga now and it seems like that's one of those things that you can always keep challenging yourself. Thanks for the insight though, I definitely need to keep this in mind.Ya new shoes are on the shopping list. Thanks!I swear this isn't perception. I've compared my head and body with my family and friends and it looks smaller than all of them I matched with. I even asked a friend whether he thought my head was small or not, and he said yes.Yeah buts it's natural sugar, 100 percent juice no sugar added is far
More healthy than coke Thanks for the encouragement. Hopefully as the weight increases I can keep this form. I've never heard of buttwink before I will look it up. did you lift it? then it counts towards the weightI don't understand how you can't see the real issue is "how can I get more work done in less time"?  Time is the only asset we all have.  Some people want to spend as little time as possible on the journey so they can get to the destination.  It is going to be very difficult to "prescribe" a diet for you because of the many factors that should be considered regarding your overall health. You may find more success with someone local who can speak with you about nutrition and fitness. Try speaking with your schools wrestling coach or talk with your parents about your concerns. Maybe they can get you to a local nutritionist. Yes, always include it. You are lifting it anyway lolYou're eating more calories than you think you are (or drinking them).  Actually track the calories you are eating - try to eat 500 below your TDEE and watch the scale.  If you lose roughly a pound a week, great.  If you lose less, eat a bit less.  If you lose more, eat a bit more. Keep at it and you'll get there.I know this is semantics but instead of "cutting calories" I would say "increasing caloric deficit".  It's possible to increase calories and still lose fat in you increase the amount of calories you burn by more than you increase what you consume.Include the weight of the bar.&gt;Improving diet means getting adequate protein and fats and matching carbs to activity. It also means eliminating junk food and increasing nutritious foods.

That's all you really need to know.  Junk food is anything you find at the corner store or at a fast food restaurant.  Nutritious food is vegetables and fruit and protein foods like unprocessed meat, poultry, eggs, fish and dairy.  Nice congrats and thanks!! I'm hoping to be at your point in a year or two, thanks for the encouragement!!Thanks, I will incorporate a neutral head position and adjust the bar position during me next deadlift set. Deadlifts was just an example. The point is to mix it up! Try new exercises whilst keeping the core (bench, OHP, squat etc.) exercises involved The calculator is an estimate anyway. You know what the best way to figure out your 1 rm is? Do a 1 rm.that wasnt a personal story.  it was a question, the answer to which would help me reach me personal goal.

Like to you do hamstring stretches in between squat sets?Me too, adding 10 lbs every 4 days (according to stronglifts) should get me to challenging weights in 2 weeks. The thing is, stretching is only a temporary relief.  Your back is tight for a reason.  Muscles restrict themselves as a protective measure.  There is something else in your biomechanics that is causing the issue that this stretch will not solve. 

Solve the underlying issue and you won't need to do the stretch.I think it depends on how serious your injuries are. I'm sure a trainer can help you out with some tennis elbow, but if your kneecap is not tracking properly, a physical therapist would be the place to go to get a set of exercises to supplement what you already do to help with the problem.

I would suggest trying to find a physical therapist that understands your goals. Some places are more suited for an older crowd making sure that they can accomplish basic function. Other places are better for athletes and people with lofty workout goals.It's what is in most fiber supplements. I get the store-brand equivalent of unsweetened Metamucil.

I've tried but I really hate taking pics of myself. You're right though, people i haven't seen in a while have commented the most. 

I know it's a slow process but I expected to be at this point six months from now! That being said, these changes to my diet and physical actovoty have become a life long goal for me now. It feels so good, why didn't I start sooner?This is actually just half moon pose from yoga but with a bandI pay $190 for Equinox and i can't even go to the nearest gym because its a sports version which requires me to upgrade to the $250/m plan.   I never have to wait for equipment is the nice thing, i couldn't deal with 24 hour fitness crowd and fighting over equipment.other than the bench press, no :/I've never been to a physio who told me I had to stop working out entirely.  Far from it, I've been given a raft of corrective exercises to do, some recommended every day.

Not all trainers have a physical therapy background, but there are many physical therapists who also have a training background (I go to a specific sports physio practice, and they've never steered me wrong).

Go to a trainer if you want form correction, but go to a physical therapist if you have an ongoing injury that may need corrective work to fix.Metamucil.Any internet resources you can recommend to get a stiff beginner started?

&gt;I am bodybuilding and a distance runner

And props to diversifying and not being a stereotypeThis thread is great, thanks for sharing!I agree with you coach. never look in the mirror when doing a big compound movement (squat, deadlift, Olympic lifts, etc.) you have enough to worry about. Videoing your lifts and looking back at them is much better.Ok! Hey can you suggest a diet plan for me? I am completely in the dark about 'eating healthy' and wanted to know what I should eat in a day. Yep, there's some 1000mg capsules on the market that comes with only 300mg of epa and dha combined, hence to get the recommended dose of 2-3g you would need to swallow at least 7 caps. Avoid theseWhere do you get psyllium husk?Really like the idea of trying to find someone who has the same history as myself. Thanks!Depending on my work schedule, but i'm the same, I prefer to be at the gym when there are less people so anytime between 6-9pm or work hours. 

I just like a calm atmosphere in the gym, where I can finish my sets on a machine without someone waiting.
So right now my heavy lifts like deadlifts (I've switched sumo and romanian because I have chicken legs) , squats, bench go something like this (squats as example): 5 x 95, 5 x 135, 5 x 155, 5 x 175, 5 x 185, 1 x 205, 1 x 215, 1 x 215, 1 x 225, 1 x 225, 1 x 215, 2 x 205, 7 x 135.
Trying to mix strength and hypertrophy. How does that look to you? (225 is my 1 rep max so far)This submission has been removed.

But i do believe adding cardio might help. Not sure
Still a noob tbh
Depends if you care if you experience effects sooner or not.  It's not necessary, but I always do it.  It's cheap as hell anyway.There's a number of core exercises that require you to extend your shoulders/arms, a few you named.  All with different purposes.  

If you're feeling only your shoulders and lower back being worked while doing the ab wheel you're doing it completely wrong.And he can't say he just has great genetics because he included pics of himself from before he started.

I'm not talking shit because he looks great but let's call it what it is and not kid each other.This. Don't just go to the gym and get on some machines, or do some combination of sets and reps that feel right or that a friend told you to do. Read the wiki on this subreddit, choose a beginner program that you feel comfortable with, and start counting calories and nutrient intake. You can't grow if your body doesn't get what it needs to build muscle. A lot of people neglect the eating part of working out, thinking that it's too much work or that it probably doesn't make that much of a difference. It really does. And think of it this way; if you're going to spend 6 hours a week in the gym, wouldn't you rather put in a little more effort outside of the gym as well to make sure you're actually seeing results?Umm... sorry for asking then :/ I guess you were born with all those knowledge, good for you, then!Sounds like "a load of bull," Only supplement that I would recommend relating to ATP is like /u/ssasnakebite mentioned, Creatine.Hey.  Any advice regarding this...?  I've been working out five to six  times per week for never less than an hour, lifting weights and doing cardio.  Due to depression and anxiety I haven't been eating much at all for the past two months.  Food made me want to barf. 
 I started working out around the time when I stopped eating regularly.  I've only lost 7 pounds in those two months,  from 195 to 187. Any advice is appreciated,  please and thank you.Right but that still doesn't explain why you would wanna put it on hold as opposed to starting it when you are backJogging doesn't build muscle, it builds endurance.  High volume of sprints, squats, deadlifts and other strength training exercises build muscle.  You should maintain the strength and speed aspects of your fitness.  Test your strength periodically without a lot of volume, correct it if you see a decline in strength.  Test your speed and correct if that declines.  Put most effort into jogging and longer distance running.   Notice that I use the word "maintain".  That is a much different word than "build".Take monohydrate.  Cheap, effective, readily available.  Yes it retains water but it's intramuscular not subcutaneous AKA it will just make your muscles look slightly bigger.  You probably won't even notice.lol best part was he said they were new books, not books he's readNo. It doesn't work like that unfortunately. You either gain fat and muscle or you lose fat and muscle depending on how many calories you consume. If you're trying to bulk then adding cardio will just make it so you have to eat more for your gains.Maybe it's just me but I feel like grip is the limiting factor for me on this exercise. I typically do overhead or tricep pushdowns with cables, but I've maxed the machine at my gym so I am experimenting with single arm stuff. Tried this last night and found my grip lacking at the bottom of the movement.&gt; Nike Football Combine
http://www.studentsports.com/football/nikecombines/Neuroplasticity?

I guarantee that if you ask anybody who's gone from a 300 pound max to a 700 pound max over time, they will say the lifts feel qualitatively different. I never started exploding blood vessels in my face until I could deadlift over 500.So this exercise is good for pain in the lower back. What part of the back? What causes it? How does this help? Just straight to the exercise without even knowing if it is the area you need help with.  
Good luck with that.I'm thinking about taking a multivitamin every day in addition to a protein shake to help get the right macros and micros in my diet. How do I figure out which one to take? I've never been vitamin shopping before. Post form video.

Just knowing and applying the basics of powerlifting bench press should easily give a beginner an additional 25~35 lbs. Leg drive, arched back, leverage, etc.If youre having lower back pain, foam roll your quads/hip flexors. 
I guarantee itll fix it.It can be taken whenever you want. You should have 3.5-5g everyday though. I like to use it pre-workout as the tingles give a sort of placebo effect like you can feel it working. On rest days I just have it whenever I have my creatine.Enter 5 reps for whatever weight.  That's the most reps you've actually done, so at least the calculator (which isn't going to be 100% correct necessarily) is based on real figures.

To get a more accurate picture, you would need to actually try for a one rep max, or a 2 or 3 rep max.  The lower the better.  Calculators get weird once you have too many reps.
  
Thanks for your detailed response! Squatting low with with good form will stretch the ligaments much faster than foam rolling, yoga or anything else. Popeyes sells Progressive products so yes they are going to recommend it.

There are a ton of similar multivitamin products out there.  Compare ingredients, pick the one with the best stats and the cheapest price (which won't be at Popeye's by the way, go to a pharmacy of grocery store).Hi! I used to be a front desk girl at LA, did you freeze your account? There shouldn't be any "forms" to freeze an account its an instant button we click so I'm a little confused why it wouldn't have been frozen right that second. Sometimes I know if you come in right after the billing date it will still bill the full amount for that month but after that it would be frozen for the 10/month. Have you spoken to the branch manager? If you get no where with the branch manager there are several managers above him/her. Is the pinching in front, kinda right in the crease?  If so, it might be impingement from the femur being pulled inwards into the side of the hip socket.

Have her drop into a squat, slowly, keeping her glutes as flexed and tight as she can for the descent, and see if it still feels as tight / hurts.  Or, have her drop into a squat position, and then flex/squeeze her glutes really hard, and see if the tightness eases.

If either or both of those help, it might be tight hip flexors OR poor glute activation (or likely, both).  When the glutes fire, the hip flexors will relax.  Also, the glutes attach at the side of the femur and pull it away from the center of the body - without this counteracting force, the hip flexors can pull the femer into the side of the hip and cause irritation.  

I fought this battle myself for a long time, after ignoring tightness, which became pain, which became a torn labrum.

See if engaging the glutes more helps.Luckily we're talking about the consumer using BBB, the OP isn't a business so it doesn't matter what BBB's relationship is with businesses. BBB is useful to consumers, I'd encourage OP to use them if needed. I've successfully used the BBB to get money back from a company that had told me they couldn't help me, but suddenly when the BBB gets involved they go out of their way to find the necessary paperwork that showed that they owed me money, and sent me a check.Find a trainer with your same goals or history.  When I wanted to trim down fat but build muscle I asked around until I found a trainer that had the same history as myself (out of shape skinny fat).  Once my physical therapist from a knee surgery I had told me I needed to not squat blah blah. I found one that understood and I got back to where I was and stronger than I was eventually. I'd rather have injuries and set backs lifting than I would die from being a lazy fat ass.  At least when lifting I get to die doing what makes me happy.  I'm still pretty new to all this, although I have been working out for about 6 months now. I have been taking no supplements. Everyone seems to be using protein powder, my only concern is that I will gain weight from it when my objective is mainly to get thin and fit. Should I be taking supplements? Which?fuck zanderMy initial observations would be that your bench and deadlift are both a bit behind your other lifts.

According to the ExRx.net Strength Standards, you should be above Intermediate level on Squat &amp; OHP.  May be slightly above Intermediate on Deadlift, and not quite to Intermediate yet on bench.

My bench stalls out all the time, while I progress on other lifts more regularly.  Don't get too discouraged.Everyone in this thread needs to read and understand this.  The industry will have you think otherwise because they want your money.  Your routine and diet contribute to 90+% of it.  Supplements are... supplements by definition.He's just big boned. Yes, I got it. And I also got it I spelled it wrong. English isn't my first language. Also I am on a diet and I didn't ask how to lose weight.I can't tell you what the issue is, but I think I can tell you that it's probably not (just) your wingspan. I've got a +3 ape index (6'5" with a 6'8" wingspan) and my bench press is 5x5x190 lbs, which is actually higher than my squat (I have weak legs - working on it). I'm not saying it's not harder with a larger wing span, because it is, but I don't think just that would account for the large difference in numbers that you're able to put up. By foam rolling your it bands/abductors. They both are hooked into your knee. In my case my it band is tight and it pulls my kneecap towards the outside of my knee. Very painful after a day of heavy squats. 

Also a lacrosse ball on your glutes/quads helps to loosen them up. All of those and the hams act on your knee. There is a lot of muscles pulling them. I like it. I sleep great when I have it although dreams can get pretty crazy sometimes.That's why people recommend filming yourself and reviewing/have someone else review it afterwardsI love you for this. Thank you. I mean you can always try doing cable curls and following the same drop set protocol.Idk about *blatantly* wrong, but I know there's a definite difference between my first and last set.

After 3x5 of 155 and 1x5 set of 160 on bench Saturday, I barely made my last set of 160, but I know if it had been the first set I could have at least gotten 160x8.

I don't use a 1RM calculator for any real use other than to see what strengthstandards thinks, but I think it's reasonable to believe that if you are struggling to get up the last set of 5 in 5x5, then that weight is probably about your 8RM.

Totally anecdotal though, so it could be completely different for others.I agree, even the highest level "manager" or whatever at the LA Fitness I used to go to had no power to do anything regarding membership that you can't do in your own home.  All they could do is fill out the forms and make requests, the same way you would through the website/phone number.I'd go for the second one. Plate loaded is much better than a stack IMO. Means you can at least alter the weight steps in smaller denominations if needed rather than restricted to the jumps that each stack plate adds. Been in CS in many a jobs, can confirm.change your diet and habits slowly. dont try to make radical changes that never works long term. obviously being active is important, but diet is much as important to how you look. id say for me avoiding sugary drinks was a good starting point. then trying to start your day off with a good filling breakfast and slowly change the rest of your diet over time This submission has been removed.

Also, I hate the way you write.

I think it's infantile to suggest, as the mod did, that roids do not produce a visibly different muscle formation, or that it was rude to ask in a sub so heavy with roid users. It does explain, however, how so many people in this sub are so angry and insistent about heavy lifting being the only or quickest or best way to a good physical form. Roids make you stupid and crazyDoes anyone take any natural supplements for heart health? I just recently freaked out my doctors with a 100BPM resting heart rate as a 5'6" 114 pound female with no previous conditions. I exercise and I feel like I'm going to stroke while doing cardio. I've cut out stimulants and quit smoking. I currently only take a multivitamin, fish oil, and Vitamin D. Improve your fitness and the quality of your diet and the paunch will take care of itself. 

Improving fitness means becoming stronger, faster and improving endurance.  The wiki has programs.

Improving diet means getting adequate protein and fats and matching carbs to activity.  It also means eliminating junk food and increasing nutritious foods.  In most cases this will cause a decrease in calorie intake as evident in weight loss. If not, you'll have to pay attention to this.

It's also important to get adequate sleep and manage your stress. It really depends on your situation. If you have chronic issues, then I would seek the help of a physical therapist or you regular doctor. It would probably be best to start with a trainer. I would explain your goals and go from there. Use your best judgement. If the guy has you balancing a 135lbs on you head while hurling medicine balls at you claiming it is the new thing to build your glutes, then I would move on. I know a couple of people that passed a test and claim to be trainers now. I dont recommend tgem. Usually you can tell the good trainers from the bad. If after seeing a good trainer and you still have issue talk to a physical therapist or your doctor, maybe there is another issue at hand. Protein, multivitamin, vitamin D, creatineNOW Foods do a good Vit K supplement I've used. Wherever you get it, you want Vit K2 and Vitamin D3, the other kinds are less effective. I'm not too sure on the specifics of fish oil.[If you read the FAQ, you should've read this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_fixing_your_diet). That's all you need for fat loss.

That said, you also might have poor posture. But having bad form isn't a good thing too.I could see that being true. 

I guess if you're not trying to break records and just working on your form it should be alright. Yeah I do this too. Particularly when I'm doing power cleans. That said, my power clean form still sucks, so I can't exactly vouch for this method.Middle of the night. No waiting. I feel like the gym is humid from people moisture when its crowded. yghEat less.

The FAQ applies to you also.Really? Typically in my case the most one RM calcs are at least 10 - 15lb lower than my max. This anecdotal but that has always been the case for me. 

Yeah. I mean she's one of my good friends but yeah.I think you've received a lot of good answers already. One thing I always notice is that the weight isn't very challenging for you (as you said). I would be interested to see your form when you are up to a more challenging weight, as that is when it will start to degrade. I'm 17 this year and just recently got my protein powder. Its 21grams per scoop and the salesperson advices me to take only half a scoop until I reach 18 years old. My parents was also there during that time and now they don't allow me to take more than half a scoop because they're afraid it'll be unhealthy to my body. Do i continue half a scoop or go a full scoop?Sounds like you're on the right track to get adrenal fatigue. Lay off the stimulants a bit!How many times a week have you been doing it? I know I am. I scrutinize things in my day job so it's in my nature to track down anomalies and outliers in the data. It makes it fun as well, in a weird science geek sort of way; mathematically calculating your weight loss progression based on daily calorie deficits and exercise expenditures.

Well, maybe not fun for everyone, but it gives my mind something to do.I hope you get it worked out. I used to work in a gym, not a chain. It was part if a sports complex and out policy on freezes like many other things was very lax. On paper there was a fee to freeze and only once per year but noone ever paid and froze multiple times a year. I remember seeing people have the same membership over a period of years. The only real way to make sure an account was frozen was a signed agreement that and only we had a copy. So if it was lost and you don't ask for one it may never have happened. Always get paper confirmation.Awesome. I'm currently taking an MV that gives me 800 IBU. Thanks for the info!He's referring to Fork Putdowns, an oft overlooked exercise considering its extremely high rate of success for weight loss goalsI wish my issue was that I couldn't eat enough. 

Just seems so easy to fix. 

Edit: damn you auto correctGenerally, with regards to contracts of all kinds, if it isn't in writing, it don't meant shit.It takes more than 2 weeks. Try doing it for 6 months [Here is the even more detail on what Nate Green did.](http://www.biggersmallerbigger.com/)

Aaaa! Hahahaha! Yeah, that's fair :DSearch for "inner thigh" on youtube and you'll see hundreds of "fitness professionals" telling you how to get slimmer inner thighs. That's how.

Fucking humanity am I right? It's a freak show."This easy thing isn't easy enough"

I don't understand that.Have you ever used BBB? I have as a consumer and they got the business to give my money back, when previously they acted like there was nothing they could do, so it can work for consumers. You don't pay a fee or risk anything by using BBB, I don't get the hate.Thanks man!She'll either say yes or no.

If she says, yes, yay! Date!

If she says no, it's not even really a loss. Just a continuation of your previous dateless state. So, technically, you have nothing to lose but everything to possibly gain. :)The tingling sensation is nothing to do with its effects on performance. You should be taking around 5g each day on both rest days and workout days. It doesn't matter if it's Pre-workout or any other time in the day. Most people take it alongside Creatine. Also, I probably wouldn't bother with using much supplements at 16. Get the basics sorted first.Thanks! I appreciate your words of encouragement!

I can't understand the LA Fitness business model, however... we ALL want gyms, we will gladly pay for them, but by doing this they are actively getting me, a PAYING customer to STOP paying.He doesn't mean lunches specifically. He means food. Can you elaborate on this? 

I stopped using pre workout when I was getting caffeine headaches. If was terrible to stop taking it for a couple days. (Might have been a bad product. No it wasn't jack3d)

All I drink right now is a crystal light energy pack and a ton of water while working out. Omg thank you for not including the sleeper stretch. 

Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GHIRD) is a topic of hot debate. Posterior capsule tightness and "tight" internal rotators are often the diagnosed case. It is often the case, however, that GHIRD arises from core instability / breathing dysfunction. 

Did an assessment on a friend and improved her glenohumeral internal rotation shoulder by ~20^o just by having her work on some anterior core stability with band assisted leg lowers. 

Top notch post, but I would recommend doing shoulder dislocations with a band while lying on your stomach. Reason being that it helps prevent compensatory movement from your ribs flaring (i.e., creating "unstable" and "false" ROM from disassociation of the rib cage from the pelvis). 

Also, tissue quality and ROM through extension/rotation throughout the t-spine is important for healthy rotator cuffs.This submission has been removed.

It was a dumb way of saying it that it sounded as though cardio doesn't help. People argue that even though you're using it to check your form, if you're using a mirror mid lift then you have some element of distraction. Distraction is never a good thing when you're lifting heavy weightsYour 5x5 max will be about 7.5% lower than your 1x5 max in my experience.This submission has been removed.

Enjoy!Its 2015. How do people still believe this stuff? Blows my mindOnly for squatsCheck out the FAQ over at /r/bodyweightfitnessOptimum Nutrition fish oil. Personally I find the mirrors very helpful. 

If they help you keep good form then i don't see how it would be an issue. Dude thanks for this. Looked up creatine and 50 servings 7 bucks.You WILL get your money back - 


Management WILL fight you, but they know their employees are motivated to take advantage of the members and keep the money rolling in. Behind the scenes they know they are in the wrong, and they will capitulate. Just keep the pressure on and keep escalating.


My Story - 

A couple years back I was in town for 3 weeks to sing a Christmas concert and work from my main branch. It was like $10 a day to work out, or I could sing up for a month and cancel and just pay the monthly rate of $20 for the one month. I coordinated with the person who enrolled me to cancel immediately and submit the letter, yada-yada. So I am canceled right away and only have the one month. That was what I was told.


18 months later my wife finally asks me about the LA Fitness charges. She had assumed I was just hitting up LA Fitnesses while I traveled for work, but it was now way past any significant travel. Surprise! I want's canceled. The membership notices were getting mixed up in my emails, etc. 


Took about 2 days to get them to refund 50% of the premiums I had paid. After all it was partially my fault for not noticing sooner.


You will get your money back.


OP shouldn't accept 50%. OP noticed right away and should get 100% back.I've had two shoulder surgeries: a bankart and a latarjet. Thankfully no rotator damage at allSummarizing some stuff 

Eggs (cheap, easy, versatile, very bioavailable protein)

Extra lean ground turkey (high protein, versatile)

Milk (vitamins, whey protein)

Greek Yogurt (probiotics, high protein, works well with protein powder or fruit, cheap)

Berries (natural sugars, antioxidants, mixes well with yogurt, smoothies)

Tilapia fish (super lean protein source, cheap, easy)

Boneless skinless chicken tenderloins (cheap, lean protein, cook them all at the same time)

Sweet potatoes (good carb source, long extended energy)

Salsa (great condiment, works well with many recipes like chicken or egg whites)

Peanut butter (lots of healthy fats)

Brown rice (extended energy)

Black beans (goes well with stuff like rice, meats, good source of fiber)

Garbanzo beans (goes well with salads, good source of fiber)

Coffee (wakes you up, natural thermogenic, helps burn some calories)

Green tea (little lower in caffeine, also a thermogenic, lots of good antioxidants)

Old fashioned oats (energy, makes a good oatmeal)

Stevia in the raw (good replacement for sugar)

Tuna (lean proteins, cheap, but be careful of sodium)

Broccoli (high fiber)

Non-stick cooking spray (essential for cooking stuff)

Cooking stuff all at once helps ensure you always have stuff available so you don't risk running to the convenience store for snacks.Dunno about that specific one, but you should to research to find a max weight for any bench before you get it. And don't forget to include your body weight. 

My incline bench is good for 375 pounds. That sounds like a lot, until; you add in my weight 200 and benching 250+.  I have it braces with 4x4s and I lift inside a rack with safety bars. 

It's rare, but people have died from dropping the weight on their chest.There is indeed one in therePersonally I prefer just filming the set and then review after.OK, and the next step? What to do to build muscle? Just general workout? Swimming? Or I have to hit the gym and use some crazy machines which are mystery to me? :PIts a video he posted for getting a certain number of subs. Its crazyhttp://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/04/25/do-a-pull-up/Protein powder, multivitamin, fish oil, maybe creatineWhat's your point? This doesn't prove he is underweight. All it suggests is that if OP puts on 40 pounds of lean muscle he'll be an outlier on the BMI chart. He's a very long way from that. I stand by my original statement. OP is at a healthy weight and the statement that "his body wants him to be at 210" is misleading at best.Prefer a mirror for squat, deadlift, and press.

Will go without though with no problem.You shouldn't use a mirror when you are in the middle of a lift. 1) Watch videos. Instructional videos are good and also just people doing big squats. Note their form, cues suggested, etc.

2) Film yourself. Compare your form to those from step 1. Try to identify your errors and how you can adjust them.

3) Stretch. Stretch. Stretch. You probably have some mobility issues.

4)...

5) Profit!OK. Thanks!So not the ratio of EPA to DHA, but the ratio of fish oil to each of those?I know exactly what you went through. I also did a trial for their personal training &amp; went maybe 3 times &amp; they told me that I had 21 days to finalize if I wanted to do PT for a year long contract. Day 13, I called saying I would like to cancel my personal training contract, they gave me an "okay, I'll do that for you" and hung up. 
Monthly billing came a week later &amp; I'm charged for personal training. I went to the gym itself &amp; asked them why I was billed. They told me that I had signed up for a year long contract, but since I was only going a certain number of days, I only had 14 days to cancel. I told them I was told I had 21 days to cancel. They show me the contract I signed. I was fucking lied to. 
So what I did, I tried to go to the gym to try to talk to the person that signed me up for the sessions. He kept avoiding me. So I filed a complaint to BBB and contacted their district manager. She called back telling me about the complaint from BBB &amp; reduced my termination fee to 1/4 of what I would've paid for a year. 
It's good enough when I just want to be done with the company. It's a three minute video dude...I think you've .gif'd your brain to death. :POh right, so I'll just keep it up and be patient :)It's really interesting the gyms in China are basically exactly the same as they are here in America. A bunch of lazy people and creeps taking creepshots.Dude don't put your creatine in Orange juice - the acidity will degrade that shizz so fastFrom Candito..?  Ill have to look it up.30/F/5'7' 

I went from 265-215 then did I did a powerlifting program combined with bodybuilding days for about a year, went down to 191. From September to Dec of 2014, I went down to 150 (41 pounds in 4 months) by doing a protein fast and I lost barely any muscle. My lifts stayed the same, I even went up in bench and did 135 for about 3 reps where before it was my 1RM. I went from 40+% bf to 26% BF. I ate nothing much but lean protein -160g of it a day or more - 800 cals for 4 months. I took an EC stack, kept my programming the same. I lifted with the same intensity and almost the same volume on most days. Accessories maybe went form 4x12 to 3x8-10, but other than that, I kept my workouts constant. I carb loaded every 10 days as well when I got down in bodyfat. I also continued IF during this process.

It's all about how you approach your weight loss. Following a combination of Lyle McDonald's research, Leangains protocols and Layne Norton/Alan Aragorn's advice as a whole along with supplementation of vitamins and minerals made my aggressive cut quite muscle sparring.His looks like a 4" ABS pipe at about a 5ft length..  Lowes and depot sells them for about $10.OK. But why less lunches?

http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view&amp;alt=web&amp;id=111137015311 

It looks a bit flimsy is all I am worried about.Yep!Form is fine:

* Straight back, good hip position, decent speed

Technique is bad: Listed in order of importance

**Shoulders are over the bar:**

* Bad leverage. You can't utilize your weight to sit back and push off the floor. If leverage is utilized correctly, your weight can be deducted from the bar (I.e. you weigh 100lbs and you're pulling 225. With proper leverage technique, you're only *really* pulling 125lbs)

**Pulling slack from the bar:**

* Correlated to your first problem, when you sit back you can pull the slack from the bar making the lift much easier. Failing to do so results in a 1-2, stop and go, pull off the ground instead of a smooth single pull. 

**Speed:**

* Something you should consistently work on with your form. Every single pull should be the fastest from off-the-ground to lockout. This doesn't mean rushing. Speed is only concerning when you are pulling, not your set up.

**Head position:**

* This is more of personal preference, but you should experiment with a neutral head (looking diagonally down instead of straight ahead). Might take some strain off your neck.

Other thoughts: Seems like you're bracing your back quite well. You always want to maintain tightness in all 3 lifts. Continue to do that and fix your technique and you'll become a stronger puller.

Edit:

**Future Problems:**

The way you lift right now is okay since, as you've said, the weight is light. The heavier you go, the more your back will have to compensate. Your legs will drive too quickly practically depending solely on your lower back. 

Don't get too scared, everyone has bad technique/form in the beginning. Learn from your errors and constantly analyze your form. The more conscious thought you put into it, the better (more refined) it will become. There is a difference between fundamentals and preferences. You still need to build the base of your deadlift. Once you know what you're doing, you can begin to tweak and try new things.

Study, practice, study, practice, study, practice...
Thanks! See, that's why I asked here :) Because in shitty ladies magazine there is tones of workouts for losing fat from every body part, including fat behind ears... :PIt sounds like you don't want to just want to make them slimmer, it sounds like you're also looking to build muscle.

The first step is to eat less to make them slimmer.

Fat reduction cannot be targeted. After I put my powder in the shaker, I add half the amount of water I need and shake it, I then add the rest and shake again.

That seems to do the job for me, I was having the same problem as you with a protein powder recently but using the above method has fixed it.As someone who lifted weights for 12 years and has worked as a mover for an additional 7 after that, I can say that you need to take care of yourself. My right shoulder feels like it is full of broken glass when I move it, not so much a sharp pain but a crunching, like there is a bag of marbles in there. Lifting my arm above shoulder height will induce pain. Not a good feeling. The 100 nuggets/100,000 lbs of squats video might be the most impressive weightlifting task I've ever seenTo clarify: You want to blindly replicate a movement with no explanation?Lower cals 500 below your TDEE and lift hard. Also, Blaha says to rest for 3 mins for the main lifts, about 2 for accesories. 30 secs is fine at the beggining, but make sure to up the rest time as you progress! I assume this is his ICF 5x5 (Ice Cream Fitness). Other than that keep focused and ENJOY the progress, cause trust me, youll see it soon enough! And yes, the workout will minimize muscle loss and give you a solid base once you lean down (Id say thats beneficial).
Cheers!So its basicly [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1iy610/dont_be_this_asshole_xpost_from_rrage/)? When did this become ok?&gt;EVERYONE wants to be juicy.

-SteroidBob&gt;I eat over recommended calorie levels every day

Eat moar

Treat eating like a job.

First eat. The eat some more. And when you're done, eat.I had this problem when I started working out. I was 20 at the time (25 now) and I weighed 118 lbs. (5' 9" Male) I could barely lift any weight at all and was always embarrassed. I would even get so intimidated that I would cut my workout short because there were just too many ripped dudes that day. One day I got fed up and decided that reaching my goal and getting into shape was far more important to me than worrying about what everyone at the gym thought of me. So I put in my headphones, never made eye contact with anyone, and just pretended I was the only one in the gym. If I screwed up or did something stupid, so what? These people don't know me and chances are I won't ever see them outside of the gym. One time I busted a loud fart while I was doing cable crunches. I know everyone heard it. Who gives a shit it's just protein! Turned up my headphones and just pretended it never happened. 

**TLDR** Stick with it. Once you get over the mental part and just realize what is most important to you then before you know it you will be one of those people that the newbies are intimidated by. Because I'm subscribed to some fitness accounts on YouTube, all during January I kept getting unskippable ads from Chang and some other dude dressed like a 300 Spartan (both promising to give me a 6-pack without having to work) whenever I watched YouTube on my phone. It was horrible.Keep a log to track your exercises, weights, sets and reps.

Get a beginner routine from the wiki

Get off the machines and start using barbells and dumbbells (depending on the program you choose).

Any decent beginner program is going to have big compound lifts as is core: squat, bench press, dead lift, overhead press, rows, chin ups

Discipline is the key - make it part of your lifestyle, something you HAVE to do, not something you SHOULD do. OK. Thanks! So I guess I should just do what I do - swimming and general workout - and just wait till I drop enough weight that my thighs get slimmer? &gt;Bone spurs from arthritis(?) had cut the muscle until it tore.   

thaaaat sounds like fun!  fuckin ouch, manI just started taking GNC brand creatine in pill form in 3.5mg servings. When's the best time to pop them for lifting sessions. Half hour before? Right afterwards? Directions just say before or after.I don't work out on my legs. I just focus on chest, arms, abs, and I jog for 30 minutes. Is it the jogging that creates the large muscles?Only way is to lose weight overall, you can't spot reduce and the body decides what fat comes off first or last.I love you man, no homo. this is what I needed. thanks.Many thanks!Yes, I do that (should probably be more specific in my post), but I'm losing fat mostly from my stomach. Working out with kettlebell has made my arms look much better and I hoped I can achieve the same effect for my thighs...Incline bench builds your upper chest flat bench builds your lower you need to do both. Well you don't need to flat will do both upper and lower just more of the lower I believe and a little bit of upper. Do both though it's just a better way to build your chest You cannotWhat would you guys consider to be the "essential" supplements.1RM calculators are a bit optimistic in general.Burns more than fat.Holy shit, stretching to the side?! **GAME CHANGER**I liked yoga but it was too much of a bother for me to do, so now I just stretch in between every exercise. Pair up a stretch with every different exercise you do and do a good 20-30s each side or 60s if it's bilateral and there is your rest in between each set. Feels amazing. The gym is as much about stretching as it is about lifting for me now. I used to barely be able to touch my shins but now I can get to the floor.Creatine builds up in your system. It doesn't matter when you take it.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis

Tldr: no easy way to accurately measure body fat. Use mirror and scale to measure progress. Lift heavy, eat protein, cut reasonably and you'll minimize muscle loss.Enter whatever reps you did. It may be ever so slightly off, but not enough to matter. There is more inaccuracy from the estimation formula itself.And it's usually the same assholes that call what they're going to show you a miracle.It's definitely fat! I cut calories and I'm losing weight. I just thought I can do something more for my inner thighs in particular.
And I'm not aiming in thigh gap :) I just want this part of my body to be less flabby and soft. wikipedia defintion:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_exercise

old article that focuses on its definition:

http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kelly22.htm

Aside from that, I've seen isometric holds in a lot of different programs while browsing around bodybuilding.com. Isometrics are more common in calisthenics programs than standard gym programs. It was a debit card that I could not check from India - they mistakenly put a hold on my internet account. (Plus, I was getting married, so things were pretty chaotic). 

Also, where I'm at the gyms are not all that cheap - I don't drive, either. 

Though now we are trying to coordinate our lifestyles a little better and go a little further afield.There's a scooper in there somewhere. Put the cap on, shake, open cap, look. repeat until you find scoopI'm 5'10 male and weigh 160 pounds. I don't think I'm too fat for the jeans. I just have large thighs.What about an adjustable bench for both, as well as seated shoulder presses or some such?I do that. But I don't know if it's working, seems pretty easy. I use kettlebell when I lay on my back and on my stomach (as I can put my foot inside the handle). With some additional weight it works better, but I can't do it with kettlebell while on my side. Do you think I should buy some weight that you can wrap around your ankles or wrists for the suggested exercise? Or just do it without any load, just making more repetition?Consider that proper squat form includes getting up from the bottom of the squat. To improve the movement, think of the muscle group working like a rubber band. Once you hit the bottom, "spring" up. It will be more beneficial to improve your core strength and technique if you add "duck walks" to your routine along with proper stretching, rather than sitting at the bottom for an extended period of time. Especially, if you are sitting at the bottom with a weighted bar.  There is nothing wrong with sitting at the bottom for an extended period of time without weights, but consider what the functional purpose of that would be in terms of developing your strength and flexibility. For general purposes, I do not see the benefit.I go with the roller too. It hurts more than before if I use the lacrosse ball. Step 1: chop off leg at knee

Step 2: get in this position

Step 3: ????

Step 4: Yoga!Those muscles are your quads.  Leg press is a machine that will help.  If you want to try free weights, front squats will target your quads. Best if you work up to doing high volume, medium intensity. That's awesome. I'm calling my belly muscular fat from now on.Don't worry about it. Body Fat analyzers (especially the one you posted below) are not accurate to 1%. 

The takeaway: you are making great progress.  Keep it up.But he's also resting between each set. The calculators are looking for what is the maximum number of consecutive reps you can do with a given weight. If he's not lifting well below his potential, his work set weights should be right at this point. 

If I'm blatantly wrong, though, someone please correct me.Are your plates bumper? It's possible that he was trying to do "deficit" deadlifts by using smaller plates instead of standing on a platform. 

Still an asshole obvsI don't work out on my legs. I usually go for  30 min jogs. Will stopping this reduce their size?&gt;I eat over recommended calorie levels every day. 

And what are these recommended calorie levels you're referring to?

Because guess what the answer is going to be: eat more.With a slew of gyms costing 25 and under a month, why would anyone pay $50. And do you not check your credit card statements?I feel like yoga doesn't have that appeal of using gym equipment, like in OPs video.  There's some kind of built-in feeling that you're accomplishing something, if you use a tool vs. if you're just using your body. You should check out the [wiki](https://i.imgur.com/NFUMcah.png).&gt; I started gear with around a 1200 total. Looking back, I coulda gone much further as a natural. Strength wasn't my only goal though, so I don't regret it.

This is exactly the crossroads I'm at right now. 1200 total, I know I could be *stronger* but strength isn't my goal at all. I'm just scared shitless of "what if I got caught".&gt; pain in the ass.

heh, heh, literally and figuratively, IT HURTS SO GOOD! Does anyone else tear up when doing this?I googled muscular fat, to see if I could find something, and I came up with absolutely nothingEat and lift. If you are eating and not gaining then you are NOT eating enough. It is NOT rocket science.

Read the FAQ.

Also, I call bullshit on the "I dont want to be ripped". EVERYONE wants to be juicy.I'm doing it. That's the main aim, but I thought I can do something more just to help my thighs get slimmer.Wiki?

FAQ at /r/gainit.You should maintain exercising your legs just to maintain your fitness.  Focus on endurance training instead of strength and size.  Strength train your upperbody and that may even your body out visually.  Losing fat will make the most difference in reducing size.

He just did a video on paused squats.....with like 525lb, or some ungodly amount of weight, kids a beast.This might sound weird, but the thing that did the trick for me when i was having som srs pain in my hip, was my stance when i squatted. Make her jump off a box/bench/ something that has some height and see how wide her stance is when she lands. Use that stance for squatting! I was squatting to wide, now i do a narrow squat with low bar, and my hip problem is soooo much better :) also did 5x5, good luck!

No difference.I make it a point to warm up and stretch my rotator cuffs before I do any lifts (besides legs of course).

They the Nasdaq or Bitcoin or wot?Often times gyms like this try to charge you an initial fee for a new membership. It's usually really expensive. Anybody that actually pays it is a chump though. My membership was like $35/month for LA Fitness and they wanted a $150 initial fee. I told them there was no way I was paying that and started walking out, and they eliminated the fee.

Thanks manCongrats, and be careful, as soon as you are happy where you are is when you lose the battle and start going back up. 

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_HAXan1wSQ)That question is way too subjective and has been asked [384 times before] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=best+protein+powder&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).  

That being said, ON is probably the most recommended brand in this sub. Right after work (4-5pm, typically). On crossfit days I bring clothes to work with me and change at the office. It's a lot harder to talk yourself out of going when you're driving in your gym clothes. I literally drive past my gym on my way home so... not going when I'm dressed for it is pretty much inexcusable. :)

On running days, I change right when I get home and get it done. I pretty much have to in the winter, because it gets dark so early and while I love running at night, there aren't sidewalks on a lot of the streets in my neighborhood and people... well, people don't always pay attention when they're behind the wheel. On weekends, I run around 2-3 in the afternoon after brunch has digested.

When I used to go to an Anytime Fitness I always went around 8-9pm because nobody else was there.

I've tried the morning workout thing, but I am just not myself that early in the morning. I hate it. I feel like I perform better in the afternoon.I went home last year for various reasons. So, I of course cancelled my membership. I wanted to get a lower rate anyway and I wasn't going much. I then received a call from from a sales rep asking me to come back. I told him I wasn't in town and would consider it when I get back. I get back and talk to the same rep and ask about pricing and he quoted me a reasonable price so I told him I would be in as soon I get paid. I went in and talked to him. It was off from the start. I had talked to him at least three times before I got back home but he acted he didn't know me. He proceeded to quote me a higher rate than previously on the phone. I was irritated and left. Fast forward a couple months later to Black Friday. I got a call over the phone from another sales rep and she informed me that I could get a deal if I come in that day. I was already around the area so I stopped in a hour after. I asked for the rep but she was at lunch. So, I talked to someone else that gave me a much higher rate and seem to know nothing about that promotion. I was again upset and left. I wrote a email and called to explain this situation but they only said sorry and justified this by saying that their prices change all the time. I finally get a email a few months that was lower without a initiation fees. If it is muscle, stop exercising and they'll atrophy.

If it is fat, lose weight. (Can't spot reduce).

Can you tell us more as I can't use youtube at the moment.Whatever tastes good to you. Most of your protein should come from your diet. Chicken, beef etc, and if you don't eat enough to meet your daily goal then drink a shake.You cannot make your inner thighs slimmer by just exercising your inner thighs.  You cannot "spot reduce" fat.

If you want your thighs slimmer, you need to cut fat and your calorie intake is the first place to start.  Check out the Wiki (TDEE section)Cold Turkey is always the best way.  I can convince myself to eat anything.  I can't convince myself to buy that thing.Thanks bud! I made the change!Good for you!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTq87JB3YFM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su8g9efk5McYes! Err on the side of caution, get things in Writing, confirmation in e-mail. Don't be a thesuninmyheart! :-/Thanks for the critique, I'll work on it! I got a free container of BCAA powder when I had a big order somewhere, so I gave them a shot.  It was just BCAA, no flavor enhancers or anything.  Tastes like shit (which is to be expected).  I used them before, during, and after workouts.  Saw no difference in anything so I never ordered any.  Some people swear by them, for me they were useless.Three main:

* Fork and spoon put downs
* Plate push-aways
* Stand up walkaways from the tableMuscle and fat are 2 different things. "Muscular fat" isn't. You're likely just too fat for that pair of pants.

You can't choose where to loose fat. You've just got to burn more calories than you take in and your body will burn fat from where it wants to.

You really need to read the wiki. Look for TDEE and eating at a deficit. Everything you need is in the wiki.Thighgap?

No offense, but it is either muscle or fat. You lose muscle by not exercising it and lose fat by cutting calories.

Exercises do not make muscles smaller. 
You'd be surprised at how much weight you lose by NOT drinking soda. I avoid that shit like the plague.What I do is lay on my side with one leg crossed over in the direction im facing and lift the leg on the bottom up about 8in and lower it in 20 rep sets on each side.Gotcha.  Apologies for the confusion.Weight is always relative. Imo body fat percentage is what you should look at.They *tried* to screw me over with magic algebra, i.e. misleading price calculations, when I was considering signing up. I walked out and never came back after that.Yeah I agree, I think I'll stick to eating and using whey to bump up my protein intake.1. can't spot reduce fat. You need to lose fat in general and it'll come off from everywhere.

2. What the fuck is muscular fat?

3. You'd have to not use your legs in order to reduce the muscles on them.This right here! I applied for life insurance and was asked my BMI. I have a little extra fat, by no means obese. But because I have lifted for 4 years and been athletic since high school my BMI is 31.5. Had to get an exclusion so they would except body fat percent instead of BMI.XanaxEat lessCurrently a member ,but I surely know I will need to cancel their membership sometime in future.So looking at the comments here, whenever I decide to that ,will send the form via registered Usps post so that there is a record of delivery Yeah... that whole work thing really interferes with my free time.try a 7 rep max for your 5x5Nope. All you can do is eat less and keep exercising. I guess we were lucky, it was never an issue to get him on the hill. We started ours at 3 yrs old in lessons for 60 or 90 minutes (can't remember) then there was an on-site daycare where he got a break to play and color for another hour. We would have lunch or snack ski a few runs together and that was a day. By 5 he was in a full day (9-3) lesson and by 7 in a full day race program. Now at 17 he races full time.

We have to opposite problem to you. With so many days of going to the hill for training and races we are glad to get away from it for a while.But he is not just doing 1x5I got a botched tonsillectomy which resulted in a second surgery which made drinking soda pretty painful for a few months. By the time I could drink it again, I just didn't crave it anymore, so I cut it out. :D To make your inner thighs slimmer, you have to lose weight/fatWorst case, you poop yourself. But that likely won't happen until 2-3, if ever.

Otherwise, it shouldn't have a significant effect on you.Did you burn calories: YES

Was this an effective workout: YES

As a man who was 320 lbs, feel free to message me any questions, but I'll leave a few tips.

1. Replace all drinks that contain calories in them with Water. To make things simple, drink ONLY water, black coffee (slash of milk if you REALLY can't do it), and green tea.
2. Check out / subscribe to /r/loseit
3. ANY workout is better than none.
4. Getting plenty of sleep (shoot for nine hours initially) and good diet is 70% of the battle and lays the foundation to a healthy lifestyle.
5. Set BEHAVIORAL GOALS over Objectionable Goals. Example: The goal "Go to the gym three times a week for thirty minutes for a year," is an GREAT GOAL. "I want to lose 50 pounds in a year," is a TERRIBLE GOAL. While 50 lbs in a year is obtainable, it's an objectionable goal, and you'll find much more success and fulfillment with BEHAVIORAL GOALS! i'm not sure, but it feels like you're overthinking it- just keep your protein levels up, keep lifting, and keep your calories down, and continue the grind.Thanks a lot for our the comments and replies. the reason I cannot accommodate it is because of what FrankRawL wrote. It is very difficult for me to get or schedule at airports or during clients visits. the only way to do will be if when I visit a client, I will completely skip breakfast instead of eating it at 11 AM. However, it is difficult to training a group of people with an empty stomach (9am to 5pm)&gt; I do squats and bends and lunches 

Less lunches.  You can't spot reduce fat on just your inner thighs.Blender?Spot reduction is a myth, unfortunately. Exercising your inner thighs will not make them slimmer.Looks like I'm wrong then. I only see the stuff from tnation posted here or r/weightroom so I guess I just see the guest writers. 

That's what I get for making assumptions. Regardless, OP don't do this programGood shit... thanksKeep going dude! My goal this year was to drop to a low enough bodyfat where the abs are more evident and defined. Right now im at around 14-15% and i have never felt better.Your 5 rep max is slightly higher than your 5x5 working weightFrom my experience some protein powders dissolve well and others don't want to as much or will even make clumps after being dissolved. I'd find a better protein powder and until you do use a blender and chug it fast.I'm not going to talk out of my ass here because I am not a SME on fish oil. Your best bet is to do some google searches. Just be wary of things that said "1000mg of fish oil!!!!" and have like 100mg of EPA and DHA combined. I think what I have is NOW Fish Oil- it was reasonably priced and had good specs in terms of mercury and EPA and DHA. There are better brands if you want to spend more. Ahh, that's the problem - I don't go to gym, I only exercise at home.Accrued injury. Torn rotator cuff (tendon pulled completely off the humerus) and torn capsule (primarily the GH ligaments). I knew about the rotator but my surgeon told me I blew out the capsule at my post surgery follow up. The rotator was the accrued injury with the capsule being torn due to a shoulder dislocation which thinking back I know exactly when and how it happened. I never knew I dislocated it and played two more rugby matches to finish my season before finishing tearing the rotator while lifting in the off season.You...work...in...Aspen...........

I think Arnold Dumbbell Press also works out rotator cuffs, but I'm not positive. You can only use it once though.the 5 rep calculation will be a little low. Most calculators I've seen only go up to about 12 reps, but even if you could do 25, the result would be way high. You could do AMRAP, or wait until you progress to a point where you can only get one set of 5.I came here to ask this.. Hoping for an answer. Shoulders pop every single rep and sometimes i get a little cringy toward the end of my setshttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index

Under limitations:

BMI is particularly inaccurate for people who are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 1015% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number.

I also do volume squats on the TRX ropes [like this](http://www.chicagonow.com/get-fit-chicago/files/2012/11/TRX_WorkoutLanding.jpeg) and really work on getting ass to grass on each squat. Doing pause squats like this has made a world of difference in my hip mobility. Just put your working set. You're doing a weight for 5 reps. That's what it's going to use to calculate your 1RM.Uhh for the amount I bought (I forget the exact amounts) I spent 60, which included a scale and did not include the propel mix. I started using it right around Christmas and have been using it 3-5 times per week and still have plenty of creatine and bcaa'a.  Getting low on ALCAR, citrulline malate, and beta alanine though.

Edit: Because I don't want to make outrageous claims without backing them up: [Source 1](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/03/fatty-and-sugary-food-as-addictive-as-cocaine-and-nicotine_n_1073513.html) and [Source 2](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000698)This is probably a stupid question but that's what these threads are for, right?  Anyway, I bought 5 lbs of the ON Gold Standard whey and it says the serving size is "one rounded scoop".  My jug didn't come with a scooper or anything, so is this just supposed to mean a spoonful or what?the second it happens next time you must chant the magic words: SHOO SHOO GAINZ GOBLIN! and suddenly he will recoil in terror at the gainz you were meant to receiveOh most definitely!For me, the recovery time from taking BCAAs and not were practically miles apart. Same exact diet, on the same routine, and I had run out of BCAAs. 

Let me tell you, the intensity of your workouts will increase on a noticeable level. For that one week I was without BCAAs, the soreness per muscle group lasted for two days, three with legs. You bet your ass I went back to grab another batch after legs, because it was evident that either A: I would have to tone is down, or B: Buy the fucking BCAAs to keep going. Didn't help that I was on a protein that used ion-exchange so I had minimal AAs anyway.

Try it out man. I've tried ON BCAAs which is absolutely wonderful.Thanks for the advice! I do have a MyFitnessPal app, but have been neglecting it. I will start back up, I'm determined this time.I said this yesterday and I want to say it again. Lifting shoes are awesome and they will help you with this problem. 

If you don't want shoes, there is some great stuff on youtube about how to work on keeping your back straight including squatting down with a weight held out in front of you. The weight acts as a counter to your balance and center of gravity. The more you practice with it, the closer to your chest you can bring it, and eventually you wont need it.

I don't really agree regarding the leg presses- these will build strength but will not help your stability lower in the squat or your ROM at all. The best diet is the one you stick with and IF is nothing but a tool to assist your diet - so don't let it wreck your intake if you cannot support it. 

That being said - why aren't you able to do IF on the road? I'm a consultant and fly Monday mornings, return Friday or Thursday Evenings. I skip breakfast and eat 30ish% of my calories at lunch. Then after work I take my super lame rental car to a gym I googled and contacted to ask about daily/weekly memberships ahead of time,  work out and then destroy food after. On days I travel home, I know I probably cannot accomodate this eating schedule so I just push my eating window earlier in the day before I drive to the airport.This happened to me... Have never had my shoulders in such agonizing pain for so long. I quit crossfit, all is good with the shoulders now. It's just not for some people Cannot have wireless transmission capability of any kind whatsoever, to include Bluetooth, wifi, cellular, and any other kind of wireless communication technology. Why does this weekly thread exist if it's just a mix of people either talking out of their asses, saying "Creatine bro," or linking to Examine.com every single week? Why not just a part in the Wiki and a sticky directing people with supplement questions there? Any remaining questions would easily fit into Monday, Tuesday, or Friday's threads. 

Not a mention a sticky directing to resources might prevent a lot of "I bought XYZ supplement and have been taking it for a month now. Can anyone tell me what it is and what it does?"Thank you for taking my comment in stride. I realise it could have been taken as a "well, what did you expect, you got what you deserved!" which is not what I was meaning to communicate!

I'm sure things will be resolved soon (maybe, haha) and I admit its a shame that we need to distrust businesses and engage in such skeptical thinking. Jym supplements yes or no? 
This time last year I was hovering at 200lbs and 18-20% body fat now I'm hovering at 250 with 33-35% body fat. Ive been running almost daily and lifting a couple times a week for a few months now but haven't seen the progress I want. A friend suggested looking at Jym but I lost my faith in supplements after being with a supplement MLM for over 2 years and seeing how shady they can be.No wireless as in wifi or wireless as in cell phone?  

If cell phone you're right.  If wifi, it doesn't matter.  You can use Bluetooth.  I'm thinking it may even work with iPads and iPods non-cell equipped.  I can't see why not.Definitely second the hatha. I used to go to a class twice a week at my gym, but stopped since I got a new job and the time didn't work for me anymore. Just found out that it starts an hour earlier now, and I can't wait to get back at it!

[Cat and Cow](http://www.creativesoulinmotion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cat-and-cow-pose-for-digestion.jpg) is my favorite lower back stretch from my yoga class. Start out on hands and knees with a neutral spine, arch spine up, then drop it down. Feels soooo gooooddddd!No! Hindsight....AAAH!I use sauna pretty frequently post workout, and have been doing it for years. I usually sit there for about 10 minutes, and hit an ice cold shower afterwards. I believe it to be beneficial for a great number of things (no source, only experience):

- better skin, getting rid of pimples.
- I tend to freeze a lot less in the winter.
- reduced joint pain and soreness
- helps make my body relax and generates better bloodflow. Around 4-5pm. It's after work. Then I can go home and eat dinner with a tasty protein shake while I raid in WoW.It's terrible when language devolves. - FTFY

DipsSo so so true! I am usually pretty vigilant with these issues - make sure I'm all good with credit cards, banks, cell phone accounts (I got a Cingular person to give me the unlock code to a then-latest iPhone when I traveled to Southeast Asia before the contract was up, because I was promised that), but this... I disappoint myself. 

In my defense (my feeble feeble defense), this was my first corporate gym experience and THREE people told me I was good (they "called corporate" or something).

I work out 4 or 5 times a week, normally take the weekends off.Lol, probably should just find a new gymNah I'm just maintaining my weight 

I've used the calculators that's how I know it takes around 3000-4000 to maintain my current weight. 
Inwas mainly just enquiring on what other people think of omni mx range I just had reattachment surgery for my left shoulder supraspinatus muscle [MRI image here]( http://imgur.com/Brq6X1m). Bone spurs from arthritis(?) had cut the muscle until it tore. They also did a [subacromial decompression](http://www.sports-injury-info.com/subacromial-decompression.html). Started PT this morning. Just ROM movement for 6weeks. (49/m). Hey man, congrats to you and glad to hear the progress is still rolling! Everything is one step at a time, like a brick to a house. You'll be reminded the most of those who haven't seen you in so long. Your best bet to stay reminded is maybe take a bi-monthly progress pic to see the changes for yourself. I'd highly recommend climbing.  It's super fun and an awesome workout.

Good luck with the new baby!I take 5g of Cellucor Creatine with breakfast in the morning and then I go to work and have ~12oz of coffee. Does the caffeine affect how long the creatine stays in my system?

Consider squatting using low bar technique (as SL suggests), and going just below parallel, rather than trying to go ass to grass. I'm not particularly flexible in the hamstrings, but I can rep 315 barefoot and hit depth. I've found that the angles are better for less flexible people.Roughly what is the cost for a months supply doing it the way you do?Right after work - my gym is on campus, and its a 20 minute drive home.Long story short, been to a few Popeye's supplement stores and I've been asking around for which multi they recommend. I'm currently taking Orange Triad, and I've been to 3+ stores and they all refer to Progressive Active men.

Anyone know more about this brand and if their Active Men Multi is recommended?

(Would be interested to hear from any past employees to know if there's a particular reason why the product/brand is pushed so hard. Especially since on popeye's top supplements of 2014 page, where "Progressive" fits into a category, it will most likely be the highest rated product in that category.)I love this topic! Diet Coke is different from many diet sodas in that it isn't supposed to be like the full sugar name sake, it's a completely different flavor.

Flavor in general is interesting. Most people think they are true flavor experts, but that gets proven wrong all the time with blind taste tests. So much of perceived flavor is based on other things: smell and sight, of course, but also the environment you're in, what else you've eaten or are eating at the same time, what nutrients your body needs or doesn't need, your own body's minor allergies and uniqueness, and a TON of placebo effect.

It's hard to evaluate soda sweetness fairly, because artificial sweeteners aren't exactly the same as sugar. If anything, I'd say Diet Coke has a sweeter taste than regular Coke, closer to regular Pepsi. Most people who complain about Diet Coke not being sweet-tasting are feeling their own placebo effect from the diet name, or noticing the different taste and assuming it's less sweet.Just load. Its cheap and easy and has no condIt's actually a widely accepted method of training.  It's called a Pause Squat and many people use them if they are weak "getting out of the hole" (which is just a term for pushing back up when you're at the bottom of the squat).When I froze my account at LA I got an email confirming it. You never got that?Up to a certain point, I clearly stated that above. 

The game is less about power and more about control. 

If you think power is so important then why are professional bowlers not ripped? Why are they all just in moderate to bad shape?Overall, looks solid.  Your back remains consistent through the lift, hip movement is smooth, shoulders stay above the bar.  Two tips:

1. Don't look straight ahead at the bottom of the lift.  Pick a spot 5-6 feet in front of you and keep your neck at that angle.

2. Move the bar back slightly.  Should be above the middle of your entire foot.  A lot of people use the knot in your laces as a cue.

Again, that's a little nit-picking, as you're doing very well on the major areas of concern (back, hip dynamics). The two issues above aren't problems right now, but may present problems as weight increases.I dont think your heart rate should go any higher than 160, at least not for now.

Dont forget to keep hydrated, and dont train too hard. A steady diet, and i dont mean starving yourself, works really well with exercise. 

Dont try to drop weight too fast, or what  may happen to you is what is refered as a yo-yo effect diet: you will gain all the weight back twice as fast. 

I will be honest with you. A balanced diet is a lot harder than going to the gym. My advice is try to eat properly 6 days of the week and "reward" yourself 1 day of the week.  

Try to find a way to prepare tasty healthy food (im pretty sure there must be a subreddit for that around here). I, for instance, am a sucker for sauteed veggies. 

Im probably a bit late for this thread, but just wanted to leave my pat on the back worth of support.

Believe in yourself. Great post.  Thanks for this OPIt's not ridiculous at all, [it](http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-words-that-used-to-mean-exact-opposite/) has [happened](http://www.dailywritingtips.com/75-contronyms-words-with-contradictory-meanings/) countless times and will continue to happen. Dictionary's don't categorize usage, they catalog it and must evolve along with the language or be left behind.  

And in the "new" definition it basically says "also used to add emphasis" - well, okay, there you go. That's not a change in definition, it's a change in common usage.
Google: "does popping knuckle cause arthritis" and stick will real websitesHit up a TDEE calculator to get a relatively concrete number, and then go from there. Half the time, people aren't eating nearly as much as they think they are, so having a solid number is a good way to scale up down or wherever you're trying to get your weight to.How do you foam roll to make your knees better? NFL combine?Very interesting. So you haven't seen much progress in your mid chest either huh? What about dumbbell presses since the movement is not really restricted. You think there's a certain way we can target our inner chest? I suppose we'll just have to work with what he have...6'1" 168 puts him right smack in the middle of normal BMI. 210 would be overweight.Right.  The gym itself was perfectly fine, and the price was good.  I just couldn't justify continuing a membership when they lied to me to get me to join in the first place.  If the sales rep had been honest, I'd probably be joining this summer when the new location opens, and they'd have a long term customer. But that wouldn't have gotten any sales toward quota for that particular sales rep, so I guess he decided dishonesty was a better tactic. Examine.com should be your 1st stop for ?s re supplementss.Can you suggest some articles about this?Right. And track your macros (Protein, Fat, Carbs) If you're lacking in Protein for the day that is when its most important to take your whey.Stretch. Do yoga. Start building up leg strength by using a leg press. Wear clothing that doesn't impede your movements.First thing in the morning, like 5:15am.  My brain is too dumb to fight back and give me an excuse not to go.  Plus there is no one there except the hardcore and old people who are just a previous generation of hardcore.    How did you detect?Yes! Calm, specific and assertive!Get a band and do terminal knee extensions.Not to pile on, but pro tip, next time never confirm anything with front desk people. They know nothing and are basically told to smile, nod, and say yes (within reason). I would be very surprised if they were aware of, or even cared about your account history. 

The conversations to plan this, and to confirm before you left, needed to be had with a manager from the get go. The people at the front desk most likely just pretended to take notes then forgot all about you. 

Is this your fault? No. SHOULD they have helped you? Yes. But think of it this way... if you were describing thins situation and it involved any business other than a gym, they reaction would be as follows: "Ugh... yeah... of course this didn't go well. You basically tried to make a deal with the receptionist of a company. What did you think was going to happen?"Actually, if you have a basic legal education it isn't as bad.

In a lot of jurisdictions they will have to prove that they did not misrepresent themselves in order to not be sued. This is why many contracts for important items have so many signatures needed, and will require that you write out whole paragraphs.Funny you mention milk. I ran out of my sample of bcaa and had a glass of milk pre-workout as an alternative this morning.I bought pure Beta Alanine. I feel absolutely nothing (no tingles, itching, rashes, flushing,...nothing) even when I take 6 grams on an empty stomach at once (I haven't been taking it consistently, I know the recommended dose is not above 5g at once). I weigh ~150lbs, 16m. Is this normal, or does this mean that Beta Alanine will have no benefits for me either? Am I not taking enough?That's quite an inflammatory statement.  Inflammable.  Flammable.  Get it?I know, right? There's actually more than a few *actually* affordable things there, you just have to look around a bit and not want the fanciest looking things in the store.  The second hand market for Ikea products is also really good.  Picked up a $150 futon for $50 among some other thingsThis is everything you'll ever need to know about the Squat. If you ever have a Q about Squats/Deadlifts or Bench, look up Mark Rippetoe.
Here is the squat explanation - http://www.t-nation.com/training/squat-mechanics-a-deep-analysisBrofessor, is that you?Oxnard represent. Skull crushers *kill* my elbows. It took a really long time until I could find a version that worked for me. This version, the lying tricep extension, that Mark Rippetoe teaches hasn't caused me any problems at all. It has also worked really well for my friends that have elbow problems as well. Here is the video of him teaching the movement:
[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rh3MHnRI_I)Ooooh... now there's a thought.That is amazing considering the price of most things there That's normal. It's probably because of how you wash your back in the shower, honestly. Yes! Thanks - I fully intend to do this. I think the trick is to be specific and calm.If you are away from home and do not have access to a blender, maybe you can carry a milk frother like this http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10076320/

It might not work if your shake is too dense but at $2.50 its worth a shot.
I can't speak from personal experience, but for a cut like that maybe an EC stack? There's tons of info on it and now that I've mentioned it maybe someone else will chime in.

Supplements aside, you could just clean up dietAt my college we had exercise physiology degree and a health fitness specialist degree.  I completed the second one, a little easier, and am now working on getting a certified strength and conditioning specialist certification. Theres a few different ways but the more credentials you have the better. I got a sample of bcaa from Bulk Supplements, which is unflavored, and have been mixing it with concentrated Gatorade powder. The sample is empty, so I'm weighing my options.Yeah, I would be careful with this. 17 lbs over 6 weeks is a pretty quick pace, great job on that.
You'll probably find that there will be a week where you'll lose little to no weight, but your body is still changing.

If you are not doing any cheat meals/days, I would recommend one, as /u/Jerks_took_my_name noted, it can help your body lose further weight going forward. 
** I am pretty sure the science on the physical impacts of a cheat meal is still split, but it will probably be good for your mental health as well.

Don't be surprised if your overall weight loss slows to 1-2 lbs a week. When I last dieted I lose 12 lbs the first month, and then 18 over the next 10 weeks, getting into shape is not meant to be quick!I'll look how to do those steps or if I can do the transition thanks. Great post. As a DPT student and someone who tore their RC as a collegiate athlete, it's a terrible injury. Posture is huge when it comes to shoulder and RC pain. Having poor posture can easily lead to an impingement and ruin your health. I'm getting on it soon!If your form isn't compromised, it's fine. It's an isometric contraction. Oh boy... seems like a pattern!Best bet to shed the fat is to start counting your calories. Get a tracker like MyFitnessPal and log everything. Find a TDEE calculator and eat at a deficit from that. Probably going to be eating somewhere around a 1200 calorie diet.He stretched toward the resistance.

Actually, he isn't stretching at all.  Isometric hold.I've been noticing the same thing--get home from work, not enough protein, not enough calories, scrambling to fill up. Started bringing a protein bar to work (160 cals, 20g protein) to have as a mid-morning or afternoon snack; if I'm home, 1 packet plain oatmeal (120 cals) with some whey powder. I'm still low-ish at the end of the day, but it's way more manageable. The biggest thing I had to get over was that it's OK to have snacks, especially when trying to lose weight, so your body knows it's not starving. Good luck!!!Something I have found very useful in opening up the hips before squatting is to do 10 reps each leg of front lunges, side lunges, and rear lunges. Give it a try! I also had pinching and this alleviated it for me. Almonds are sneaky fuckers. I only really follow the intermittent fasting side of lean gains, not the caloric distribution during the feeding period or workout timing recommendations. It's just a well known example I used for clarity. I work out when it's convenient. Whether before work, during my lunch hour or after. My schedule is dynamic.I was taking bcaa's for a while and quit a few months ago. I lift fasted and really did not notice a difference from being on/off. For me, I just liked drinking something other than water in the morning, couldn't justify the cost and the lack of results (imo). I think it's a good thing.  I do it often during my warmup. doesnt it just increase the amount of air bubbles in the cartilage and increase the chance of arthritis later on?I was recently in a similar situation, i was also changing my routines and all.. How often do you work out? If you are going to the gym everyday, try taking more rest days. Also vary your calorie intake, for example if you should be eating 1500 calories, try eating 1700 one day and 1300 the next. Keep your body guessing on what you are going to doOkay, awesome.  Thank you!yeah LA fitness fucked me over to,The irony is that I really did not want to get out. 

This works perfectly with respect to where I live and work. I would have been happy to call this "my" gym because the people are relatively unobtrusive, they are clean, I almost always get towels (in fact up until last week when they had issues with their washers, it was always), and I love the physical set up of Bakery Square - I use the cafes there to work and study, so this gym just beautifully dovetails into my life.

I just can't reconcile the really bad taste in my mouth after being lied to, however. Though you are absolutely correct in your assessment as well.Yes I do. Thanks!This is like a 3 minute video calm down.So really, no difference?Yup...Lucky! I was also wondering because if squat shoes didn't affect your mobility, then it may be because you had habits (or biology) outside of the gym helping you maintain it. Maybe not the case for people like myself or OP, unfortunately.It just sounds like you are underweight. Your body wants you to be 6'1, 210.

I don't think Starting Strength is right for everyone, but it is right for you here. Buy it on Amazon, read it, implement, eat/sleep/fuck/eat/sleep/lift, and look at the mirror again in 6 months.Meal prepMaybe you are right. Maybe you are an ugly sonofabitch. That said, you aren't going to look any worse by putting on a little muscle, and being stronger will feel good.I can imagine it would be awkward taking a client out for a meal and letting him/her do all the eating.As long as you keep your back straight and tight, you're fine.Just to add to what sacred-pepper said, if you're currently taking a multivitamin check if it's giving you any vitamin D already. The last multivitamin I was on gave me 1000 IU per day so I took 2x1000 IU vitamin D pills as well.

Also, many vitamin D pill bottles will say to only take 1000 IU per day, but there have been more recent studies saying even 10000 IU per day should be fine. I tend to stick to 3000 IU per day, and I take all 3 in the morning with breakfast. Don't take it at night because it has an effect on melatonin levels and could disrupt sleep.

You don't need any specific brand, I get mine at Costco for something like $10-$15 for 720 pills

Believe it or not, one can actually entertain ideas without nitpicking irrelevant details that add nothing to the conversation and have nothing to do with the subject at hand. "Grammar Nazi's" remind me of a politician that plans on cutting taxes for his wealthy campaign donors but campaigns only discussing abortion and the right for our kids to pray in school. 
Fyi, foam rollers and lacrosse balls can make your tight knees feel better.  If/when you make rice you can put in turmeric, a cinammon stick, cloves and/or cardamom pods, or any combination.

Document your conversations with the employees and your understanding.

Was a member for a year and went through hell to cancel my accounts no pain = no danger. it's called cavitation and it's just air bubbles popping.I went on the $10 hold as well for the sole reason that they wouldnt cancel it via phone. I was told I had to come in to cancel, but I had moved and wasn't near one. I finally ended up stopping the auto debit through my bank, which cost me a one time $35 fee. Hopefully they dont find a way around that.... I used to work there. Yes LA Fit sucks.. I'm sorry. As u/theedoor said, call corporate. Don't back down. It is extremely difficult to maintain IF if you travel a lot, at least for me it is. 

Planes and airports aren't the most accommodating places for it. It's hard to find the right meal in an airport when you only have 30 minutes until you board your connecting flight. Living out of a hotel for a couple weeks doesn't make it any easier either. Going without food because it doesn't fit your macros is a bad idea imo.

I just try to stay as close as possible to my macros and try to maintain my excercise routine as best I can. 

What else can you do?

If IF is working for you and you are enjoying it, you will find a way to make it work for you while you're travelling. I know it's pain :( but that's because they want you to spend more time on that page. Don't know about this video but professional video channel (Specially on YouTube) do that to earn more money.

Wait a minute why am I still typing this, I can feel the ga...Awesome thanks. I'll take note of that next time I deadlift. On squat, I've de loaded once or twice for depth but I'll try it one more time. Thank you. Muscles barely burn any extra calories, that said they will give you a better shape so do weights anyway.It isn't heavy enough to challenge your form. Also, it's hard to see your foot/knee movement from the side. Another angle from the back would help a lot with determining if your feet are at the right width and how your knees are tracking.

That being said, I can tell from here that you're putting weight on the balls of your feet rather than the heel. A good cue to fix this would be to do bodyweight/lighter working weight sets with 2.5 pound plates under your heels. Don't let your toes touch the ground when you do this stuff.

If all else fails, you can widen your stance and point your toes out wider. It will be easier to get depth that way.

You're going to get a lot of shit about butt wink. Shifting the weight to your heels will help alleviate this, but people wouldn't bring it up *every fucking time there's a form check if it wasn't a super-common "problem."*

...I wouldn't worry about it.

Also, you're stalling because you weigh 150 pounds and are trying to go for a 5x5 with more than 120% of your bodyweight. If you want to lift more, eat more.I went to an LA fitness branch to do a guest pass when I happened to be in the area a few months ago.  They gave me a guest pass and also told me another branch would be opening right by my office in January 2015.  I decided to join then because the branch I visited wasn't too far out of the way and the one by my office would be super convenient.  January rolled around, and it was apparent that they hadn't even poured concrete yet for the foundation of the branch by my office. I called them to ask about it, and they said it might be open by late summer 2015.  I cancelled my membership. 

I think they, like many gyms, operate on a business model that's basically like a crab trap - easy to get into, impossible to get out of.  Combine that with what I assume are sales quotas for the sales associates, and you have a recipe for dishonesty and deceit.   In the first video, I was trying the Internal Rotator Cuff Stretch and every time I would raise my arms up, my shoulders would make a pop/crack sound. It didn't really hurt, but it happened every time. Is this due to a lack of flexibility or a more serious issue?You can be a weak fatass, is/was my point.What do people think about CLAs and L-Carnitine? I always see they promote this and that, but never anyone making solid claim to the products effectiveness. Or even why and how they do this and that.I think pull-ups are often overlooked. In my experience and opinion pull-ups are the most beneficial back exercises. What kind of help do you want? Meal prep, motivation, workouts etcI just posted this question to /r/Supplements last night but it might help to post to a larger subreddit.

Hey, I was hoping for a recommendation for when to take synephrine with my current stack of yohimbine hcl, BCAAs combined with intermittent fasting.

Right now I fast until 4pm, then I take 10g of BCAA and 2 scoops of Cellucor C4 preworkout and go weight lift. A half hour before I finish my weight lifting(usually an hour after I take the BCAAs) I take 10mg of yohimbine (I weigh 165lbs) and finish with a half hour of low intensity cardio and then feast(~1500 cal) 2 hours after I took the yohimbine.

I'm looking to add synephrine, in the form of Primaforce's Syneburn and asprin but I'm not sure of when I should take it. Does anyone have any advice on the matter?

Also, should I take caffeine with it even though C4 preworkout has quite a bit? Coffee? Caffeine Pill?
ohhhh i see yeah well some lil  chicken spots here count calories as well a meal was like 1700 calories i felt blah hahaWhy wouldn't you be able to do it while travelling?Too much for what? If the label says a scoop is 24g of protein, then that scoop has 24 or less grams or protein in it. When I got to about 240 i switch to minimalist shoes. All depends on how the sole of your current shoe is acting. Just start with the 5g/teaspoon. The loading may help it saturate faster but it is unnecessary in the long run.He would have saved you, but you typed out that comment, only slightly shorter. What a waste of calories man, you didnt have to do all that finger cardioHow did you get into the health fitness field? Is there a certain major for it?You should get 10g of fat with each meal.  It helps with absorption of nutrients and slows emptying the stomach.  A little butter or olive oil with your veg is enough, although fat isn't something you have to afraid of.

If whey shakes are causing bloating you may be alergic or intolerant of something in the shake.  Try different types of protein.  Meat, poultry, fish eggs and dairy are all good choices and vegetables, whole grains and legumes provide some protein.

Get some variety in your vegetables.  I can't image eating only kale. That's only one of several good choices when it comes to greens.  Your vegetables should be include other vegetables other than greens.  There are about a dozen other different categories and you should eat from all of them over the long term.  They also help fill you up. The mirrors are shockingly the cheapest thing there.  I think I paid $10 for 1 1.5'x6' mirror or something like that.First of all, good on you for making a lifestyle change.

It's always tough getting in the swing of things when it comes to meal prep. You could also snack through the day. Looking at your previous post it looks like you need to make up for it in the fat category. Keeping a baggie of almonds or nut mix would be a great way to fill this macro. 

If you're struggling to hit your protein number, try this: mix in a half scoop of vanilla protein powder with 1 cup of plain greek yogurt. Not only does this make it vanilla greek yogurt, but it adds a ton of protein and almost no sugar (depending on your brand). Of course the idiot front desk people aren't going to be able to help you. All they know how to do is swipe cards.L.A. Fitness is horrible. They keep the place clean but the whole "can't cancel unless you send a written letter via snail mail to California where we will deny we've received it" schtick is just shady. Plus, their personal trainers seem to shuffle in and out - most just seem to have received their training certs. Boo. Boooo. I'm looking to buy fishoil,  Vit D &amp; K.  I've searched but the recommendations are overwhelming.  
I am not from the states but i am going there soon, so if possible i would like to buy a large supply that will last me at least few months.  
Could a get a few brands recommendations? Thanks!Your submission has been automatically removed pending manual approval because your account is either too new or does not meet the minimum karma requirements of /r/Fitness.

I've been lifting on amoxxicillin or however you spell it since Saturday. Set a bunch of PRs. It shouldn't affect anything you're doing.Seriously. Small head and wide shoulders is good for bodybuilders, makes them look even bigger. But yeah overall OP sounds like he's got some issues that aren't actually about having "ugly proportions".I usually have a 2 hour break before class and work around 11AM-1:00PM. I'll try working out then to see if I have more energy.Fun fact, wearing a belt while squating isn't there so much to hold your body up as it is to provide your abs something to push against while your lifting. Take a deep breathe and imagine pushing something with your abs. It's the same thing you should do when you're squating!worked for me. but I'm not a consensusstir with a fork or something?Hey! I'll PM you in a few minutes. Thanks for reaching out to me!Then there you go. Beginner programs are just that, for beginners. They're meant to start easy and be simple. Then tailor and adjust to your specific needs/strengths and what not.You don't. Yeah, I'm familiar with IF but if you're traveling and can't fit it into that window you could also just have that single meal. 

It's up to you.I'm not sure why you would replace a meal with a protein shake. You should be able to get everything you need with real food, and if you needed more protein drink a shake as well. Not saying you're wrong to do it, but how would it help you lose weight? 2 proteinsYeah they are different. Cable crunches allows you to progressively overload your abdominals to get the 6 pack everyone wants, while ab wheels can be replaced with unweighted planks to get essentially the same results. Theres no reason your core work should require shoulder extension.you might have tricep tendinosis. i developed an issue with my right tricep after cutting pineapples multiple times per week in a grocery store for 2-3 years while i was in highschool lol. just start light and work at a stimulus level that doesnt irritate the tricep tendon, eventually you will strengthen the tissue.Ideally, I prefer late evenings Monday-Thurs (9-9:30pm) cause the crowd has died down. Early evening on Friday (6:00pm) cause the crowd has died down already but you can still make it to Friday night hangouts, etc.  11am on Saturdays and Sundays because that means I get reasonable sleep but the gym isn't crowded yet.

Right now though, I have to work out in the morning before work because I am climbing in the evening. Not ideal since I am not a morning person but I have found working out/climbing three days a week is better for my recovery than working out three days and climbing on rest days.
Shouldn't neglect your obliques, especially if you're working towards aesthetics. It shouldn't "push out" anything, in fact it should just leave your core stronger and looking better.My left elbow starts to click and feels uncomfortable sometimes after a while, I have tennis elbow. What feels good for me is using cables, but put the height of the cable to a bit below shoulder height, stand a few feet back, and use this not as much as a tricep pushdown, but it moreso mimics the motion of a tricep kickback.Sorry, power rack. If you feel alright you should be good to go. TNation is still very reputable, compared to most websites. They do push bio test hard on a lot of articles though.http://stronglifts.com/wp-content/uploads/deadlift-grip.jpgThat was the plan anyway, I was thinking more of the next 6 days while I'm on the medicine.Hey I work there now and don't understand what could possibly have gone wrong here. Your request got denied? No, it sounds like somebody messed up and isn't willing to take the blame. There's no request to freeze accounts, you click a button, that's it. Any front desk employee can do it. The ONLY way your account wouldn't have been frozen is if you were past due on payments.

PM me if you have any more questions. Just don't over do it on Caffeine pills. Know the dosage, don't take the entire bottle, that's about it. I extensively used Caffeine pills during my Collegiate rowing career, still use Caffeine pills weightlifting. Yes, they're cheap as shit.There's a label on the tub.My idea is to eat in a window of 8 hours but only the days in when I am in town. During that window I will have my caloriesI am super late to this post! But first of all it is great that you decided to go to the gym, as an overweight person myself i know how intimidating the gym can be. I started at 240 pounds in December and very out of shape, i worked out for about 2 weeks without seeing any kind of results so i thought i would give counting calories a try (january) since then i am down 22 pounds. Working out is a great start but diet will take you the rest of the way you want to go. I am up to running 2 miles and have been lifting weights. Its is going to be a long process, but in the end it will be well worth it! Keep doing what you are doing, make sure to switch up excersises to avoid plateaus and eat clean!Call CORP. they are notorious in charging people unnecessary money.At the end of the strengthening article....
***Never perform a rotator cuff routine before doing shoulder press or bench press exercises***

And thats the only time I have ever done them for the past month... lolYup, currently working through my lower back pain and sciatica and the limber 11 is showing me how much tighter my entire right side is. That shit matters! a fantastic Playlist helps me and a hell of a lot of self motivation!!! Well, I guess it happened anyway.I think you mean a power rack. Squat racks are usually not height adjustable and would be too high for benching.Some people swear by EC stacks.  I have been doing it for the last month or so but I also started it at the same time as a cut diet and starting a hypertrophy workout so I'm not sure which one of those or the combination is what's working for me right now. 

EC stack is caffeine and Ephedrine so you can take caffeine and any nasal pills that have ephedrine in it or you can buy blends for more money.  I heard cellucors fat target stuff has good reviews but I can't really speak for those. more water to protein ratio
Local news stations.  Go public.   Twitter it.   I have noticed that it gets me sweating and I don't have the painful aches from running I'll be doing that more.Any thoughts on Evogen EVP? I have developed a horrible sensitivity to caffeine.You should improve your fitness, first and foremost.  That means getting stronger, faster, and improving your endurance.  That inevitably means strengthening your core including your obliques.  

Part of addressing your fitness is achieving a normal bodyfat level and that means improving your diet, reducing junk food and increasing nutritious food.

Also improve your sleep and stress management.

Once you have these basics under control, your problem will also likely be under control. I prefer going to sleep at 8-9PM because I know i'll wake up refreshed at 4:55 AM and at the gym by 5:05 AM the latest. Helps that my gym is 3 blocks away and open 24/7. 

There are people at my gym that early but we all do different workouts and the power racks are always free. The luxury of being able to complete your workout without waiting saves more time in the long run for me. 

It also sets the day right as I get something positive accomplished right away. I can say my day started on a high note and anything trivial throughout the day won't bother me. I totally agree. My father has had 5 rotator cuff surgeries from tearing them so I know have genetically weak rotator cuffs. My bench got so bad I couldn't do the motion without a pain in my left shoulder, so I had to stop benching for a month while I let it sit. After a month I started adding in rotator cuff exercises every shoulder day. I didn't notice a difference at first but it's been a year and the pain has never come back. I still work in rotator exercises on shoulder day because I also play golf which is a lot of rotation and I don't want my bench to suffer from my weak shoulders. Broken down into two different phases. Loading and Maintenance

Loading Phase: 20g - 30g of creatine Monohydrate a day for 5 to 7 days. Once done, move onto Maintenance phase.

Maintenance Phase: 5g of creatine Monohydrate a day.

When should to take it? Ideally during Loading you spread it out, take 5g in the morning, 5g before workout/noon, 5g post workout 3pm, 5g late afternoon, Doesn't matter when, you could even take 20g in one sitting. The problem is you might have some interesting poop, 20g spread through out the day and you won't notice anything different. During maintenance? Whenever the hell you want. Miss a day? Just continue as normal.

You only really need about 3g a day normally, anything extra will just get pooped out, so 5g is usually what's recommended and what I used in calculating. 

Also; YOU WILL PUT ON WATER WEIGHT. For every 5g of creatine taken, expect to drink an additional 4-6 oz of water. Only things I drink are water, green tea, and black coffee so I've never had an issue with this. Yeah you might not want to drink a 150g protein shake in one sitting. Get it throughout the day from food and make a -25 or so g protein shake after your workout if you need some for the day. I take a heaping spoonful of creatine monohydrate everyday at dinner time, as long as you take the same amount everyday you will be fine. When I did IF for a short while it was just skipping breakfast and having an early dinner. That or you could just have one giant mega-meal and have all of your daily calories then?so, is it not even worth it to only do it during the weeks I am in town?2 weeks and 4 daysProbably just water retention. Ignore it and continue on. Doing a single meal carb load might help shed the water weight. Google "whoosh effect".You should be alright. Penicillin is just an antibiotic there's no reason why it should conflict with working out.You should probably rest for today. Nope never played, but I think I know what you mean. Yea I was going to take a guess around 2800-3000 for yours, 3300 seems pretty high.  I'd have a difficult time eating that much and staying healthy.Are different forms of creatine really more effective than others? When I first started lifting seriously, I saw articles saying some absorbed better and didn't have as much water retention as monohydrate, but now I'm seeing articles and posts saying that's a bunch of crap since monohydrate doesn't need to be loaded. &gt; I mean tnation is reputable 

What? No it's not. Tnation occasionally will have guest writers who have worthwhile articles but most of TNation is complete bullshit designed to push their supplements. Jesus christ, you pay more for 2 months than I do for a whole year...Bruh you need to have 45 degrees from your elbows to your torso or you aren't focusing your chestSo, so, SO helpful. I have flexibility issues still and this helps a lot. Also the tip about bracing your core I saw on here a few days ago was a godsend. 

I used to hate squats but now I kind of look forward to them.A little reminder for you when you have doubts
[link](http://i.imgur.com/KLizapH.jpg)1) You know how you see kids twisting their torso when standing around doing nothing. Yeup. You use your hips to "toss" your arms so that the hands hit the opposite shoulder and pect. Do it 100 times.

2) Bend over let your torso hang from your hips.
a) Let your arms swing to and fro together from front to back 10 times.
b) Let your arms swing to and fro from front to back alternately 10 times
c) Raise your shoulders wiggle alternately up and down so that your hanging arms and hands lower and raise alternately 10 times.
d) Swing your torso left and right so that your arms and hands swing left and right of your legs 10 times.

A flexible spine will give you a long life.

DN

Your spine must be flexible for you to reach enlightenment.

SadhguruEdit: [here's a picture that goes all the way down but I stop halfway](http://jamesdawsonmartin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoulder-internal-rotation-standing1.jpg)



No, sorry I'm bad at explaining. Like if you're not holding weights your palms are facing forward and you rotate your arms down so they remain in an L shape and your upper arm (above the elbow) is in the same position albeit rotated and your lower arms (below the elbow) are parallel to the floor aka your open palms now face the floor.I feel like all my energy has drained throughout the day and therefore I lift less. My schedule with my GPs makes me exercise at night.We've brought them a couple times but by the time you get them geared up for the lesson, then gear yourself up, take a run or two, then they are done because it's been a couple hours and they are hungry/tired/cold. Like most things with kids, skiing with them is not the same as skiing with other adults.Yeah I realise that this is not taking into account lower body and perhaps training arms four days a week will not result in gains but rather result in overtraining, due to little to no recovery time. However, I do see how this could be quite an effective routine if it was incorporated with other body parts and executed, say, two days a week.Bakery Square.It's 95$ ish for 2 people. We also had a very small (or maybe even a 0$) initiation fee as part of a deal.I believe the Beta Alanine can be taken as either a pre-workout (on lifting days) or whenever on non-lifting days. As for the protein, I always mix mine with water (dissolves way better). Right now I'm using a Body Fortress whey isolate protein, and it tastes good. I also used an EAS whey protein, which tasted good. N jutut vaan tulee kun niist alkaa kirjottaa.
LMFAO. Holy shit, I hadn't seen that one. 

So let me get this straight. He's 5'10", 191#, presumably below 10% BF, has a 1560 total, which he doesn't have video of because he was busy "...working out and tracking my calories...", **and** runs a 5:18 mile all while following a bodybuilding routine. Oh, and the only cardio he does is 20 minutes of dancing 3x a week. 

Cool story bro.I mean tnation is reputable and sounds pretty ridiculous... But this routine seems bananas imo. It'll make your arms look good but if the only thing that looks good is your arms you'll look pretty awful.

Thanks for help.When I saw the set-up I expected the worst but all things considered its not bad.

You do start with the bar over your toes, which means the bar must come towards you on the way up. You want it a vertical as possible.

Heres a super simple method to set-up your deadlift. If you combine that with your straight back itll be damn near perfect.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syt7A23YnpA

You will also find that your shins will be more vertical and your upper body will probably be more parallel to the floor when you start but thats fine.The gym I'm talking about is a Lifetime Fitness too.Here's how I view losing weight: It's like a row boat that is sinking and the water filling the boat represents the fat. You take a bucket and start bailing out the water. At first, it's easy. You're dumping full buckets of water out. But once you have the water level much lower, you're not bailing full buckets, you're bailing half buckets and eventually you're laying the bucket down on the bottom of the boat just to get water in it. You may be at that stage where you're not filling buckets easily. Stay with it and remember, as long as you're burning more calories than you're taking in, you'll get where you want to be but it gets slower and more difficult.  &gt; Some people, not myself, find it difficult to count calories and can't do it properly. There are a lot of people who have no idea how many calories is in any food that they eat.

That's why things like MyFitnessPal exist. You're at a restaurant? Say Applebees? Just punch in "Applebees Honey BBQ Chicken Tender Dinner" and boom, all the macros and calories pop up. You made something for yourself? Say it was... idk pasta with vodka sauce. What /u/rollollo is saying isn't false, you don't need to measure it to a tee. But if you had 1 bowl? Guestimate how much you just ate. If you're really lazy, when you're done eating take a measuring cup, fill the bowl with water and then pour the water in the measuring cup. If it's 1 cup, assume you ate 1 cup of pasta and guess randomly at the sauce as well. MFP exists to make calorie counting easier than having to pull out a food scale every time you eat. Unless you're trying to cut from 10% to 6% BF you have no need to be that specific. The main point in "counting" everything that you ingest during the day is simply to keep yourself conscious of the food you're eating. 

Will cardio help burn calories? Sure, but even an hour on a treadmill is only burning 300 or so calories. If you're just eating the same way you always eat and doing cardio you'll gain weight because you're still not at a deficit of your TDEE. Realize, people that are obese (OP for example) are 'typically' that way because they eat way more than they're supposed to without realizing it. 

OP didn't list her height, I'm going to assume an average height of about 5' 5". So at 5' 5" and 280lbs she has a TDEE of 2458 calories/day if she doesn't move all day, which is likely what she's been doing most of her life. Now, she's probably been eating closer to an average of 3000-3500 kcals a day her entire life which is why she is in the state she is in currently. So, if she keeps eating 3000 kcal a day and is burning 300 calories from cardio, she still won't be losing any weight at all. In fact she'll likely still continue to gain weight. Albeit, slower than before, but gain none the less. 

Reddit is black and white because that's really the only way there is... if this girl tries to burn 1000 calories a day from exercise she's going to get burnt out and see zero progress because she'll stop working out. But if she takes the time to fix her diet first and starts eating at a deficit and consuming closer to 2000kcal a day, then she'll see pounds fall off before she starts exercising and that will help her motivation. Then, when she is still eating 2000kcal a day and burning those 300 calories via cardio a few times a week she'll start to get healthier and burn even more weight off. But telling an obese person that they don't have to fix their diet because "counting calories is hard" and that working out will help is 90% of the time false. As most Obese people got that way by eating a significant amount more food than they should on a day to day basis. Counting calories should be Step #1 for anyone looking to lose weight and you're helping nobody by telling them otherwise. Especially when MFP makes it SO easy to count them. It takes me 30 seconds to enter my meal into MFP, maybe a minute or two if I made the dish myself and need to think about what I put into it. But it's certainly not hard, you're just lazy.Discipline is the better way to put it. its been part of my routine for years and i have the want to make gains. its just that work drains me of all energy....what? You're like not even wrong.

Seriously, what's your full depth 1RM squat or dead?The bar looks like it's hovering over your toes. Bring it back a little bit so it is in the center of your entire foot. And try to keep your head in a neutral straight position. If there is a mirror in front of you resist the temptation to watch yourself until you're at the top of the lift. Yeah I hear you about starting light. I was thinking about starting in the second month of SS, which means Id bench 65 pounds instead of 45 -- which is still light enough to get the movements down but closer to a weight that is going to start to tax me.

(Of course bench is not what im concerned about.. That would be squats and deads.. I have squatted as part of bfl tho just not continuously)

Mmmmmm.... Waffles. What is it about soda you like? The bubbles? The taste? Try drinking club soda with lemon or lime juice if you can't quit cold turkey. I wasn't a big soda drinker growing up so it's easy for me to say no.I tried that haha, i woke up at 5 am, looked at my alarm and said screw that. went right back to sleepIt's tough to gauge. The evening is when you're not at work, so playing that game or watching that TV show is sometimes all the "living" you get outside of work. Coming home, eating, and sleeping 2 hours later can very quickly make you feel like a drone. 

That said, my company just announced a bunch of redundancies coming soon- 1/3 of my floor, so that might not be an issue any more...I would normally never recommend it to anyone as food is generally enough to put on mass.  But I know when I was 19 I had the same problem and resolved it the same way.  I was 5'11" 170 pounds and couldn't put on a single lb to save my life.  Now I am 230lb but it took a lot of time and years to get there.  I sit around 15% body fat as I have no reason to be lower and I enjoy some b dubs and a beer.  Now that my activity level and metabolism has slowed 10 years later it isn't needed but it does the job when you need the extra calories.Thanks, I'm hooping on the food train atmOh its been a part of my routine for about 2 years now its just that now that i'm working i'm losing the energy to goKeep doing crossfit lol.12AM-1:30AM. 

I have school in the morning, and work usually from 2PM-11:30PM. 

On that note, is there anything bad with working out late at night like that?Squat - You're not hitting depth. You're about 8 inches too high it looks like.I've never been refused a spot, though I never asked those with super smug face. I know I know, don't judge the book by its cover.If you take note in the deadlift video, the bar moves towards you as you lift.

You want the bar to go as close to vertical as possible. In this case it means starting with the bar slightly closer to you, over the middle of your foot as opposed to over the toes.

This also may cause you to need to have your shins more vertical and so you might have your hips higher at the beginning. This is fine.

For your squats I believe that weight is too high for you. Your depth is really lacking and you are pretty unstable on the ascent.

You should deload a bit and try to make sure you get down a bit lower. You may lack mobility but its worth working on it.

You also tend to put your weight onto your toes about halfway up, which isnt ideal either. You want to keep the weight at least over your midfoot if not towards your heels further.

Good luck.If you look at the path of the bar, it looks like: /. It needs to look like: |. It's putting a lot of extra stress on his lower back. 

You said the starting position for the upper arm (assuming bis/tris) is parallel to the floor.  After rotating, you said it is still parallel to the floor.  Did you mean you rotate your lower arm (assuming forearm)?  

As in start like an 'L' (view from the side) and then rotate inward.A lot of these gadgets aren't very accurate to be honest. You can buy fat calipers for $5 that will generally give you a much better estimate. 7% body is really not much at all. If this is accurate, you're doing the right thing in trying to bulk. 2500-3500 calories is a big range, assuming you were perfect and ate the average over the course of a week, 3000 calories usually isn't enough to actually put on significant weight. Best recommendation anyone can give you.

EAT!I drive.

-The Driver, Drive, 2013Which Pittsburgh location was this?If what you want is big arms, this is a good routine to follow. It is not optimal according to current science but this is the kind of routine (rep range,drop sets, etc) that I see the best results with so take that bro science for what it's worth.It neglects the lower body but if you don't care then it is worth 4 weeks of your time. 

Also, I would deload on the 4th week then run it over again. I'm gonna try it out. Thanks!Though it probably will work, the guide itself states that it's a programm for exactly four weeks. I won't go so far that your arm will fall off afterwards, but any extreme training programm like these will be severly unhealthy in the long run.

They are, like all these obscure named diets in the rainbow press, programms based on a limited timeframe and narrowed scope for shortterm effects that are either not sustainable in the long run or simply unhealthy/prone to injury. A guide like this reminds me of the good old popeye cartoons.

But if you want to have "them big guns", go for it. See what happens and dray your own conclusions.LA Fitness memberships cost $100 a month?  Holy shitballs Batman!I'm pretty sure bodybuilding ships anywhere.

Welcome!&gt;I'm the type of person that needs it laid out in front of me.

You might want to hire a trainer/cook.

&gt;Should I bump up the cardio and do less weight training? 

This is backwards.  You want to build muscle and lose fat.  That means imporve your diet and your training.  If you want to get better at running, run more. Sorry. You said "....you drive?" instead of you would drive? Misunderstood the context.
Everything about it is terrible, starting with the bullshit claim that it will add an inch to your arms in 1 month and ending with the overly macho "hurdur don't worry about legs and overtraining" rant. Your comparing cable crunches to the ab wheel, two completely different movements.  

It would be foolish to try to put 200lbs, hell even 100lbs on your back and try to do the ab wheel, 10-45lbs is more than enough.  I'm a novice but you definitely need to go lower on your squats.Thanks! I like to comfort myself with the idea that our house is built by wood as well, so im confident in its safety unless I light it on fire. Regardless it can easily hold up to 400lb. By 300lb I'm already gonna be looking at a more durable bar and rack. 

If all is well this will all cost me about $400 total.. Which is perfect for my wallet right nowHi Beethoven. Yeah it's normal, same exact thing with me.Considering any nutritionist worth seeing would know your TDEE person to person of similar body type doesn't generally fluctuate more than 300 calories. Assuming you aren't suffering from a medical condition.I had a similar problem where they reactivated my account randomly and charged me for 6 months worth of membership. The local management said there was nothing they could do except cancel my membership going forward.

It took about 2 months worth of phone calls to LA fitness corporate (I don't remember where I got the number from), and plenty of voicemails, but eventually it was resolved.

It was IMPOSSIBLE to talk to anyone about it or have anyone do anything but if you're persistent enough, you should be able to get through.I have a question.  I went to my doctor who referred me to a sports physician.  He informed me that (after taking an X-ray), that I have a partial dislocation in my rotator cuff.  It's been like this for years, and has affected me a little bit in my daily work outs.  If I outstretch my arm all the way it "pops out then back in".  They then referred me to physiotherapy where the exercises did not really improve my condition.  Another option was surgery, but I am unsure if it is worth it?  Is there anything I can do without further damaging my rotator cuff and strengthening it?General health. Unless you work outside year round, you are likely deficient.


http://examine.com/supplements/Vitamin+D/#summary3Thanks, and yea it makes sense. 

Jay Cutler doesn't run, why should I?

That should be on a poster or something.

My TDEE is supposedly 3100cals a day but i have lost weight in the past 3 months since i have been eating that much. I lift every day but it is hard to believe i need to eat more than that to maintain at 6'3 202 lbs. So it is kind of hard to believe you will not lose weight eating that little and working out as much as you do. LA Fitness is awful to their customers. I scheduled a personal training session and got paired with a really wonderful trainer. He was patient, friendly, and very helpful. He convinced me to sign up for a month to give it a real try, and then after that, we would reevaluate if I wanted to do an on-going program.  
Well, the week after signing up, they paired me with a new trainer, which I was not expecting and not excited about. After one workout, I decided I was done and would not continue. He was rude and impatient; he spent more time talking to other people around the gym than coaching me. He made very condescending and discouraging remarks, such as "Really? You can't even do lunges?" I figured I was out the money for the month, but I wanted to try to get a partial refund after such a horrific experience and the bait-and-switch garbage they pulled.  
When I talked to the management team on-site, I was informed that I had actually signed up for a 6-month, non-cancelable contract. They refused to do anything about it. I demanded to know how that was even possible, as it was not what I agreed to. Unfortunately, when agreeing to the terms, I had signed the electronic pad-- not a physical paper. They printed out that electronic signature on a 6 month contract and told me that is what I had agreed to. I was furious; it was going to be over $1600 total, and I was under the impression that I was signing up for 1-month. Sure, it was ignorant of me not to make them print the contract for my review, however, I was young and naive, not yet jaded by unethical business practices.  
I, too, had signed up with a debit card. There was nothing that my bank could do to get me a refund, which I was OK with. They canceled the debit card to prevent me from facing future charges, but after negotiating with LA Fitness corporate for over a month, no compromise was made, and I am sure their records still indicate that I owe a $1200 balance.  
It is really unfortunate, though, because I loved their gym. 100% agree with you! "Carb-loading" is definitely best left to days prior to running, but per her diet an increase would be beneficial not only for energy stores but also for the weight/strength gains OP is going forIt depends on what you're using to measure body fat. DEXA scans are the most accurate but still have error. If you're talking about an impedance tool like [this](http://www.joyzyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bioelectrical-impedance-analysis.jpg) then that has a lot of error. So if you measure 7%, lets just say it means you're between 6-8, so saying 6.7 or 6.9 is too accurate.

In this sub people usually go by visual estimates as most methods are very inaccurate. You may very well be 7% body fat, how do you look compared to [this](http://www.southfloridafitnessbootcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/body-fat-percentage-men.jpg).

If you are having trouble eating more, peanut butter helped me out a lot. Protein shake with oats and peanut butter, tons of calories in easy to drink.

A great article that was posted yesterday.Add some form of weight lifting to build some muscles. Muscles burn more calories.

Try adding bodyweight movements, squats, lunges, push ups, dips etc Same here 5 am is the magical hour. 

Very very few people, and at mine only me and one other guy will ever use the squat rack that early. Basically no waiting on anything or dealing with people that make you write a Rant Wednesday post. 

For me it gives me a good start to the day and I tend to have more energy throughout the day. By the time I get home though I'm wiped so the sleep comes easily. Helps with excuses too, no its been a long day at work or I'm too tired to go today crap. 

Wake up, lift weights, enjoy the gains.... Repeat.Just eat, dude. I hate it when you skinny guys say "I can't gain weight" and then you eat half of your meal or skip meals. It's a legit problem if you're eating 5k calories a day and not gaining weight but if you're eating 2.5k and whining about it you're not helping yourself.

Butter, oil, french fries, ice cream, hamburgers, milk, eggs, etc. All calorie dense and all fine for a dude your age and in your shape (as long as you don't mind pooping).

Like Alan Thrall says, you don't stop lifting because it's hard, if you're serious about gaining weight you wont stop eating just because it's hard. Yeah but you said you'd drive 1 minute.read the wikiCan you get a cheap hotel for the night before?  I wouldn't want to perform after 2 hours in the car. Other than that, just warm up the same way you usually do.  CHANGE NOTHING about your routine the day that you have to perform.Words require clarity in order for meaningful communication. I'm all for the adoption of evolving language, but it is ridiculous that a word could come to mean its own antonym and that so many people world accept this simply because dictionary writers say so.

Simply sit down with your legs straight in front of you and lean forward to stretch them out. About 20 seconds on, rest 5 sec, then 20 seconds on a gain. Then bend one leg in and stretch the other leg to the side. Then switch legs. 

The scorpion stretch is also a good one. Lay on your stomach with arms extended to 90 degrees.  Take your left leg and try to tough your right hand, keeping your shoulders on the ground best you can. Then repeat with the other leg. Do this several times. 

These two stretches will keep you from having lower back pain.  Your extremely soft hands need to become not soft hands.

What are you a hand model?  Get the calluses and progress.It's generally accepted as how it works because it's one of the most heavily researched supplements ever.  It's not a debate anymore. The half life only matters when talking about serum levels of creatine.  Serum levels aren't what's important.Or a mirror.No, the gym 2 miles up the road is a signature club and I cannot use those. Only members of that specific LA can go there. I pay the regular $29 a month and can use any LA in the country besides the signature ones. I was saying if I'm at my gf's house and want to get a workout in I cannot go to the one 2 miles up the road from her. Instead, I have to drive 20 minutes to a regular LA for the common folk like me.Uh, no, you're wrong. The use of who versus whom is not dependent on intentions, it's dependent on whether who or whom can be replaced by he and she or him and her. If you were to answer the statement "Whomever mentioned that you need to tense your core by pushing your abs out and not in, thank you," the answer would be "he or she stated that you need to tense your core" not "him or her stated that you need to tense your core."

I'm a professional editor, so people stop arguing something that you're clearly wrong about. There have been multiple complaints towards the BBB how they will lower your rating if you don't pay them money and raise it if you pay them. It might have changed in the past few years.

Hell, the terrorist group HAMAS got an A rating on BBB by a group of business owners paying the BBB $425 back in 2010.
You did not hit a plateau in 6 weeks. Check your calories, but don't try to drop anything too fast, slow and steady fat loss is sustainable.

First weeks of a weight loss journey is normally water anyway rather than actual fat.I personally take MP fish oil, best ratio I could find for affordable price, for each 1000mg capsule you get 700mg of EPA DHA combined. I take 3 a day, 1 with breakfast, 1 with lunch and 1 with dinnerI take mega men energy and metabolism pills as my daily supps. They aren't pricey off amazon and was wondering if there is anything better. I run regularly and lift as well, i used to take the mega men ripped and got great results. That was too pricey though and was wondering what supps you guys would recommend. I'm just look for something that gives me a little boost and helps me stay in shape. Nothing too pricey though gotta pay for school.Well done OP on building it yourself but am I the only one who wouldnt trust a power rack made out of wood?Was about to recommend this! I still do this before I squat!Also here to confirm. That's the attitude you need to put weight on! I've never found a weight lifter or bodybuilder who likes cardio, only those who tolerate it during cutting.quick question since you seem to know,  why the vitamin d? i mean i know it's an essential but what does vitamin d do for muscle gains? 
2 miles would be a fantastic warmup jog and you drive?I read somewhere that its somewhere around 16oz = about 13 grams  &gt; as an Engineer and Chemist, I like to know what I put into my body specifically. Out of all the odd and hard to pronounce supplements there's two that I consider well tested enough to know they can give you enough of an edge while being entirely safe.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Caffeine and Creatine

amen my other scientifically inclined brethren (rhyme not intended)

Just to add for those who might not be aware - caffeine pills are also readily available at your local supermarket or pharmacy, and are so cheap you'll do a double take (especially if you are used to branded PWOs).You should have a letter that is just professional.
They respond better to it.thanks man
According to the LG guide, training 'fasted' (pre-workout BCAA's) is optimal and second best is training with a small pre-workout meal (larger meal post workout). These are just guidelines, do whatever works for your body and your schedule.Heh. That soccer practice sounds pretty familiar though luckily ours is more likely to start at 5:30 or 6. How the heck are enough parents out of work by three to get their kids there on time?

Anyway, I usually stick around while they practice - get cardio in running so I'm as sweaty as the kid is when we're done.  Gym time is after they're in bed.
Will do, and yea I see now that the body fat probably isn't correct.Just double checking, thank you for the help!Dude. Frankly, they're caffeine mixed with lots of other crap that have a hint of truth behind them, but no effectiveness in the real world. Examine.com has recommendations for what works (from actual studies).lol, yea I didn't realize how retarded that sounded until I asked you guys. Thank you5AM - Right as the gym opens. It completely sets my day to be great. Used to HATE each day I would have to work or be at home...the gym turned that around. Im smiling everywhere and so happy with myself.Triggered to cunt punch someone maybe. What BCAA brand/flavors do you go for?You're making some unrealistic assumptions.  Building muscle takes time, effort and planning.  You are not going to build massive traps accidentally.

Start with improving your fitness.  Become stronger, faster and improve your endurance.  Improve the quality of your diet, eliminate junk food and increase nutritionally dense foods.  get adequate sleep and manage your stress. 

Pick appropriate programs (from the wiki) that address your fitness goals.  Don't worry about body proportions right now.  As you get fit, you will naturally develop the body that is right for you.  If after a year or two of this you find that you need a body part emphasisied or de-emphasised, you can use bodybuilding techniques to to that.  Oh shit, so I should stop using creatine?I'm going to second the notion of carbonated water, part of the addiction for me i found was carbonation something just so satisfying about popping open the can and hearing it fizz as it's poured over ice. 

You still get that with sparkling water. However it's naturally flavored with no sugar, no calories, no sweetener, and no sodium. The brand i would recommend is La Croix lots of different flavors and pretty affordable. I will squeeze a sliced lime or lemon to add some additional flavor sometimes. It's worked great for me so far. It's been about 4 or 5 months since I have had one. 

You are likely to start having some withdrawals heavy cravings after about a week depending on how much you are drinking per week. Just push through it and it'll be worth it once you've kicked the habit. Keep in the back of your mind that soda is terrible for your health, and your teeth. Reinforce that thought each time you start to crave one.I was expecting a completely different stretch. Ive found that doing standing psoas stretches throughout the day at work has solved all of my lower back problems. Thanks, yea I see that's my problem.Yes I am. I eat around 1650-1750 a day and do cardio and ab workouts for about 30 minutes a day.Use a loose grip. Don't hold the bar tight, just let it rest in your fingers. You're gripping the bar too tightly which is causing it to slide during your reps which is hurting your skin. 

You just have to pull the weight up. Gravity will help keep it down.I hate cardio. Thanks&lt;3dang thanks guys i truly appreciate all the feedback. ummme, that's actually a pretty decent list of what i've got in the cupboards. my protein intake is controlled by my appetite,  lots of deer and antelope. nice, lean, good protein.   thanks guys!!Regarding your question, I'm not sure. Melatonine is the supplement I'm more familiar with. The problem with Melatonin is you need to be very careful not to overdose. You body only makes about 300mg of melatonin a night for sleep. If you start to take 1g supplements of melatonin to sleep, your body will stop producing melatonin. If you buy the 1g pills, divide them into quarters and you'll be fine.

Reason why I recommend melatonin is because it's something your body naturally produces to help with sleeping. It can be argued that things like Xanax don't actually inducing a sleeping state, but rather a more unconscious state of being. You can define sleep as what you want, but it's argued that you don't actually receive the benefits of sleep in this state.

Beyond even that, it can cause you to do some really messed up shit in your "sleep."You of course can tailor a beginning program like SS to your individual need. However, it would be wise to start light with any compound movement you have not done before. If you feel very confident, you can add weight faster than recommended until it gets harder. However, use the time at lower weights to really get your form down well, as it will pay huge dividends going forward.Definitely, thank youLifts are ok but chances are the problem is the volume of cardio you are doing. Just ditch that off and you should see improvements. 

Try something like the stronglifts 5x5 and don't fo the cardio and you should notice improvements.I definitely will, thank youAre you counting calories? bro i just have questions based on the leangains method, is it really better to lift fasted? or is it alright to lift within the 8 hour period?This post has [too little content](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_3._posting_rights_require_minimum_qualifications). **Add more text to the body and then [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFitness&amp;amp;subject=Please+reapprove&amp;amp;message=http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2vnnhc/how_good_are_protein_shakes_for_a_16yearold/%0A%0AI have added more content.)** to have it approved.

(I know BroBible isnt the best place to look for accurate information, but this site gets their posts from other sources aswell)
Also keep track of the creatine you have in your preworkout and possibly protein blend.  They add it to everything so you may not need the full 5g by itself.  My preworkout has about 2g or something in it.  Pointless by itself so i'm not sure why they add it. That's why they make vanilla and chocolate.So demo it first and then explain. In law school, we were taught to state your conclusion up front and then explain because people ain't got time fo dis shit.Only stretching and more squats. Front squats require less hip flexion, but hip flexibility is important.&gt; I am bodybuilding and a distance runner.

I'm a music producer and I'm deaf.I've also had a problem with them. I signed up for training sessions with them, trainer is awesome and I had no problem with the sessions themselves. When you sign up they lock you into a 1 year contract, which I agreed to. About 10 months in I get a call from LA fitness saying that they see my contract was about to be up and if I wanted to continue, at which I say no because I was doing fine working out by myself and wanted to move that monthly payment to other areas in my life. APPARENTLY LA doesn't consider that a cancellation, and that I actually have to talk to a manager to get that cancelled so I got another month of training. I know I could've fought it but they have these business practices in place to try to get money from people like me who aren't going to put in that effort.When starting on creatine, do I really need to go through the loading phase, or can I just start taking a tsp a day? Does it really make a difference?Yeah, *to waffle* is a great word to describe pusillanimous behavior.Myfitness pal is a great tool for that.

Keep some peanut butter in your room. It's cheap, high cal, decent protein, and doesn't need to be refrigerated. Is it the healthiest thing? No, but it's not terrible and it gets the job done. If you don't a chance to go to that spot on campus you like, pound a couple teaspoons at two different times that day to compensate.DOMS. Back is used for squats. Arms for bench. Maybe your form was off, your nutrition, your sleep.

When you see hoof prints, think horses not unicorns.Hell yea, I'll hop right on it. Thanksif your serious my brother dropped around 100lbs by roller blading, a low sugar diet, and only drinking water.

I think the best thing he did was dropping all calories that he drank.

Calories in and calories out, its simple if you put in less calories than than you use the weight will come off. You'll like the headline "British Left Waffles on Falklands".I do mine 7 in the morning and then around 1 right after lunch.  I read you should take it on an empty stomache but it doesn't agree with me when I do it that way.Yea I've come to realize that. Macros being tracked as of 5 minutes ago.

Thanks!I'd look into body dysmorphic disorder and perhaps consider getting into therapy.Leftcorner has suggested using a foam roller for loosening off the hip flexors and I agree that foam rolling can help. Having said that, I have had exponentially better results from doing the 3 minute stretch for the hip flexors found in this MobilityWOD video before my squats. I can easily hold a third world squat position after this and getting deep is more an achievable. Foam rolling feels a little meh when in comparison, I prefer to roll IT band/Quads/Glutes/Hams and stretch off my Hip flexors in this way.

Here is the link, happy squatting. 

It does make a big difference from a foam roller, but using the lacrosse ball is a pain in the ass.Focus on your diet if you really want to be fit.  You could have an excellent routine and it would be severely handicapped if your diet was shit. Also try to focus on compound movements until you've built a solid foundation. This means dumbell press, deadlift, squats, bent over rows, overhead dumbbell press, all of these should be the basis for your weight training. Don't go super heavy on one workout and slack on the rest. You should build an even physique, upper and lower body. Removed. Please read the wiki before posting.I go to life time fitness and pay $150 a month.... I also feel like an idiot.I'm European and I do keep forgetting that people turn on the Super Bowl just to watch the commercials. I just found out I've been taking about 80 grams less protein than I should every day.

Thanks for the help, I haven't tracked them separately like that.Alright thanks I've already checked out plenty of other subs tho. Appreciate your response regardlessAlright thanks I've already checked out plenty of other subs tho. Appreciate your response regardlesscoffee and a nap.SS. :) Good to hear! Wasn't about to give up, but damn that shit was painful!Dang, that blows. I wish gyms weren't so crooked. I can't speak entirely about GAT. However I have a friend who lives off of GAT products (he's not a rep, although he wishes he was). And GAT has some great products with their pre and protein. Now when it comes to the other stuff I have no idea.

And with me, I never had any luck with GAT Pre Workout, but most pres I've taken don't seem to effect me at all.

As far as jetfuel t-300, no idea. Good on you for spotting it though, be sure to thoroughly do your research. It might be some kind of labeling they have to put on there.Yea with these types of things i'd much rather eat a chicken breast with some tasty sides than drinking a bulk supplement.   I understand if you are on the go but man if you have the luxury of eating more why would you not take every advantage of it.   You will miss it as soon as you go on a cut. I know that's how it works, but in all seriousness, I know for a fact that if I had to lose weight, I wouldn't cut calories.  At all.  It's tedious, it's annoying, it would make me obsessive.  I would likely skip entire meals simply because I'd rather not eat than count the calories (which would be effective, but not calorie counting).  I'd also rather eat lots and spend loads of time burning it off, because cardio makes me feel *awesome* and lifting is really just a task for me.  I get no joy out of lifting, but I lift so that I can do even *more* cardio without hurting myself.  I did once have to lose ~7lbs to get back to my ideal raceweight after spending 5 months in a place where it was very unsafe for me to run outside but I kept eating the same amount I've always eaten because eating is awesome, so I started running the amount that I used to run (30-90mins/day of varying intensities, 6-7days/week), then added in 30-60mins of swimming or cycling 3-4 days/week after the runs.  1-2 hours of straight cardio is mentally easier for me to handle than spending 10 minutes determining how many calories are in a meal I'm going to consume.

Everyone's different, I know.  Counting calories works for some people,but I'm certainly not unique or special in my preferences.  I know a lot of people who would spike up their weekly mileage instead of going on a "diet" if they had to drop a few pounds.Keeping it real here.

Your bodyfat percentage is probably a good bit higher than that.
You probably don't consume as many calories as you think. No matter what, you're not eating enough. Since you asked what macros were somewhere in here, I'm guessing you don't track calories/macros, so that furthers my idea that you think you're eating more than you actually are.

I will investigate that. Since my cut is 700 calories (0,2lb a day). But what do I do with the water weight? and thanks for the linkRemoved for rule #2, sorrySize is everything. Are you an idiot? Lol? We work out to either get slimmer or bigger.Dude, you weren't fucking kidding. I popped over, figured I'd get at least a light workout in, just to maintain the routine if nothing else. Started on the leg press...soreness was almost totally gone by the third set. Squats and DL were on the lighter side but I fucking did it! Legs are jelly now, but not super painful. :)Sounds about right, and your progress is about where I would put it over a 2 month span. Over an hour of rigorous weightlifting can burn upwards of a thousand calories. 3-4 times a weeks yields roughly an extra 500 cals a day above maintenance. I'm 6'5" and I sit about 2500 - 2700 a day, so 3000 sounds reasonable. My new flavor of whey pretty often doesnt't fully breakdown when I shake it up. Leaving chunky whey occasionally when I drink... :(

Thoughts on a remedy? Shaking harder/longer has -not- worked. I would rather stay with water to avoid changing out my calories throughout the day.It's bad and any site called brobible.com is also bad. You get used to it

Source: [My hands](http://i.imgur.com/fKefy2r.jpg)One occasionally reads about sarcoplasmic hypertrophy versus myofibrillar hypertrophy where the latter is associated with high intensity and is better for powerlifting and the former is correlated more with size and how much lactic acid your muscles can handle.

Is there any reality in this distinction?I recently have injured the muscles in the shoulders. I have been doing crossfit for about 6 months and recently have developed tendinitis and scar tissue build up around the rotator cuffs. I have been been doing better the past few weeks with really watching what I am doing, warming them up and cooling down the shoulders every workout. Any other suggestions? http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_startedWhat's the consensus on ZMA? Anecdotally it helps me when I'm stressed at work. I take it with green tea caps.

I didn't know it was touchy.

Thanks though, I'll definitely be tracking everything much closer from here on out.I never use a sauna, but I live in an area where the summers are often hot and humid. I can see what you mean, it is nice sometimes to just sit outside and sweat (as long as I have water and an a/c'd building to go back to). YouTube's algorithm favors long form contentMacros are short for macronutrients.  In most fitness conversations, that means the breakdown of how many grams of carbs, fats, and protein you are taking in.No that's not how it works.  The BBB is pretty strict in regard to who responds to complaints and who doesn't.  Take a look at them on the BBB for yourself.  They had 2300 complaints in the past three years, and resolved all of them. 

Also, it is worth mentioning here that she has nothing to lose by calling the BBB and everything to gain.I know you're joking I just wanted to be a dweeb hahaRead the other comment. Promise that it works 100%. You go back to the gym and keep lifting.I'd say ground flax seed is still worth supplementing with despite this. But you are 100% correct in that Flax seed doesn't contain the DHA Omega-3's you look to find in fish.Thanks! I need to find a chart with our Uni's food cals on it or something Just keep lifting.Fap gainsWell you obviously get your mom to talk to his mom and they'll straighten this whole thing out.

Seriously, get over it.  Some people are dicks.  You aren't required to pay attention to them.Foam Roller may help. Unless your school's rec doubles as a top-of-the-field research laboratory, no form of measurement device they have can be accurate to that degree.  If anyone has told you that this device is accurate to even 1% accuracy, they grossly misunderstand what the device does.

It's not the variance in calories that's the issue, it's that you're not sure what you're taking in each day.  Are you sure you're even getting to 2500? Start keeping track of your calorie intake.
