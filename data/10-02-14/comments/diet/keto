I thought I could of done harm by taking in too much protein thus knocking me out of Ketosis.I still do. No reason to stop. I just have to set alarms to remind me now. Thank you for the advice everyone. When I got the measurements, I was actually surprised as my clothes are starting to fit better along seeing noticeable differences in my face.I still do! Not saying I stopped but I have to set alarms now which I never had to do before!Awesome. 

I know this in my head that if i put on muscle the scale might 'go up' I guess but I have lived my life obese for so long that I am terrified of gain - even though it would be healthy muscle gain.

I'm sitting at around 17% body fat now (as calculated by my FitBit Aria scale for what thats worth). Would love to get rid of the mid section of my stomach and get it flat flat flat! Those sound good! 

I'm not so much worried about the eating fish part, but about hitting my macros based on one meal a day without gorging myself.I also brew my own Thai tea, then add sweetener and some heavy cream. Delicious as a dessert.If there's a bodega or truck stop nearby, you can usually find it. If not, I think you can buy packs that you cook at home from Amazon.Tip: Invest in belt which doesn't use set holes: braided belts, canvas sliding belts, etc.

 It's kind of embarrassing having a belt go half way around you but if you're *tight* on money you can save buying mid sizes.  That's the only reason I haven't bought a whole new wardrobe yet.

If you love shopping and want to budget in new clothes though that's also an option. I do my own chocolate too. Usually just chocolate sauce, in a minute... Personally I find coffee a vital part, it tastes way better to me, I love coffee. I add a wee bit of keshew too.
I think the possibilities are endless... Chilli, coconut, keto caramel filling, a little rum, pistachios, there are zillion variations :) I usually just use coconut oil, a cocoa, a little strong coffee (my mix would be too dry anyway since I don't use honey. when I did, it was perfectly smooth without coffee), eythritol, a tiny amount of cashew and that's all, I mix it and it's ready to eat.
But if I add an egg yolk for every 10 grams of coconut oil, it becames especially wonderful, I could spread it on a cake but I typically just eat it up...

It melts, yep. I never tried coconut butter but it's on my todo list. It's very expensive for me right now and I could live my life without it pretty well.Do you dip them in sugar between bites?Vyvanse here, and I find that IF comes naturally between the meds and Keto in general. I've been trying to eat regularly as of late, but found that it's slowed my weight loss almost to a halt the past few days, where I was losing about 2 lb/day initially. Could be related to the initial loss, but even then, at my current weight (320), I should still see a decent loss daily. 

Scheduling an intentional IF tomorrow to see if the weight loss picks up again.winter stuff does tend to be sweeter, I think they force themselves to make more sugar through photosynthesis to live longer or something like that.I feel pretty good... not hungry at all (the meal was filling) but im not very energetic...(dont wanna get out of bed and do the things I need to get done kinda feeling)Obviously you should still be brushing/flossing as much as you always have, but I put that clean feeling down to consuming no sugar and drinking lots more water.ok, thank you so much! I was worried it was way to low because i read that most people wake up with a fasting blood sugar of 80 or so. 
First I've heard of it. Maybe ask over at /r/ketoscience - they'll have better info about this sort of thing.Congrats buddy. Keep it up!!I would figure out your current body fat % (lots of accurate and not as accurate methods of calculating) and get a realistic goal that is maintainable for you (No fat at all isn't healthy).  You might find that you are at a desirable body fat % currently(8%-12%) and just need to do some strength training to increase your lean body mass.  Obviously you have the dedication to transform your body just need to keep realistic goals if you want to continue to improve and possibly change your routine as your goals change.  Body fat % and lean body mass are more telling than total weight now that you are no longer obese.  Either way awesome progress bro!Lifting. As in barbells.Sadly, only after I told him so.

We are working on a new one -web based one- soon for www.ketogains.comI've noticed this too. I noticed more nutty flavors (and the chocolatey ones) in coffee since cutting out the sugar. I have a new appreciation for my Blue Bottle subscription.I would cancel the appointment entirely, lol. Dieticians are generally not able to do much for you, and will probably want to put you on the same cookie cutter diet they put everyone on. He gave you an 'atta boy at the bottom!Yep, I get really thirsty. Usually the 6-10L includes 2L of water that is mixed with electrolyte packets as well.Just let that comment slide off of you. People say what they say while knowing only a part of the picture. You're not weak/less manly/whatever for having specific dietary needs and following them. Taking on a victim mentality and letting yourself feel like crap despite there being options to make yourself feel better right in front of you? That'd be pretty weak. You take control of your diet and how you feel. Pretty boss way to live life, in my opinion. I'm confused about the to satiety portion. Did you add lime juice for satiety - or you ate that meal until you were satiated ? Well 23/1 doest imply ultra low calories but in fact eating all your days macros in an hour window. One day is not big deal but if you plan on more you still need to get adequate protein and calories. That sounds fantastic! Thanks!How do you feel?I've read elsewhere that it doesn't have the same negative effects as transfats from man-made hydrogenated oils.I work at Target, and our Mossimo skinny jeans are at 70% off! Check them out and get a pair at $7-9 a pair! Energy in the morning, I experienced that. It's one of the main reasons I really try to get back  on  the wagon! I'm a morning zombie normally (I'm way more awake at 3am than in the morning, my brain is kind of asleep till noon), so having way more energy was amazing. I want it back!

Getting tired earlier... I don't remember such thing but I didn't do keto for long. It would be nice to me, I always go to bed too late because I'm not tired or sleepy at all and it's no good as it's interferes with my already handicapped morning state...Its a rip off of my calculator.That calculator is based on my Excel Spreadsheet and I only got credit when I called the author upon it.

Ruled me just steals content from all over the web and posts it as its own.

We are working on a web based version of my Ketogains macro calculafor which will be available soon.Yes, it's fine. Do you feel fine? Keto is often associated with lower blood glucose but people remain asymptomatic. If you feel symptoms then I would be concerned and call your doctor but if you're not otherwise diabetic it shouldn't be an issue though that raises the question of why are you checking your blood sugar? &gt; They told me my total cholesterol was high risk

You can't really assess high risk with total cholesterol alone which is why these health assessment screenings can be troublesome

&gt; Should I get a full blood test before I panic

There's no need to panic. It usually takes 3-6 months for lifestyle changes to affect lipid profile and moreover weight loss alone will affect your lipid profile. Just get a lipid profile at your next annual check up.  Do you drink that much water because of thirst? I drink 1-2 liters a day. I never wake up to pee unless I drink more than that. My urine is mostly clear or light yellow which means you're hydrated.Do you count eggs as meat?  What about cheese?
Also, how have you eaten fish that you dislike it so?  A different method of preparation can transform the eating experience.YES!! I have totally noticed this too!  Awesome benefit!Are you looking for fish recipes?  It's only a couple of months, and it's once a week fish, can you tolerate it that long? If so perhaps you can find some fish options you enjoy.  I do 23/1 IF but that means I still eat everyday. 

* Steamed mussels
* Salmon with spinach and Hollandaise sauce
* Tuna melt with portobello mushrooms or stuffed tomatoes
* Baked cod with tomatoes, Feta and olives 
* Parmesan crusted cod or any other white fish
* Shrimp scampi 
* Seared tuna
Not all of Peets beans are dark roast, but they do dark roast better than anyone else. If you ever get a chance to try Ethiopian Supernatural, it's incredible. It has these amazing berry flavors; it's like drinking blueberry pancakes.I do a lot of fondue, and usually just use veggies as dippers, but I might try making some keto breadsticks to dip this year! To make the fondue. I just use my fondue pot and add in some cheeses like cheddar and gruyere and some cream cheese and a dash of white wine and let it simmer.That's how I pretty much view bread and rolls and such, as a dessert.Took me almost 3 weeks to feel good. Really depends. Think about what you're not eating and how much nutrition you really get from them. Starchy foods usually are not super nutritious, with a few exceptions. When it comes to micronutrients, you'll get those from your vegetables. I take a multi just to make sure. There are also a lot more micronutrients in meat than you might think.   

Also fish. Eat fish.  

Eat your vegetables, you'll be fine. You are probably getting more vitamins now than you did before you went on keto.   

You may want to supplement electrolytes.I have not used that, as we suggest the keto calculator on the sidebar instead. ------------------------------------------------------&gt;

You can download /u/darthluiggi's excel workbook that allows you to input your actual exercise minutes instead.  It is located on the sidebar at /r/ketogains.Yup, looks good.  

Fat and protein are not relative to each other.  Protein is relative to lean body mass and activity. Fat is for calories and satiety.

* Limit carbs
* meet your protein goal
* Fat to satiety unless eating at too high of a deficit

Exceedingly high fat = exceedingly high calories = slower to no weight loss

It's net grams not ratios or percentages of macronutrients.Floaty?Awesome. I was just worried that the much lower calorie count would have to be balanced by like a huge increase in protein or something, which given my disdain for fish would likely have to come form supplements or something. 

Thanks!Totally go for it. It's like 3.50 a loaf just to warn you Yeah, but it would be a start. I'd only be trying to get him under 30 carbs a day at first. We have such a solid food routine that if I were just able to swap a couple of things he'd be on the diet without doing anything at all. We love sugar.There have been multiple posts about nightsweats in this sub. I know because I did a search before posting this, however the answer I was looking for wasn't in any of them. 

Also as I said, this started since I began keto, so I would assume it's related. Thanks for your input but I don't think a visit to the doctor is necessary.&gt; Fresh roasts from places who don't overroast the beans

You missed that part.I'll have to try that! I think my next attempt will be: Egg wash with HWC, pork rinds/Parmesan.Plenty of people on Keto eat on 23/1 schedule (one meal per day).  Just practice a few times heading in and that week should be a breeze.Sometimes one. [Here's](http://restlesspalate.com/coconut-oil-chocolate-recipe/) a decent recipe.  You can, of course, sub out to any sweetener you want if any.

It's basically cocoa powder and coconut oil.  The only downside to this is that coconut oil melts at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, so it will melt in your fingers but man does it make a REALLY easy ganache like chocolate.  You can even add some toasted unsweetened coconut for some extra fiber and flavor.

EDIT:
You can also easily get [cocoa butter](http://www.bulkapothecary.com/cocoa-butter.html) that you can add to make a more traditional chocolate.  I prefer the traditional cocoa butter and cocoa powder chocolate but you can mix and match the coconut oil and cocoa butter to get some interesting finished products.I have never heard of this before and I don't think it has anything to do with your diet. See a doctor.During the last nine months I haven't counted any calories at all; I just made sure I ate 20 g of carbs or less a day.
During the summer months between May and October I played tennis four times a week and now that it's in the winter months I play squash four or five times a week. I do not do any weightlifting at all.
I would say I eat less than 1800 cal a day and I play squash for usually two hours at a time which is about 800-1000 calories burned per hour (avg or estimate).
Some days I'm very strict with my eating some days I definitely go over 1800 as an estimate.Good to know. This is where I got my stats from:

http://www.ruled.me/keto-calculator/That's crazy progress! This is very motivating. What kind of exercise did you do and what did your calorie intake look like?These people exhaust me. My challenge is that despite the fact that I spent a good amount of time reading and studying the subject before I decided to experiment with keto, I'm not particularly good at explaining it, so I get accused of being uneducated and naive. It's working for me. I'm challenging myself psychologically as well as physically. I'm losing weight that's been stubbornly stuck on me for months. I'm becoming more aware of what's in my food. Honestly, anyone who is putting extra work into taking care of themselves earns my respect, whether that's keto, Paleo, or even a high carb raw diet. Kudos to you, I hope you feel awesome. Our bodies are so varied and complex that it takes exploration and experimentation in addition to education to understand yourself. I'll never understand these closed minded cult followings people develop for their nutritional habits. The keto reddit has been the most open minded fitness/diet related reddit I've run into yet. &gt;The last 2 nights I've had the worst insomnia- I usually hit the pillow and drop into dead sleep, but I've been tossing and turning for 2+ hours before falling asleep.

Nurse here. Stress causes the release of cortisol and epinephrin, both of which cause insomnia. Your body is adapting to a new stress and so this wouldn't be surprising. 

Hypokalemia and hyponatremia can both cause N/V. Any chance you are pregnant?Like everyone else said, you should be fine.  You should treat yourself every now and again though.  You basically get a free pass to eat meat, so take advantage of it.  Get a big-ass, good steak, and go to town on that thing!Four slices of the trader joes bread is almost the daily limit of carbs alone, 16 carbs..... I'd rather get those from veggies but that's just meA lot of it depends on your goals and what you are doing at the gym.  However, 80g of protein is way too low, so you should move over to /r/ketogains and read their FAQ.Thank you for answering!Italian or creamy Cesar works just as well. Oil-vinaigrette. Any salad dressing thats keto will work perfectly.  Even yogurt or hummus. I've been on the diet off and on for years, and I can do without bread. My husband is so set on having 2 pieces of toast with his eggs in the morning and a pb &amp; j for lunch that I want to be able to substitute it.  I really hope my trader joes carries that bread.  I don't mind baking occasionally but I don't want to do it all the time! im gonna give it a try, so.. following the same logic... a 100% cacao bar from bakers is even healthier than a 75% bar of chocolate then?that sounds delicious, what brand of 100% cacao do you use for your mixture? You still need to floss and brush. [There are tons of threads on teeth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=teeth&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)I occasionally eat it too, it is quite bitter, but what I find is that I dont miss the sugar, i just need that velvety chocolate texture. From the Keto calculator (guessing your age), I'm getting these stats. If you really are 16% BF, you're eating too little protein.

Eat around 118g of protein for a mid range.

24/M/5'8" | CW 176 | 16% BF | Mostly sedentary

* 1588 kcal Goal, a 25% deficit. (1377 min, 2118 max)

I haven't been waking up since I started making sure my water was all in by 6:00 pm or so. I do wake up thirsty, but I know I'm not dehydrated since I get all of my water during a 24 hour period. I'm just dry mouthed when I wake up. Before I stopped the water a few hours before bed I was up a few times a night. Now I sleep all night. You on a deficit? Do you exercise? I found that a large caloric deficit with heavy lifting affects my sleep quality.Just use any dressing that you would like in a salad? Ranch, blue cheese, Caesar are usually all low-no carb choices. If you are following the 0.8g/LBM pound advice, you were taking 142g protein instead of 111g protein.  Lyle McDonald recommends 150g of protein the first 2-3 weeks anyways, so you were doing fine.My go to meal is to buy just a package of 400 gr wok vegetables, all cut up and done;

and add meat that is on discount, usually chicken or ground beef. Please describe the taste of the culinary masterpiece please.Post your height and sex and macros People will be happy to double check your macros for you.i have a bit of a problem with this "bone broth" trend. it's *stock*, people. (yes it's delicious, and i have like 8qts in my freezer at all time, but why do we have to call it 'bone broth'? that's like calling steak 'meat steak')Did they ask you to join crossfit too?
It looks lovely. I wish I could stomach mayo, I just hate the taste. It's one of the things that has put me off unwitches, the fact that they just turn out dry and bland because I can't find an appropriate dressing/sauce that I actually like the taste of. Not sure how to get around it really.I don't think I could sell him on that! Baby steps. I don't but it looks similar to lightly breaded chicken, the crust tends to slightly thin. Yes, sorry I meant 3 months not 4.Thanks, I'll look into that. Small amounts of trans fat naturally occur in beef, so it's not an intrinsic thing to be worried about.I'm actually having a hard time finding pork rinds near me. I've looked at the grocery store and 7-11 type places. Apparently in Boston, people are too "healthy" to eat them. :(

The grocery store used to carry one kind a few years ago but slowly stopped.mmm cake
I can actually smell chocolate from across the room now. I can pick out sweetness everywhere in (what feels like to me) an almost superhuman fashion. If you want Pita/wraps or a base for a pizza then these are pretty good and 4g net carbs. Not really splittable in the same way a pita is though so I sue them more like wraps or cut into quarters as the top and bottom for a handheld burger 

https://www.josephsbakery.com/shop/flax-oat-bran-whole-wheat-pita-bread.htmlOh yeah I'm stoked about my results so far! Just that first day was really rough. I weighed myself today and I'm down another pound. If you want Pita/wraps or a base for a pizza then these are pretty good and 4g net carbs.  Not really splittable in the same way a pita is though so I sue them more like wraps or cut into quarters as the top and bottom for a handheld burger
Hard cheeses are usually near zero carbs per serving. They are the ones that typically have been aged for the longest. The cheesemaking bacteria have had the most time to eat the lactose. An example of a soft cheese is cottage cheese. You can still eat soft cheeses on keto, just have toe more careful about the carbs adding up.I had some almond milk this morning and realized how much more sensitive my taste buds are now. Crazy!I've had similar conversations with Paleo-ers! I get the natural, whole foods movement, and I like where it's going in terms of promoting healthier food choices over processed carp. However...carbs galore with some foods!

I think as soon as I go into maintenance mode, I'll venture into some Paleo meal territory, but I'll be as low carb as I can. I used to do Paleo, and I only lost a little bit of weight. Keto is far better for me and my goals! I've found the /r/paleo sub to be pretty negative actually. I think there's a lot more to argue about since paleo has no hard set rules.I have the same issue. I got 10 hours of sleep on Tuesday night. I felt good most of the day. Came around to 8 - 8:30 last night and I knocked out and did not want to get up this morning. Another 10 hours of sleep last night and I would love to go back to sleep.Yeah but you lost 4 pounds! So that's good, right?Wow that is early! I usually went to bed at 2am when I finally felt tired, but now I am getting tired by about 10pm. So I guess it is also easier to fall asleep too. :)Agreed.  The benefits of committing and sticking to this diet far outweigh that "reward" you think you are giving yourself. 

But also on that note, don't beat yourself up if you do cheat.  Move on with even more resolve. Health. Lowering blood pressure. I though it was peanut butter at first - now I want a peanut butter and bacon unwich dammit!I've gone keto multiple times and for me, this IS normal. But only for a short period of time. About 2-4 weeks into the start of it. 
I make a big plate of food after not having eating much or very little during the day. I start eating and suddenly its not appetizing. I stop after having eaten a little bit.    
I think its part of the adjustment to the different types of food and the schedule. After about a month into it, it goes away and I can eat normally.   
As a side note, I do NOT follow macros. I don't load up on fat like many do.Yep... I'm with youI have been an insomniac since I was 14 or 15. I take melatonin every night and it usually helps. I'll lie in bed for 30-40 minutes before I pass out and wake up 3-4 times a night. I have slept like a baby the past 2 weeks with very vivid dreams. When I wake up, I'm actually well rested and have more energy.

I didn't even put the two together! I do sleep and wake at around the same time daily. Slim Jims are functionally like Pepperami in that they are shelf stable preserved meat sticks typically sold as a convenience snack - slim jims taste like arse though - Pepperami Firestick FTW - since I morved to the US they are one of few foods I miss - the others being proper pork scratchings and Colston Basset stiltonHmm I'd add some cheese to the flour then. That will probably help it stick a little better. Have you tried pork rind breading? I think it sticks better and gets gets crunchier than almond flour. If you're doing keto properly (that is, following the macros that the calculator provides you, and keeping up on water and electrolyte intake), you couldn't possibly be doing harm.

Keto, so far as every scientific, medical, and anecdotal piece of evidence I know of shows, is straightforwardly healthier than high-carb eating.

Also, if you're eating at a proper deficit, you'll be losing weight in no time, if you aren't already!NH here. Even my snow-loving ass is getting a little tired off all this shovelling. The snow banks around my driveway are officially over my head now.What's the rest of your life like? If I'm stressed or busy the amount of sleep doesn't make a difference Hey! I started the same day you did! What fools we were huh? I'm also 30F though on the other side of the country. I'm hoping to lose about 90lbs.

Are you on my fitness pal? Let's be friends on there and root for each other!Kosher hot dogs (check the carb count)

Pumpkin seeds 

Almonds, pecans, walnuts, etc.

Canned chicken (add pesto or mayo)

I feel your pain! I woke up 3-4 times a night. I started tapering my consumption about 3 hours before I go to bed, which has knocked it down to 1-2 pees per night. Also, when I wake up with dry mouth, I don't glug the water like I do in the day, I just sip it and go back to sleep. Seems to do the trick.That sounds much more reasonable than what I did -- two tablespoons right after my first keto breakfast, when I still wasn't used to all that meat so early in the morning. sourdough is what I miss the most.  Honestly, I could eat a whole artisan loaf on my own.Rice?  How can rice be a paleo food?  Isn't the whole deal that you don't eat any grains?  Isn't it a pre-agriculture diet?It's like a superpower. I can taste the surgar in onions and peppers.I threw up a little bit and then got terrible diarrhea... at work. I'd suggest that you read the /r/ketogains FAQ and follow their protein intake recommendations.Creatine I'm on Adderall and I get lightheaded/dizzy/confused/anxious/tired when I don't eat for more than 4-6 hours. These symptoms can be tied to general hunger, but I feel that they are exacerbated by being on a stimulant insofar as my meds tell me I have energy, while my body disagrees, resulting in clunky functioning.

Rather than IF, I eat at specific times--7:30am, Noon and 6:30pm--each around 300 calories of high fat, protein and greens. I also drink a lot of water with the meal and try to take 20-30 min to eat. If you pick at your meal for 30 min, you finish 30 minutes closer to your next meal, which makes it a little easier. The high water consumption helps to mitigate the pangs as well. It get's easier the more I do it, and it seems to be creating a healthier baseline for my portion sizes. I find myself snacking and binging far less than ever before. 

Play around with your calories and see how you feel.You're fine. How would you have done harm? Just curious No, you're fine. Oh its there! I just cropped a little better lol
Maybe the HWC is what mine is missing. I just did straight egg. Chipotle mayo made by boars head. Its so damn good. Yea, and I could find studies saying the opposite.  I tried this and ended up with a coating double the thickness that still flaked off. I wake up at 4am so getting tired "earlier" is normal for me but then again if I'm not actively preparing for bed and late at work or otherwise occupied I don't get tired. But when I am at home at the usual hour I go to sleep and not active I'm tired and ready for bed. You might check electrolytes if you feel unusually tired or is it more that it's easier to fall asleep?Thanks for the imput friend, not only the budget, I am 17 with no real knowledge on cooking, also a full time student and at the gym most of the time so it's hard to fit meals in between. I need to lift lol. We have similar SW and GW. I have the most stubborn spare tire. 
Great progress.  The past two days in Louisiana we have been getting up to 70! We get random shorts weather, but today and tomorrow we're back down to highs of 50, then back to 70 Saturday and 50 on Sunday. 

Can we just have some consistency, please?!What happened to the picture by the toilet?Those are basically fine.  "Slim Jims" are small snack sized sausages (around 1/2 inch diameter and 4 to 8 inches long) usually sold at the check-out line and in service stations.  Not refrigerated and hence lots of preservatives.That's one of the nicest looking lettuce leaf sandwiches I've seen. What's the orange stuff? Mustard? Or some other dressing?Anyone who wants to make a group on Skype so we could talk to each other on a daily basis! Ask questions, support group and stuff? 

If you're game then send me your skype ids and let's get this thing going!! :D The quality of the food you consume matters no more on keto than any other diet - keto is about the macros not the micros.

That said - the quality of the food we consume SHOULD matter, regardless of our diet since believe that science bears out the notion that livestock raised in a more natural manner (free range, grass fed, low stress etc) seems to lead to better micronutrients, better Omega 6/3 balance etc.

In a realistic sense, we cannot all suddenly start eating "all natural" foods as the current industry cannot sustain that sort of demand.  Most people - myself included - couldn't afford to eat what we eat unless we make a few compromises and buy factory farmed and/or processed meats from time to time.

All things being equal or if I can afford it, I will spend the extra to buy grass fed beef, dry cured bacon, free range pork etc for the taste, the presumed nutritional advantage, and the ethical angle.Would it be reasonable to increase my protein intake to 75 grams according to blurfocus? Thanks xI don't know much about egg fast. I love eggs and they are great food but I find an egg fast unnecessarily extreme.
I automatically started IF when I started keto (well I actually did something like IF before too, breakfast never was my thing, it's just the eating window was long, like 8-10 hours. Now it's 4-6 hours), it's very natural for me, very pleasant, convenient and helps me losing weight (at least on keto, I can eat really big meals otherwise). Even if I do IF, I do what always: I eat when I'm hungry. I'm simply not hungry till afternoon. Keto and IF - a great combo for me,  I love it!

But I can't know what your experiences will be, of course. To me, IF only has advantages. So I think you should try it, maybe it's your thing.I'm not. I'm indifferent about them.

Can we be friends now? :DDo a little searching.  You'll find that not only is there no evidence for vitamin supplements in healthy individuals but there is a casual correlation between them and sickness. Save your money. I see, thank you for your reply :)YesI have seen that said around the subreddit, but did you also find you get tired earlier too?Thanks! Now I know the types of fat :)Ok, maybe I wasn't clear enough. "Preaching" to other people you're doing a better, harder, healthier (inject suitable adverb) is NOT gonna give you social brownie points.

Thank you for the advice and I ment sausages like these sorry I'm from the uk and have no idea what slim jims are :P http://images2.mysupermarket.co.uk/Products_1000/67/306167.jpg?v=5?1423757632538%20=1423757632538Sub minerals.  
Avoid multi-Vitamins.
If you don't get a lot of sun light sub vitamin D. 
Get regular checkups and blood work. I don't know anyone who's had a deficiency on keto besides the things mentioned. That is most definitely not normal. See a doctor about this, you might have trouble digesting certain foods. Has your diet been low in fats for a while? Were you vegetarian previously? Did you just change my life?I'm guessing your future mother-in-law is just insulted that you didn't eat what she made for you, or forced her to make something that wasn't her specialty.  Is that a possibility?  As for feeling weak, I have about five or ten pounds that I'd like to lose, and I'm a pastry chef and artisan bread baker and confectioner.  When it comes to diet, I'm the strongest person I know. By rights I should be overweight, what with my line of work, and everyone assumes I'm gobbling up crusty sourdough and cream puffs and nougat.  I would love to eat the wonderful foods I make.  But I don't.  It takes almost superhuman effort to resist this stuff!  So stand proud, and maybe try to explain to her that you are doing this for medical reasons!Provided you are actually eating a good, balanced keto diet (like you're not just eating cheese and diet pop and calling it keto), the only area where you might lack vitamins would be electrolytes. Sodium, potassium, magnesium. The reason we have that problem is that in a perfect keto world, you'd be consuming MUCH more animal product than you probably consume today. Organs, blood, etc. That's where those electrolytes would normally come from.

That being said, a multivitamin probably can't hurt. You could always get bloodwork done and decide what's best with your doctor based on your result.Lol I'm 6 feet and the snow banks tower over me in some spotsThings like this make me glad I'm not male. There are definite downsides to being female, but at least my midnight pissing is efficient :)Improved sleep is a common keto side effectPaleo has a lot of cult mentality (like most diets) and has been adding more carbs back into it as what's "allowed" over the last few years and a lot of it's proponents have championed 100-200g of carbs per day from starchy vegetables, rice, quinoa etc as well as from fruits.

Fruits is the biggest argument I get from paleoers. They all seem to ignore that for the majority of the planet all of those foods are extremely seasonal.Never, ever talk with paleo or vegan people lol. (kidding)
Paleo is a very broad term. It comes of course from paleolithic which means stone age or before agriculture. But, homo sapiens has spread around the world and there were a lot of different diets. People in Indonesia ate differently than the inuit or the vikings or people in Chile. There are also genetic differences because of that. Like the P479L gene or the fact that lactose tolerance is different for people around the globe for example. So, paleo is a very loose term. 

I do paleo, but keto. I eat raw salmon, egg yolks, avocado, vegetables, etc..... But you can also eat bananas the whole day and do paleo. It doesn't mean anything. You have living food, raw food, paleo, cavemen and god knows how many diets.

But it is all personal. You have to find what works for you and that will also change throughout your life. It's a personal journey. The body is a very complex biochemical machine and everyone has a slighty different one.

But we do know that HFCS and too much carbs are not the way to go. :-)
I've been on keto almost 5 months, and I have the same problem :p Well, maybe not to the same extent. I usually drink some water during the day, and then polish off a 1.5 liter bottle of seltzer water in the evening. Some evenings I'm thirstier though, and drink 2 bottles (3 liters) and I'm only exaggerating a little when I say I have to get up to pee once an hour all night long :p My big meal of the day is dinner, and I'm a salt fiend, so I'm pretty sure my sodium is fine. Congratulations on your sobriety - I have someone in my life whom I am very close to who is beginning that journey for herself, as well. I'm as proud of you as I am of her.

It's so funny, because I don't and never have been a drinker... so I've actually experienced your story from the other side. People being like, "but... what do you DO for fun??" Your anecdote totally makes sense though... experiencing someone who exists completely outside your understanding could stand to be confusing. I hope I'm not giving her an identity crisis, lmao.90% Lindt tastes like a Candy bar :)

I buy a stack regularly, and ended up getting an 85% in the mix. Didn't realize until I ate some of it - even that small difference was very noticeable.Check the ketogains FAQ.

1 lb a week is about top end to avoid muscle loss.

Don't force it.I guess my point is:  most cheeses seem pretty low in carbs, even traditional soft cheeses like gorgonzola and Roquefort.  Compared to many other food groups, cheeses across the board always seemed to me to be a safe bet.  Was wondering if I was missing some.I can see where the idea could come from. Like you can't control your cravings or have no will power. I totally get that people can see you that way for eating a diet whose benefits include reduced hunger and no cravings.  

I know that for me, if I decide to break my diet and eat pizza, for example, I will have a very hard time eating just one or two slices. Is it a weakness? Is it a character flaw? Yes. It absolutely, definitely, certainly is. I will not dispute that. However, which do you think is a better course of action? To try and work against those cravings and risk caving and overeating, or to acknowledge your weaknesses and employ a plan that eliminates them?  



I think it's the same reason people keep putting more and more sugar in stuff. You enjoy the sugar taste but get desensitized.

I like coffee and chocolate. You start off pretty weak and work stronger. So now I'm using an aeropress and 2-3 tables spoons of coffee per cup and 100% cacao.I'm so ready! It's been *years*.I wonder if its from the sugar, or just the highly refined flour that starts converting to glucose in your mouth almost immediately. A slice of wonder bread only has 2-3g of sugar, hardly enough to make it taste like cake.Holy crap.   I've never thought to put cream in it.  Is it like drinking a root beer float then???Maybe a dumb question but all the prepackaged burgers I've seen have at least 2g of trans fat. Is that okay to be consuming or is that a type of fat to avoid?You really should try IBC root beer.  Fantastic stuff.Technically, no.  Keto is about adequate protein, limiting carbs, and eating fat to satiety.  However, after you learn these basics, then you get into other discussions about fat composition, toxins, preservatives, additives, sustainability, etc.

Much of the advice on /r/keto is about how to successfully implement the lifestyle and hopefully improve your health, and eating whole foods instead of Atkins bars is an example.  If you are talking about "Slim Jims" type pre-packaged sausages, they are probably fine in a pinch, however I wouldn't make them a large part of my diet.Self-discpline isn't an issue with me but availability of low-carb foods is a huge issue. I can't cook meat because I stay in a vegetarian household..So only cottage cheese.BUT THE CANCERZ!!11one 

If you're anti-artificial sweetener we can't be friends. As a Dietitian I feel superior to my peers, because I know and they are too ignorant and brainwashed to even seeYup, that's the thing. I like spicy food but it's got to be home-made. Even if I exercise, I tend to gain weight so low-carb is the only the thing working for me with the reactive hypo.

Feels so frustrating to see others gorge on carbs and not having choices.here is a link that seems to have a pretty good discussion

http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1yfysw/are_saturated_fats_as_good_as_unsaturated_fats/Mayonnaise, ranch, or low carb ketchup are all great!No problem, enjoy!Today i slept 10 hours. I had to go three times :/ It pissed me off...Ooo. That sounds great! Do you have photos of the mayo fried version?Keto is about ketosis so no, meat quality doesn't matter as long as you achieve ketosis. However for most keto is also about overall health and so you might consider not just eating processed meats and incorporating other meat as well4 slices?? Shiiit, maybe he should quit bread cold turkey and do lettuce wraps instead.Judging by your comment history I would say that you have a tendency to go on to other people's celebratory threads an cut them down and call them fat so I'm just going ignore this and take my doctor's advice. I think you should consider seeing a mental health care professional yourself if that's how you get your kicks. Carbs for cheese varies, if the package says 0 then it's no more than 0.4 grams per serving I know you're leaving your job soon, so thankfully you won't have to confront her on a daily basis anymore.  But just gonna add a brief anecdote, in case you encounter any similar characters... I quit drinking over 7 1/2 years ago at 19 years old.  Now when I meet people that also don't drink I think it's great.  But when I was a raging alcoholic I remember meeting this one guy at college who didn't drink, and didn't have any obvious 'tells' (still went to bars, wasn't mormon or uber religious, etc.)  I also thought he was really cool, and he was the only person I ever remember meeting that was cool AND didn't drink, at the same time!  This was like a bomb to my entire world view, and every time I saw him I would ask him about it, probably to the point of being annoying.  I didn't even realize if I was being annoying at the time -- to me, he was like a confusing human specimen who I needed to understand, due to my own problem with alcohol, of course.  My point being, maybe she has a really unhealthy relationship with food or her body, and the thought of seeing someone actively changing their body is something she sees as beyond her comprehension.  Not sure if this is helpful at all, just trying to offer some possible insight into why people act crazy sometimes. Usually it's because we are, indeed, crazy.  But we can always get better.  At least I like to think so.  When you see her you can be happy that you're living in the solution, and pray that she also finds her solution.  That's what I try to do, anyway.Even within /r/keto you have wildly varied beliefs that make discussions harder than they ought to be.



I've never brought up keto or dieting with anyone in person, but I end up being asked about it all the time anyway.I'm different. I have a different constitution, I have a different brain, I have a different heart. I got Tiger Blood.Yes, it will. When I do IF I drink black coffee with stevia by the liter.
Next to the caffeine fix it will help to suppress your hunger a bit.

But, as anbeav said, the main benefit of IF is the convenience and simplicity. I also like to do a 16/8 or a 18/6 always but sometimes hanging out with carb friends make it difficult.
I overlap.
During my cycle each month I add berries to my yogurt. Or once in a while honey in tea. Banana pancakes maybe once a month.

But that's it for fruit. It still fits my macros. I'm with anbeav, we shouldn't overcomplicate things sticking a mere number... Our body don't work so easily anyway, such numbers are just a guide.
I personally have no such problem, I never could drink coffee black either but spices helped a lot (I usually use coconut milk as well though. or butter. but not in my fast period) and I don't actually need coffee. I'm not an expert at all but I don't think even a coffee with a tiny amount of nut milk would be a problem.Very good point! If I just pick something that would gross them out I may have a shot! :) 
They do have a tasty whole shrimp dish there I know we could all eat. I appreciate the advice!Resistance training = Lifting heavy weights.  It causes your body to react physiologically and can help reshape your body.

No sources for the die &gt; weight lifting &gt; cardio, but have also seen it around a lot as well.Why fight it?  They are not that expensive, they might add some missing nutrients, and they will make your mom feel better if you take them.  Save your silver bullets for more important battles.Sweet baby Jesus

I have been fantasizing about the cream in diet root beer - please tell me its amazing? D:I asked a similar question last time I was on KETO.  below is a link to that thread.  Wasn't super definitive though.

http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1j3dos/gallstones_whats_the_real_deal/This sort of thing really perplexes me. Keto and Paleo are fundamentally similar. While paleo types don't necessarily limit their carbs, they generally eat a very low amount just due to the nature of the diet.   

We also similarly do not eat sugar or grains.   

I do agree that paleo is more strict, mainly because it's an elimination diet that has a lot of restrictions that are not necessary for most people, and a good number of which are based on woo/pesudoscience but do seem to yield results for many people.   

They are both good diets, I think you just caught some elitists (Were they crossfitters? They had to have been crossfitters) who think, like some of us sometimes make the mistake of doing, that they've found some holy grail of health and nutrition and are looking down their nose at anyone who hasn't found the same holy grail.  

No joke. I had a couple strawberries yesterday - fucking unbelievable.They can eat family style and you order your dish to add to the others and just eat that.  I doubt the steamed meat and veggies will be a crowd favorite :)Broth and vitamins are your friend.

Make sure you drink enough water - I have to force/remind myself

If you are not hungry, dont eat. Just because it is 8am, noon or 6pm does not mean you have to eat out of habit.

Jerky, nuts or 99% chocolate is a great thing to keep in your bag in the case that you get a bit nippy

Your main goal is to get in your required amount of protein. After that, the rest is pretty much just filler (eat enough fat/carbs so you are not hungry - but you dont need to hit your limit just because you can)

There is no shame in keeping it simple - bacon and eggs, bunless cheese burger, pork chops with garlic mayo ect. The longer I am on keto, the more I find complex recipes overrated

Go shopping often and get good deals on meat/freeze

Try eating less/intermittent fasting when at a plateau

Be proud of keto. Haters gonna hate, dont let them get you down.

Don't stress about asking to change your rice for a salad and that odd bid of carrot/onion in your curry is not the end of the world.

Straight up cheating on keto is not worth it. bread, pasta, and potatoes become a distant memory after awhile.&gt; anbeav - i'm 5'2.5 52kg, 23% bf eating 1600-1700 cals and counting macros 5%carbs 20% protein and 75% fat. generally losing about 0.5-1lb a week which is fine. But wanted a bit more of a boost before my hols.

&gt; darthluiggi - I didnt think eggs were magical, i'd just heard an egg fast could give you a boost if you were in a plateau.I call that a pee-boner. she sounds like a human pathogen.  yay for you!!! AFAIK you need to possibly supplement sodium, potassium and magnesium Good point - the only thing different is the packaging. I'm the type of person who can't keep "treats" in the house because I'll eat the whole box/bar in one go. I've been experimenting with the really really elaborate and tasty sugar-free gums like Trident Layers because it's only 1 g net carb and it lets me feel like I'm "treating" myself when I'm in the store passing the candy aisle.[Flaxseed crackers in the microwave](http://easylocarb.com/recipe/flaxseed-crackers/) are a great way to eat cheese.During the last nine months I haven't counted any calories at all; I just made sure I ate 20 g of carbs or less a day.

During the summer months between May and October I played tennis four times a week and now that it's in the winter months I play squash four or five times a week. I do not do any weightlifting at all. 

I would say I eat less than 1800 cal a day and I play squash for usually two hours at a time which is about 800-1000 calories burned per hour (avg or estimate). 

Some days I'm very strict with my eating some days I definitely go over 1800 as an estimate. Eat your vegetables and eat a variety of other foods meat, nuts, cheese, fish and no!

If you live on processed meats, no vegetables, and a limited diet, perhaps. Also consider that most people on a SAD diet are not necessarily the picture of nutritional health, the reason the food is fortified is because it's nutritionally deplete.

Your mom seems to be nagging you about keto a lot and I assume she knows nothing about it so you need to either educate her or ignore her

The micronutrients in fruit you can get from other foods and many vegetables are more nutritious than fruit as it's mostly a convenient sugar delivery vesicle

The science-tell me what's in fruit you can't get from other foods? 

I think you might need to explain to your mom that you've researched this, it's safe (provide a copy of the art and science of low carbohydrate living) and ask her to respect your choices and that you don't want to discuss any further. I had the same problem. Going to get it resized some day (it was custom made), but I'm thinking of getting something new to wear as a placeholder.Ahh thank you :) Pinot Noir and sparkling wines/champagne it will be! Much appreciatedNo sugar added dark chocolate seems like a great idea - I was a milk chocolate gal so I have to be careful as it's a slippery slippery chocolatey slope.

I went to a brazilian steakhouse in December pre-keto and I remember feeling soooo guilty about all the meat I ate - Can't believe I didn't think of this sooner!! 

Thank you for the insight and I am in love with the getdrunknotfat (it's my life motto)So at first you disliked it? but at the end you started enjoying it? how much did it last for you to start liking it?.  do you do it because of the health benefits or because U CAN do it? Everybody is different, but I found that I don't get the laxative effect if I take 1 tsp in a small amount of water after a meal.  On an empty stomach... yeah, not good.Make sure your oil is hot before putting the chicken in. I also double bread my chicken. So dip in egg/heavy cream mixture, coat with breading, dip in egg mixture again, coat with breading, shake off any excess, then into the frying pan. Good luck! It's good to get all this idiocy on the record so that when we finally decide collectively to stop the diabetes epidemic we will know who gets tarred and feathered first.

&gt; Experts say starchy food should make up around a third of the food we eat.Yeah, I've upped my g carb / day to 50 since I hit my target weight, and peanut m&amp;ms used to be a staple of mine. They are absolutely 100% candy-coating to me now. I could not taste anything else. It was incredible (not in a good way)That quote stuck with me as well. They're right, because that's essentially how fat accumulation works.

If the effect of carbohydrates made you obese, reintroducing them stands the chance of making you gain all the fat back. Sucks, but that's metabolism for you..I know. I used to work at Peet's coffee.For me in my circles, the term keto has negative connotations, mostly do to the fact that it is food source agnostic (if you wanted to eat 100% processed food you could and still be doing keto correctly.) 

I don't eat lots of processed food, so I generally say I'm low-carb primal. That automatically makes people think whole foods, fresh veggies, etc. I also say primal because dairy, and do not ever say 'my diet is Paleo, but I eat dairy' - the hardliners get upset.

Sometimes I even say IIFYM.  And I don't label my macro set at all, I let everyone make assumptions about the things I eat.

of course, I try to avoid all of the above BS, by following the first rule of keto.I bet it felt great to put it back on! And you're right, what's a few more months? Great job!That's a good idea. =) sweet of him!One of the best bosses was into paleo. Nicest guy ever, ex marine.Thank you!Wow, amazing progress. Let us know some details. Are you counting calories, if yes what's your deficit? How often are you lifting / cardio?
Whyyyyy does nobody read the FAQ?? Sourdough bread actually has a glycemic index of 54, which puts it (barely) in the category of a low-glycemic-index food.Ooh, I'll have to try the Trader joe's stuff. I'm not sure I can make enough cauliflower bread to cover the 4 slices minimum that my husband eats a day. This actually worries me a bit. I'm pretty strict on my keto, and I aim towards zero carbs (really), and accept that there are some hidden carbs or unavoidable carbs.

Except I eat in the company cafeteria, which is ostensibly healthy Chinese food. When I look up a lot of Chinese recipes they often have sugar (a couple of tablespoons for six servings, for example). As a consequence I avoid the food with sauces.

But I really, really love green vegetables. And since starting keto, they taste _so_ danged sweet that they're not as enjoyable, but I also question whether or not they have sugar added. One of the local employees told me it's a winter crop; they're naturally sweet. But it's driving me crazy.

I wonder if I'll like sweet corn when I reach my goal weight?
I couldn't eat all of my dinner last night either.Fresh roasts from places who don't overroast the beans are even more amazing, with coffee there is a wide spectrum of flavors, even if it's a different roast on the same beans...I started looking at the peking duck as well. In my experience there, since they are a dim sum place, they like to put a sweet glaze on the duck, so I will most likely have to avoid it. I want a simple meat and veggies dish. A whole other issue is they want to eat "family style" so I have to share everything too. TKD questions should be adressed in /r/ketogains

Egg Fasts are not magical - they work mostly because you are eating in a controlled deficit and are being accountable with calories and portion controll, not due to some magical properties from Eggs.I'm only on Day 6 so I have the disadvantage of little perspective but the advantage of a fresh memory of Day 1. I haven't "cheated" at all yet, either. When I first configured My Fitness Pal I said I wanted to lose 1.5 pounds a week, and as you can see from my stats I'm not a very large person, so this left me at 1200 calories a day. This is, on average, is what I was eating on my old "healthy" diet with 50% of my calories coming from "healthy" carbs. I'm enjoying the food and new lifestyle and relishing my long lost relationship with butter, but usually still hungry at the end of the day and was feeling really funky at first, probably largely from lack of electrolytes. Once I realized that I was probably severely lacking in sodium, potassium, and magnesium, I took measures to remedy that by making a bone broth and a soup out of chicken bouillon cubes, sauteed mushrooms, avocado, and parsley. Yummy! But I was still hungry and craving dessert, even 1600 calories in. So I topped off my night with a bowl of heavy cream mixed with stevia and vanilla extract. Double yummy! It's easy to make keto treats without "cheating", I just recommend beginning with a simplified approach to what "cheating" actually means -- it means eating carby foods, NOT eating too many calories. At least that's how I'm managing to get through, by being forgiving of myself if I'm still hungry at the end of the day and giving myself a fatty treat. As far as I'm concerned, I can just decrease my calories after my body adapts in a few weeks or on days when I'm less hungry. Once I actually kick into keto, I apparently shouldn't really have many hunger pangs at all and can start experimenting with intermittent fasting. But for now, I'm in no huge hurry to lose weight, and I really don't have much to lose. I'd rather set myself up for success in the long term than shoot for quick gains that are a total joyless chore.  I also read a lot of testimonials and keep reminding myself it's going to get easier.  Best of luck!!

TL;DR: I'm a newb, too.  Get those electrolytes! And if you feel like cheating, just whip up a keto dessert or eat a bunch of cheese or pork rinds or something. It will feel like cheating but it's not.  You could also possibly import some of the "rootbeer mix" or extract from the US too. Usually it is just the flavor packs, you mix it with whatever sweetner and carbonate.Safest thing would be steamed meat and vegetables with soy sauce. Beef and broccoli would not be a good choice as most if not all of the sauces have starch and/or sugar. The Peking duck would be an awesome choice as most aren't cooked with carbs but you might have to double check how they prepare itReally similar stats, from someone who didn't take progress pics, thanks! Really motivating. I was starting to think the same. I'll have to have my girlfriend or her brothers order for me because this is like some OG chinese restaurant stuff going on there.I definitely agree!  I don't think its a finish line, but sometimes I sorta view it that way from a very hard work perspective.  I think i've lost alot quickly because I have been attacking this very aggressively. When I hit 180 I might be able to ease off a little bit and just get into more maintenance instead of 'aggressive loss mode".

Certainly not happy with where I am at yet tho!  For once I'd love to be basically fully trim with no fat at all - I think if I want to reach that I might have to dip below 180 tho!  I guess I will address that when the time comes.  Thanks for your thoughtful response!Ok that totally makes sense.

Thanks for the info!You're welcome to post this in /r/FreeEBOOKS :)The highest estimate I have ever seen is 12 weeks, and that is just for top physical activity.  At 20g carbs, your brain seems to be about 85% transitioned in four days, and two weeks is usually sufficient for basically all brain transition and a good part of system conversion.  Two weeks in seems to be a low point of physical performance, however, as the initial effect of adrenaline wanes.  I have PCOS an endocrine disorder, I tried every diet to lose weight. I ate 1200 calories a day and gained weight! I topped out at 250 before finding keto now I weigh in the 180's and still losing but I am eating 1400 calories! I eat more and weigh less. My mother in law is Asian (I'm not) and she made me feel awful about never eating her food, but now is starting to get it. I don't view Keto as what is making me weak, it is helping me be strong.How is your fiber intake? I've noticed that if my fiber is not up to par, I'll get really bad stomach cramps, and or nausea. The nausea will sometimes come out of nowhere. It's worth a try. I have been eating a serving or two of coconut flour a day along with what I get from a few veggies and sometimes also add a soluble fiber supp as well.I've noticed that unsweetened coffee--when brewed well--is almost chocolatey with a hint of sweetness.Just ask for no sauce, there's probably lots of sugar and starch. Man, diet root beer with heavy whipping cream is my jam.I had 4-6 of them in my mouth.  I chewed them up and thought "What am I doing??!?" and spit them out.

Then I ate some sugar free chocolate pudding and made some thick sugar free chocolate milk.  :)Great Job! KCKO!![Thinslim](http://www4.netrition.com/thinslim_foods_bread.html) or [great low carb bread company](http://www.netrition.com/glc_bread_company_bread.html)

1g net carb each (7g fiber)Try an unwich, seriously, most don't miss the bread at all. Moreover it would likely be a better long term strategy rather than appealing him with substitutes. However I think Trader Joe's has a low carb bread and if you search ruled.me, cavemanketo.com, ibreatheimhungry.com or /r/ketorecipes you'll find recipes and reviews Easy sandwiches don't need bread.  Prep a bunch and put them in a tupperware.

Pepperidge Farms 'carb style' is 5net per slice but it adds up too quickly for it to be more than a treat. There are also many different brands of low carb wrap 3-6net but taste and texture varies. Again they add up. 
Really attempt the romaine leaf 'unwitches'. You could probably make your own if you wanted to bother...  There are lots of recipes for making the syrup, you could make it keto, and just add soda water.The brain uses a lot of energy, I wouldn't be surprised if that figure goes insanely high when we are stressed. So the fact that you have a craving is most likely just a fact that you're hungry. Find the best Keto foods you can and keep them handy. I make a 160g heavy cream drink with 40g coconut oil and 40g Kerry gold butter, 7g cacao powder, cinnamon, vanilla, cayenne/paprika. It's about 1000kcals and I keep it hot in a thermos all day. It's been a life saver for me since I hate having to pack and carry a bunch of foods with me when I'm out of the house.I make [cauliflower bread](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=2232221) because honestly, I just need a vehicle for my meat and cheese. But Trader Joe's has a sprouted bread that's 4g net carbs.You don't find it hard to meet your protein macro?  Sometimes I have trouble meeting the daily goal and I'm not even trying IF.  Usually on the days I'm drinking a bulletproof coffee instead of bacon and eggs or a protein shake.  I would worry about not being able to reach my protein macro if I was skipping two meals. Europe's bread game is taken seriously by the citizens.

Bakeries are like Starbucks there (i.e. on each and every corner).I love IF! Especially when traveling or at a function where you aren't sure if there will be suitable food, suddenly food doesn't even become a worry. You don't have to plan snacks to stuff in your bag or anything cuz you know you'll have a feast when the hour comes.Egg fast - unnecessary unless you really like eggs but there's no need to drastically cut calories just eat eggs at a reasonable deficit 

IF - keto and IF pair well, useful for many and it makes eating at a deficit feel better and thus most are more consistent and lose more efficiently but it's not magic

TKD-this is complete separate consideration and has more to do with training than fat loss

Just curious, what are your stats? What is your average loss per week? Are you counting calories and macros? If so how many calories?What an inspiration to us all!I preferred diet soda over regular soda pre-keto too.

That corn syrup is too sticky to enjoy.Ooooh...  How do you do that?  I'm interested in making my own chocolate...I found that instead of egg, using mayonnaise works better with almond flour. Plus shake off excess flour before frying.Austrian here, I love root beer. Sadly I can only get it at specific import shops, and I've never seen a diet version. Your period of very decreased appetite only lasts through adaptation - say three months maximum.  I'd day take advantage of it.I wish I had gotten a better handle on comprehending how the body metabolizes the food it takes in versus what it does with the extra nutrients.
That's why I ate yummy grilled pork last night :-) Oh. Weak in that sense... Yeah, I do. I am also reactive hypoglycemic and have a fructose intolerance that causes bloating and I can't handle my spicy food. I'm also Hispanic so I tend to get crap for the latter.

It is quite annoying not to be able to handle much spicy food since I actually like it. 

However, I feel way stronger than most people in the fact that I am able to realize I have food intolerances and am actually doing something to live a digestion problem free life. Not everyone has the will power that us ketoers have and that has to count for something. C: kckoThanks I will go to that! Last time I did a calc for body fat it was 11% on me I think any links to good body fat calculator? Excellent work and an inspiration to us all.

Yes tweak those calories to squeeze out those last few pounds.

Although you must feel pretty good at your current now.

Well done &amp; Good Luck.I was thinking of taking a supplement but trying to find the right one
Yeah I stopped being able to wear my ring about a month ago. My husband said my valentines day present is going to a nice chain to wear it on. Yes it's pretty effective. Haha for dinner I had planned on having a couple meatballs and then a chicken salad. Buy I got through 2.5 meatballs and wanted to vomit. I didn't even get to start my real dinner. I felt happy that I was full but a little sad I couldn't eat my delicious salad. Multivitamin isn't going to cut it, you need much more potassium and magnesium than is in a multivitamin. I would get a chelated magnesium supplement like magnesium citrate. For potassium, mushrooms, avocado, spinach, yogurt, fish; lite salt or no salt potassium supplements whoa!! AWESOME!Thank you for the brands!  I was wondering if the coconut milk was in the can or carton.  My birthday is next month and I was trying to think of something low(er) carb for the cake that everyone could enjoy (and that wasn't cheesecake).  I'll have to give this one a test try!Really though, congrats on your weight loss success. in the beginning at least a couple, but 2 months in noneYes! That's exactly what I was thinking. Thank you for your advice. I was a little worried. Way to go!Doesn't this qualify as NSV? Lol sorry for all the folks in the colder regions. It has been quite warm lately... For about  2 weeks. I feel great all the time! Except when I eat, but I was thinking maybe I'm just full before I realize it. That's what I was thinking, maybe my body is just saying I'm full before I realize it!That's a good kind of embarrassed! I've lost my pants in Target, reaching up for something on a shelf. It was not pleasant but a good kind of mortified!I've been on keto for 2 weeks. I have never experienced this before and no I haven't been to the doctor because it was a new thing. It happened the last time I tried keto too. Not sure what it could be. Buy a smoker, it'll make the diet a lot more fun. There a lot you can do with it, and it's easier to make flavorful meats w/o sugar than with bbq (although there's plenty you can do with that too, there just tends to be a reliance on sugar in a lot of the marinades / sauces / rubs, so you gotta watch out for it).

Moussaka! There are many mediterranean dishes that don't have any carbs (or are entirely veggie based). Look into Greek and Lebanese food especially. Also the olive bar at the supermarket can be great  roasted red peppers, artichokes, marinated garlic etc.

Tuna poke or sashimi platters are actually quite easy to make at home. You can also make ramen with Shirataki noodles and it doesn't really feel like a keto-sub, people actually do eat it like that sometimes just cuz.

Hot pot is great. Go to an asian supermarket and go nuts, it's really easy to make and a lot of fun. Get lots of enoki mushrooms instead of noodles.Oh geez, they're really doing that? Smh lol
Some friends posted they made no sugar added chocolate chip cookies... I told them chocolate chips (tollhouse) are at least 50% sugar lol. They stood by their claim. Shrug.

For me fructose = fructose, glucose = glucose, and same for all the other forms of sugar. Every natural sweetener out there is just a combination of these.I think it's because of the metallic taste your breath/saliva take on when in ketosis.  I recently became addicted to seltzer water when I realized it tastes amazing when I'm in ketosis.  I worked up to it and now I actually enjoy it. It's like espresso.

I usually eat one little square from a large bar at a time (maybe 1 or two a day) and I just put it in my mouth and let it melt.Pretty effective way to get you from eating too much, right?Isn't the coating high in carb?A multivitamin isn't a bad idea but you will need far more sodium, potassium and magnesium that it will provide.  Check the FAQ for dosages and keep in mind this is in addition to normal daily requirements.  

Don't worry, it's not too hard to supplement.  Use Nu or Lite Salt for potassium, broth for sodium and a chelated magnesium pill (any kind ending in 'ate').

Good luck!Obviously Mother Nature is not a Patriots fan...  We're gonna have a long weekend of -23 C (on average) here.

No snow though, ha ha!My partner and I work together, and currently working a lot of overtime hours.

We started going to the grocery store by our office and buying some thick cut dry sausage, fancy cheese, a cumber and spicy mayo.

We then come back upstairs and do a sort of 'kids lunchables' style lunch -super fast and easy - also cost us like 7$ each (with leftovers for the next day)Around 20 a day it seems...Just remember that your body will need 50-75g of protein per day even after keto-adapted. That protein will come from somewhere. If not from your diet, then....The keto calculator tends to over-estimate exercise calories, so we recommend that you set it to sedentary in determining your macros.  You only need the maximum suggested protein on heavy weight lifting days and 80% of max on rest days.  I don't think that you will need or want that much fat (especially for the first three months.)  Set to sedentary and a 23% deficit and remain on Standard Keto until you hit 15% BF.  Then you can move to the more advanced TKD explained in /r/ketogains.ah, thank you! I also was getting leg cramps at night but thought that was due to walking through a foot of snow to work :P Seems its time to get me a multivitamin!For me almost everything tastes sweeter. Tomatoes, mandarin oranges, the few Ryvita I have on occasion. It seems super strange to me that my taste buds are so amped when it comes to even the slightly of sweet foods.Congratulations friend :)

I might have a suggestion for you.

It's your body and your life, so take my advice or leave it; that is entirely up to you.

It looks as though, honestly, you don't "need" to lose more weight. That is, if you are eating such that you feel comfortable with your intake, and you look in the mirror and are proud with the way you look, and you wake up in the morning and last throughout the day feeling great, than you might just be able to continue exactly what you're doing and stay right where you are.

If that idea isn't attractive to you, and you want to be positively chiseled and look like you dreamed, and you're just not feeling like you're there yet, then hey, who am I to suggest that you stop.

But honestly, you look great, and if you feel great and like where you're at, there's no real NEED to force yourself to go any lower.

Also, I would caution against thinking of this like a real goal-line where, once you cross it, you're done and you win.

This is a life-long experience. If you feel like you've "won" when you hit your goal weight, you might go back to eating like you used to, and then it's all over but the crying until you hop back on the keto wagon :p

Best of luck to you whatever you decide, and I am impressed at your progress.

Well done :)

Edit: Also keep in mind exercise adds muscle to your body, so you may not be able to hit 180 as easily as you could have once before. You may have more muscle on your body now :pBritlandian here, **love** root beer! Costs so much to buy over here because nobody sells it, we have to import brands like A&amp;W and MUG from America. It's usually a treat I enjoy two or three times a year at most really :(Ah, making those happy college memories, I see! Seriously, this will probably be one of your favorite stories when you think back about time in college. I once showed up to a formal lecture in a v-neck and yoga pants and pretended they were black slacks. Womp womp.My ring had been too tight for years, but I had to stop wearing it about 6 months before keto as it became so tight that I could hardly get it on/off

My first NSV came about in my first few weeks of keto when I was all "hm, I wonder if my ring fits" tried it on, and it fit perfectly

Right now, I am at the point just before it falling off - it spins in place and the stones always end up sliding to the bottom. I want to get it re sized but I figure there is little point until I get near my goal weight.

The way I see it, I had to go 6 months without wearing it as it was too small - I could prob go another 6 months because it is too big :)As a culture whose obsession with being fit is almost rivaled by its obsession with superheroes, I'm starting to think ketoers might just be the modern superhero. You think batman HAD to get his snack in before saving Gotham so he wouldn't get grouchy? Pshhhh. All these stories are really motivating me through adaptation phase. Day 6 and my best friend says I'm going cuckoo and my eyes are dilated and sometimes I have laughing fits for no reason and I can't stop mumbling about butter. #ketocrayI have never read science for this but it sounds reasonable to me, do you go to bed and wake up at the same time every night/morning? I would imagine if you did your body would catch on and do something to not have to pee during your sleep window. But if sleep schedule is all over the place, then body never knows what to expect. Just an idea, no science behind it.No, just the opposite.  I feel weak as a person when I overeat and delay my progress in getting back to a reasonable weight and improving my health.  &gt; "Yeah, I heard it shrinks fat and water cells, but as soon as you start eating carbs again it will fill them all up again and you'll gain weight."

This one annoys me so much and I hear it all the time. They've validated the keto diet in one sentence but somehow still blame keto for weight gain? It's no coincidence that adding carbs makes you gain weight. That's not keto's fault, it's carbs.

There was a woman on BBC Breakfast News the other morning blaming saturated fat for obesity and heart disease. Her reasoning was that saturated fat encourages you to eat carbohydrates [referring to buttered toast].

They get all the observations right but the conclusion is always the opposite of what's actually correct. Unbelievable.Oh god, a friend gave me a 'eat for your blood type' book.  Speechless. Recipe or it didn't happen ;-) Woah man, great pics. Your hard work really shows- you look great! You've got this in the bag.Excellent!Congrats!! That is a great accomplishment!I'm originally from France, been in the U.S. about 12 years and I still can't stand the taste of root beer.Congrats!  Fantastic focus!&gt; other high carb diets are not necessarily high GI processed carbs and people can lose and maintain on these diets because they do not cause insulin resistance in the same way as SAD.

Like the Kitavans or Okinawans I'm guessing? A diet based on sweet potatoes and rice rather than on grains? 

Interestingly once had the hypothesis that it's a combo of high fat and high carb that is dangerous toward fat gain. 

If you are objecting to foods on the basis of being 'processed', which ones are healthy carbs, and which ones aren't? 

Is it a problem of sugar, which would include fruit, making starches acceptable? That would be a strange thing for a keto advocate to say.

&gt; When does dieting worsen insulin resistance? 

I didn't say dieting, I said diet. As in one's diet worsens insulin resistance, or the pathogenesis of:

I eat x --&gt; x causes me to gain weight --&gt; gaining weight worsens insulin resistance (this is the common model of it)

or

I eat x --&gt; I have a pre-disposed insulin sensitivity --&gt; I gain weight if my food choices overwhelm my insulin sensitivity --&gt; my weight gain worsens the insulin resistance I have

&gt; The insulin resistance on keto is physiologic.

Yes, but we're talking about pathological insulin resistance and how it contributes (or doesn't) to weight gain. Either IR has an effect on gaining weight directly or it doesn't. The idea behind keto is that IR has built up over time, and reducing insulin levels chronically resets IR to a healthy level and reverses the metabolic blockade of fat cells. If patholocigal IR develops as a result of weight gain, then just eating less would be enough to reverse it, and their would be no need or justification for Keto. 

&gt; You cannot compare SAD to a diet of high carb vegetables, yes they are the same but metabolically they are different

A high carb vegetable (like a potato) is nothing but starch, fiber, and vitamins/minerals to the metabolism. The velocity at which it is digested is slower than a simple sugar, but the ultimate glycemic effect is the same. I refer both to Holt et al *Insulin Index of Foods* and also to the [glycemic index](http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthy-eating/glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods) where a baked russet potato has an index value of 111 in comparison to glucose of 100. 

A lot of 'processed foods' perform much better: Peanut M&amp;Ms at 33, Potato Chips at 51, and Snickers at 51. Likewise, a yam, which is a Kitavan staple, is 54, while Whole Wheat Bread is 71. So in terms of what they actually do metabolically, the processing makes no difference: a Snickers or Peanut M&amp;Ms has less glycemic impact than either whole wheat bread or yams. 

 &gt; are you saying a high carb diet inevitably results in fat gain?

No, I'm saying fat gain indicates the worsening of Insulin Resistance (pathological) while on a high carb diet, and that where fat gain doesn't occur on a high carb diet, it is down to individual insulin resilience. 

And I do apologise if I misunderstand you and am wasting your time spinning in circles. My sister and I used to joke about the blood type diet, then it became real. Missed that one. Thanks for having a sense of humor.I've found preachy vegans to be the worst. It's a diet, not a damned religion. Live and let live.Belts work wonders and you can always drill new holes.If you go to the gym for heavy lifting and only eat that level of protein you are just wasting your time.  You'd be better off taking a walk around the mall instead....Have an upvote. Me and my wife joke about this all the time but mostly in the vain of alt medicine. 

Edit: cus its a joke, I hate when people are too damn serious and PC. TIL I'm a tiger and that's grrrrrrrrreat!I think that's the fruity taste of acetone breath, not the water.Follow the electrolyte guidelines in the FAQ. For now I would not do IF, I would eat when hungry and think about IF later when you're keto-adapted.  Thanks. :)So happy for you!  What awesome work!I got this too. 
1 million people will ask you. 
1000 will tell you to send them the info. 
3 people will read what you have send. 
10 will try it. 
Maybe one or two will succeed. 
So far Im down 100+lbs, my wife is down 20lbs, a friends brother is down 95lbs, and My neighbors and mother-in-law just restarted this jan and are down about 10 each.  Actually not bad now that I think about it. 
Okay - you know the issues.  It still comes down to calories in achieving your goal weight, so I'm reminding you as I remind myself.  ;)Ther first 2-3 days can be tough (varies form person to person). Please check out the FAQ for "keto flu".haha. probably totally don't. But I had this same sort of experience where I was tasting sweet where there made no sense to be tasting it. Like touching the top of my tooth or in a swallow of water.

Turns out (this is according to my dentist), tooth decay gives off a very similar sweet flavor when your cavity gets a certain amount deep.  Might want to make a visit to the dentist just in case.

However a lot of people say they go through the same thing in ketosis. So there's that too.
I say bacon and sitting on ass. Technically less of an exaggeration then your lie, lol. 

I want to shock people into looking it up. I don't do facebook, but thanks anyway.I started IF yesterday, scale says I'm down .4 pounds - probably water.  You've inspired me to keep going!Steak? Eggs? Pepperoni and salami and cheese. Bell peppers cut up and dunked in guac or hummus?I don't like almond milk on its own, but I drink it as a dessert sometimes with Milk Splash strawberry or orange flavoring. It tastes so rich and is honestly an awesome dessert for like 15 calories a cup.I am new here and trying to ease into it.  Two specialists I see have been pushing Paleo or Keto or some combination of such on me for about three years now and when I did "atkins" in the past it worked well for me. I just have no self control to stick with it.

I did a Paleo/Ketoish thing for several months last year and a car accident derailed me due to some meds I needed to take and they required carbs to keep me from getting sick taking them (I tested that theory, they were not kidding!).  From then the wheels fell right off the truck! Sugar and junk are my kryptonite. And I am my own worst enemy.

I am trying to get back on the tracks, and I've learned from past experience that I can't just jump full bore into anything, I have to ease in. So far I am getting there slowly.  I love the recipes and snack ideas I am getting from this group and the paleo group on here, and I am hoping I can ease my husband, who is diabetic, into this life as well.

*waves*Depends on what sort of bread, definitely agree if you're talking about that horrible processed white breadNo idea but in general most who are fasting try not to push the limits so not sure anyone has really looked into it in more depth but I think yes it varies with BMR.  As I mentioned above, IF is about making eating at a deficit feel easier and convenience so if you need your morning coffee with cream go for it, I don't think it will be an issue.  And, like I also said above try not to overthink IF, make it work for you. If you prefer to have 75 calories cream in the morning with coffee, go for it :) 

From Berkhan:

Splash of milk/cream for your coffee will have such a minimal impact on insulin that it's no use making a big fuss out of it. I said 50 calories max to safeguard against people using boatloads of the stuff which is obviously not ok.I like to grab a box of sugar free jello pudding and sub heavy cream instead of milk. I then use the whisk beater on my hand mixer to whip it into a kind of mousse. pop it in to the fridge for 10 minutes and it's good to go. still some net carbs but it's dense and I can usually eat a tablespoon or two full and shake my sweet tooth. better than having a sugary freak out and eating a package of oreos!I like nuun tablets... they dissolve in your water like seltzer and make it lightly flavored and a bit fizzy, but they have electrolytes instead of just flavor and fizz. One a day and my legs haven't cramped in months.Don't forget the broth. You might do fine without it but it really helps if you need it.  I suggest just working a cup in daily to avoid any issues.  I use chicken bullion with fresh pepper and a little butter. 1 - Use MFP to track everything (combined with a vivosmart its even better)

2 - Don't cheat with carb foods - the idea is to make the lifestyle work for you so you can be on it for life, that way you will never feel as if you are waiting for it to finish so you can indulge in XYZ

3 - Ignore premade atkins bars or low carb bread etc but experiment with some high calorie keto foods so you can still use them as treats - don't have them every day ie Keto pizza night is every other Friday, - that way you'll look forward to it and don't miss the carb version.

4 - Using 1 above plan out your meals for at least the next 7 days - it makes it far easier to shop and that way you can pepper in your indulgence foods so you regularly feel as if you are being treated instead of living on the same meal day in day out. (If you batch cook then batch and freeze for several weeks so you still get the variety each day).

5 - Enjoy the benefits, and remind yourself of them regularly - eating this way should not be an exercise in self denial but rather a voyage of discovery for all the great tasting new things you can replace the craving causing carbs with.lol based on a lot of these comments we need to xpost this to /r/ketocirclejerk  ;)I heard the root beer thing is because (in Germany was where I was told) their "default" "cough syrup" flavor is similar to root beer ...  
whereas in America our default cough syrup flavor is that kinda fruity/cherry/jolly rancher-type flavor.  

So it's not that root beer tastes like medicine to them, it's that their medicine tastes like root beer.Duration of ketosis makes a big difference. The duration is the most important thing.

It can take up to 4 weeks for the brain to begin fully utilizing the ketones. This is how long it takes for the body to adjust to a fat-burning metabolism from a carb-burning metabolism.

It can take up to 12 weeks for individual muscle cells to complete the transformation in very many intricate ways (mitochondrial biogenesis, epigenetic changes and changed gene expression).

Keto-adaptation is one of the most important things about a ketogenic diet. No other diet forces your body to change so much. It is the keto-adaptation which gives the long lasting health benefits (better insulin response, lower blood sugars, less muscle and cell glycolation, reduced brain plaque, improved blood panels, improved liver capability through remission of fatty liver). 

Weight loss is incidental to these whole-body improvement processes and is closely correlated to calorie reduction.Actually she was.  

And never actually said, "Let them eat cake."

Qu'ils mangent de la brioche.

Let them eat "brioche". --- egg bread. -- also, totally still not Marie Antionette.I definitely understand that feeling. Often when I go off plan, all I think about is food and I will literally just keep eating no matter how full I am. I've just accepted that my self control is something I really need to work on. I also try to remind myself that most people don't have enough discipline or motivation to try to get healthier, so I have something to be proud of even if it takes keto to do it.Shredded? No, you have to get to like 5% body fat for that. In three weeks that's not gonna happen. Put on some lean mass, that will help more. Go to /r/ketogainsMany people overdo BPC at first before their system is adapted to the higher fat diet, and especially MCT/coconut oil in BPC, and stories of gastric distress here are common.  In addition, at the beginning of the diet, your appetite normally goes down quite a bit, and people report struggling with eating enough protein, and especially report not eating enough protein because they are overloading on fat.Sounds like they need to shut up and eat something.so you eat that chocolate made for cooking cakes? which is 100%? are you serious? I dont eat too much sugar neither Ionly eat 75% dark chocolate but wow I tried tasting that one and it was unbearably sour!Did you dip them in anything?I had a sip of milk last month and it tasted like pure sugar.Check out r/fastingHarder cheese = aged longer = less lactoseJust because peanut butter is keto friendly, doesn't mean you should eat all the peanut butter, all the time.Happy you found it!! That would be scary. Yeah... I would say on a good night I am up about 5 or 6 times to pee. On a side note, also TMI, as a dude on keto, for whatever reason, every time I wake up I got some serious drill sergeant standing at attention so pissing takes forever.  Good answer, haha. *Again,* not trolling or kidding of being stupid. Just new to keto. Love it!Maybe get a cheap substitute for the time being? =)What a great motivator. That's super sweet! =)That's a great idea!!Sorry to hear =(It'll happen!This.No more weight to lose, limbs start falling off! HahaDidn't used to be able to drink diet soda because it tastes gross and not at all sweet. Now they all taste super sweet and are actually enjoyable!If it makes you feel better, once in college I accidentally tucked the bottom of my skirt into my underwear after going to the bathroom and walked around with my ass hanging out for like five minutes. Also, yay physics!In Denmark we eat [Rugbrd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugbr%C3%B8d), I don't if it will fit into a Keto diet, but it's a nice alternative to white bread. Research has show that it lowers the risk of testicle cancer.I ate a peanut m&amp;m yesterday and it blew my mindif you're really interested in zerocarb, there is a facebook group that eats ZC that is failry active. 

https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/105005229541718/Over what window would you say (best guess) that 50 kcal applies?  Surely not for the entire fast?  If I had coffee at 8am w/40cal worth of cream, then again at say 10:30am, all should be fine, right?

If I had to guess, it would be tied to your personal BMR?  Where did that value of 50 come from?  It looks to be, roughly speaking, the hourly BMR of a "low end of normal" person.  I wonder if that value was created to cover all bases.  So, could someone have 50 calories per hour?  My hourly BMR is closer to 100, could I get away with a little more cream in my coffee?

I don't expect you to be able to answer all of this.  I just got really curious about the formulation of this number.  I'm not looking to take in 100 cal/hour and still call it a fast.  But I wouldn't mind putting more like 75 calories in my morning coffee.  :)

My question about two coffees in the morning is actually moot, because I've always been very sensitive to caffeine.  If I have any past noon, then I have trouble sleeping.Fruit will blow your mind.Lucky youIt's only the first day...

Not all high carb diets are SAD that's the fundamental issue-SAD is high carb rapidly processed crap and high fat, other high carb diets are not necessarily high GI processed carbs and people can lose and maintain on these diets because they do not cause insulin resistance in the same way as SAD.

When does dieting worsen insulin resistance? The insulin resistance on keto is physiologic.

You cannot compare SAD to a diet of high carb vegetables, yes they are the same but metabolically they are different 

Again I think we are talking in circles not even sure the point you're trying to make-are you saying a high carb diet inevitably results in fat gain?You're welcome to some if you're in NYC!If you fill it halfway with oil, it should work. Try adding the coating and then storing the batch in a ziploc bag in the fridge overnight. The coating stuck more IIRC. I don't mean to talk in circles with you, or to put words in your mouth. I'm trying to clarify a point and to correct what I believe is inaccuracy.

First, one can't have it both ways. Either:

* Insulin resistance is independent of weight gain, and thus down to each individual pre-disposition, where diet choices don't impact insulin resistance and weight gain is only down to calories 

or

* Insulin resistance and weight gain are related (where the latter would be dependent upon the former) and the non-low-carb diet would first corrupt insulin sensitivity and weight gain would result as a by-product of a calorie composition that violates it

&gt; Many gain on high carb diets everyday, the fittest people around with no insulin resistance.

If this were true it would be directly attributable to the individual resiliency. It could also be expressed as a simple equation:

    Insulin Resistance = Natural Insulin Sensitivity - Activity Mitigating Impact (ie fitness training) + Diet Choice Impact

Some activities improve insulin sensitivity and also help reduce insulin resistance where it is found. 

If your version is right (insulin resistance is independent and individually attributable) then managing the diet means managing one's carb tolerance and eating under maintenance to lose weight.

It's also notable that insulin resistance can worsen with diet, which seems to conflict with the idea of its independence from weight gain--how can weight gain via excessive caloric intake cause pathological insulin resistance develop or worsen when the two are not related at all? 

&gt; Not all carbs are the same, not all weight gain on a high carb diet is the same.

Yes they are. The only difference between a sugar and a starch is the velocity at which they are digested. A potato is just as glycemic as table sugar, thought it has more fibre and vitamin content. And weight gain is weight gain--it's either fat, or it's lean body mass. It has only those two components for everyone, although both can be part of the same change in weight. 

&gt; where the distinction between those that gain unhealthy weight vs those that can gain healthy weight or maintain on high carb diets come in

Do you mean gain lean body mass or gain fat? 

SAD is nothing more than high carb, high fat, low protein. Other configurations are certainly apparent, but the gain of fat is no different across people when it happens and is equally unhealthy. Other configs may support a gain of lbm over fat, but if a person is gaining fat, it's all the same in that regard.If its black it has like 5 calories a cup, so I'm sure that if perfectly OK.about a yearOk! Never had hazelnut meal before. Post the results!The little 100 calorie packs of almonds are a good way to not go overboard on almonds, when you need a salty snack!No mincing or pre cookingThose look great! I'll have to try ground chicken next time!Never. I typically don't need to pee very often either. I always was like this, sometimes it's pretty useful.
But I never drank 6-10 liters. When I have 5 liters (and it's not an everyday thing for me), I need to pee a bit more often but never at night. Even if I drink a whole liter before going to bed, I don't wake up.
I noticed drinking frequently but little at a time works nicely, I don't need to pee too frequently (if I must, I do it in every 8-9 hours only - of course, I don't drink a big amount in this cases. I never tried it out while on keto). A lot of water at once is way different and if it's tea or beer, it's even worse.

So I wouldn't stop at 6pm (I would feel terrible in the whole evening) just drinking a mouthful water sometimes. Except if I'm too thirsty...There was an article a few months back about things Americans eat that Europeans just can't understand, one of the biggest was "Wonder Bread" type white bread.

All of the people talked to described it as cake. "It's so sweet!"

Of course, that's at least partly because of the amount of High Fructose Corn Syrup that's in it in order to keep it "fresh."

Interesting side note, Europeans didn't understand how we can drink Root Beer, which they all claimed tastes like medicine. God, I love a good root beer.Whisk the egg wIth HWC and try and get most of the egg off before adding coatingI notice I eat WAY less on keto than off. My average day is about 900 calories. But I'm also a slow eater. My husband is a fast eater, he's done with a plate by the time I've eaten a quarter of mine. Perhaps you are also a fast eater and don't get the "I'm full" signal until it's too late?Once, pretty consistently at 1am

Make sure you're getting enough sodium as well It's a laxative, a very fast-working one. Like Epsom salts. As long as its not a couple hundred calorie coffee (BPC)Make sure you adjust your weight loss expectations appropriately.Low carb beer is fine as long as you limit yourself. Ill drink 3 mich. ultras and 3 rum/diets or gin/seltzer.  about 10 carbs total if you round up. keeping an eye on electrolytes is key. I constantly have to adjust my pants to keep them from falling down and my favorite Shorts now just slide off my legs. It's a great feeling but also becomes a hassle sometimes Haha. &gt; Did you bathe the chicken in its own children first?

FTFYCanned fish with decent ranch sauce is my goto snack. Just make sure the ranch is low carb, I get Newman's Own which is 1g of carbs per serving, and it works well as a fat booster for most meals.To be fair, bread by itself is really sweet even if you're not on keto.Miller64 is very bad, yes.Really consider a deef fryer. I picked mine up 3 years ago and between buffalo wings, avocado frys, and naked fried chicken I get a lot of use out of it. Lately Ive been deep frying pork chops and hamburgers too.  They are a tad messy and take bit more skill to clean than to cook with but overall Im really happy with it. I know that brie is keto friendly, I've got a triple cream brie in the fridge with negligible carbsYes. You become fully keto adapted after 5 weeks - 4 months and can vary from person to person from what I understand. This is what I'm afraid of.How long have you been on keto? My first three weeks I drank like a camel and peed like once an hour. Now though I drink about 4-5 liters a day and usually don't wake up during the night to pee. It usually levels out after your body adjusts. Not soft, but pre-grated cheeses contain starch to avoid it sticking together.I know! Not in Boston here, but I'm in a snowy upstate NY region, and my first thought was "Where the heck does the OP live that it is now shorts weather?!"

To OP, good work with the keto. Now go clothes shopping! ;-)Well you can get 100 ml of cow's milk for a taste if you want everyday. Full cream milk has like 5 g carbs in 100 ml. Once you add it into your carb allowance.Absolutely ... progress is being made two steps forward, one step back. Ratios don't really matter. What's your calorie target and your protein/carbs/fat intake?those almond flour nuggets come out AMAZING.  super juicy and tender thanks to all the oils in the nuts.

i just bought some hazelnut meal and can't wait to try it.  the flavor is surprisingly mild so i think it'll be a good vehicle for spices.No! If anything, I feel stronger. Ask just about anyone if they could give up bread/rice/pasta and they practically faint at the idea. Add in the idea of sugar and/or fruit being off limits and they say "I could NEVER do that" (almost exactly) every single time. I feel strong because I've been able to give up foods that previously were an addiction to me.I actually feel more masculine eating this way than when I ate the dainty grain filled crap I ate before.  Kit Kat bars and bread aren't manly in my opinion.You can PM me. I'm nearing the end of my journey, with only 20 pounds left, so I'm full of motivation and drive! I'm also always down to help people who need it. I used to be ~100 pounds heavier, I get it. Cream cheese is a little carby compared to cheddar or parmesan.Yep, I had it resized, and I am picking it up in a few hours.i occasionally find myself frustrated that i am SO sensitive to carbs that i've had to adopt this way of eating, and that occurred as a direct result of the OMG FAT IS BAD that we've had shoved down our throats the last forty years. 

but the benefits outweigh the inconvenience.

you are not weak, and your mother-in-law is, to be honest, kind of a bitch for saying that.  wow.this is a fantastic answer.I know Keto is so much easier when you have people to ask for help. If you ever have ANY question, don't hesitate to PM me.Is beer bad though? Miller64 has only 64 calories and 2.4 carbs per can. I won't give up wearing my wedding ring and don't want to get it resized until I'm happy with my weight. Instead, I buy an inexpensive ring in the right size and wear it in front of my wedding ring. Keeps it safely on my finger. I'm down three ring sizes now and it's still working.I found that water started tasting sweet!Their buffalo is supposedly low carb. Check their website. I just make my own. Anything below 75% store-bought tastes of sugar coupled with that burning in the back of your throat right? I make my own coconut oil based chocolate...;) -huggles- :DVitamin D - I was told by mine that a huge percentage of Americans are deficient.oh my gosh thanks to your flair I finally know what KCKO means...haha  (I'm a newb)I'm good then... Thanks for the infoI eat 100% cacoa bakers chocolate. If I have some regular chocolate it is almost unpalatable.I'm not sure this is true for everyone, especially women. I was going to say that. Bread is a must less dessert like affair outside of the states.I think you know you have to cut out the carby foods, even in tiny portions. It will be worth it, because after a week or two you won't be having the ravenous cravings for them anymore. 

You also might want to cut out the lite and diet foods (diet tea, lite sour cream) and go for water and full fats. The diet foods are typically carb heavier, and less calories. It's the carbs you need to watch. I went to a fancy engagement party once, staying overnight in a hotel. When it came to get dressed in my suit, I found that (a) my trousers were falling off me and (b) my belt notches didn't go that small.

We were running late. I tried to cut a new notch in the belt in the taxi on the way over. I failed. Once there I had to blag a safety pin from the staff to keep the trousers up, and checked my belt into the cloakroom!Melted cheddar in a bowl of sugarI really like boxes of frozen burgers (just take a quick peak at the label to make sure there arent hidden carbs).  Fry/grill the burger up and then I put it over some lettuce with some kind of cheese on top.

I also like scrambled eggs with spinach, just sautee the spinach and pour the eggs in and scramble. 

Then you can always go with the standard piece of meat over a salad.Apparently 8-12 inches of snow is now called a "snow shower." 
Because, I mean, when you already have a full bathtub, what's another turn of the faucet?&gt; it's not possible to gain weight from eating  non-low-carb calories (ie SAD) without first developing a degree of insulin resistance as result of the dietary macro composition. The weight gain is indicative of an increase in insulin resistance.

This is not true. Many gain on high carb diets everyday, the fittest people around with no insulin resistance. Not all carbs are the same, not all weight gain on a high carb diet is the same. SAD is not the only high carb diet. 

I never said it was simply CICO so don't put words in my mouths. I think we are on the same page here but talking circles. However if you're implying insulin resistance is inherent to individuals, I disagree. For some yea, for most, no, that's a function of SAD and not all high carb diets are SAD which is where the distinction between those that gain unhealthy weight vs those that can gain healthy weight or maintain on high carb diets come inBased on the info you gave us. I think that although you had good intentions, you may consider to work on you're social skills. 

When you connected the word "stricter" with "keto" and combined it into a comparison with Paleo, you automatically put yourself into a RETHORICALLY superior position. It doesn't mean anything if you actually mean that or not. Forcing people into a comparison, where they feel they have to defend their choices = emotional hostility. It doesn't matter who is "right". 

You also said "I'm really not familiar with Paleo, but I know people coming off of the ketogenic diet often go to Paleo as it's a little less strict." Which is a) a statement that shows you don't know what you have an opinion about. b) You accept thirdparty statements as a universal "truth".

If you wanted a heated discussion all this is fine. If you genuinely are curious to hear about other people's experience, open questions are usually more productive, like "why do you do Paleo and what are the pro-cons of following such a diet ?"

I'm sorry for being blunt. You may hate me. That's ok.Why do people always say hard cheeses?  What soft cheeses aren't keto compatible?Mine is currently set at 80-15-5.. Is that okay?That makes sense. I'll start increasing sodium towards the end of the day in that case. Thanks.Did you find it??Insulin resistance isn't independent from weight gain. 

It's possible to gain weight by eating excessive low-carb calories, but it's not possible to gain weight from eating  non-low-carb calories (ie SAD) without first developing a degree of insulin resistance as result of the dietary macro composition. The weight gain is indicative of an increase in insulin resistance.

They key variable between them is the inherent insulin resiliency of the individual, which is first strained and then broken.  

There are seriously people eating 5k calories of low-carb foods without gaining weight (as their BMR compensates) and people eating loads of calories of non-low carb food (in fact high sugar) who also don't gain weight because they are resilient to corruption of their insulin sensitivity. 

It is not simply reductive to a calorie number without considering the individual variability and how that impacts their body's behaviour.This is a really good idea! Especially because I'm not such a fan of the whole pork rind breading thing - or I didn't get much success last time I tried at least!

Thanks :DWhen I was huge on keto I might have a single can of soda a week, and it was always as a dessert after a meal. And I rarely finished the whole thing in one go. Just sip it like a dessert wine.

Keto's cool like that.I haven't noticed a tolerance shift (2.5 wks in) but I have noticed that I'm not drinking as much so maybe that's what it is?

Electrolyte issues can manifest in many ways, typically headaches but also night sweats. It might be that you're getting most of your sodium earlier in the day and less at night before bed.Yes it's only been an issue since I started keto. My meal times are pretty much breakfast, lunch and dinner. I try to keep from eating anything past 9pm though, and snack on salted nuts as and when I feel like it during the day.

I will admit I haven't been tracking electrolytes, but isn't a deficiency supposed to make you feel dizzy/ light-headed? I remember feeling slightly dizzy the first couple of days in, but I upped my salt and water intake and the feeling went away. I've had a few nights off and on where I woke up feeling super sweaty.

my solution was to start wearing less to bed.  I think, for me, my  metabolism is cranked higher than before and at night I'm "running hotter" than I'm used to.

Also might try experimenting with the time of your last food of the day.I'm right on board with you there. I'm really starting to hate snow. I wish it would warm up here instead of the impending snow storms  Did you put  the chicken in an egg wash first? Electrolytes do need to be supplemented on keto but it's not really a lack in the diet.  It's simply that the glycogen that could more efficiently retain most of those electrolytes is lost.  That is why we need to add more.I cut mine in half, scrape out the seeds, coat them with olive oil and some sea salt. Let them sit for a few minutes to absorb some of the oil, then turn them over and bake until they feel soft when you press on the skin.  Makes all the difference in the world, in my opinion.  Softer and more pasta like. I also love how you can re-heat these "noodles" and they still taste good, sometimes even better than the first time around.hell this food plan / diet makes me feel stronger.
in my mind I know the work that I've had to do to be successful at this so far (it's not an easy way to go about eating sometimes).
While it's a bit different than your situation (choosing vs. needing) the ability to show myself that I have control is empowering.

Also what's not strong about a diet consisting mainly of dead animals and fat?Electrolytes electrolytes electrolytes Resistance as in what?Could you point me out where did you read this?nice, and lucky you being in a warm territory.Is this only an issue on keto? When do you eat your meals? 

Are you actually tracking electrolytes?This was an interesting back and forth, thanks!If you don't have insulin resistance, eat more than you need carbs or not and you'll gain weight. You can gain weight without pathologic insulin resistancePlants crave it. Why not?That's fine 

Nope never tried itAccording to LG  50 calories or less is recommended So the only way you can gain weight without an proportionate insulin resistance is by gaining it by eating an excess of low-carb calories? hah! you know the same thing happened to me, actually I only ate about 1/4 (I think the flour really expanded on my gut and there were more carbs than I realized?) but wife took down her entire half.  that pizza is awesome, but for those not on keto it's a bit weird to realize it's basically eating a huge chunk of cheese :)And that's what I said...assuming no insulin resistance keto offers no metabolic weight loss advantage (read: if you have insulin resistance, it offers an advantage)I boil a bunch of eggs at once and keep them in the fridge for a snack or for salads. Helps save time. Sausages are a quick grab and go as well as salami and pepperoni. Olives are a good snack. Stream bagged frozen veg. "The weather is warming up" ha, ha

*cries as Boston gets two more feet of snow this weekend*For me its a different kind of fullness. I just stop being able to eat any more. You get full so quickly it doesn't feel the same.good to know, I've certainly had some days where I'm just not as hungry.

I've always found almond flour and Parmesan cheese a good mix for any fried meat. It's amazing how sweet things, that were once bland, taste after a few weeks without sugar. It makes no sense that carbs would trigger an immediate gall bladder attack. But what would I know. I no longer have my gall bladder. :-)

Keto has been fine without it. 

I wonder if there is such a thing as a pancreas attack? That's what should be squeezing out juice after a carb overload. To be fair, bread in the US is effectively cake.  (Note I'm talking about store-bought white, there's obviously lots of other types that are more "classic" non-sugary messes)Perhaps this is what Marie Antoinette was referring to. I have a friend that had his gallbladder removed and has been able to eat like normal.  Other than he lays off the energy drinks more than he used to.Yea I just keep away from beer.  Dry red wines and straight liquor is the way to go.  Just remember your tolerance is lower.This was an excellent summary of the current advice provided by "nutritional authorities". It didn't quote any recent research. It simply kept repeating what various "experts", government agencies, and official reports recommend. 

How sad. &gt; Are you saying you can't gain weight without pathologic insulin resistance?

No. Hypothetically one could eat a low carb diet with an excessive calorie count and gain weight--although I think it would have to be beyond the threshold of the body's ability to compensate via certain tolerances to raise and lower the BMR. 

&gt; Most insulin resistance is driven the macros of a SAD and too many calories. So yea weight gain is a function or insulin resistance but weight gain also increases insulin resistance, it's not either or.

I agree. It's a self-reinforcing cycle in that regard.

&gt; Most insulin resistance is driven the macros of a SAD and too many calories. So yea weight gain is a function or insulin resistance but weight gain also increases insulin resistance, it's not either or.

Removing the carbs removes the impediment to weightloss which can exist even at a calorie deficit. While one needs a calorie deficit to lose weight, one also needs an agreeable insulin sensitivity via hormonal balance achieved by reduced insulin presence. People for whom insulin resistance is no problem lose weight by merely eating less, but people for whom insulin resistance is also a problem need to also manage their glycemic response, and the best solution in that regard I would argue is Keto.I tried coating with pork rinds a few days ago, it was not successful. It may be because of the type of pork rinds available here, after crushing they were very greasy and did not adhere well.

I've used egg and almond flour (w/seasoning) before and it was a success. Coconut flour was also a success apart from the fact I hate the taste! Going to take your advice and try adding some parmesan to the almond flour too :) thanks!Black, espresso strong and without sugar.
Tried portuguese coffee?What is the calorie limit that would "break" a fast?  I can't stand black coffee.. I'm not going to lose sleep if I have been doing it wrong, just curious.Coffee is fine. Don't overthink IF, the biggest benefit of IF is that makes eating at a deficit feel easier and is convenient, do what's sustainable for you and I imagine coffee is a big part of your morning routine :) if you're drinking it black it doesn't break a fastI have been a hibachi chef for the last 6 years and I can tell you the only thing that uses corn starch is the teriyaki sauce.
no corn starch is used for your food cooked on the grill unless it is a meat that uses teriyaki sauce.
Chicken is generaLly the main meat that uses this sauce though some places may put it on seafood as well. 
You can always ask them to just use soy sauce onlyIf you fed a tiger a diet of mainly corn, I'm sure that tiger would have some serious issues. You wouldn't ask why the tiger is so weak. You would ask, "why the hell have you fed it corn? That's not what it's supposed to eat." Likewise, there are some of us who eat Keto who don't have any other choice. It's not that we're weak, it's just this is what we're supposed to eat. Eating carbs makes us sick just like a tiger eating corn. No shame in eating how you are supposed to.[r/Keto-er that combined Paleo and Keto](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/w2kuu/365_days_85_pounds_2ish_pieces_of_advice_f54/c59o7f4)Well, they did say you need balance of everything, and that restricting food groups leads to losing weight unhealthily.Agreed - good quality bone broth is such an amazing source of nourishment to support ketoing!I went through a very stressful time where I was unable to focus on myself any more and a lot of control was taken from me. However I am nearly out of the woods so I have been able to get back to what matters in life, and the biggest thing for me is being healthy again :) As for what I would do differently, I'm not sure, perhaps be strong enough to keep control? In hindsight I maybe could have, but at the time it wasn't an option I felt I could have.Yeah, that's great, thanks for sharing! I'd place myself in the middle to the bottom.Thank you! :DHaha thanks! You too! :DYup, with time taste buds and brain chemistry can change Set it to Sedentary with a 20% deficit. Set protein to 0.8g/lb lbm (middle of the suggested range).Set to sedentary, set protein to 85 gLol I agree! I'm both paleo/primal and keto (but can tolerate dairy, thank goodness), and work in a paleo cafe. All day long I hear my coworkers assure customers that everything is sugar free, but when I talk to people about our food (which is pretty freaking awesome) I always make sure to point out that it's only free of REFINED sugars, and that we use NATURAL sweeteners like honey/dates/fruit/maple syrup. To me, sugar=sugar=sugar haha.I agree!!! This is not complicated but people really overcomplicate it. Eat real food and get some salt.  I get it's a learning curve but it's not as steep as many make it. Not everything needs a label or a formula. No one needs to stress if they are doing IF "right." If you want to drink BPC in the morning then do it. It breaks the fast but so what, do what works for you. Exactly!! Keto poses no issues to anyone else around me, I eat what I eat and leave the rest, no explanations, no discussions. In fact I didn't realize keto was so complicated and there was so much criticism until I discovered reddit. My keto bubble has been burst :) But, this! This is all simple, as mom says K.I.S.S. A mayonegg! In the first weeks, his cholesterol values will actually be higher than they were before starting keto. It will take 1-2 months to see a real drop.
Sugar is a problem, when trying to do both. In my interpretation, paleo is very much against artificial sweeteners (with occasional exceptions), so most of the keto treats sweetened with stevia or diet products aren't really something I want to depend on. I occasionally indulge though - it's a compromise thing. It doesn't help (or does help?) that my stomach doesn't like fake sugars either. Damned IBS.Post a recipe, that looks amazing! " ... yes it's a fad but people including me have been doing IF for years, it just didn't have a name it was called "skipping breakfast." 

If you think about it, this concept applies to a lot of stuff. Folks attribute all sorts of "sciency," "am I doing this right?" stuff to BPC too, when it's really just drinking your breakfast. Even keto itself is just the idea of having a steak, veggies and a baked potato for dinner, but skipping the potato. 

It's kinda like depressed folks, prior to meds, were called melancholy and people suffering with anxiety were high-strung. Sure, as we learn what drives these conditions, we understand that there certainly is science involved in IFing and BPC and depression &amp; anxiety, and keto in general. But I think if folks tried to simplify keto for themselves, especially early on, it would make a potentially complicated subject---and a lifestyle that can be challenging to follow---a heck of a lot easier. 

Yes, I'm oversimplifying, but I'm talking about the gist here. Think: Just not eating your hash browns and toast as opposed to explaining to the waitress why you want her to hold them. 

K, will shut up now. BPC is kicking in. Time to raise a barn or something.  This started for me last summer. I just had it resized this week for valentine's day. I went from an 11.5 to a 9. I actually thought I lost it on a plane last fall. I was sitting in my seat, and my precious slipped off and rolled under the seats forward like 10 rows. I ran up to try to find it on my hands and knees, but couldn't. I waited after everyone deplaned to crawl and find it.I haven't been able to really wear my wedding band either for the past month or two. I've got some friends that are sensitive about those kinds of things, so I've been asked on a few occasions whether or not things are OK at the old casa.I don't think in regards to feeders that "to each their own" is an appropriate opinion. It's textbook abuse. Protein is a little low, fat is a bit high.Been there.  Didn't notice until I was off the bus and halfway to work. Upvote for the feels-Well done! As an emotional eater I can fully empathise. I could easily go through boxes of sugary Honey Crunchy Nut cereal, or loaves of toast slathered in butter. I've found casual-IF has helped me with the emotional aspect. I don't really have a set pattern and I'm not strict with it, but in general I usually only allow myself a 2-6 hour eating window each day. I'm not going to beat myself up if I quit IF for a day or two, but I've found that it helps with the emotional side of things. Instead of thinking "god I want &lt;bad food&gt;" I'll think "Oh well I can't have anything because it isn't time to eat yet, so I'll just go distract myself with something else!".

The little victories add up to one big one :) KCKO!But make sure to always check labels when you are looking at a new product. Carbs are often put in the strangest places. This is my 2nd time through Keto.  It is sort of a modified intermittent fasting where I eat breakfast &amp; dinner and just drink coffee (with some mct oil) throughout the day.You might try 2 meals instead of 1Are you saying you can't gain weight without pathologic insulin resistance? That's where you lost me, because people with no metabolic derangements can gain weight. Most insulin resistance is driven the macros of a SAD and too many calories. So yea weight gain is a function or insulin resistance but weight gain also increases insulin resistance, it's not either or. But once you get there, remove the issue (carbs) and weight loss is more efficient I still haven't picked out an engagement ring (engaged for one year, he proposed with diamond studs because he knew I'd want to pick the ring, d'aww!), specifically because I don't want to have to get it resized after weight loss! So getting a nice shiny at the end of my keto journey is just a bonus ;)I recall a section of The Primal Blueprint mentioning keto briefly. (Obviously Primal isn't Paleo, but it's similar enough). I find it a bit strange that they had such a negative reaction when the diets are actually quite similar, paleo is low carb in general, especially compared to the SAD.

I think the biggest differences are that Keto is more restrictive regarding carbs, Paleo is more restrictive regarding food "purity".

When I did Primal a few years ago (no calorie-counting, no macros, lost a little under 50lbs, kept it off too), I remember one of the things I found stressful was getting too caught up in finding the "purest" food - raw organic milk, grass fed meat, organic vegetables, raw organic nuts, zero additives, etc. It made finding simple snack foods quite difficult because pretty much everything had to come from a whole food before being cooked into something else. I ended up feeling tired, overwhelmed and too restricted. I don't doubt that Paleo/Primal is one of the healthiest lifestyles around, but I feel that (for me) it is more important to get the weight off sticking to something I feel comfortable with and fits into my current lifestyle and around my current medical and psychological issues. Then once the weight is lost I can re-evaluate where I stand, at which point I will likely do maintenance by going Primal.

Now that I'm doing keto I still try to maintain certain Primal/Paleo principles, I still buy grass-fed and organic meat, pastured eggs, organic berries; I still make bone broth from organic/pastured/grass-fed animals. But I'm not as hung up on "purity" as I once was, which makes it less stressful. I don't care if my Blue Diamond almonds use rapeseed oil rather than a healthier oil with better omega 3:6 ratios. I don't care if there are some E-number preservatives in some of the deli meat I eat occasionally. I don't mind eating non-organic cheese. I allow myself sweeteners (Natvia/Truvia, Erythritol w/Stevia).

But overall I think the two are similar and very compatible.Canned fish. I'm currently eating canned herring in a mayo based sauce with only 1% net carbs.

Maybe something similar is avaiable where you live.How long have you been in ketosis? You might be experiencing keto flu! IF is a natural thing for many on keto, of course it doesn't work for all, no one ever said it does. Moreover yes it's a fad but people including me have been doing IF for years, it just didn't have a name it was called "skipping breakfast." I think you're over exaggerating the IF talk around here and undervaluing the reason that it's popular is that keto offers reduced satiety and prolonged hunger which make IF seamless for many. If it doesn't work for you, don't do it. Not sure why the rant about it. There are dozens of things people suggest here that don't work for me, I just don't do them. I do agree that people suggest IF for stalls but it's not magic, the reason it works for stalls is it helps with eating at a deficit and by eating more consistently at a deficit people lose weight more efficiently. It's not magic.Wonderful to read this. You must feel GREAT!

Welcome and good luckThis exactly. Everyone tried telling me it was okay to cheat. I told them I knew myself and knew that if I cheated I would cheat again. I wanted a month before I even considered cheating. 

I have cheated since starting, but it's been easy enough to get back on the wagon. I don't think that would have been the case however if I hadn't fully committed at the beginning. There shouldn't be this 'us-versus-them' competition between dieting groups. Tribalism in health of all things? We should be joining together against *the world* because the same energy that people use to argue about whether or not they should eat apples could be used to inform the general populace about how their sugar-addicted/processed foods diet is killing them.

Some chap got downvoted to -30 elsewhere on reddit for saying that sugar was just as dangerous as caffeine and nicotene. Shit like that infuriates me a thousand times more than some paleo guy who thinks I'm dumb for not eating carrots.Yep I've taken the same stance as you with the quality of my foods. The difference in macro for keto is less carbs to get into nutritional ketosis. Stepehn Phinny spoke to the author of the paleo diet and ask why so high on the carbs and he said to him it's to fuel the brain. But so much new info is comming out keto and paleo is converging.  
Here the link time coded to the part where he speaks about the difference between a well fourmulated ketogenic diet and paleo diet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkQYZ6FbsmI#t=915Do you mince the breast?

For like a week. Sometimes I'd make chicken. Then I started looking up and making recipes but I still eat a lot of this stuffFAQUse ground chicken. The breading sinks in and sticks a lot better. Also try baking it with oil drizzled on top. A lot easier and you still get a decent crunch. He/she said that unless a person has insulin resistance, keto offers no metabolic advantage other than increased adherence. My point was to inquire how it's possible to gain weight without gaining a proportionate degree of insulin resistance. 

I think from your perspective it comes down to whether insulin resistance is a function of weight gain, or whether weight gain is a function of insulin resistance. For my part I argue the latter; that the processes which end in weight gain start with a sort of metabolic 'corruption' which happens as a result of how the body reacts to dietary macros. For some people the idea is that the continued insulinogenic stress their diet choices puts on their body creates a progressive insulin hypersecretion in tandem with a poor insulin clearance. This begins in the liver and then spreads peripherally--a phenomena called 'hepatic overload'. As it worsens, so does insulin resistance.

The continued need for more secretion of and chronic presence of insulin in the bloodstream has negative implications for white adipose tissue (WAT)--in that it downregulates the expression of Hormone Sensitive Lypase inside WAT, which reduces the body's capacity to breakdown stored triglycerides back into non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and push them *out* of the cell for use as fuel. So the end product of weight gain is caused by the prevention of stored fat from exiting fat cells, and this in itself causes a build up of NEFA in the bloodstream (dyslipidemia) commonly known as high cholesterol, or high HDL/LDL. 

A healthy individual with correctly functioning adipose/endocrine tissue is suppose to be able to keep an equilibrium between NEFA flowing in and out of the cell, alongside all the carbohydrates eaten being used for fuel and not arising either in frequency or overall amount as to depress the function of adipose tissue. What I have noticed and what I think is interesting is the individual variance in 'resilience' to carb metabolic 'corruption', or how people are affected differently by a similar carb load. 

/u/anbeav is well respected here, and I was hoping for a comment on how weight gain/weight loss are not related to the underlying metabolic structure of the individual. 

Does that make sense? I too just went on a chicken nugget binge. I really wanted mine to taste exactly like store bought/fast food nuggets so I used ground chicken for the first time in my life. I also discovered that the breading sinks in and sticks A LOT better to ground chicken than it does slices of meat. My winning combo was pork rinds, Almond flour and dehydrated parm with garlic and onion powder. I was to lazy to fry so I baked them with oil drizzled over.
[ Turned out pretty well if you ask me! ]( http://imgur.com/tyTH416)Many people make this mistake - but since technically ur consuming less carbs currently i wud stick with it - no need to UP your carbs since ur below ur 20-25 gram - i find the best keto ratio is 80 fat 15 protein and 5 carbs. Net carb is ur friend I wonder if you only can eat that if you're part Polynesian. Or do we need to use the pineapples which weren't modified with 5,000 years of selective breeding? I'm betting that a lot of fruit is sweeter today. How long have you been on keto? What were you like with food before keto? Do you have any known allergies/conditions? Have you spoken to a doctor?
I lost my wedding ring this way.  Bitter sweet.Haha, right on.. embarrassing though it may have been, it's a victory! I ended up getting a couple of cheap elastic waist maxi skirts for similar reasons. The weight was coming off so fast for a while that I didn't want to get anything nice knowing it wouldn't fit soon. A great feeling!I am doing IF since I started keto about 6 weeks ago. I really can't bother eating more than once anyways.I think this is a case of irresponsible journalism.

The BBC should be able to put better quality opinion pieces on the web than this. 

There is shockingly little consistency, neither low fat nor low-sodium nor calorie restricted but a mish mash of everything.I know exactly how you feel. Glad to see you're back on the keto wagon!

I lost almost 90lbs in 2011-12 on an atkins diet that morphed into keto when I learned more about nutrition. I went from being "morbidly obese" to "healthy weight" on my doctor's scale. I went from a 44'' waist to a 35''~ waist. I gained muscle tone and for the first time I really felt good about myself.

2013 was a tough year. I gained jobs, lost jobs, had a back injury, money worries and an incredible amount of stress. I began cheating here and there, with the intention of "going hard" at the gym the next day to make up for it. But that never happened. A slice of pizza turned into a whole pizza. A pint of beer turned into 8 pints of beer. In my last binge, I drank 9 pints of beer, ate a whole Papa Johns XXL pizza, and then crammed in Ben &amp; Jerries ice cream in a 12 hour marathon. I sat there in bed watching my stomach pulsate as my heart seemingly struggled under the stress. I was honestly worried I might have a heart attack.

Then this Christmas just passed I found myself over 100lbs heavier, with all my muscle tone gone, sleep apnea, chest pains, digestive problems. I was in terrible shape.

Thankfully 2015 has been good to me so far, and /r/keto is always there for support and advice. I'm 22lbs down, not a sip of beer has passed my lips, and everyone has started commenting on how much better I look. The second time around is harder in my opinion, but I think it also grants us a little wisdom in the long run. We remember what a hard marathon it was the first time, and the mistakes we made. But we also remember the reward in reaching that goal weight, or wearing that new pair of jeans, or simply being healthy again.

Best of luck.The way the article started I actually thought it was going to say something positive about a ketogenic diet. Then the one quote by some doctor or whatnot and same old same old.lol!

&gt; Some convenience foods may still contain good nutrients and be fine to eat in moderation.

&gt; A can of baked beans, for example, contains both fibre and protein.

[See for yourself the goodness](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/7698/2) contained in baked beanz!

Yeah, I do feel quite foolish for thinking that. "Idiot Proof Diet" - There's a lot of nice stuff in it about changing your mindset and living with keto longterm, but, it does give the impression that you don't have to watch calories once the carbs are kept down. Purchased only from a vendor at Mark's Daily Apple!Yeah ,female or male food preferences can't really be stereotyped, like you said your boyfriends the one who likes fruit the best! It's lucky that you have a particular draw to vegetables. 
 With the sugar -fructose in the fruit must give it that "Move outa the way, gotta have it feeling". I don't get your answer. The more weight you lose, the better your insulin sensitivity becomes.You'll do fine if you stop eating junk food. Even in tiny quantities, junk food will sabotage your diet. All of the small amounts of carbs add up to put you over your limit. If you cut out the cheetos, croutons, low-fat cheesecake filling, etc, you would be well under your limit. Also, sugary or carby processed foods like that will trigger cravings for more of the same. Just lay off that stuff for a week and your cravings will go away.

Seriously, just eat meat and low-carb veggies cooked in butter or olive oil and you'll be fine.

Or maybe you are just trolling us? :)Yes! This what I need! Thank you!When I was doing Keto, I had this problem too. Note that it's only suggested to hit 20 for the first 2 weeks. This is to kick you into ketosis. Then it's suggested to hit around 50. So essentially you can eat healthy at 50 but not so much at 20. Not that it's UNHEALTHY to do 20 for 2 weeks... but you need fruit and veg. It's no problem at 50.Don't let anyone deter you - 2 weeks at keto is a very short time and it takes a while to adjust to it.  You're doing great.  Just cut out the croutons, eat more fat (no "light" or "low fat" stuff.)  You'll do great.I would be skeptical of the trainer's measurement. Accuracy with calipers depends in part upon the skill of the person doing the measuring. Try getting someone else to measure you with different calipers.

Here are some calipers on Amazon rated 4.5 out of 5 stars that cost only $10.49 and they have free shipping.

http://www.amazon.com/Sequoia-Fitness-TrimCal-4000-Caliper/dp/B00B2MIDFY/

If you don't end up getting a second opinion, I would go with 45% if I were you since it matches the comparison photos and is closer to what the keto calculator says.If you are interested in fasting, try Intermittent Fasting. I only eat after I get home from work and I can eat 1500 calories a day and feel really full. I get hungry around 2pm but only for about half an  hour and I don't have a lunch at work to eat so easy not to. Started at 245 and down 8 pounds in 9 days.I think paleo is more strict than keto. On keto I can have cream, half n half, cheese, peanut butter, diet sodas, sugar-free candies, and really anything I want, as long as it fits into my carb count and my macros. 

Paleo is limited because people really consider what cavemen actually ate. They didn't have diet coke, they didn't have sugar-free brach's candies, they didn't have cows for milk and butter, they didn't have coffee or chocolate... So they're like, I have to cut all of this stuff out of my diet, because cavemen didn't have access to it, so it's not paleo. I've literally read of people drinking nothing but water because it's the only thing that's paleo as a beverage. Sometimes those people are crazy.20g _net carbs_ is generally what's advised.

http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_net_carbs_and_how_to_i_calculate_them.3F

Eat more foods with fewer carbs. Have some meat and non-starchy vegetables or something. Munching isn't the issue with your carb count- your food choices are.All meats are fine if they aren't glazed in honey or cured in sugar or otherwise contaminated with carbs. You can look on the nutrition label to be sure the carbs are 0 or near 0. Stay away from things like honey-glazed ham or teriyaki chicken or maple cured sausages.

Other things that are ready to eat or easy to make ready:

* boiled eggs

* beef jerky (be careful of brands with too much sugar added)

* pork rinds

* hard cheeses (check label to make sure near 0 carbs)

* deli meats

* pre-made salads (make sure they have low-carb ingredients) or grocery store salad bar

* full-fat, low-sugar greek yogurt (e.g. Fage 4%)

* almonds, other low-carb nuts

* salami

* low-carb frozen dinners (microwavable)

* avocadoYUM!!!I'd like to think that I'm on a ketogenic informed by paleo principles. I'm huge on sourcing my food from sources that make them the most nutritionally dense. A pasture raised cow is simply going to supply more micronutrients than a corn fed industrial raised cow. The same as vegetables grown on healthy, living soul are going to be better for you than crops grown in depleted, dead soil with artificial fertilizer. With these, I agree with the paleo community. But I just love being in ketosis and don't think there is any need to differentiate. You can aim your macros to be in ketosis while giving thought to the quality and nutritional value of the food that gets you there. There are those who do Keto in line with paleo and those who don't. Damn, do I feel you. I did so well and felt so good when I first started. The past few weeks I have fallen off the wagon hard, and every stinking day I tell myself 'tomorrow.' I'm stuck in a vicious cycle. I know the right things to do, but can't make myself do them. Thank you for putting out such an honest post!I think it really depends on the person. I've been on Adderall since end of October and on keto for 2.5 years. The adderall definitely decreases my appetite even further than keto already did. Before adderall I was fine eating two meals a day and a couple light snacks if needed. There are many days now that I find it's 7pm and I've only consumed about 500 calories. I'll have a large dinner to make up for it even if I'm not hungry.   
I went on a fat fast recently to jump start my system again. I was eating a minimum of 85% fat every 2-3 hours with a daily maximum of 1200 calories. It was for three days and I lost 3.5lbs during it. However, I noticed that in the afternoon of my second day my body was reacting very differently to the adderall. I normally take 20mg in the morning (9:30-10am) and then 10mg around 3pm. The lack of protein that I was eating was making me jittery like I had taken too large of a dose. My head hurt, buzzing, I felt dizzy, just overall not good. I know that I need to eat some kind of protein within an hour or two of taking my pills and my fat fast was making it that I was only getting a couple grams at a time.  
This is only my experience and I was told by my doctor that my body is pretty sensitive to drugs. I had some pretty bad side effects with strattera and wellbutrin before going on adderall.I know, I just hate cleaning our wire rack (it has some kind of coating, can't use anything harsh, total bitch to clean) so I just hope for the best. Our oven is also quite subpar, I think it's older than I am!&gt;Vitamin C keeps your immune system healthy first of all.

[Citation Needed]. If you have a deficit you develop Scurvy, or other issues, none of which are immune related, but deal with connective tissues. Normal (even Keto) modern eating provides more than enough Vit C to prevent that.

Also, mega-dosing yourself is actually counterproductive as your body will dump more of it out of your system instead of adding it to it.

Drinking water without the vitamin C also helps with hunger, the extra vitamin C isn't needed.

[More information on what Vit C actually does](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002404.htm).I thought about doing just that, but then thought about my frying situation and decided against it. I don't really have a pan suitable for deep frying or a deep fryer. Though I suppose I could attempt to oven bake them...Your friend doesn't understand Paleo. The adobo stuff that comes in a can almost every restaurant uses doesn't have any/much sugar. The info says no carbs per one ounce serving might be rounded down but it should be pretty low. Of course, they might add something to it...Lots of people are asking about IF, and lots of people are getting those questions answered.

IF is [going mainstream](http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-82776447/), and when paired with SAD can bring about real improvements.

My take on IF in keto: Since you already have insulin under tight control, IF is about tweaking leptin and ghrelin. Way too detailed and micro-managing biology than is useful, probably. IFing on keto is convenient - one meal a day is less effort than 3 meals a day. Since I already do lazy keto, eating once a day makes it even lazier.I thought about pork rinds but since I don't like them alone, I figured I'd omit them. Cheese with sausage is ALWAYS a winner though :D So far so good, though microwaving didn't work out, but oven reheating was fine :) &gt; Why didn't he tell you this?

We were running out of time. I can ask next time.Is she one of those "I hate drama" people? Because it sounds like she loves to have drama to hate.The keto calculator uses the bodyfat percentage only to calculate your protein requirement. The higher the bodyfat percentage, the lower the amount of protein required.

The keto calculator suggests that 35% bodyfat may be appropriate for you (but it could be wrong).

Here are the protein ranges for you given various different body fat percentages.

35% -&gt; 54 to 88

30% -&gt; 58 to 95

25% -&gt; 62 to 102

I would choose a protein of around 75 grams which puts you safely in the middle of all three of those ranges.

You can increase your carbs to 20 or 25 grams without hurting anything. It may help you to have the extra flexibility.Uh, yeah. That's basically what I did back in the day when I lost weight the first time. Now they call it IF. 

However if your going to go a while without eating on keto you must remember to drink water and maintain electrolytes (Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium)Grind them up and add a tbsp to cream cheese pancakes for a more substantial and bready pancake. Substantial enough to use for a wrap or to put a hamburger inside. I usually put herbs into the mix, sometimes cheese too for more savoury pancakes. Store with paper towel in between each oneHellz yeah fruitarianism is dangerous! Cancer cells feed on fructose, according to a bunch of studies -- which is why Jobs likely did the exact opposite of what he was trying to.Have you tried making your own [brown sugar](http://yourlighterside.com/2012/09/make-your-own-almost-sugar-free-brown-sugar/) with molasses and a low carb sweetener? I've done it in the past with success using Swerve. 1 tablespoon of molasses has 15g of carbs which makes 1 cup of brown sugar.It is conditioning.

You have conditioned yourself that cereal tastes great and is a very cool reward. So now you want cereal, as a reward.  I think most people would accept that using food as a stimulus in [operant conditioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) is not good. Maybe right now is not the best time to tackle this, passing the CPA test is probably more important. 

Ultimately what will free you is to break the conditioning. You don't need food to enable you to work harder, play harder, exercise longer, succeed at school/work, be loved, be liked, feel better. You don't need food for those things unless you make yourself believe that food is the key to getting what you want. 

If you want to master yourself you will need to break the reward conditioning.When I feel like snacking, I make myself a cup of bulletproof coffee and add more coconut oil than I normally would. It makes me feel very full, often to the point of nausea. The last thing I want to do then is eat. Not great, but better than giving in to my snacking desires :p How did that turn out? I can never get my breading to stay on when I use a frying pan, but I hate deep frying in my tiny apartment. Any tips on pan-frying breaded stuff? I started doing both IF and Keto hand in hand a week ago and have lost 8 pounds... I am sticking with it!150If you are going to do physical labor I would recommend starting to exercise in addition to doing keto. Not only will it speed up your weight-loss but it will build strength and stamina. Even if you do lose weight, you'll be amazed at how unfit, tired and weak you are if you don't work out often.Please tell your S.O. I'm happy to come on over and help you dispose of them, because they look friggin' *delicious*.You don't have a diet problem, you have a mother in law problem. 

I see no issue with eating lots of meat, fat and cheese, and really don't see how this can be associated with 'weakness' in any sane mind.Some people use keto for a few months and shed 10, 20, 30 pounds of fat. Then they go back to "eating in moderation" and often gain it all back in the same amount of time.

If this is what you want (and it seems so) then you need to read the FAQ and follow it strictly. I won't repeat what it says, but it says everything you need to know.

If you can manage strict keto for the first few months, you can manage it for a few years with even less effort.Nice. I need to download the app yet and start logging my food more carefully. I'll add you when I do. I personally would never do a thing like that. I think there is MORE than enough bullshit clogging up the market, why would I want to add to it?

One of the best things about keto and this community is that it is free for anyone, no bullshit, just facts and support. For free.

I think part of the reason so many people have trouble with weight-loss is that they are confused by all the products and misinformation out there. Making a buck off stupid people is one thing, but to consciously contribute to delaying/derailing someone's health is pretty nasty.Near the Tacoma area.  Been keto for almost 1.5 years now.  aleehagen on MFP if you want to add me to MFP.Hi! Also from Olympia and am fairly new to keto. I'm on my fitness pal: akimaryJust don't do IF on a day you are planning to exercise or lift weights!I guess I technically don't NEED to do keto/low-carb, but with this and actually finally finding the right supplement mixes to get my energy levels up (prone to depression/forever sleeping), I actually feel stronger.

It feels great to realize some sense of control over your own body. Keto's been great for me and my self esteem because it finally gave me the framework to connect what inputs turn into what outputs. Previously, all I had to go on was some psycho-mumbo-jumbo on "listen to your body," which was about as useful to me as trying to learn French by diving straight into Proust.Some people only do IF. It's not something that you need to limit like a fat fast.Glad I haven't watched it. 

Lunch today was two quarter lb burger patties from a local joint. For $3.25. Bomb. As the great philosopher Jay-Z once said, "Ladies is pimps too, Gon' brush your shoulders off."Man you guys from North America have it so good. I checked out Franks sauce and it sounds fantastic.  Its hard to find nice sauces here in Australia. Bear in mind that keto should be viewed as a somewhat permenant way of eating. As soon as you pick up carbs and sugar you will put on weight.And because I forgot and in case you didn't know already(you probably do) you can change the targets for the diet plan to make it more specific as the two images here showcase. I use the percentages from my macro setup from the Keto calculator in the sidebar personally. http://imgur.com/a/j0hMxWooo! Grats on your NSV! KCKO!Make up some shit, sell it as an eBook. Eventually you can make a modest change to an exercise machine, like add vibrating motors to a dumbbell and make up some shit about stabilizing muscles and whatever. Get rich I was just thinking this today and I'm curious to see what others say. Typically when I win I get between 25% and 40% of my original bet. 
So it's not a lot of money, but for me it's more about loss aversion. I often do 3 diet bets simultaneously, and the thought of losing up to $100 terrifies me enough to keep me on keto.
When I was on day 3 (day 10 now), I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible, god-awful headache. I was too tired to make broth, but I knew I needed salt. I measured out half a tablespoon of salt and downed it with some water. Headache was gone in ten minutes. Hang in there and do like the others say and get enough salt! -internet hugs-Of course they are. It just takes the naked human eye to see they aren't as breaded though. The official website even lists the carbs. There's only 9 net grams in the 8 piece nuggets. With the nuggets, I notice that you can kind of see the chicken through it. Where as the filet you candefinitely not. If only the sauces weren't loaded with sugar though. I'd kill for sugar free Polynasian! I dunno - I specifically eat ultralow/no-carb stuff for breakfast and lunch just so I can have amazing dinners on a regular basis.You really need to talk to your doc. I have been on amphetamine for my ADHD, and it killed my appetite. I haven't been taking it since being on keto and have an appointment scheduled to talk it over soon. I already IF and am worried my appetite will completely go away with the meds. Weird. On facebook at least,  the paleo keto people are the fucking worst.  "That's literally poison" "That has chemicals" etc etc Meals are usually half a pepper, half a tomato, some cucumber, meat, coleslaw, cheese, omelette, sausages If you go to the gym they should have Callipers there that should give you an accurate  fat measurement. :)None, quite a bit of olive oil but I've eaten more before and not had an issue! You can do it! Stay strong and plan out your meals. Snacking is/was a huge problem for me so I would get caught in a moment of weakness if I didn't plan things well. 

Ps. MN is great. The wife and I are from there and hope to move back someday. Dude! I am studying for my CPA exam as well.  I take AUD in less than 2 weeks!  My goto snack is macadamia nuts.  They are awesome!.. they taste good and they fill you up bc of all the fat!That kind of self-righteousness is usually found in diet newbies, in my experience. Were they new to Paleo?No way! I'm all for Threesville and Twotown as well lolI've been on keto since early January. I'm in olympia, so it's good to see other WA folks on here. If you want to chat or need encouragement, let me know. You can do it!This looks great! I'm going to try it this weekend. I *miss* chicken nuggets!Partisan garlic should be fine. Their medium, hott, mild sauce should be OK.When I tried similar with only almond flour (no parm) the coating fell of very easily. Any ideas? It the parm the secret I was forgetting?Good for you! I'm looking forward to the day when I can actually put my wedding ring back on.Eta?   Do blood work again, get the ratio.  The good/bad ratio is important on keto.  And a breathalyzer... To make sure you aren't drunk :)I think anyone getting mad over what other people eat is silly. Our society is obsessed with hating "fat" people and uses the moral superiority whatever diet they're on gives them to fan the fires of fat phobia everywhere. 

Sigh. 

In my experience,  people tend to think whatever diet they AREN'T on is crazy and strict. 

Edit: I also do keto and paleo. I'm trying to add cheese and butter, because, cheese. I'm used to people making comments about what I eat, so it rolls off me like water off a ducks ass, as my grandfather used to say :D KCKO!I am a fellow ADHD Ketoer and I think a lot of it depends on your medication and metabolism. I am currently taking long-acting Methylphenidate HCL and am also doing a 20/4 IF fast. The medication still works (if that is your question) and I am not hungry after taking my medication (or before for that matter) but I have noticed that I metabolize my mediation incredibly fast.

I can't 100% say that it is due to the IF though, my body naturally fell into the rhythm when I started Keto so it could very well be keto itself, but what I am experiencing is that with my medication that used to take 6 - 8 hours for me to fully metabolize and come down off of I am now metabolizing in 3 - 4 hours (some days 2!) and coming down off it. Aside from that everything is A-Okay!

As far as trying different medications, I unfortunately recently moved and have yet to procure a family physician to speak with (there is a doctor shortage here) so I have been saving my Methylphenidate HCL for times when I feel I really need to concentrate (reading tasks, etc) and doing my best to cope in other situations until I can find one. :-\

I would say give it a try, and if you notice any complications arising I would suggest stopping and discussing it with your family physician.I think I got the keto flu 4 weeks in. It snuck up on me too :)If you haven't found it, read around /r/ketogains which has more special information on maintaining or gaining muscle and controling bodyfat%. It even has it's own calculator so you could compare the results given from the two for a protein number. I don't have experience with the cyclical keto plan, but ketogains does. 

Usually though, unless you are a training professional, you would start with the Standard Keto Diet (SKD) for a duration of 4-8 weeks to get adapted into Ketosis before transitioning into the Cyclic Ketogenic Diet (CKD) or Targeted Ketogenc Diet (TKD). Starting out with those stats now, keep up on your electrolytes, and see how that much protein feels once you are adapted to Ketosis. Which could take 4-8 weeks. Hope I was helpful, good luck.I too was overjoyed when I discovered this at my local Costco. Unfortunately my research uncovered serious discrepancies regarding the carb content. According to numerous commenters on the keto and xxketo subs, the 17 grams listed as "total carbs" are in fact the NET carb amount. For me, the definitive answer was found on the Netrition site: http://www1.netrition.com/explore_asian_organic_black_bean_spaghetti.html#NUTFACTS. Just wanted to make you aware of the "carb controversy" regarding these noodles. Well that *is* how you get insurance to pay for itOkay thank you, glad to know there's a cause to this. Weird that I only started experiencing this 3 weeks in.How many 300+lb users we got on this sub?This happened with my new coworkers. After I told them about keto, they got all preachy and started informing me about how unhealthy it was to eat so much fat and asked why I wouldn't try paleo instead. This also being after the fact that I told her that I was on the diet previously, about all the benefits, and how much research I did on it before starting the first time. I didn't want to start off on the wrong foot so I held my tongue. But what I really wanted to do was ask her who the fuck she thought she was to tell me how to live my life.Yes, called the Keto Flu, often happens when transitioning into Keto, but it can happen anytime. [Read all about it in the FAQ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_.201Cketo_flu.201D_and_how_long_will_i_have_it.3F), it advises what to do. Eat more salt, what salts to eat.It sounds like rather than being a victim of your circumstances you've taken some major steps to overcome serious invisible health problems. I'm only aware of the social culture of India secondhand, because I've never been there, but from what I do understand anything which deviates one from the norm is subject to harsh criticism. Especially to a prospective man or woman in a relationship to the in-laws. Source: my Mother's first husband was from India. If it wasn't your diet or how your stomach affects you it would be something else. If people are looking for something to criticize they will find something to criticize. Chicken Broth is magical.

Make a soup, add it to your foods or just plain drink it. I live right to a Buffalo Wild Wings. I'm going to assume they add a lot of sugar in their sauces.. Would I just have to stick to plain buffalo hot?Someone just told me I'm going to get atherosclerosis from my keto diet.  He told me it will cause inflammation.  This person is a bonafide expert in weight loss.  He's an MD, bariatric surgeon and is on blood pressure medication in his 30s.  He ate a ton of fat today for breakfast -- along with a ton of carbs.

He is obese and already had part of his stomach cut off (sleeve gastrectomy).  He literally stands to make millions more than he does if he'd just lose weight.  But he can't.

Yet I am the unhealthy one.I would love to join you! I started on February 7th, so last Saturday. I'm aiming to lose 50+ pounds. :) 

I'm from Minnesota, haha.

We can do it! Message me anytime!How long did it take you to go from 385 to 255?  And how do you feel about your progress at 255 at this point with your weightlifting?Fantastic work man, congrats.  How long did it take you?i read that as: "my ring finger fell off today" &amp; i thought "looks like it's time to stop dieting."Good luck on your license, I saw my Dad go through the same thing when I was really little. He locked himself in the basement to study for hours at a time. Would tea (hot or cold) or a cup of hot broth give a comfort feeling for you? Start by reading the FAQ. 

When you're done, read it again.

Then use the keto calculator. 

Follow it. Eat fat. Stop or severely limit carbs (less than 20g per day)

Drink water. Eat salt. Measuring how? I've already gotten caliper measurements and I can't afford a DEXA scan. Agreed. Largely, paleo does support individual approaches and doing what's right for you :)I lolled in public.*pastured, free range organic bacon ;) lolWe had to stay late in the lab  yesterday. Everybody was whining for pizza and going "I'm sooo hungry! ".

 All I felt a polite knock from my body "hey, if you don't have anything better to do, food would be nice. I really don't want to be a bother though, I can come back later. "

In addition I didn't feel weak at all on my hour long bike ride home! I would disagree with the idea that paleo needs to cause debate over whether modern foods were available to cavemen and whatever. I've always thought of the 'paleolithic' part of the philosophy as a hook - a story to help people get their head around what it's really all about, which is eating real, whole foods. Just my interpretation: I'm broadly both paleo and keto, and find plenty of room for both philosophies in my life. Technically, I guess I would say I eat low carb low fodmap primal haha but that sounds horrendously strict. It's not particularly.Started on January 27th. Already down over 10lbs. 
My MFP username is livitup85. Add me :) Today I just happened to not eat until 6:40PM... wasn't intentional, I just wasn't hungry, and accidentally went the whole day without eating. It was a pretty great realization that I can do it, and function normally without really much trouble. My routine is 2 scoops of protein powder in morning + vitamins first thing in morning. Then all my food after at least 5pm.The only thing I've changed is where I buy my food.

Once I saw the way animals were being kept I made the switch to keep it as natural as I could.

Grass fed beef &amp; open range chickens.

Food Inc on Netflix really fucked me up.Yes, I second this, though I would compare the carbs in the bouillon cubes before buying.

If you can't stomach just the plain broth, you can make a quick egg drop soup. 
Here's a quick recipe, if you're interested:
 
-Bring about 4 cups worth of chicken broth to a simmer in a pot (make sure it is not at a rolling boil)
-Wisk 2-3 eggs in a bowl
-Add some black pepper, onion/garlic powder, and any other spices you would like to the eggs
-As the broth is still simmering, slowly stir in the egg mixture, keeping it as steady as possible
-Once the eggs have been added, turn the heat off and let the soup sit for a few minutes, so the eggs finish cooking. 

I definitely attribute that soup to the reason why I only had the "keto flu" for a day or two. I made 3 batches total and had at least a little bit of it at every meal.

Hope this helps and you start to feel better soon!If you want to do p90X make sure you take it easy. It is a very intensive exercise program with almost no breaks during the hour or so of each video. Definately focus on a hypertrophy workout. You don't need strength if you just wanna get big. Do a lot of volume. Use a nitrous oxide promoting product like  agmatine, or citruline malate, or if u can handle it, most pre workouts have shit in it to get you pumped. This is all broscience btw but it's what I'm planning to do in a couple of months for a fitness competition, and it's what got me big in highschool, just pure ego lifting.I've been trying IF this week, and I feel considerably better than I have since starting keto.

I've been working with the 20/4 interval, though I do want to try my hand at 24 or 48 hours soon. I have similar stats in weight and height as you and my body fat % is closer to 50 than it is to 35. I would maybe try measuring or getting another opinion from a doctor perhaps. :)Lighten up. Onederland is a huge accomplishment and a big I MADE IT to so many people. 

To OP: Oh yisssssss. Nicely done. =)You're doing well! You may want to invest in some sort of broth or tea in case you start to not feel so well within the next few days. 
I had the "keto flu" for a couple of days towards the end of my first week. 

I made a basic egg drop soup (4 cups of broth, spices, 3 scrambled eggs) that I ate throughout those days, really think it saved me from the worst of the symptoms others get. 
I think most people get the "flu" because of the change in electrolytes- not entirely sure. But the broth really helps make sure that your sodium and electrolytes stay at a decent level.Feel free to message me! :)52grams of carbs? I have it set for 20grams and it works for me. If it goes over for any reason try cycling the different meals. http://i.imgur.com/yOxOYY7.jpg &lt;-general exampleHah. No.

Hunger is natural, and there's nothing weak about eating what makes you feel less hungry.

Further, there's nothing wrong with eating what jives well with your body, and avoiding what messes you up.

Your mother-in-law is saying what is tantamount to "He allergic to peanuts, he weak person because can't eat peanuts. Bad person." 

There's no reason for you to feel bad about it.

It tells you more about HER (she's a bad person) than it does about you ;)I started in November but haven't been good about sticking to it for about a month (back at it though!) From the beginning my goal loss is about 30 lbs and we are the same age! Feel free to PM me too :-)first time on keto (2012) i was fine, avoided the flu for the most part aside from feeling a bit "brain foggy"

this time around, it's every bit as bad as i've read it can be. 

also, your dinner sounds amazing.Ladies can do anything! We just add cream to ours.Thanks for the help! I will try this!
Thanks my man! I will try my best!
I hadn't seen this before. Thank you!PM anytime started a week ago, good luck on your goalsCan ladies do that too? =)Indiana.  We've got Mperks all over the place ;)That's really unfortunate. I am coworkers with someone on paleo and they are always the most sympathetic to my annoyance over food options in the office cafeteria. Tell her you have cancer.If I were you I'd take creatine,  and then ego lift try to lift and sustain a pump. Last few weeks do a keto diet to shed your water weight.I posted a couple of days ago, but I was also suffering keto flu really badly that day.
half my lunch came back up.

some helpful people here told me to get some electrolytes into me. 
all i could find was powerade zero from the convenience store next to work. 

seemed to help a lot

and this is the third time ive started keto, but never experienced anything this bad before! between that and the sugar withdrawals. omfg. kill me.
 
i swear sugar is more addictive than methCongratulations!

You're right; cereal won't help.  You'd still have the anxiety, plus you'd feel sick and bloated, plus you'd be really ticked off at yourself, and you'd probably knock a few points off you test score.  Well, I would, anyway.  My brain words much, much better on keto.


Stick to your guns and slam that exam!Interesting. Have a link? These aren't "herbal" supplements... I'm not into that hippy shit... so I wonder if the FDA investigation is going to cover these vitamins. I've always viewed the generic Equate brand as fairly trustworthy but if it turns out they've been screwing me over for years I'll switch.

Seems legit, though... my urine coloration is noticeably different depending on if I took my vitamins that day or not.I had to give up talking to people about food.The regular nuggets are done exactly the same as the filet on the sandwich. I worked at chick-fil-a.Proud of you for finding a better way to deal with your stress! You can do this! Good luck on your exams! When I look at BFP comparison pictures, I look more like 45%. All this is so confusing! And exactly why I'm starting to lift! Whoa! That batter looks pretty cool. Post back with the chicken pics if you use it!Oh no doubt. But I'm okay with it being such trace amounts that they don't register for a single serving of food. If it's listed as "&lt;1g" it goes in the notebook as 1g.You can PM me!I've noticed a lot more places have started to offer it! McDonald's being one of the more notable onesThanks for taking the time to share videos!  

You seemed really nice on camera. I deduced from a YouTube comment that you were Canadian.  

Intuition confirmed.  Looks like you missed out on a prime opportunity for a hall pass my man.  What's that Baxter? You pooped in the refrigerator? and you ate a whole wheel of Brie?! How'd you do that? I'm not even mad, that's amazing,Hmm, haven't thought about chicken nuggets for a long time, but this made me crave them, and I just happen to have a ton of chicken thighs laying around.  
  
I might try and wiggle my [fish batter](http://highsteaks.com/egg-and-cheese-battered-fish-bites/) recipe to see how it might work.I honestly do drink a decent amount of water, I'm in school and bring a liter size water bottle every day and finish it ATLEAST once, then when I'm at home I only drink water, or the diet tea from time to time or a coffee at work. But I mainly try to just stay with water Great jobJust total in MFP. I'd been trying to stay with lower-carb options but I'm easily tempted :(  why didn't you ask them to wrap it in lettuce or add more toppings? You seem to have gotten what you asked for besides the increase in price. ...no? I was just trying to eat "normal" food in portion. Still new to this.


 Shit.Don't be obsessed with "am I in Keto yet" and just stick to the program - if you eat less than 20g carb a day, you'll be in Keto soon.   
Don't get stressed if/when you plateau - your body will likely be healthier and that's the goal and the point.  

Good luck, stay positive and check in here if you have questions!Total I guess, just going off of MFP.


I'm a really bad muncher I guess :/I always get diet Dr pepper &lt;33 one of like three restaurants that have itShe's probably a sociopath who speaks badly behind your back.  The workplace is full of these nutjobs.  This rabbit hole goes deep.Meijer! Yea! Which of the 5 mid-west states are you in?Definitely try the almond flour and powdered parm one! You can play around and adjust the proportions too. Sometimes I prefer more almond flour. Just don't forget to add some salt, pepper, and seasoning of choice!

I've made this in a frying pan as well.The first time I did keto I felt fine days one and two. Day three I felt like death and I shit my brains out all day. Not cool. Then it got better. It might not effect you. I can only last about 16 hours before a headache kicks in. I don't think it's for everyone either. It doesn't help me stop stalling. Great job!!!! It is such a great feeling to pass a big milestone!Very new, yes.  And wow, that's some serious eggs.  I thought I was going overboard with 14 eggs and 30 strips of bacon a week.Saved! And thank you! I made pork rind encrusted ones and they were okay but kind of soggy with no crunch. I'll have to try this. I bought two silpats on an Amazon lightening deal.  I love them and wish I had bought one sooner. I thought it was going to be a link to [this](http://huntgatherlove.com/content/paleo-vs-primal-vs-atkins) Paleo/Primal/Atkins (keto?)

No.  But you can definitely put some muscle on for a decent beach body.  Head over to /r/fitness abs read up.

Edit:  by March?  I thought you said by the Summer!

The most you can do by March won't be much at all.I was doing this as well. I play volleyball, soccer, and run 4-6 times a week so I make sure to eat some carbs daily to keep my energy up.I know.. whoever runs that blog must use a professional photographer.. lol. I don't have anything as fancy as pancake shaper thing.. so I have to use the xanthan gum to keep them from running all over the skillet. 

The coconut pancake sounds really yummy. I've found low sugar syrup before that had like 7 net carbs.. but I think the recipe on ruled.me had like.. 2 net carbs or something. When we're trying to keep them under 20, each little carb counts a lot for me.. lol.

I recently realized my breath mints contain 2 carbs a pop. ouch. :/First day ever on a ketogenic diet, which is why I ask. It seems unlikely that I would just transition suddenly into ketosis after 24 hours of a low-carb diet. I haven't had any headaches or anything.You're new around here aren't you?

Dietary cholesterol doesn't have the effect on your heart you think it does.

I frequently eat 24-36 eggs in a week and roughly 4 pounds of meat. My blood lipids are fantastic.I get this and it hasn't kicked me out of Keto, because it's only 9 net carbs. It is lightly breaded as opposed to the filet in the sandwich. You just can't eat it with most of their sugary sauces though. I also get an unsweet tea and add stevia or if I forget they always have sugar subs, like Splenda, available. Add a side salad and your golden. Their grilled nuggets are gross imo.Feel free to PM meI watched some documentary about IF, then I didn't eat for three days.  On day three I started feeling like Ghandi or Jesus.  All my aches and pains went away and i felt all calm and peaceful.  Even my grumpy personality went away.  It was totally weird and I'm never doing it again.Is this your first day on a ketogenic diet, or your first day in ketosis? It sounds like from your post you've gone 1 day eating low carb and youre already in ketosis (which would be quite impressive)

If it's your first day on a keto diet ever, a lot of people go through carb withdrawal which can get quite nasty. People get super grumpy and start salivating when someone mentions bread. However when you're past that, as long as you eat enough fat to satiate yourself you shouldnt feel bad at all.

In regards to actually being in ketosis: some people report runny noses or feeling under the weather (keto flu). Outside of that most people get a burst of energy and feel amazing (I know I feel much better now that I'm not shoving my face full of carbs every day)I would recommend cutting down on the drinks. How much water do you drink a day? I've been around for a while now but there are several of us Seattleites (and surouding area) around /r/keto and /r/xxketo. Welcome and feel free to PM! :)I am nodding in agreement so hard right now. I'm late but their chicken salad in a bowl is good. I eat with just a fork or with cucumbers or pickels. 

Be prepared for confusion while ordering. You do NOT want a chicken salad or a chicken salad sandwich. Just chicken salad in a cup. HTH!!Another thing you could try is ween down on the carbs. Try maybe 100g for a few days, then down to 75 for a few days, then to 50, etc. This works better for some than cold turkeyTry brawndo. What happened?Don't eat croutons. Don't eat cheetos. Don't eat pre-made cheesecake filling or cupcakes. Don't eat things with names like "Maple caramel" or "Sweet heat." 

Are you tracking total carbs or net carbs?Hell yes! Are you counting net carbs or just all carbs?

The other thing I notice is that you're still eating carby food, just in tiny portions.  I think this might be part of your problem, because things like a tiny cupcake or cheetos have so many carbs that you're blowing a good chunk of carbs on one tiiiiinnnnny amount of food.  Those flaming hot cheetos must have had at least 5 carbs.  If you consider it, that's 25% of your daily amount in, like, 13 little sticks of cheetos.  For many of us, that's almost 1 meal's worth of carbs (I aim to top out at about 7 at most in 1 meal).

Also, lite or diet versions of foods have more carbs.  Lite sour cream can have 2 carbs per serving, while full fat sour cream has .4 carbs per serving.They sound hangry. You should have thrown some non-grass-fed bacon at them and ran away!12 count of grilled nuggets dumped on top of a side salad with ranchYou should check out Healthy Wage too. If you have a substantial amount of weight to lose (50 pounds or more), the win is totally worth it. My boss signed up. He stands to triple his money over eight months if he loses fifty pounds. Is this a joke?Maybe. I haven't tried it.  Try some and see. You won't have wasted much if it doesn't work.I saw a recipe on here a while ago for "fauxtmeal" which was equal parts flax meal, chia seeds, and unsweetened coconut. Add some sweetener if you require it (I use swerve), some cinnamon, and some water - microwave 30 to 45 seconds, and ta-daa oatmeal!

I sometimes add berries, too. :)http://m.imgur.com/a/a8te2



Screenshots of MFP diaryGood to see another keto follower from the Seattle area. If you can start on Super Bowl Sunday, you can get through anything :)http://m.imgur.com/a/a8te2 

There are some screenshots of MFP diaryWait last Thursday.  You've gone that long?"Still, despite some revisions, the main advice never changes: eat more fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and eat less saturated fats, salt and sugar." - Don't forget that line in the article.

Also, it states that "While they are based on dietary science, the guidelines aren't immune to politics.".  I'm seriously wondering how OP is  struggling to keep it under 30gsEat meat, fats, and low-carb vegetables. Eat the lowest carb vegetables from this list.

Cobb salads are a reasonably good choice. Mixed greens, bacon, avocado, boiled egg, mushrooms, cheese, full-fat salad dressing.

Don't drink any carbs.:)Drinking lots of water without bolstering electrolytes will only make you feel like hell.  Ever heard of water poisoning?  That's it.

Drink some broth or salty water with a splash of lemon.  Then hit the grocery store to track down some Nu or Lite Salt for potassium.  While you're there buy a chelated magnesium supplement (ends in 'ate').  The FAQ should have the dosage you need but keep in mind that it is on top of standard daily intake.

Electrolytes will help sooo very much you'll wonder why you could have ever forgotten them.You bred raptors?Think this would work with Met-RX protein powder? I find it to be extra thick for some reason Try this on for size: http://grainfreerecipes.com/986/herby-flaxseed-meal-pizza-dough/Awesome! Thanks for your efforts. I look forward to seeing any improvements or reading about your next creation.I was one of the first to get the original version, and as long as you haven't had booze in the last couple days it tracks well enough with blood ketones. I've tested them side by side probably 50+ times, when I'm 0.5-1.0 I blow yellow, beyond that it's red. I did it for personal love of data, but don't care to bother any more.I like your link to the Venn Diagram wiki page!Even the best diet in the world can't cure cancer I started last Tuesday (two days after you)...looking to lose 30 lbs.  If you are on MFP, you can add me.  I'm spicymelons73.  Good luck!    If you could put up a list of your average intake on a daily basis, for all meals and snacks, that would be helpful.Relax, potty mouth.hey I do it too. I'm just saying what I have read. I do 16/8 or 20/4 every dayNo kidding? I'll give it a shot tomorrow, thank you!I'm new, on my second week. Last week I stayed under 20 net grams of carbs all week, but it didn't feel like I went into ketosis. No keto flu, no funny taste in the mouth or pee smell, etc. On Sunday I ended up going way over my carb/sugar intake, so I'm sure that screwed up everything. I went back to normal on Monday and don't plan on falling off the wagon again, so to speak. I've read the FAQ a few times and still feel like I might be missing something.  

My main two questions are:  
  
1) Is there any reason why I didn't feel the effects of keto flu even staying under 20g net carbs for six days straight?  
  
2) I've been tracking my food intake on MFP as accurately as possible, and although ideal macros are 60/35/5 mine have been closer to 70/25/5. Most people I've seen have problems getting more fat as opposed to protein, but I seem to have the opposite problem. I've long been a fan of chicken thighs with the skin on, but I've gone to eating skinless chicken breasts to up my protein/fat ratio. Should I be worried right now about getting that fat-to-protein ratio closer to 60/35?

However, I will say that right before I started Keto a week and a half ago the scale said 283 and last time I weighed on Saturday it was 276. So something was working.What the fuck are you eating? I'm curious why you say this.  Are you saying they should save their fat allowance for other things that will allow more satiety?  I did BPC a couple of times during my first two weeks, didn't see any downside to it.I'm tired of telling my patient they should lose weight to help with their health problems and feeling like the biggest hypocrite on earth!Happy to hear this. I have a loaf of their sourdough on the way from Netrition.Yes, there has been a weird spur of downvoting going on in this sub since the News Years.  I least that's what I've noticed.  This thread alone is covered in negative karma.

Anyway, thanks for the advice.Yeah that is what I thought. On facebook I read some people mentioning at least 5$+ per test! Meh. I don't have enough money to sustain something like that. Indian food is generally pretty good.  Chicken Tika, Kurmas ectI'm pretty sure I read that fat loss goes in this order of significance. Diet &gt; Weight Lifting &gt; Cardio.Welcome back. I am only a couple months in and depend on this community. I am saddened by some of the harsher responses, and ridicule, but find overall most comments are welcoming and encouraging. Good luck and blessings on your journey, and congratulations on your wedding. Especially because of my GAD, I need regular reminders that I am doing things right, I was alarmed by my reading and I don't think that it is wrong to ask the question I asked. Some people just love to attack other people while they are only trying to learn their new body and new lifestyle. For sure, some responses I got here would have scared some people off. Thank you /u/Addbutter for your empathy.Thank you so much for helping me try and find ways to spare on calories. It means a lot! I spent a lot pf money in groceries (mainly the almond flour) and threw out a lot of cupcakes for this. I'll continue to experiment and come back with an update if I crack the code!You sure need to stop hitting on my head. There is NOTHING wrong in being concerned and ask. I'm only 10 days into this so give me a fucking break.Never be embarrassed to modify an order when eating out to make it keto-friendly... your long term success is worth more than a few seconds of confusion or a condescending stare. Most of the time, they don't even bat an eye. You're paying for the meal - pay for the meal you want. Plus, you're avoiding wastage. 

Flat out telling the server to make up the order without carbs is the best option, rather than simply pushing them to the side of the plate where you might be tempted/peer pressured into "not wasting food". 

Being "forced" to eat carbs due to dining out should never be a reason to break keto. If worst comes to worst, just say NO! If you think you'll be tempted, eat before hand (if possible), or eat after. Spend the meal focusing on the company or the delicious meal you'll eat once you get home! 
I wasn't going to cancel an entire pharmacy order just for a freaking 7$ box of ketostix. Calm yourself will you? I don't need your judgement. I got to go to a dietician. I never went back.  Mine told me to eat my carbs and with each meal.  Potatoes are so good for you....I don't agree with that definition. I am taking in very meagre amounts of fat (butter and coconut oil; about 200 Cals) to keep the body in fat burning mode. This lasts all day until I break my fast 12-14 hours later. You're telling me that's not fasting?! Where exactly did reddit get that 10 Cal/hour definition?

People can do their version of IF, and that's great if it works for them however they define it. This is working for me. When I do 48 hour fasts, I only intake about 400 Cals for 2 entire days, in the morning as fat in BPC! Oh that's not fasting?thanks! anbeavSorry didn't read everyone else's reply. Can't take credit for most of this, I've  gathered things from this sub.

If you're craving anything, eat, you're hungry. (I was blown away by this one.)


Eat enough fiber. (I got serious nausea and stomach cramps which made me feel like death. Day 18 of my second attempt, I woke up and barfed. I'm now successfully avoid such problem with coconut flour and other soluble fiber supp.)


Drink water with plenty salt and nusalt(potassium), use the taste as a measure of how much to add, it never fails.


Bone broth, beef broth, broth, broth, broth. Salt to taste.


All the fresh herbs!


Heavy cream drinks for the lazy. I make one that provides 1000kcals of my daily intake almost every day.


Kerry gold butter _is_ worth the price.


Make your own ghee with cheaper butter for cooking.


Take it easy with coconut oil. Start with 10g a day and work your way up every so often. (Day 2 of my first trial, I had to make up calories and had used up my macros, so I force fed myself 50g of coconut oil... Had plenty of fun the next morning.)
Give yourself time to adjust, not everyone loses that big water weight in the first few days. It takes time for the carb crave to subside, sometimes. This diet is the most adjustable to fit your lifestyle that I have been on, so fit it to you, as long as you get the protein, electrolytes, and good fats your body needs. Take advantage of the support, advice, and encouragement found here. And yes, be careful about giving in to that high carb favorite treat, because it can become a snowball effect. But if you do, forgive and get back on track. KCKO.and headaches!Actually when you're fully keto adapted, you have so much energy that you don't sleep that much.

But sleep is important, keto or not. It's the time when your brains does a lot of work sorting memories and such, and regulation of certain hormones are done during sleep. Adults really should get 8 hours sleep a night, and that should burn about 1000 Cals, depending on weight. Night, because all life on Earth above the ground has evolved using the sun to set circadian cycles. Sleep in a fully dark room. Disrupting this cycle with on and off sleep may not be the best thing to do because it can add a lot of stress to your life as well as depression. My advice is to try to go to sleep earlier. 

Personally, I have noticed weight loss on the scale stalling when I don't get enough sleep, and i feel like crap.Ahhhh I see! Thank you so so much for the detailed information! I will ask my local friends how to type in Chinese to look them up. 

That's cool! No wonder you know so well about the local cuisine... ;)When I first started keto I over thunk it. (poor grammar I know)Iit took me about 2 weeks to realize it was as simple as just eating.  If you can pick a weekend to do nothing but relax and eat keto you will get past the tough part.  Batch cook some bacon, get that cheese cut up and ready to snack on. Eat cream cheese and pork rinds. Drink the broth.  Saute some spinach in bacon grease. Eat a big ass steak. Prepare for the worse and you will find that you aren't thinking about it at all.[Don't stop once you're "finished."](http://np.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2tl4hu/graph_keto_works/)Belizz has a good idea. I just salt my food and I take magnesium and potassium tablets. I'll try the Mio trick though. I've found that since I started keto I'm taking more high sodium foods anyway. Haven't run into much trouble except today I have a terrible headache. Will probably up the salt intake tomorrow. I think that Keto is stricter in the sense that you pretty much rid your diet of most sugars. Where some use artificial stuff, I rather not.  I have know many paleo peep who swear fruits sugar is some other variant that doesn't qualify as sugar. I've seen them try to recreate their favorite desserts with as much sweet stuff as they can. 
However, in the end it really comes down to perspective, its silly for someone to blow up on you for saying such a simple thing. I just saw those 2 days after I bought my big bag :(Be Patient!  Eat when you are hungry. Keep keto friendly stuff around.  Eat when you are hungry. (notice I said that twice)   If you feel like cheating eat some bacon, eat some cheese, drink a diet root beer with heavy cream.  KEEP KETO no matter what! :-)Diet Dr Pepper and heavy cream. About a 5 to 1 ratio of DP to cream.Don't even bother trying food substitutes like low carb tortillas and quest bars. I'm currently trying to ween myself off of stuff like that. The first time I did keto, I lost 40 pounds in 4 months. I didn't know alot of products existed, so I ate really simple and didn't even track macros. Now, I'm struggling at a stall, despite being meticulous with macros, and I know it's because I eat at least one carby substitute a day. Nice!  Let me know how it turns out.

&gt; I stuck to a small batch this time because I substituted peanut butter for almond butter

Definitely the smart thing to do the first time, though I'm guessing almond butter would work just as well.  I actually used half butter / half olive oil my very first time because I had no coconut oil (still tasted great).  From what I've noticed, the more substitutions one makes, the more you *might* have to make up in sweetener.  

One good thing about this recipe is that you can pretty much just taste test the mixture after it's melted and gauge how it will be (then add whatever little touches to finish -- I've added nuts before).  As long as that tastes great, you'll be fine.I've always wondered if I should head to the doctor to discuss these symptoms but I think it's just my body trying to get used to such low carbs. Once I get used to it, I'm sure I'll feel way better. It's just going to take a ton of determination in the next couple of weeks. I thought the same way, but the more I am on the diet, I find the less food I need to get that full feeling due to the richness of food and the longer I go without being hungry.I have battled with blood sugar issues with all of the highs and lows, and was accustomed to having to eat something every couple hours to keep my sugar level up high enough to keep from getting weak and having the shakes. I am awed that I no longer get the hypoglycemic reactions, and I usually eat no more than 2 meals a day, with an occasional snack. After living for years having to be always aware of the time and making sure I carried an adequate snack I feel a real sense of freedom. Look,for low carb substitutes if you feel the need, but after while you may find you no longer want them. Good luck and blessings on your journey.Homemade Gatorade/headache buster=  1-2 squirts of MIO (my favorite is cranberry raspberry), 1/2 tsp of Lite Salt in 24 ounces of water.   Your on an enlightened path.I completely agree and I appreciate your honesty. I know I just have to tough through it, sometimes it just gets hard. But that's life. Thanks again for the advice. You may also want to skip your daily exercise until you are past the keto flu. If you are getting enough electrolytes, then the likely cause of your headache is insufficient fuel.

When eating high-carb, your brain uses around 120 grams of glucose. On low-carb, you are only eating 20 grams of glucose. The rest is supplied via:

* glucose from burning fat (from the glycerol)
* converting protein to glucose (gluconeogenesis)
* ketones

Your brain may not do a very good job of burning ketones on the first day since it has not yet adapted. So eating a bit extra of protein and fat can help. That's why avoiding the calorie deficit is likely a good idea at first.
I just gave that website a try and it told me to consume 52+ grams after subtracting the carbs in a single day. I clicked on the Keto - Atkins. Vaguely on topic:  if anyone was looking to pick up some xanthum gum but not sure they wanted to buy a full pound of the stuff, I found the following little bags of it at Walmart:

https://ashleyshomemadeadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_4001.jpg

It's .32 ounces for 49 cents.  Located in the baking aisle, clustered with their other gluten free items.  I think the problem was that he tried to cure cancer with it.I usually call that breakfast.Hey thanks for the tips, my first batch is getting chilled right now and im really excited! I stuck to a small batch this time because I substituted peanut butter for almond butter and wasnt sure how the outcome would be :PYou mentioned 8 hours of sleep.

With myself getting off at midnight and getting up with my SO at 7:00 AM the next morning, I'm typically getting 6 hours of sleep. Is this going to majorly effect the weight loss benifits of eating a Keto Diet?

Should I find time to take a two hour nap? 

*Edit: spelling.
I think it's probably relative to what kind of foods you crave. I'd have a harder time on paleo diet without dairy products or the occasional peanuts (they are legumes). On the other hand you're "allowed" to eat more nuts (real ones), root vegetables and can also eat fruit on a paleo diet so if you're in to that paleo might feel less strict.Eatthismuch.com can give you meals based on your specific macros from the Keto calculator and you can tell it you are doing keto as well. It can be really helpful to at least see the options it gives you for your meals. If it didn't make me feel terrible, then I wouldn't be going on and off the diet. Um, I thought under 25g of carbs was required fir ketosis.  I'm confused. Can someone double-check for us?Stop going on and off if you want your body to adjust Holy s***! I woke up today with a terrible headache and low electrolytes and did _exactly_ that! I was not prepared for what happened next.

Did you find another quick and easy way to get your salt? I struggle to put too much of it on food. I also take NoSalt for potassium and that is terrible on food.That may be it...

However, it's also possible that this supervisor is a cannibal. Obviously she had designs (recipe?) for OP, which are now totally messed up because of the weight loss. And it's just getting worse and worse for her every day.

KETO PROTIP: If your co-workers are worried about your weight loss too much, they just may be cannibals.Grilled chicken, salads And no, I'm usually not hungry. I actually stay pretty full throughout the day since I'm eating more fat. Controls my anxiety and moods, also.  A few weeks ago I cheated and had a normal serving of sushi rolls with soy sauce (I know, gluten) .... After 40 minutes I wanted to kill myself, literally.  I was googling painless suicide.  Scared the crap out of me!Unbreaded filet or nuggets. I tend to obsess over my macros, but I will take your advice on not counting calories right now. I'll just focus on staying away from carbs. Thank you :)I add lite salt to like everything, its a habit now honestly Their grilled nuggets are awesome and very low carb. Also, even an 8 count of their regular nuggets is below 10 carbs, which is crazy to me!It could also be that you're drinking TOO much water and it's flushing out even your extra electrolytes. Only you can tell based on urination, everyone needs different amounts of water.

I would recommend the no/nu-salt stuff, I doubt you're getting enough potassium. You're still missing that one.

I just saw you exercise ~500 calories of cardio. Maybe you should cut that down a bit and eat at maintenance until you are comfortable with keto, and *after* start a deficit+exercise.Get electrolytes, especially sodium, in the amounts detailed in the FAQ.* Take a week's vacation to coincide with the induction phase, because keto flu can be that bad.
* Don't try to restrict your calories the first week. There will be enough going on with carb withdrawal, keto flu, and needing to cook 90% of your food.
* Make sure you have a working scale so you can start weighing yourself before starting.

Actually, I'm lying... I was on top of the first two and everything worked out fine because of it.Sounds like you've tried about everything!  Thanks for doing all of the experimenting.But are you still hungry? You may just need more food. Don't worry so much about the calorie counting right now, your body will take time to adjust to processing fats while your glycogen stores are being depleted.

Focus on making sure that you are satisfying your hunger, avoiding carbs and not putting extra stress on yourself.Here is a recipe for cream cheese frosting using Truvia that claims to have 0 carbs per serving. I haven't tried it. If it works, then that could save another 1.5 grams of carbs per cupcake. Worth a try if anyone wants to experiment.

I found another recipe for cream cheese frosting that uses Truvia and butter. Maybe it would be better. 

http://shortcutmenus.com/2011/11/sugar-free-cream-cheese-frosting-with-stevia/
I've been doing keto + IF for a few weeks now. The combination is insane at burning fat. Far better than calorie counting ever wasessential fibers = 0I tried that. I can show you the bag! It was disgusting as well. The cupcakes sank in the middle and had a bitter aftertaste. I use it for zillion things. Nut breads and nut cakes, I mix it with egg and vegetable purree and bake it - but it's never alone, there are other nuts involved too. Pure flax bread is horrible to me. I never have enough eggs to use them in big amount for bread. But this one is so lovely I bake it sometimes:
http://www.charliefoundation.org/resources-and-tools/find-recipes-home/breads-rolls-and-muffins/item/978-high-fiber-rolls
 
I put ground flax seed on my scrambled egg today. I put it on my mixed raw veggies or fried veggies. I typically eat everything with raw veggies but I need something dry too sometimes, with some calorie and fiber content... And I don't always have bread and it's simpler. Okay, it wasn't so great on the eggs.

And I have this:
10-10 g ground flax seed, coconut and walnut (everything ground), a little water or nut milk, I tend to use some butter too.
Spices or whatever we want (cocoa, fruit).
It's a quick meal for hungry times. I personally like its taste too.I'm eating about 1700-1800 calories a day and then I exercise at night. I'm definitely eating enough, but it probably isn't potassium rich foods like avocados and spinach. And I love both of those, so I will try to incorporate more of those into my diet. When I say a lot of water, it's usually a gallon a day. Yes, add more butter. Yes, add more salt. YES!No, I have been going off and on. When I do the diet, I stick to about 20 carbs a day. 

I'm 5'7" and 213 lbs. I eat about 1700 calories a day and get about 120-140g of protein. When I exercise, I do cardio and burn about 500 calories. But the thing is, I exercise at night and am feeling sick about 5 hours before exercising. How many calories are you consuming? Are you hungry?This might be of interest to you as well:

[eatingacademy.com/nutrition/do-calories-matter](http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/do-calories-matter)

&gt; "All calories are not created equally: The energy content of food (calories) matters, but it is less important than the metabolic effect of food on our body."I am sure others will chime in with better advice, but.

I highly doubt there is enough potassium in that supplement if it's a typical magnesium supp. Did you add additional potassium, like nu-salt? Avocados, spinach?

According to your other post you seem to be eating enough but are you hungry? 

You don't need powerade zero. How much is "a lot of" water? You should be seeing 5+ clear urinations per day.Have you been sticking to 15 to 20 grams of carbs for the entire past month? Or have you been going off the diet periodically and then trying again? If you've been going for a month straight, you should be past the point of having these symptoms if it is the typical keto flu.

If you are determined to follow keto, it is worth going to the doctor and asking for an electrolyte blood panel test to rule out deficiencies in electrolyte balance.

Another possibility is that you could be eating too few calories. What is your height, weight, total daily calorie expenditure, and target calories? What are your macros for protein and fat? How much exercise if any?I like the analogy: "If you get a flat tire, you wouldn't get out a knife and slash the other three tires, would you?"This looks like my favorite yet! Cauliflower crusts are getting a bit old. There's crazies in every group, whether it be diet or religion. The longer I eat differently than most people, the less I'm willing to discuss diet at all with people. Somehow it tends to bring out the crazy in even the most sane seeming people. Keto especially seems to bring out the crazy. Those websites would be great!! Thanks for your advice.Thanks. Appreciate it. It seems strict is subjective, maybe it means "easy for me" here...

I'd say paleo is way less strict (I try to be objective) but it's just my first guess, it's impossible to compare the two I think... And I might be biased because I met paleo first and went almost totally paleo, then met keto and went keto for a while... Keeping paleo except for some interesting recipe in the beginning. And I never mentioned vegetarianism, not like I do it nowadays, I'm just very close to it, I have about 29-30 vegetarian days a month...

Paleo is very easy if you ask me. Keto is harder (according to the few weeks I was on it) but not so very extreme, a veggie lover hedonist like me could do it for a while, after all. But it feels better.
I plan to make keto my lifestyle - with occassional cheat meals (I forgot how one can say it nicer) when I eat more veggies, a little more fruit and even more veggies, but nothing extreme.

Vegetarianism was the easiest, I simply couldn't not to do it. But it changed when I met the wonderful salmon...

Of course, others would say drastically different things. If someone can't live without a ton of fruits or fell in love with oats, keto seems hell.
To me, every low-fat diet is hell and would cause suicidal thought in a few days, I'm sure. I never tried that (not eating anything for days doesn't count, that's way better).

Nothing as strict as paleo? :D I would have laughed at it for minutes if I were there. What about raw vegan, zerocarb, vegan paleo? Hey, even my almost-vegetarian almost-paleo is more strict!
I'd even say it must be easy eating meat :D And they could hate me all they want. I'm not a nice person though I don't think I'm very intolerant, especially regarding diets. And they shouldn't take me oh so seriously. Why can't people just discuss topics of diets in a calm way?

Oh I got carried away again.Sounds like yes and yes to me.  Keto flu from lack of salt.  Try drinking some broth, and also use No Salt or Nu Salt for potassium if you're not.  A magnesium supplement is also helpful.I guess I am fortunate that most people I interact with do not respond like they did. Instead I would expect questions like "What do you mean by strict?"  or comment "Not in my experience."  Especially when prefaced with "I'm not familiar..."  I'm definitely not used to someone taking up an immediate offense and striking out.  Have you tried Truvia Baking Blend instead of the Splenda Brown Sugar blend? It says to use half the amount of sugar that you would use. This is the same as what the Splenda Brown Sugar Blend box says. However, Truvia only has 32 grams of carbs in 1/3 cup instead of the 64 grams that Splenda Brown Sugar Blend has.

If it will work, then you could save 32 grams of carbs out of the recipe for a net reduction of 2.13 carbs per cupcake.

http://truvia.com/recipes/conversion_chartThis sounds good and so easy...  I do have some ground turkey in my freezer, I'll have to try it - thanks for the idea!  Oh, and congratulations on your fantastic progress :)I always like to put this into context like this:

83 lbs is almost 38 kg. That's 19 two-liter bottles of Coca Cola that's he's always been lugging around. Or nearly 10 standard US gallons of water. Or, you know those water cooler bottles (carboys), the ones that usually hold 19 liters or 5 gallons? That's _two_ of those in lost weight.

Imagine walking around in life carrying two full carboys with you everywhere.

Since starting keto, I've stopped carrying 4 gallons worth of weight with me everywhere I go.
Great tips here. I'll just add that alcohol can be part of a Keto diet (especially zero carb choices like gin), but it may slow down weight loss because your body deals with the alcohol before it gets to burning fat. I found that I didn't lose (although didn't gain either) those days I had an alcoholic drink or two.  But I know not everyone finds this - it may have had more of an effect on me because I am a small woman who didn't have much to lose (and in maintenance now). Also -- a body in Keto cannot handle liquor! Your tolerance will have dropped and hangovers are brutal. Stay hydrated.Wonderful job!  Congratulations to you!  :)Looks like the heavy carb hitters are:

* brown sugar splenda blend @ 64 grams
* almond flour @ 30 grams
* vanilla frosting @ 21 grams

Those three together account for 7.7 grams of the 9.2 total per cupcake.

Here's a Google spreadsheet that I made in case anyone wants to make a copy and experiment.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AN5QlMTvN49PZWy003UBSUVZ_6n_zPm0gUzPqlJ-Z3U/edit?usp=sharingNo they are, that's just a reference that gives you an idea of how much energy you get from the same amount of fat/protein/carbs BY MASS. What you see on the label is already accounted for this (though you will notice that smaller amounts of fat have lots more calories than a similar sized protein/carb). Again, you need to re-read.  I wasn't trying to educate them, but simply answer their question briefly and concisely.   I lost 2kg when I did an egg fast, and I was eating more than usual. It still didn't break my latest plateau :)NO  
Two weeks is not a plateau.  
Ask again in about 3 months ;)  Congrats!!! I bet that feels great! Mexican is hard because their food is VERY carb based. You might get away with a naked burrito (in a bowl) if you can specify the ingredients used. These kinds of people exist in every dietary group, unfortunately. Don't take it personally :)

I eat paleo/primal keto, and I don't see what's wrong with the OP's statement. I think paleo *is* less strict if you're looking at carbs. Ketosis is a very real limit (you're either in ketosis or not in ketosis). While paleo may naturally be lower carb than the SAD, it certainly doesn't restrict carbs in the same way someone on a keto diet must restrict carbs. Lots of paleo folks eat tubers, higher carb veggies, and fruit. Some even eat rice. Paleo is stricter in other aspects, so I guess I can see both sides. 

But either way, getting p*ssed over keto is a bit silly.I don't know enough about how humans work but I have a hunch eating only fruits doesn't enough. I can't imagine that. Raw veganism seems to work, zerocarb seems to work, they are just complicated to do well in my eyes. Eating only fruits for a long time... Well, it seems dangerous to me. I'd love to read about it more but not so much I actively search for it :D It has nothing to do with me, I just love fruits - in tiny amounts and not all the time :)Try having some Bovril or broth if you feel drowsy around that time. You just need to up your electrolytes.Porridge

I also like to add strawberries, raspberries, blueberries or some carob depending on how I want it. Meal planning is the biggest help for me. If I don't have to think about or decide what to have for dinner I'm 100% more likely to stay on plan.Started IF last Thursday, lost 7.7lbs! Only thing I suggest is to keep something handy to up your electrolytes like some salt, boullion cubes you can mix with hot water or Powerade One which has 0 carbs. In my first day I was fine, but second day I started feeling dizzy, nauseous and my body aching all over. It helped drinking Bovril but until my body adapted, until day 4, I felt very weak. I wasn't hungry just needed elecytrolytes.After I bake them I throw them in a skillet with bacon grease and butter for 5-10 minutes until they are more pastalikeGet a Shatafa (Hand bidet). Your bum will love you. I just squirt a little water up there to lubricate the "pipes" and it works wonders.  

Also, drink more water and make sure you take a Mg supplement. Probably been said already but heavy cream, coconut oil, almond butter, olive oil etc..I love vegetables and I'm worried about eating too little... But my diet is probably much more restrictive. Zerocarbers surely haven't this problem.
Why are you worried? Vegetables are great (not super healthy because nothing is that nowadays *sigh*).  At least in my not-expert-at-all eyes. It's a wonder I can limit them on keto but I love lowcarb ones too and I have a generous carb limit just because I depend on vegetables. I'm close to being a vegetarian and anyway, I LOVE them with a passion. Many people eats kind of much vegetables on keto, what would be the problem if it's not too much carb for them?From what I understand..., this diet basically killed Steve Jobs. I just finished making this, but with homemade Alfredo sauce and crab, it is really friggin good, thank you!Welcome back and I wish you luck! Eat yummy, healthy meals and get your ideal figure and have a lot of energy! :)

To me, keto is way cheaper than my usual almost paleo diet. And that was the same as my normal diet, despite some pricy and frequently used ingredients. We are very poor now and keto will make our costs less :D Especially if I can keep myself from eating too much erythritol every day :-/
I eat veggies and nuts and eggs and coconut oil and butter, they aren't very expensive (they might be, depends on the type).

I fell off the wagon myself (my keto life didn't last long but was great), stayed low-carb and lose a bit more weight... Very slowly and because of keto anyway. My diminished hunger stayed, I was able to eat at a deficit if I focused on it. But it was tiring, it was easier on keto. And I felt better on keto. Had more energy. I tried to come back but it was hard, there are so many kind of valid excuses why not exactly now.... Then I got angry and said I do it. Now. It's the worst possible time ingredients wise, and what? I love challenges (well there are a limit...), I will do it almost totally plant based in the first days if I must! So I'm here, reading stories, they are pretty encouraging. They makes my newborn decision stronger. I need that.I guess you didn't check the sidebar http://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscienceOh, indeed at least on the biological level. When I become a frothing, drunk-munchie-seeking cookie monster though is when it can be hard to toe the line of the straight and narrow. :DI have the opposite problem. I saute mine in Alfredo sauce and they get all soggy and make the sauce runny. Maybe I should try roasting. Some Paleos go to harsh extremes like eating raw intestine for gut flora, consuming only foraged greens, or refusing to eat any non-sprouted seed (including mustard and sesame).

I think anyone who heads down the path of a restrictive diet runs the risk of feeling constantly tormented, but also feels a sense of accomplishment over their extreme determination.

I think the most strict diet is fruititarians, who only eat raw fruits (in a way that doesn't kill the plant). They feel like they are constantly starving, no matter how much they eat.Beware, keto has a diuretic effect and too little sodium can raise blood pressure as wellFriend of mine is paleo and thinks I'm crazy limiting carbs to such a degree, has tried to tell me I'm going to die without carbs. Funny thing is he started paleo to reduce inflammation because of a back problem that paleo helps manage as he doesn't eat starches. He'd benefit from going even lower carb but is pretty adamant that you need to eat all the wonderful carby foods paleo keeps trying to add into the dogma.Get your veggies in and take Psyllium husk powder. Your asshole will thank you. Rememeber you only get one ass, take care of it. I think I'll just eliminate some sodium. And drink more water. Thanks. The formatting of your post looks good to me on my tablet. Welcome back! I'm all new here and stuff, doing a lot of what it sounds like you did. Trying to be part of a community where I found this big life upgrade called Keto. Being positive, being helpful if I can.

This subreddit is very active, and just everyday you see all these new to Keto posts. It is exciting in a way. Like this is an idea that is catching on or at least being made known. I wish I had heard of Keto earlier, or at the very least hadn't been so misinformed by the dogma of nutrition standards that exists from the political world (because it is politic$, not science-based). There is so much misconception and just outright wrong facts it could be really tough for someone coming into Keto. Personally I lurked and researched everything for about a month before diving in and yet, I'm still learning.

Best of luck, strength, and may your Keto budget be successful :)If you're worried consult your doctor. Well I'm a little bit concerned. I haven't nearly gotten 5000mg of sodium a day. I'm afraid if I add any more it could be hazardous. I don't eat salads at buffets because I have them at home, but I sure do eat a lot of meat.Tell her you have a horrible disease of the butt (like crohn's) that causes wasting, and well up with tears, then go silent.That's awesome, Chris! 

Thanks for the Keto Chow, too, by the way. I am liking it better than People Chow in terms of flavor. Keep up the good work!Don't have any suggestions for the constipation beyond what has been said by others, but that figure for [iron is *way* off](http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/).

Men are recommended to get only 8mg/day, women 18mg/day, with the tolerable upper limit for anyone at only 45mg/day. So even if you meant to say 100mg/day rather than 100g that is still over double the maximum safe dosage, and will be problematic for you. Follow the guidelines, see if that helpsThis is exactly what I do every time I try to cheat!This.  The cashew milk is amaaaazing.You get to enjoy more veggies :) I have this exact stuff and yes it's 8.7g "bad" carbs per 100g. 

However- I use a tablespoon which is only about 5g in soy milk and make milkshakes, or in minute muffins for cakes- it's a small amount so the carbs are negligible. Unless you're planning on eating the whole box then you should be ok to use it no problem!Thanks for writing this post. 

I'm new to keto. Sugar was one of the things that I thought to table and figure out later because there's just so much too read and it gets confusing because there's nothing clear cut, just opinions. 

I want an erythritol sweetener. Done. I agree. IF is a much more pleasant way to eat. I'll take a nice sized satisfying meal over a bunch of snacks any day, and feel way less hungry.It's a bit crazy in my case. On keto, I don't crave sweets. (Just fruits, sometimes.) They are just comfortable and my SO needs them. He loves sweets and he actually eat desserts to get enough calories... Sometimes their role is the same for me. Or keep myself to eat too much carbs. I almost think we cut too many food groups...
And it's a stubborn habit! I ate sweets all my life. I decide I won't eat desserts, I don't need them, after all. And the next thing I realize I do some. It just happens. I want to try out an interesting recipe, my SO needs it, I just wanted to put these together, totally not a sweet thing... But it would be yummier if sweet, yep, it totally needs that. I love coffee and cocoa but they are hard to use without a sweetener. My old sweet tooth must be angry and sabotage me. I don't like to use self discipline when I eat (I just respect my own decisions if I'm aware) so I'm vulnerable.Only difference is that you have slightly more flexibility than you thought you did. There's no harm to super-low-carb (e.g. 10 grams instead of 20), but not much benefit that I've heard of either.

Don't spend those extra 10 grams all in one place! ;-)Congrats on your SV!

I just started IF yesterday (haha) but not as drastic as you. I usually need something by about 13:00 or so or I get drowsy. It just suits my natural eating habits so much more. You have kind of inspired me to bump up my fasting window though, maybe I'll give it a shot this weekend.

Have fun with the rest of your conference, and enjoy food not being the boss of you. :)And fiber for digestion if one benefits from it.The 90%+ Lindt bars are made with Dutch-processed chocolate,  which strips them of the flavonoids and makes them bland IMO. I eat dark chocolates for the bitter flavour, dammit!

I nibble on Ghirardelli 100% instead. Pure bliss.I'm a [Venn diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) guy. I think of Paleo and Keto as overlapping Venn diagrams. You can do Keto diets that aren't Paleo, and Paleo diets that aren't Keto, and plenty of diets are both at once.

As for more strict? With Keto, it seems like there is one simple rule: eat few enough carbs (likely 20-40) for your body to remain in Ketosis. That's pretty straight forward! Get a blood meter if you want to double-check that you are doing it right. With Paleo, there are all of these arguments about what food Cro-Magnon man had access to, and whether modern beef still qualifies or if you have to hunt venison, and there's no simple test to see how you are doing. On strictness, I can see the argument going either way.You know, I probably would have said the exact same thing. So, thanks for the heads up! People can really surprise you in how passionate and reactional they get over their own diet protocols. Not all people, of course, but yesh. You did your best to stay cordial, that's the best anyone could do. KCKOFlaxseed - egg pizza base ( takes 3 minutes to make)

Then flip it over onto parchment sheet, smother with favorite pizza toppings a bake in oven for 10 - 15 mins.Welcome back. You definitely are not alone in losing 45 pounds and then gaining it all back. I did the exact same thing except I lost 45 and gained back 50 before starting again. Now I've lost 55 since the restart. I'm where I was about 5 years ago. I've been much more strict about it this time and not allowing myself to make excuses to cheat.

I hope that you find enough good here to come around from time to time.Well no knowledge of a subject sure sounds like a good way to start a disagreement. Just as I'm sure it annoys you when people spout off incorrect stuff about Keto, the same is true for Paleo folks. You're being too modest! You did carry the weight well beforehand but it's never too early to start eating healthy. :DThe super crazy thing is that after she went on and on about "you're more beautiful when you smile," she made a big scene about something (I don't even remember what it was... something work related though) and literally ran out of the building sobbing and didn't come back for the rest of the day. I'm just not sure about her.This just means that you've been eating fewer carbs than what you could have been eating. There's no requirement to eat carbs. You could do okay even if you ate zero carbs.

The main reason to eat more carbs is that it allows you to eat more vegetables which could give you more beneficial micronutrients.This looks so good. I actually made coconut flour pancakes   (Tspn of trivia in the mix) a bunch recently - cooked in coconut oil and then I buy sugar free syrup. These sound awesome too! That... is so clever. Accept and continue rather than letting the conversation stagnate at the comment. I like it!!Here are the screenshots from MyFitnessPal! Sorry they're iPhone screenshots. These are of course total carbs not counting fiber and the frosting isn't counting sugar alcohols-- I already did that math for you guys LOL. The apple sauce comes from HEB/Central Market (a grocery store here in Texas).

Brands that got cut off in the screen shots are Torani (caramel syrup), 365 Whole Foods (butter), and So Delicious (coconut milk).

http://imgur.com/a/PUhXn I hope this helps!Ahh, the "I" language. It is a brilliant thing. Our call center works with health insurance, so we're actually specifically trained to refer to the company/ourselves rather than the customer when there is a concern, especially because it's such a sensitive topic to begin with. 

Generally speaking, I genuinely love when somebody notices. It reminds me that I AM making progress however slowly... I just don't need someone to notice 3-4 times a day, lol. 

I appreciate your suggestions :)No personal experience with/knowledge of Paleo - just repeating what I've heard from people who switched over.  Well no real history of hypertension. History of some white coat syndrome other than that none. The only thing I've been doing is drinking water. I Haven't been following the guidelines. I'ma check those out. I'm a hedonist. Feeling well is basic for me. And I HATE breakfast. I have several years of experience. If I have breakfast, it's bad. If I don't, cool. I feel soooooooo way better without it! So my choice is very obvious (I couldn't even force feed myself if my brain wanted! my other parts would fight against it. I have an anti-hunger, anti-desire towards food in the morning. I CAN'T eat. And I don't wanna. I don't need. I have more energy without it. I would get hungry. It would be so silly :D)
And there are zillio people who has great results without breakfast anyway. As for me, I don't care, there are people who has great results using steroids. I want to give my body the lifestyle and diet it prefers. Our love and communication is nice and I plan to keep that.

I'm NOT an average person from the statistics. I'm unique. I don't work like the statistics think.
Some people need breakfast, some people are fine with or without it, it's wrong and feels bad for some people  and there are ones who gets really unwell, almost really sick if they eat a breakfast. Of course, diet matters a lot.As I said, I don't know a thing about Paleo, only repeating what I've been told by keto-ers switching over.  

"To have someone come and say how easy it's been to drop weight, etc, is construed as inconsiderate."   Ummm, perhaps you need to re-read my entry,  I never said that.&gt; I realize that there are billions upon billions of dollars wrapped up in these lies, and those people and organizations will go to great lengths to make sure that this outdated knowledge is kept in place.

I am sure this is part of it. In addition, my experience with big companies has taught me that it is an *enormous* amount of work to get people to change. Left to themselves, most people will keep doing the same things. 

The nutrition professors have a text book that they know. They have class notes that they are comfortable with. They have quizzes and tests already prepared. To do something **new** would be hard work! Plus, most teachers are not researchers in the field. They are likely to wait until "the authorities" recommend change, and we know how well that's going.

So even without oodles of money in lobbying, I wouldn't expect fast change.Eat. Eat before you make bad decisions.Cheers to that! And I know she understands at least to some extent. She has pretty bad scoliosis, and one of her shoulders is significantly larger than the other as a result. She's mentioned to me before that she's super conscious of it... although I never noticed until she drew my attention to it. It would be super rude of me to be like "HEY! Your shoulder looks pretty straight today! Did you do something different!??" and while that's kind of an extreme example it's the same kind of idea. Wow that's crazy!! I don't think I've ever been so close to someone that they would be offended if I made a decision like that without them. It's good that she was able to have that discussion with you, and tell you what upset her and why. 

I also think that my sup is trying to be positive, in her own way... I don't know whether it's that she's treating me the way she would want to be treated (she does like attention....) or if she simply has never had someone in her life lose a noticeable amount of weight. I try not to let it get under my skin in a serious way, but I just don't know how to handle her. 

You make a great point though - if she feels like she might be triggering me by bringing up my weight all day every day perhaps she'll slow her roll some, lol. Thank you!About the fat/calories part, you're saying that the calories listed on nutritional facts aren't final yet? That we still have to equate protein and fat to get the final calorie value?Sadly I do not. I really should get one. I've been loving all the things I can do with spaghetti squash.I totally see that. A lot of people are used to seeing me bigger so I often get the comment, "I can't imagine you losing any more!" and really the only thing to say to that is either, "I'm only half way there!" which may concern people, or "don't worry, I'm being healthy." 

I have rehearsed my lines many times ;)Oooh, Makes sense.I generally don't have a problem being complemented. I am proud of what little I've accomplished (20 pounds on a tiny frame does make a difference) and I'm proud that people are starting to see. But she knows she's already brought it up... today, yesterday... 45 minutes ago. It's not THAT striking of a difference yet that it should be the only thing she can think about when she's talking to me. I am not my weight.I almost never fit female stereotypes, I just like fresh raw stuff, well my darlings are vegetables, I really, really love them. My boyfriend is the real fruit lover :) He keeps a lot of apples in the house all the time and it's winter (I miss some vegetables) and they are lovely... But I don't touch them because of this tiny reason, my dedication is harder. Okay, I touched them today but I barely have vegetables at the moment and I ate 10g apple, it's way harder than not eating any though...

Sometimes I wonder about fruit. My body shouldn't need it. But sometimes (not today) it just wants it. It's not like just a craving for sweets (I love cocoa, I eat it a lot but I'm pretty sure I could live without it), it's something basic. It's like real, strong thirst. it's like hunger when I haven't eaten in the last 4,5 dats. I need it. I must have it. Probably because I never was on keto for long enough to fully adapt. I feel I don't need the sugar in it, I even feel it's too much sugar for my body when I eat half an apple. I need freshness, juicyness... It's one reason I try to eat enough raw vegetables in its juicy form, not dehydrated.She does get right up in my face with it, too. I usually just make some excuse to leave the pod, but eventually I will always have to come back. I can only be gone for so long, haha. I'll try to just brush it off without trying to respond and see how that goes!For some complements it seems awkward to agree. "You are the nicest person!" Don't answer: "Yes, I think so too."

But for complements about more objective topics, like losing weight, it sometimes feels less weird to just agree rather than accept the complement. "You have really lost a lot of weight!" Some how if I say, "Yes, I'm happy with my progress," it seems to take the conversation to a different place. Like the two of us together are noticing this thing that happened, rather than they are pointing me out.

I don't know if this is just a quirk in my own psychology or what.I think I was afraid of fat when I first started.  I mean, its really calorie dense.  It took me a couple of tries getting back on the wagon to finally say fuck it.  So my advice is, "don't be afraid of fat".  Don't go nuts on it either, because it IS calorie dense, but don't be afraid of it either.  It really does help with satisfaction.I totally understand, I wanted to try the IF to jump start my progress and see how it goes. 

I started on Sunday and to be honest, after eating these kinds of foods, I've found that when I do get hungry, I look at the clock and cant believe how long its been since I ate last.
Which is a huge difference from last week when I ate because "I woke up" or Its 12:00 time for lunch" and if I missed those meals I would definitely feel it.

I'm loving this diet and I really feel like it could be a lifestyle change that I can stick too.Well it was just an example I guess, but there's no way that eating 35 eggs and 5 pounds of bacon a week could be good for you, even if it might help me lose weight how could my heart handle that?

Because yeah, ideally to start off I would just be very boring and eat the same thing over and over again that I knew put me within my limits.  But I can't eat bacon and eggs 3 meals a day and expect it to be healthy, I gotta try and balance portions with content or I'm just going to end up going from one extreme to the other I bet.Ugh, she sounds awful. Ignoring you after you called attention to her passive aggressive-sounding comments? I've had supervisors like this and I consider them to be immature and manipulative. Do your thing and pay no attention to her. Sorry, this was purely hypothetical. I love vegetables, but I'm worried about eating too many.As a child I thought all cocoa powder was sweetened cocoa powder, and got a terrible surprise when I mixed some unsweetened powder into a glass of milk. But now my own kids are eating very dark chocolate with me, and although they obviously enjoy regular milk chocolate, and sometimes will comment about "that really bitter stuff", they still always want a taste of it.
I would go with 45% as just a ballpark estimate Yep. I've been lifting for 5 months now. And thanks for the kind words.No problem.  Take what I say with a grain of salt, I'm no expert :)

Honestly after not quite intentionally doing the IF thing for a few months, it's pretty hard to break 1700ish calories a day without doing something like drinking an entire pint of heavy cream or loading up on delicious, evil potatoes.I'm 6'5 the road been a little bumpy. But I learned don't let a a bad day turn into a bad weekMy favorite site for product recommentations is [wirecutter.com](http://thewirecutter.com/).

[Here](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-bathroom-scales/) is what they say. I bought one and am quite satisfied.No, but you also don't necessarily need fiber supplements. Thanks. Please include the brands too since then people can go for your exact recipe if they can find the brands.I was eating lunch today when one of my coworkers said "you've lost some weight". I said yes, I have. I sat down to eat. I had a salad from home (spinach, some ground beef, spouts, cheese and a dressing) along with a bowl of steamed spinach (from the cafeteria). One of our coworkers asked me what I was doing, I said "no longer eating stuff that isn't good for me". She dug in more, then said "oh, Atkins". I said yeah, sorta, just modified.  

People get atkins, not too many get keto. My doc does, the docs I work with do, as does a nutritionist that I know.It is possible to follow a ketogenic diet without eating vegetables. As you stated, the main things you'd miss out on are dietary fiber and micronutrients including vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals.

If your main reason to avoid vegetables is that you don't like the taste and texture, you can work around that problem by blending them into a puree / paste and including it in a protein shake. Use cocoa powder and cinnamon to make it taste okay. To do this, you'll need a powerful blender such as a Vitamix or Blendtec. Your typical home blender doesn't make a very uniform and fine puree of vegetables.

This seems consistent with the point that Gary Taubes likes to make. The 3500 cal/lb theory may be correct in the level of physics, but it isn't very useful for understanding what is actually going on in the biochemistry of living people.

What if you trim 500 calories from your diet, but your body responds by metabolically slowing down 700 calories worth? What if different macros make it more or less likely for your body to do this? What if your eating *history* makes it more or less likely for your body to do this?

My sense is that science is still at early baby steps for these kinds of questions.Thanks Oranges13, Noted about the carbs! Thats a great thing Follow the FAQ electrolyte guidelines. Water without salt doesn't work. Eat the meatIF is also a really great way to prepare for keto.I feel like not everyone will have an EXACT same breakdown of carbs per ingredient as I had because some brands have a lower or higher amount of carbs depending on what brands are available to you. As soon as I get the chance, I'll provide you with a breakdown of my own!

And I completely agree with you. I tried going for more coconut flour and less almond but the result was awful and pretty much inedible. I wish I had taken a picture. The consistency was terrible, flavor wasn't so bad. But I'd rather have no cake than eat what I made that day LOL. It came to a point where I'd rather take the plunge and ration my carbs just to have this cupcake, in all honesty. Ok. When you broke it down like that, it totally makes sense now. 

Thanks for help!
I am in respiratory therapy school and on clinic days when i am running all over the hospital and not sitting down for hours and hours, my weight is very apparent to me when every part of me, especially my feet, hurt like hell. When a code blue or a rapid response is called and I have to sprint to the other side of the hospital up 3 flights of stairs, I can physically feel my weight pulling me backward. Knowing this will be my career and that I need to be physically fit to do it it a major motivation. That being said, I am 40 lbs down and can totally tell the different when I'm climbing stairs.

There's also the fact that I have PCOS and my dad has diabetes.

I am only 24 and have been huge my whole life, and I want to look good and be able to do all the things a 24 year old should be able to do.

Shouldn't be hard. Eat a big salad and a bunch of steak. Yeah, IF is intermittent fasting.  I don't know how others do it, but I usually sleep during a large portion of those hours.  Four hours before sleep, eight hours asleep, and then four hours after sleep is sixteen hours without calories coming in.  You just have to get used to doing that, I guess.  I don't usually get hungry for hours after I wake up unless someone shoves food in my face.

1500-1700's pretty easy once you get used to eating only a little every day.  Low carb/keto helps with that, because most of the calories you'll be getting are high in protein and fat, which means they fill you up faster and keep you feeling full longer.

Not sure about the other stuff, I'm still a newbie myself :)OK, I see how that appears very contradictory. I obviously didn't word that correctly. Apologies!


What I meant was, I really do not enjoy your typical *^green ^salad* types such as : tomato, cucumber, radishes, spring onion etc.

I do however enjoy cooked veggies like the cauli, broccoli, spinach, asparagus, that sort of thing (which from the sounds of it, actually has a good amount of carbs :(


From tomorrow I will try cutting some of the veg out, and alot of the dairy. Again, I thought I was already over doing it from the meat side of things, but after what every1 is saying I will increase the protein intake.


Thanks guys!Drink some broth made from bouillon or homemade soup. Use more salt. Take magnesium and potassium supplements. The Keto FAQ says how much. If that doesn't help, try eating a bit more protein and fat.

Other things that can help include a tablespoon of coconut oil or MCT oil in your coffee, tea, or soup.What is the net carb breakdown by ingredient? I may have some ideas after seeing that.

One thing to try is using a little more coconut flour so that you can use less almond flour. It seems that coconut flour absorbs more liquid per unit measure than almond flour does. For example, doubling the coconut flour amount may allow you to cut the almond flour in half (just making examples up since I don't know for sure how extreme the effect would be)."[G]eneric equivalent of centrum silver"  --  be aware that store brands of herbal supplements are being investigated by the FDA for failure to meet their label specifications.  Quality control for generics, particularly those made outside the US is iffy.  And, there is no way for you to tell if you are getting the vitamins you pay for.It depends on how quickly you want to lose weight.  I keep carbs under 15 g a day, sometimes just under 10. Yes, it could be due to electrolyte imbalance. Are you supplementing with potassium, magnesium, and eating enough salt? See the Keto FAQ for details on amounts.

It may help to increase your protein slightly.

Also, it can help to eat a tablespoon of coconut oil or MCT oil when just prior to when you normally get these headaches. That will provide your brain with some more energy.Increase salt and water intake.Avocado, spinach, mushroom, fish, yogurt; lite salt or no saltDo you have a history of high blood pressure?  Did you have caffeine beforehand? Did you sit down and rest beforehand? Are you following the electrolyte guidelines in the FAQ? What are your meals like? 

What is your protein macro goal?

Meat - fish, chicken, turkey, beef, pork; fish - canned, freshPlease do! It's so worth it. And if you end up making substitutions, share it with me. I'm always looking for ways to improve. :DThey are counterproductive long term. For now I would not eat any higher than 40% deficit and ideally not 30% deficit.  

The estimated maximum deficit is 31 kcal/lb body fat but I certainly wouldn't push that limit. thatd be a really interesting blog post to read about the comparisons of making your own seed milks5 net split across all of those cupcakes isn't much.

I love carrot cake! I will try this for my birthday which is coming up later this month.I love IF :) Glad it's working out for you&gt; Don't rely on the stats in My Fitness Pal. They aren't accurate about half the time.

Eh.  I mean, you gotta track, so you track using the tools available.  
The accuracy of any individual item in the MFP is less important than the practice of consistent tracking over time.Unfortunately, I tried using light olive oil and sunflour oil in two separate tests, it doesn't give the moisture, true cake texture, and flavor. With the brand I use, half a cup of organic apple sauce adds 5g net carbs to the recipe. I tried doing my best to cut out and substitute ingredients to make this as low carb as possible while trying to do minimal damage to taste and texture. Unfortunately, apple sauce was not one of these things. :( Thank you for the suggestion, I appreciate it greatly! I'm absolutely willing to tweak this recipe further in the future with your suggestions! I just take a daily multivitamin to ensure that I am covering my bases.Do you lift? I looked wayyyy fatter at 195 than you do and we have similar body and age stats. Congrats man, looking good. and frankly, eating 1500 calories in a sitting is way fun =)&gt; my body was not used to the increased amounts of fats i was eating

Had a coworker spike my crock pot with castor oil ... now *that* was an unexpected increased amount of fat! :-ODon't wear your seatbelt, it's like planning for an accident!Have you had a look in the stickied post?Especially with pork rinds.  Those fuckers add up quick :-/I'd call your Doctor.  As I recall, my wife needed a stool softener along with her prenatal vitamins.  Given your diet and other answers, this might be necessary.The metaphor I like is, "If you dropped your phone on the ground, you wouldn't then jump on top of it, would you?"Now, it's white :D Maybe a wee bit gray but basically white. Surprising, I know.
I've read you can make milk from every oily seeds. I tried some. I couldn't drink sesame milk, it was horribly bitter. I love walnuts but walnut milk was strange for me, I just add a bit into my coconut milk.The 10 lbs you lost in the last 4 days is likely mostly water weight and won't affect your body fat percentage. Right, but because it only measures *excess* ketones in the urine and *none* of the ketones in the blood, a newbie could be in ketosis but still show blank on the 'stix, which could make them discouraged.I would probably cut the skin off- it goes a bit rubbery.I think the term "strict" and the implications of a lack there of are probably what set the person off. Keto and Paleo aren't strict vs less strict. Paleo has rules... Keto does not have rules per se. Keto is short for Ketosis, which is a state your body can achieve/exist in. Paleo is not a state of your body. Going forward, I wouldn't refer to one or other as more or less strict. Paleo does allow for more carbs, but doesn't allow a lot of artificial stuff people on Keto eat. It's just perspective as to "strictness" and I'm sure that felt like an insult to the crazier of the two people. Suck it up, write it down, every bite.

I already knew that writing down my intake worked automatically in the past, I just did not want to do it.  I was on this upward trend that I couldn't shake, and then found out I needed (as in, prescribed) 6 grams of fat/day for brain function.  That made the upward trend worse.  I stated messing with keto recipes, and tried "lazy keto" which worked to put me in maintenance, not loss, mode.  When I gave in and started writing down my macros, the weight loss started.

Simple.  Annoying.  Works.To piggy back on this comment. Do not fall into the trap of "in for a penny in for a pound."


Oops... you accidentally had regular soda instead of diet. Or - Damn I slipped and had some wheat toast or a whole wheat bagel because I was weak. I guess my day is ruined, might as well goto hell with myself, right?

WRONG.


Don't indulge because you caught yourself cheating once. Don't throw out the rest of that day or weekend or whatever because of it.

Treat it as a non-issue and just keep calm and keto on.yah. every time i get drunk i end up ordering a pizza. fortunately i'm not an alcoholic and eating a whole pizza just sets me on cyclical keto for a couple of days.Weird. Paleo people are generally pretty easy-going about it. It sounds like at least one of these two was trying to be some sort of martyr to their diet. The odd thing is that most paleo dieters eat pretty low carbs of they're trying to lose weight, and are pretty open to the whole ketosis thing.It's true. You'll be amazed at what size a portion actually is. It varies quite a bit for women. You can check out /r/xxketo if you want more info on it. 

My personal experience is that my PMS is a bit easier to handle, my cravings for iron are higher (or I'm more in tune with them perhaps), cramps and bleeding seem the same, I'm hungrier just before I bleed and I have more cravings then too, and my cycle has lengthened a little (from 25 to 27 days), which I am really happy with.

Nice, man. Keep it up. I did my first attempt close to your age and the little stalls messed me up a bit. Keep up the hard work, it will be worth it.Don't rely on the stats in My Fitness Pal. They aren't accurate about half the time.

If you cheat, you're going to feel like shit. It's actually a good deterrent not to. 

It's going to feel weird eating things like bacon, butter, mayo and cheese if you were brought up that low-fat is the way to diet. It's a little hard to believe you can eat those things and lose weight. It's not just that though - eating those fats is what helps you to succeed on this diet. Track your calories so you don't go over, but plan to utilize the fat. It really makes you feel satiated and it's what has enabled me so much success with keto over low-fat dieting.

I like to skip breakfast and use my calories for lunch and dinner. I'm generally not hungry in the morning - but once I eat something, I find I'm hungry regularly after that. So, it's best if I just wait and have an early, larger lunch. 

Embrace low-carb veggies. You can steam them and then saute them in a hot pan with some good butter so they brown up a little. (add kosher salt and pepper). So good. Yeah the content of the post says "[removed]" for me, as well. No picture links.I don't know, I think a few (maximum 5) weeks? You are right, it's not much time but it had some effect on my hunger and calorie intake already, I think I subconsciously thought it can't get any more better for me, I extrapolated using my expriences too... Oh. Maybe it's... possible? I can't want to figure it out! :) I feel silly now. I  restarted keto and I try to stick to it this time.
I definitely entered ketosis, there were pretty obvious signs, so many things happened, mostly good ones. In the first week I ate my usual amount of calories. I got used to keto, it got easier and a few weeks later my calorie intake dropped a few hundred calories, it was amazing. (When I fell off the wagon, my hunger stayed the same for months and I continued my slow weight loss.)
But even if less calorie is enough, I still had to focus to make sure I don't consume more, it's very easy to eat a few more fat bombs or drink 1-2 more coffee with butter (I actually banned them at some point)... I'm not used to weight-loss diets, I like freedom. I need a method that automatically makes calorie deficit possible. Keto is the biggest part of it but I need more.
(Being 145lbs and sedentary definitely doesn't help. It was easy when I was bigger, 80g carbs did the trick. I lost about 40 pounds but my body wanted its usual calorie intake, if I just ate as little I could, it was 2000 kcal. When I wasn't that strict, it was a bit higher. High-carb would be worse. This behaviour of my body has benefits, gaining weight is pretty hard for me and I can't get over 180 pounds without force feeding myself. But I want and definitely need to be thinner.)You should make the peanut butter pancake recipe on ruled.me! I make half a serving nearly every morning for breakfast. 

http://www.ruled.me/peanut-butter-pancakes/  

They use a home made low carb syrup, but I can't find some of hte ingredients, so I use a couple tbsp of reddi whip instead. 2 tbsp has like 1 carb, so even if I use like 4 tbsp, it's only like 2 carbs.

I've also used stevia and cinnamon as a no carb topper and turned it into a cinnamon type of uh.. thing.

Sometimes I'll add an extra tbsp of almond flour in as well. Almond flour is way more expensive for me though so I use it more sparingly. 

I noticed the batter can be runny sometimes as well. So it's good to have xanthan gum on hand.

As a 6'1" guy, I can't wait to get down to 255! I got down to 270ish before and I felt amazing.
