Am going to try this tonightThank you.Lentils over rice? two things I don't believe shouldn't go together.The sidebar is funny and so are some top posts. However, it went from being absurdly frugal to unrealistic . Frugal means getting more for your money.  When they take a picture of dog feces and title it "dinner," that's not being frugal. You would never eat dog feces and if you did, you'd likely spend more money on medical bills. It also gets old when every comment section reduces down to calling someone a "fatcat" or debating over who spent less caloriesvery nice. I can see lots of variations on this too, such as goat cheese instead of feta. Also, if someone isn't to keen on the lemon juice, they could use a bit of chicken broth to prevent the potato from being too dry. It's vegetarian, and not kidney beans.  There isn't an unsafe temp at which to eat it as long as you store it in an airtight container.I react strongly to sugar, so YMMV. I feel just as sick after eating delicious baked beans, as I do after eating a candy bar. Sometimes if the rest of my meal is slathered in butter I'm okay, because fat has effect on how the sugar is absorbed by the body. But protein and carbs don't help me out personally. But to each their own. I wish I could eat baked beans every single day though... one of my favorite foods actually!If you love chickpeas, you might like this recipe: http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/linguini-zucchini-chickpeas-recipe  I've made it a few times, once I added mushrooms and it was great too. That's the first time I'd used chickpeas as anything but hummus. Now I eat them as a salad topping too. I'm not in the US, ymmv.Number 4! Sorry, where I come from it's a toastie maker![1. Toaster over?](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71mdsLdw2-L._SL1500_.jpg)

[4. Sandwich toaster?](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71aoxQGalzL._SL1500_.jpg)Sweating involves adding salt early.  The salt brings moisture out of the onions.Yeah, it's all about setting up taste expectations for me.  People kept telling me to try spaghetti squash with pasta sauce because spaghetti squash "tastes just like spaghetti!"  Well, no, it doesn't, not even close.  If people had said, "Try spaghetti squash with pasta sauce, it's delicious!" then I wouldn't have been unhappy with the result because I would have expected a squash flavor.Anecdotally (and subjectively), it does wonders for me. I find that when I drink around 3L (or more), I feel better and more awake, am better able to focus, and snack less. And of course, water is free and won't hurt your teeth. You might feel a bit ridiculous with how often you run to the bathroom, though.that is correct. It's more of a mock tuna/ egg salad though if you add mayo there is technically eggs in it(from the mayo).True that. I feel the same way when people say mashed cauliflower is just like mashed potatoes. If you eat mashed cauliflower expecting it to taste like mashed potatoes, you're going to be disappointed. But if you eat it thinking they're buttery garlic mashed cauliflower you may be pleasantly surprised. It's similar texture and color but the taste is very different. This question comes up quite a bit:

Once this is added in the comments, send the mods a PM. Thanks!That looks like it would be great with tortilla chips on the side - for scoopin'. 

Thanks for sharing!It is Chachies brand.Anyone have an ideas as to how to make this a crockpot recipe?Do you guys have macros for this recipe? It would be very helpful. Thinking some greek yogurt mixed in would be good too.How are the farts?Canned meats can be healthy, just read the ingredients and make sure there's nothing in there that you don't want. I eat a ton of sardines when I road trip. Hardboiled eggs hold up pretty well too, and of course, jerky is shelf stable. Now if you want to go really out there, you could look into making pemmican. It's one part tallow (rendered beef fat) and one part dried beef. You can mix it all up together and package it into bricks. It is shelf stable as long as it doesn't get exposed to excessive heat or light (cooler bag would be sufficient), and it's complete nutrition (all vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, etc...). You have to be very vigilant about drying the beef properly, and it is usually recommended that you use grass fed beef or wild game over grain fed animals (better levels of beta carotene, better ratios of omega 3/6 fatty acids), but I don't know if that actually matters if you are not going to be living off the stuff 24/7/365.If you've only ever used tuna from a can...try tuna from one of the little pouches. It's only like $1.55 around here, and you get one sandwich's worth out of it. They're usually flavored, and I layer some pickles on top and have it just as is. Super good!I have been sprouting lentils. Love having fresh sprouts in the middle of winter!Can't we just call it a mashed chickpea salad? Chickpeas don't taste anything like tuna or eggs, and mayo isn't that much of a miracle worker.My boyfriend would hate everything about this recipe except the spinach lol&gt; and more expensive too.

I find 10-12oz bags at Dollar Tree, doesn't seem unreasonable.Excellent post. I make a similar recipe, very frequently. The meat and vegetables can be varied a lot, this recipe is such a good way to go through some fresh vegetables before time to clean them out of the fridge. Last week's curry included carrots, celery, bell pepper, mushroom and spinach that were fresh, and diced tomatoes and bamboo shoots that were canned. So easy to whip this together. 

I also brown whatever meat just a small amount, remove from the pan, then add onions and curry paste, adding the meat back in once they have softened a bit, then continuing with the other ingredients afterward. A good curry has some varied mouthfeel on the vegetables, even some crunch. For those making this, be careful not to overcook, and to ensure you put soft vegetables in last.

Great post, /u/PabstyLoudmouth!I kind of like that idea, thank youIt is very bizarre. She says the smell lingers for days. I can't smell it but she can.Shallots no, fennel and celery are fine, never tried leeks on her. Thank you!beans and rice. I make a big pot of rice, then get a couple of cans of beans. It's boring on it's own, but it's easy to add all kinds of stuff to (like salsa, guacamole, or just about any sauce, really). If you want to be even cheaper cook the beans yourself. You can also live off of a combination of lentils, beans and potatoes, too, but I haven't tried that myself.Never met anyone who couldn't tolerate onions but still like garlic!I like putting a little lime juice, red pepper flake, pepper, and a touch of salt on baby carrots.You know you can Save things on Reddit too?I dont know how to edit but I should probably add that by toastie machine I mean sandwich toaster.Hit it with fire at the end. I reverse sear most of my meals that i put effort into and it works so much better. Less gray banding as well with the red meats. Greek yogurt with some chocolate whey powder in it is delicious and can have more than 30 grams of protein. Cottage cheese is also awesome, with yogurt or whey powder.

For snacks, I like Blue Diamond smokehouse almonds, roasted edamame, pumpkin seeds, mixed nuts, nut butters, and pickles.

For full meals I like spiced up lentils (eat in a bowl, use as filling, as a side-dish), vegetarian chili with black soybeans, and veggie burgers with hummus and feta in low-carb/whole wheat pita. Carb-balance Mission tortillas are amazing (and filling!) with nut butters, as wraps, or with burrito fillings. I have tempeh in my fridge waiting to be tried tomorrow, along with some extra firm tofu. Make sure to include a lot of eggs if you like em, and greek salad with some olive oil and feta is a very filling lunch that you can eat a lot of. Finally, don't be scared of all frozen foods. Soups, veggies, and [Amy's](http://www.amys.com/products) are all things I like to get from the frozen aisle.Shallots, fennel, leeks, or celery?Everyone's throwing in their suggestions but the only way I'd eat this is simmered with a tin of diced tomatoes. 

I'll give it a go! Sorry just to clarify, you dont actually add egg or tuna to this do you?Just thinking about the pastey texture of this dish is making me lose my appetiteSounds yummy, thanks!TaggingI love doing a "grown up" Lunchables.  Crackers, deli meat (usually chicken or turkey), cubed/sliced/string cheese, and some sort of fruit. I usually also have a yogurt, especially when they're on sale at 10 for $5.  You can easily portion them out into individual containers for the week, or keep the food in the company fridge and assemble it each day.  yea, to caramelize themI have gas, but I think it is unrelated! Fine otherwise, no symptoms at all from this.Bought a 20lb bag from Costco last year. It's since expired, but they're still good. Working through them, one miserable, healthy pot at a time. Never again man. Man cannot live on lentils alone!I disagree with you. I think that's the reason why a lot of people don't like lean meats like chicken breasts. I just want any readers to know that low and slow isn't gospel.Oh my goodness, all of my favourite foods combined. I must try this sometime. Wow this looks pretty good, I'm def gonna try it next time I grocery shop.This is easily the best tasting variety of Bush's.  Haha, I love that sub.I personally don't wash chicken breasts, as that is an easy way to spread bacteria and there is no reason to. I usually buy my chicken in bulk and freeze, so when I'm using them, I let it thaw a bit then cut while it's still semi-frozen.

But if you don't freeze yours, no worries, just a suggestion. Ha, aw man I need to drink more water. I'm always at about 2 bars below the red line. I barely drink any water, mostly soda, tea, some juice, and sometimes milk.http://www.wildrootsfoods.com/products/trail-mixes/coastal-berry-blend-trail-mix.html

My favorite snack. This meal is actually cheap and healthy.This looks great, going to try it but I'm adding bacon. You can make an egg salad/tuna taste by smashing chickpeas with mayo and make a sandwhich :)  it's a common "vegan tuna" recipe but it taste just like egg salad to me, it's so good. I add cut up pickles and tomatoes into it. My kid doesn't care much for sandwiches, so I often pack some small chunks of cheddar and/or a hard-boiled egg. Also included is a rice cake (kid loves them and used to use them instead of bread for peanut-butter and rice cake "sandwiches"), seasonal fruit, and granola bars or homemade oatmeal cookies. I sometimes include some cherry tomatoes or carrots, but those are hit or miss unless I pack guacamole for dipping. This might sound crazy, but what could I sub for the onion... Lots more garlic? My wife can not tolerate the smell of onions at all. It's weird as shit.Looks great, can't wait to try it!Apparently you're not familiar with the art of BBQ... anything.Thanks for this! I just made it tonight for dinner. Really simple and good. Cool, I didn't realize this was DIY either.  I might give it a try.
No need to use a microwave, thought it works.

If your water is evaporating add more and cook on a lower heat.Been a fan of mason jar meals. Easy to clean in the dishwasher and the right "lunch-size" container.

Salads, soups, pasta, and oatmeal for breakfast sometimes.

I've also been doing "pan" dishes lately. Shepards pie, lasagna. You just layer the ingredients in each jar, and bake in the oven for a little shorter than the normal 9x13 glass pan. Mason jars are strong enough for the oven.This recipe is amazing: [cumin wild rice &amp; quinoa](http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/2012/01/18/quinoa-black-rice-salad-with-cumin/).I am from New England, your approximation is about where my family's recipe is at. It doesn't taste all that sweet to me, but we're all tweaking on our syrup addictions so I guess that could be why. I have a kickass maple syrup beef marinade too.

And yes, pork definitely has to go in the baked beans.:)

haha it really isyes, it's a generalization. And there are exceptions. With vegetables though, generally it works. With meat, if you sear it it's a high heat, but then you can throw the meat in a slow cooker all day long and it'll be fine.Upvoting purely for the whack of common sense at the end rather than the prurient analogyAre you claiming that minute rice isn't easy?I think it would still taste good if you didn't use lentils and had it over rice instead :)No offense taken :) I've had a bag of lentils in my pantry for months and just started using them, they are actually pretty great, so I understand the hype

Edit: Also, thank you for introducing me to /r/frugal_jerk this shit is hilarious.Just commenting to bookmark. This looks amazing! If only my husband liked lentils. Oh well, lunch for me! it's a joke because they always talk about lentils is all. not hating on you or your recipe, it's a great idea, and i am probably going to try it.Is it still frugal jerking if I made it because I like how it tastes instead of because it's cheap?/r/frugal_jerk/Sure dude.  You gotta do you.Can it be the whole gram white I'm sure is really bad for me somehow but I prefer its taste?Check out the comment I posted. The stuffed potato itself is about 225 calories.Is it Kirkland?  I keep seeing the 2-pack of Kirkland salsa, but I haven't tried it yet.Is it really far to compare 24 grams of sugar, that comes with 28 grams of better carbs and 10 grams of protein with a candy bar. I'm also a IIFYM kind of guyI made a curry with lentils and tomato sauce the other day, I bet it would have been great with chickpeas. But I love chickpeas, I'd pretty much eat anything with them in it, haha.This is DIY. I got everything on amazon in 2 days. So this may not be the best way, but I have a really hard time getting them soft and this worked for me. Basically I combined my lentils with the appropriate amount of water (last time I made them I used 1 cup of lentils and 1.5 cups of water) stick them in a deep, microwave safe bowl, and microwave the shit out of them. My microwave is super small and shitty, so I microwaved them for 14 minutes twice, but I think for most people 14 minutes should be fine. This worked well for me because whenever I tried to cook them on the stove the water would evaporate quickly and the lentils would stick to the pan. There's probably an better way to do it though, haha.the mango peach salsa is delicious.  I am eating some right now.
Chickpea curry is seriously amazing. I would add a small can of tomato sauce, and serve over rice.Hmm, thanks for pointing that out. Cauliflower. There is a typo for the 1/4 cup; half is 2 TBS, not 2 tsp.Any ideas on a good broccoli substitute?

Try as I might, I just don't like broccoli.Whats the best way to cook lentils? Im going to trt this tonight.  Ive had cans of lentils for weeks but avoid cooking it because I never have and fear change.The reason I use frozen is that it lasts forever. I usually only go grocery shopping once a month, so I don't buy many things that won't store for a while. Plus I don't use it super often, I've had this bag since October I think. Helps keep down on food waste :)Here's another! I saved it a while ago and make it at least once a month. I usually use 4c chicken broth instead of water and bullion, and I throw it all in my rice cooker.

Edit: mobile link fail. Here you go 

https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2ggqpu/lentil_and_brown_rice_taco_filling_tasty_and_less/You definitely want to do this. I'd cook them for 10-20 minutes until they're getting really golden (not caramelizing though). You could even blend them at this step, but ideally they'd be soft enough you don't need to. Try it, trust me.

Also, I personally hate frozen Spinach, never as good as fresh.. and more expensive too.
It's like making love, really. Sometimes you need to start slow, ease into it, don't move around too much, just let the energy start to build, and then hit it on high; thrust in with a wild jerking motion a few times to toss everything around and before it knows what's happening you've managed to kill the heat.

And sometimes it's like cooking, where you do whatever makes the most sense for the food you're preparing.A little creamier, just a tad sweeter.  Cashews and garlic work great together, I could probably just blend those together and eat it on crackers.never mind, i didnt realize there was a DIY soylent movementIsn't the waiting list on your order like six months? I've been watching from Canada for a couple of years now.How did you like it?Almond butter is worth a try.  He tried sunflower seed but didn't like that either.  I'm hoping, like you, he grows out of this.  I keep working on him.I've found that ethnic grocery stores have the cheapest vegetables &amp; also carry a great variety of strange, wonderful produce. It's worth seeking one out!I used a recipe with roasted pine nuts instead of walnuts. And like all awesome recipes I lost it :( but I found it initially by searching on the internet, so it's out there somewhere.Pinterest is your friend. Thanks for the feedback! I agree that the cauliflower part is a hassle without a food processor. Chopping it without making a mess of the kitchen is an art form that I haven't gotten down quite yet. I'm glad you liked the marinade!"Low and slow is the way to go"
Becomes impossible to burn/overcook anything as long as you pay some attention.Fair enough. My first thought also; browning cubed tofu for a little more texture. Would make it even cheaper and vegan if you're into that sorta thing.I don't think I've ever tried cold pasta with pesto.  Gives me something new to try out.Sounds good! I'm trying to break myself of the habit of cooking everything on high heat right now, haha.Has he tried any other nut butters? There's almond butter and cashew butter. Maybe with crackers instead of on a sandwich. I was a picky kid and liked cucumber sandwiches, though that's still light on nutrients. Pesto pasta can be served cold. I got out of my picky phase when I realized that garlic made everything better (for me). I think the sweetness of the onions would enhance the dish. it sounds pretty savoury as is and a bit of sweet could balance that out nicely.I generally find it brings out more flavour as well as a nicer texture. It's a slow process of caramelization, but you can stop well short of the onions actually caramelizing (when they turn transluscent this is known as "sweating" the onion).Being hungry isn't a bad thing. It can be annoying but as a vegetarian you'll need to adjust your expectations of how food makes you feel. Good vs. full. Not really advice but something to keep in mind. The key will be to more often. Sit down and eat 200 calories is lettuce. You won't be able to. You'll get full before that. But because your body can digest it faster you'll get hungry faster. Nuts, roasted chick peas, dried fruit, granola, cut up veggies and fruit are all things you could snack on. Even a protein shake could help your hunger or a protein bar. You said you gave up bread and that's good. It's easy with a vegetarian diet to fall into a carb trap and miss out on the "veggie" part of vegetarianism. Could also try quinoa instead of rice. In the end the cure isn't really about eating more but just eating more often. The most hardcore vegetarian I know who is also a runner basically eats constantly. I'm not as active so I stick to a pretty set schedule of protein bar for breakfast, a Kind &amp; Strong bar at 11, lunch at 2 and then dinner around 5:30. So I'm basically eating every three hours. When it gets warmer and m more active I'll probably bump it to every two hours. Find what works and don't be afraid of having your tummy grumble. The sides all sound great.  No salad but I can squeeze in cucumbers and carrots.  ThanksI'd be willing to try that, but I'm curious what the reason for it isHam  &amp; soups are good ideas.  Will add that to the list.  

He hates both the peanut butter and the jelly.  It's just so strange to me to not like peanut butter!  I can't even imagine packing him a salad.  I would hear about that for the next 15 years. Hysterical.Also very high in iron which is really important for vegetarians and vegans.I don't think you want to really bring all the sweetness of the onions out on this dish, just relaese some of the flavour, which 5 mins is ideal for in my humble opinion anyway.I like it fried. Just dump the can out in a skillet and fry it in your oil or fat of choice. Salt and pepper to taste. Good for sandwiches or salads. If I may make a suggestion, try cooking your onions on a lower heat for longer.For someone not counting every micro nutrient, you can't beat the cost-to-nutrition of PB&amp;J (or fruit) sandwiches with whole grain bread. No specialty shops needed. There are no "empty" calories. Yes, there are some oils. Plant-based oils (unsaturated). Its an extremely efficient source of healthy (healthier, not healthiEST) calories for the price. Add some oatmeal and leafy greens, and whole day's needs are met (variety with the veggies and fruit is key, though). Cheap eating with no absolute need for cooking, unless you MUST have your oatmeal warm.[You until you get the hang of it]( http://i.imgur.com/4VECbpz.png)No problem! Even though I like spice, massaman is still my favorite. If you can get a big tub of the paste from an Asian market, it also makes a pretty cheap and filling meal. Protein, carrots, potatoes, onion, curry paste, coconut milk, roasted peanuts (optional), and serve over rice. Love! I make something very similar but use kale instead of spinach and top it with sliced almonds for a crunch! I've also made it with quinoa and cherry tomatoes as well.Check out mujadara as well, its fantastic and cheap!&gt; and calorie dense

That's what I'm talking about. Calorie dense and nutritious goes well with *cheap*, even though many seem to want to advertise that their recipes are so lacking in calories that they can only sustain you for one hour.http://www.copymethat.com/r/38H1GUm/ajandiacute_de_lentejas_bolivian_spicy_l/For hard boiling more than a few eggs at once you can stick them in the oven on 350F for 30 minutes. Then you just leave them in the fridge and grab them when you need. They should last a week or so :3Ah, lentils are amazing. If they're taunting, you spend a sunday afternoon making lentilburger patties and freeze 'em for single serving 'twixt sheets of wax paper. Yeah, you don't need more calories, just a greater mass of food that provides you with a decent balance of nutrients.(unless you were overeating, in which case it may be less)That does sound good, I'll definitely try it next time!I'd honestly avoid supplements. Better to try to eat a wide variety of things, paying casual attention to what nutrients they provide.*Dem ol' Beans-n-Rice.*

Fresh veggies and herbs... (ginger root is a fav of mine), remember that just because its vegetarian doesn't make something healthy.Go for vegetarian chili in a can. I eat that stuff all the time and it comes in a much bigger can, roughly the same price, and is way more filling.Haha, always nice to hear from someone with real experience.I can suggest adding a hit of chicken stock or veg stock at the end and simmering for a little bit. I like the change in texture and it serves well over a bit of rice!Well I don't know who taught you about loosing weight, but 1000 calories a day is unhealthy, most people are too heavy due to eating 2400 cal when they only use 2000 cal. Normal calorie intake for females are 1800cal and males 2400 cal, you seem to already be aware of this and as this is not a fitness sub so I'll move on.

**Loganbread**  
*item 1  kg coarse wholemeal  
*item 500 g wheat flour  
*item 500 g bulgur (soake in water for 30 min)  
*item 500 g of rye flour  
*item 2 spoonful of salt.  
*item 250 g of chopped almonds(or other nut) 
*item 250 g of raisins (or dried fruit, chopped in raisin size)  
*item 300 g of butter  
*item 300g of sirup  
*item 250g of sugar 
*item 1 Liter of whole milch  

Mix the dry ingredients. Heat the butter, syrup, sugar and milch in a pan, until  the butter and sugar is melted and hand warm approx 40 degrees C then mix the dry ingredients into the liquid mix. Put it in a baking pan the dough should have a height of about an inch more will increase the baking time, but give you a softer bread(actually slightly less hard), I will not recommend a thinner bread than an inch. Bake the bread at 180 degree celsius for 90 min. Take the bread out and slice it into 20-30 parts while it is warm as it is almost impossible to cut it when it has cooled down.

A little info: if you cut the bread into 20 parts each will have 750 calories for 30 it is 500 calories, you may want to cut the bread to more pieces than 30.

A little info 2: The bread is very hard, and kept in containers at room temperature they will keep for 2 weeks. 

When I am on camping or out in the wilderness I have to carry everything including food which can be heavy, therefore loganbread is a big part of my meals in the wild.

edit gramma.Just made this yesterday.  It's basically a nice stew.

* 2-3 lbs of cubed chicken (I used skinless, boneless thighs; you could also use beef or pork)
* Half an onion, sliced
* Three new potatoes, cubed
* 1 cup of baby carrots, halved
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup
* 1/2 cup chicken stock (could also use other stocks, broth, or just water)

Throw it all in a crock pot and cook on low for 8 - 9 hours.  Definitely play around with seasoning -- the recipe as I wrote it is very bland.  Try minced garlic/garlic powder, good old salt and pepper, chili powder.  You can also play around with the veggies.  Adding some peas, corn, or peppers could be good!  It would also work over rice.  This amount lasts me a week eating it for dinner every night.I eat a lot of burritos. Beans, various veggies, cheese, rice, tortilla. 

Some stir fries, rice or noodles, fried veggies and tofu, mixed with a sauce that is half stir fry sauce, and half peanut butter (yes). 

Vegetarian chili mixed with noodles.

Lately (because I'm poor) I've been making rice and bean dishes. Which is more like, rice, beans, diced tomatoes, chick peas, spinach, spices, hot sauce.

Hard boiled eggs are a great snack. So are avocados with salt. Baked potatoes. A good though debatably healthy snack I make is peanut butter, sliced or mashed bananas, granola and honey wrapped in a small taco tortilla, and it's pretty filling for a post-work out bite.Meatballs (whatever you prefer - pork, chicken, beef, etc) cooked in a couple of cans of diced tomatoes, crushed garlic, Italian herbs, diced capsicum, carrots, celery, onions thrown in a pot together. 

Then throughout the week you can take portions and change it up easily for variety. Chuck in onto pasta. Put into a sub roll for a sub sandwich with some cheese and grill. Add a bit of Mexican seasoning and some canned beans and eat with rice/in a burrito/with corn chips. Use it as a topping over baked potato. 

You can obviously skip the meatball part and throw in strips/diced pieces of other meat. Meatballs are just nice sometimes because they're fatty and hold a lot of flavour. Vegan friendly too!
Wow a post thats actually cheap and healthy. Thanks for posting!A non-vegetarian version would have a good hunk of salt pork floating around too. You'd render the fat out of the salt pork while baking in the liquid, and it just all goes into the sauce.The only known benefit is that drinking water prevents dehydration (no shit, right?).  Whether drinking additional quantities of water improves your health over those that are simply hydrated, there exists no scientific data to conclude one way or the other.  The only known benefit is that drinking water prevents dehydration (no shit, right?).  Whether drinking additional quantities of water improves your health over those that are simply hydrated, there exists no scientific data to conclude one way or the other.  Will definitely give the massaman curry a try. Thanks!Calorie in, calorie out. And all that shit..Too easy!  Thanks!I like using ghee. It's got a surprisingly high smoke point, and it makes things oh, so decadent.All that means is that since it isn't so precise, you have a lot of freedom and leeway to create your own special house dressing, and if you accidentally use too much acid or too much oil, it's not a dealbreaker for the dressing.1 day later


OP PLSIf it does, I havent gotten sick. Ive been pretty lax in terms of 'leftovers', and while my evidence is only anecdotal - It is the truth as it applies to me!thank you so much, i needed a lentil recipe badly.  have a huge container of lentils,they're just sitting in my pantry taunting me.Holy crap. I should not have clicked on this while I'm doing IF. That'd really depend on which curry you use. Curry can be non-spicy as well, depending on how much and which kind you use :)
Got the idea from [this recipe](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/sweet-potatoes-stuffed-with-broccoli-feta) and made a few adjustments. It takes about 15 minutes including prep time (chopping, etc).

Ingredients:

* 1 sweet potato
* 1/3 cup broccoli florets, chopped up nice and tiny
* 1/4 cup kale, chopped with stems removed
* 2 Tbsp feta cheese, crumbled
* 1 Tbsp red onion, diced
* 1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
* Lemon juice

Directions:

1. Wash your sweet potato or yam or whatever and puncture the skin several times with a fork. Place it in the microwave on high for 8 minutes, turning over halfway through.

2. While the sweet potato is in the microwave, heat the olive oil in a small skillet at medium-high heat. Add the red onion and Italian seasoning and let it cook for a minute or two before adding the broccoli and kale.

3. Once the sweet potato is done in the microwave, cut it open lengthwise and perturb the inside with your fork, creating little pockets on each side. Sprinkle lemon juice inside and then press the crumbled feta cheese into the pockets.

4. Stuff your broccoli and kale mixture into the sweet potato. Inhale.

The lemon juice can be substituted with butter, I suppose, since I just added it to prevent the sweet potato from getting too dry, but that would make the recipe less healthy. The important thing to remember is to chop your broccoli florets small enough that you can fit it all into the potato. I added some grilled zucchini and yellow bell pepper on the side since those were about to go in my fridge.

If you use light feta cheese, like I did, the [nutritional stats](http://www.caloriecount.com/cc/recipe_analysis.php) come out to:

Nutrition Grade AIf the potatoes helped you and you enjoy them, then keep eating them. They're relatively calorie dense in the veggie world, so they're nice and filling. If bread doesn't work for you, then just continue to avoid it. 

Sounds like maybe you're getting enough calories but just not feeling full? I would just recommend upping your vegetable intake. Try eating a whole pound of non-starchy vegetables every day. It's a lot of green things, which will give your body tons of micronutrient goodness. Because a pound of veggies is a large volume without a lot of calories, you'll get to feel super full without feeling stuffed or weighed down.A similar recipe to this is one of my staples. It's great to top with bean sprouts and cilantro.Wow, that's insane. Even for a dessert that would be sweet. 

There's not much fat in that recipe, is there? So, if I need to eat more calories, how do I avoid getting fat? I stopped eating bread awhile back for instance, because I had gained some pounds, and I found that meat and potatoes helped a lot with losing those pounds. 
Is there any vegetarian equivalent? I think one of the keys to vegetarian eating is to eat a lot! Transitioning away from meat, you're going to be accustomed to fairly small portion sizes. I mean, a single portion of meat is only a couple is ounces. Vegetables, however, are far less calorie dense. I can easily sit down and eat a pound of salad for lunch with a potato on the side. So don't be afraid of larger serving sizes than you're used to. Keep eating until you really feel full!

Don't focus too much on the protein. Everything contains protein (to varying degrees, of course), so you should be getting plenty of protein as long as you're getting plenty of calories. If you're still concerned about meeting specific nutrient targets, though, I would recommend plugging your daily diet into something like Cronometer. 

Best of luck with your new veggie life!Put it on a piece of buttered toast and you're in heaven.I was always voluntarily the salad kid, and I loved it. For some unknown reason, I get tired of sandwiches very quickly but was able to bring salads to lunch for years without tiring of it. My mom would pack me a small salad with the dressing in a separate container, yogurt, pudding, apples, bananas, or strawberries with an ice pack. And Hot Tamales. Those were key. Are we talking vegetarian or vegan here? Eggs are vegetarian - if you're concerned about the welfare of the chickens, buy them locally from a farmer's market. Milk products like cottage cheese and greek yogurt are also good sources of protein.

As for vegetables only... there's mushrooms, textured vegetable protein (soybean 'ground meat' which can be bought dried and rehydrated), firm tofu, seitan (wheat gluten, sometimes sold canned as mock duck or mock abalone) and products like 'Beyond Meat' that're made from wheat and pea protein isolate. Peanut butter, sunflower seeds, pretty much any kind of nut or seed, as well as whole grains like brown rice and whole wheat contain amino acids, which are the building blocks of a complete protein. It's not necessary to combine these in the same meal - just having a varied diet helps.

If you're going to be vegetarian, though, you should research your choice thoroughly so you don't end up deficient in any vitamins and minerals as well as proteins. Many vegans are deficient in Vitamin B12, and [common supplements like Spirulina and Chlorella actually contain a 'pseudo-B12' compound that can't be used by the human body, but can cause a false positive for 'normal' B12 levels](http://www.veganhealthandfitness.com/blog/2011/07/b12-for-vegans/).

 Please read the sidebar before commenting again.I desperately need to go grocery shopping, but I think have all of this at home already. Mmm, you just planned my dinner for me tonight. Thanks for posting!I get the thin sliced chicken breasts at the store. Marinade them in Italian dressing and cook em up on the stove, great for sandwiches. Different curries have different degrees of spice. A red curry like this usually does have a kick. You could try a massaman curry instead, which isn't spicy at all, or a yellow curry which is generally listed as mild. yumyeah, bunch of sugar, and expensive. Although, I am a sucker for peach iced tea and you don't get that awesome fake peach flavor from doing it at homeI went through this period where I was obsessed with drinking water. Especially iced because it tasted crisp, clean and pure. 

I ended up drinking 72oz in the period of three hours. I felt extremely thirsty, and the guy I was working with started freaking out on my third 24oz round, telling me while water is GOOD, and GOOD for you, anything in excess is bad. I had no clue what he was talking about. I was just drinking because it tasted good and filled me up.

It ended up being too much water, too fast and I got a severe headache, and ended up puking pure water from my body. 

Now I have to consciously remind myself to take it easy  

But yeah. Point is. Water IS good for you. Just don't be a moron like me. limit your intake. Looks good, although I'd rather have bamboo and longbeans or other more asian veggies. I guess I'll be makong this tomorrow, cause it looks too good!Might as well change it to black beans and hot sauce or lime juice. Baked beans aren't as healthy or as cheap as just plain canned beans. Not a typo. That is my approximation of a friend's New England family recipe for baked beans. I think some pork goes in there too.

It's disgustingly sweet. Then again this guy eats maple syrup on everything. Actually, there might be some maple syrup in the recipe too...

My point was, making a 1:1 comparison, canned is not cheaper. 

Then again, theres a reason it tastes so good: sugar, salt, fat!I was mainly thinking about the iced tea that you get at the store, which people often think off as healthy, but in reality they got tons of sugar. I've made a similar dish with chick peas.I've never had curry but i've heard it's spicy and that bothers my acid reflux. How is this in terms of spice? It looks delicious and makes me want to try it.Yeah, i really agree on the fact that you don't get cravings for snacks! And when you say it, i think i can remember having drier eyes before, considering i also use contact lenses, but have never thought about the fact.Tofu and shiitake mushroom strips are excellent in curry.If you have recurrent kidney stones you are doing the right thing, hydration helps push those little punctuate stones out before they form into large painful ones. Also, depending on the type of stone you have and the frequency you get stones, diet changes can affect kidney stones. Spinach is thought to influence the growth of some stones so if you get stones often you may want to think about cutting that out of your diet. Biased tea drinker here. iced tea isn't really that bad for you. Unless you make it southern style with a kilo of sugar. There is some caffeine in brewed tea, which does act as a diuretic, but then you do get some benefits that it is tea and has some nice properties to it (antioxidants and whatnot). Personally I think its a wash, you shouldn't depend on tea as your sole source of fluid but then again, you shouldn't be doing that with any flavored beverage  then again, you shouldn't be doing that with any flavored beverage. ) but in moderation its fine 

FWIW I can brew my own tea for under $0.10 a liter, add some lemon to it and it might be around $0.20, not bad at all if you ask me. Certainly better than paying minimum $0.50 a liter for soda. Sure, *right* after. But within seconds of being exposed to air it is totally touchable. Now... It *is* hot, I'm not putting my face on it, but anyone that has worked grill on a busy night knows you are finger fucking that meat all night long to test for doneness. It's not so hot you can't touch it.tofu would be good with currySometimes ill go meatless and do beets, vegetables and hummus in a wrap with some greens and maybe feta or goat cheese.There are other meats to put on sandwiches besides turkey.  Ham is always a good option.

For peanut butter/jelly, is it the peanut butter or the jelly he doesn't like?  If it's the jelly, there are plenty of other things that go good with peanut butter.  Elvis taught us the value of peanut butter and bananas.  When I was 9 I liked peanut butter and pickles.  Still do like the flavor actually, just can't stand the texture anymore.

A thermos full of soup can also be a good lunch, it's something I did often in school.  Same with pasta.

I'd say consider salads, but no kid wants to be the one bringing a salad for lunch, that's just mean.My urologist recommends at least 3L per day for proper hydration but I also have a history of kidney stones so that might change the recommendation a little. I used to have a [chart that showed urine colors](http://www.appforhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Urine-chart.jpg). I found that a minimum of 2L was required to keep my kidneys healthy. The only non-dessert dish I would put sugar in is a tomato sauce,but even then only like a pinch. A teaspoon, max. It's not really necessary and you could just, you know, not and cook it for longer. 2 cups is like 400g... That's an insane amount of sugar.

Yeah, it's not exactly hard to make. Throw some vegetables in there and you're already on top form.I would recommend reading cooking for geeks or....you know in your case not reading it.The same amount as a candy bar.I guarantee it's no typo. Baked beans (in a can) are delicious, but way too sweet in my opinion. Maybe I should try making my own, with a lot less sugar...  for the egg doneness chart, do i time after boiling? and is that with the stove on medium?I'm speaking for myself and I'm not satisfied with the content, so I'm criticizing it. Anyone who agrees with me can upvote, and if you don't feel the way I do you don't need to pay attention to me.Any suggestions on what to replace the chicken with? I like this recipe but I'm a vegetarian!Aren't they basically fried blood clots?2 *cups* of brown sugar? That better be a typo...Pasta dish: 
Boil a few handfuls of pasta (Whole wheat/grain if possible). 

In another pan, stir fry up a chicken breast, tomatoes, peppers, onion and garlic. When the chicken is cooked, add in some tomato sauce. (Amount depends on if you like your pasta saucier or drier). Let that simmer while the pasta finishes boiling. 

Once the pasta is done, drain it and add it to the sauce/veggie/meat mixture. Sprinkle some cheese if you want. Enjoy. 

Fish dish: 
Heat up a olive, canola, or peanut oil in a frying pan. 

Take a filet of fish (I prefer salmon and can get it reasonably priced at Price Rite, but this recipe will work with almost any  white or red fish filets), toss it in flour, salt and pepper, or breadcrumbs. 

Throw it in the heated oil. 

Cook up some rice and frozen vegetables. Ta-Da!

Super lazy easy dinner: 

Mix a can of tuna (drained) with a half cup of cottage cheese. Season to your taste. I use sirarcha personally. Eat it with crackers and a salad, or put it in a wrap or sandwich. Note, this is a TON of protein (approximately 35grams), depending on your stomach, you may only eat half of it at a time. 

Edit: Added recipeare you able to grow it indoors? It's pretty easy to do!

edit: oops. I see someone else has the same suggestion. People will look at two items to purchase on the grocery store shelf:

Minute rice, which is "easier" to make and costs like $1

Or a 2lbs bag of rice, which costs like $1.70

However, the bag of rice makes something like 16 servings, and minute rice makes 4 servings.http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking

I copy them to a note taking program and look for common ingredients so I can make multiple meals from one shopping trip with no left over ingredients taking up space in the kitchen. This is all anecdotal, from my own experience. About a year ago I started trying to drink around 60+ ounces (1.77 liters) of water a day.  It helped my skin, which was more clear, less prone to blemishes, less tight and dry, and had a healthy glow. My eyes (I have a bad dry eye problem) were less irritated, I didn't need drops as much or as often, contact lenses were less painful. I stopped snacking so much- when I wanted to snack just for the sake of snacking, I drank a glass of water first. I definitely peed more often, but it was a lot lighter (which is good- it means your kidneys aren't working as hard), and I wasn't thirsty!

A few months ago, I stopped drinking water so well. My skin is breaking out more, my eyes are dry and irritated, I'm snacking, pee is pretty concentrated (yellow)...I'm really trying to get back to the 60 ounces, I definitely felt better on it!&gt; pull out a tasteless block of nutrients

In theory if you eat nothing but baked potatoes with butter (skin included!), that takes care of your basic nutritional needs. You won't starve or become malnourished.

You will have to bake them once a week or so, then pull and reheat as you suggest.

You should probably eat green things too though...or at least a flintstone chewable.I got a big cup that holds 7dl and can be closed. I drink at least two each day. I also take omega pills because I'm not good at eating fish once a week. My job is great though, they serve fish two days a week and steak each Saturday, in the summertime I drink at least four liters in twelve hours when I'm working[You might try those "meal in a jar" ideas](http://www.bigredkitchen.com/2011/07/how-to-make-mason-jar-meals-part-1/)? buy a case of mason jars and build grab and go meals 6 at a time. Pasta salad might be a decent go-to. 
Pro-tip: ensure you have forks that can be put entirely inside the jar with the lid on, to make putting the aftermath in your bag possible.

&gt; For lunch I've been bringing these "P3 packs" that are basically just small portions of cheese, nuts, and some type of meat.


I bet you can make a week or two's worth of those yourself for less than half what you are paying oscar meyer. All that stuff is even pretty decently long lasting too. The meats would be the biggest worry.

Another option if you are literally looking for just more calories is simply to drink them. It's so easy to do, that's most people's problem, actually. For example a 16oz Jamba Juice smoothie is like 300 calories. Grab some pineapple juice and frozen fruit, blend and dump into an insulated container. You can probably tack close to 6-700 calories that way. That's a ton of (natural) sugar though. Not the end of the world with lots of exercise though. Certainly beats downing coca-cola.

My grab and go morning food is a [sort of ghetto frittata](http://justbento.com/handbook/recipe-collection-mains/rice-cooker-frittata-summer-vegetables) I make in my rice cooker, which I just just reheat in the microwave and bag in a plastic bag as a sort of wrapper. It also make a good disposal for leftover veggies, proteins, etc.

Sometimes in the morning I just eat some simple rice dish I set to cook the night before. Any decent Japanese rice cooker will keep the rice perfect for about 24hrs, so 8ish is nothing. This certainly beats an apple in terms of calorie count and filling you up.

I would say dollar for dollar, my rice cooker has probably saved me the most from eating out, and actually eating breakfast.nice job! Looks tasty. Fixed it.Not sure about the healthiness of this, but for pure ease of cooking, The Starving Student's Cookbook is probably the easiest. It's available on Amazon (I'm on mobile, so no link). There's no sophisticated instructions or anything. This might be able to ease you into the cooking mindset. Most recipes are pretty quick too.

Also, you need a fridge.You don't need anything major. You can even go second hand if you'd like. I'd be more than happy to help if you'd like to clear up the other points too.Not extremely wealthy. My dad worked as an engineer for a major logistics company for many years. Think rail roads. my mom pretty much stayed home. there for a bit in elementary school she was a lunch lady and just brought all us kids home at the end of the day. 


Normal suburb life I assume. My dad is oldschool though. Kitchen stuff was womens work. Youch.chicken and rice is my go to meal pretty much. I think I'll try and cook that first. Maybe document it for you guys, but I haven't changed anything yet or gone grocery shopping. Still fridge shopping. You got all those letters wrong, I said nothing like that. 

You may be dyslexic. still shopping around for one. It's rough*that loves mevalid point. I'm still fridge shopping at the momentyep. sorry, i assumed everyone on the internet was from north americaI've cooked freshly caught trout in a similar fashion in aluminum foil by a fire. Gut it, throw butter and season in there, wrap it up, wait 20mins and eat it off the bone. Throw bones in the river. Usually breast. I usually wash the chicken breast first form the fridge, then cut it.

I should freeze before hand?I'm not totally sure about the healthy aspect, but a crockpot recipe I've done:

-chicken thighs
-verde salsa (get one that's thinner)
-habanero peppers chopped
-Serrano peppers (whole)
-chopped onion

Throw all that in and cook it for 4-5 hours. you'll get a spicy but delicious soupy thing. Chicken thighs tend to me much cheaper, and you can get Goya verde salsa very cheap.I buy dehydrated meals and meals in packs. Pretty much add water and heat type stuff. Usually my buddy freezes some steaks and by the time we get out there and set up they're good to cook, and he does that. then it's eggs the next morning, and then granola, or sandwhich stuff, or some type of meal in a bag setup. I'm in charge of taking the water and making sure it boils for 5mins+ before we use it for anything. 
That was absolutely fascinating and made me more squeamish than I thought I would be. Tempted to try some of these, but there's definitely an unfortunate mental block.Owning a crock-pot is clutch for week-long recipes

&gt; 
&gt; 1 cup frozen, chopped spinach ($0.21)
&gt;
&gt;Total price: $1.42, per serving:$0.35 + cost of spices

Stir-fry onions in oil over medium heat with spices and garlic. After about 5 minutes rinse the chickpeas and add them to the pan. Next add the cooked lentils, and finally the frozen spinach (you may want to thaw it in the microwave before adding it to the pan.) Cook until everything is heated through and serve (with salt and pepper is desired.)

These are actually the same recipes as the ones above. Did you mean to include a different picture?1lbs navy beans: $1.50

2 cups brown sugar: $2 (rounding up)

2 cans tomato puree: $2

Water, spices, salt: basically $0

That would yield aprox 8 cups of beans and sauce. Your price per 8 oz would be $0.70

You could package it up into small containers and freeze. You can keep the frozen container at your desk in an insulated lunch bag, and keep it at a safe temp for 4-6 hours. 

You could make this in a crock pot too. So even the "no effort" argument looses its legs.What works for you may not work for everyone you seem to be speaking for.Look, you guys, I've touched hot meat right after it's come off the pan.

It tends to not taste as "tuna-y" as the other stuff. Also, I recommend looking for other preparations then the standard "add mayo to make tuna salad." Tuna is very versatile.

Pole beans are also good with the same treatment if you steam them slightly first.

Broccoli is tasty if you roast it in the oven.  Toss it in a metal roasting pan with some olive oil, salt and pepper and then put in the oven at 425.

The marinade for the chicken was really good. I was worried there was a bit too much siracha sauce, but since its just in the marinade and the marinating time is quite short its fine. I actually went a little light on it, but now that I've tasted it I'd say the recommended amount is pretty perfect, or even a slight bit more.


I perhaps wouldn't recommend the cauliflower rice if you don't have a food processor. Its a mess and takes a quite a lot of time, even thought I just chopped it very roughly and I will probably opt for regular rice if I make it again without a processor.

I definitely give this one my recommendation.I hate that hand test for meat done-ness that keeps getting shared.  

I've had restaurant cooks swear by it to me, seen it online before etc.  

Here is the thing: no.  It doesn't work.  

Different cuts of meat and different thicknesses of meat and different *animals* feel differently at different meat temps.  

Different peoples *hands* feel differently, based on the amount of muscle and the muscle tone. 

That there is a sorta-clever seeming trick out there that is 90% bullshit isn't surprising.  That happens all the time.  But the zeal with which people will defend this silly trick is remarkable to me.  People get angry when you tell them this doesn't work.  

It doesn't.  It's like the taste-map of the tongue, or the "fact" that you can see the Great Wall of China from orbit, or that the full moon makes you crazy, or that vaccines cause autism.  It's something that is "known" and "taught" to many while not being true at all.  After 1,5 liters/day not really. Until then it improves a huuuge list of stuff. IIRC in the northern countries like Norway and Finland, where I'm from, you are supposed to drink around 1,5 liters per day to guarantee proper hydration and it goes up to 3 liters in some hotter countries, but here the benefits stop around 1,5l afaik.


EDIT: Also its tap water with which you fill it again, spring water refers usually to bottled spring water.[This is my fancy go to recipe.]( http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/01/warm-butternut-squash-and-chickpea-salad/) It takes more time to prepare and you have to hunt a bit for the ingredients (well mostly just for the tahini) but once you have it in the cupboard, all you need is the fresh ingredients and its easy!

Another one when I need my veg fix is simple oven roasted veggies on couscous. Take veggies (like carrots, zucchini, sweet potato etc), cut them into about 2cm cubes, coat them in olive oil + balsamic vinegar + salt + chopped garlic + dried oregano, whack it in an oven until cooked, cook couscous, and finally serve the veggies on the couscous!You can't remember 3 steps to diced food?On winter squash storage, depending on the variety, some will store for up to 1 year without problem.These are too long and complicated for anyone to actually bother remembering what they say.No hard feelings whatsoever. Thanks!Save**Ingredients**

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

3 tablespoons red Thai curry paste

1 yellow onion, sliced with the grain

2 chicken breasts, cut into cubes

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 1/2 cups broccoli florets

1 1/2 cups chopped carrots

1 teaspoon dried basil

3 cloves garlic, minced

Zest of 1/2 lime

1 1/4 cups coconut milk

1/4 cup chicken stock

One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes

Lime wedges, for squeezing

**Directions**

Cook 1 tablespoon of the oil, the curry paste and onions in a large saute pan over medium heat, stirring often and letting sizzle, 5 to 6 minutes. Pat the chicken dry, sprinkle with salt and pepper and add the remaining oil to the pan. Cook the chicken in the onion-curry mixture until golden on all sides. Add the broccoli, carrots, basil, garlic and lime zest and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are coated, about 2 minutes. Add the coconut milk, chicken stock and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Let the chicken simmer until cooked through and the sauce begins to thicken, about 20 minutes. Squeeze with lime juice before serving.

Ive just noticed the dates and this is correct. Yours was posted on the 12th jan and mine the 25th. Credit given when credit due :) I do apologize. Once again I hope no hard feelings.The " amalgamation of work" in your link was copying the work in Buzzfeed's article...word for word.

And Buzzfeed compiled the list from other people's work.

See how sourcing can be tricky?Yay! As a sometimes cooker this is fantastic!Thank you, I was a little worried lol. I also would like to point out the all three are an amalgamation of peoples work put together so both yours and my link are both correct :) Keep up the good work and thank you for your post. Nope! It is all good. A coworker says they are fantastic. But, again, pricey.What do you think about the link? It suggests that IgG might be a marker for food tolerance, not intolerance. http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/igg-food-intolerance-tests-what-does-the-science-say/I noticed that the link also gave credit to Buzzfeed but the link just took it to the main page. I just want to be clear the in no way was I trying to upset anyone but instead be helpful and give others/all credit. I enjoyed the article both here and on the link I posted. No hard feelings I hope ?Vat of either rice or pasta plus cut up chicken plus bags of frozen veggies plus cheese.Is it just me, or would that make a great poster?Thanks! You mean [this list](http://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/cooking-charts#.gsabNMA0a) from a week earlier? Sourcing data on the internets is often tricky. Especially when claims of original source are being thrown around.That can't be healthier than chipsI don't know about y'all but the Cast Iron Skillet instructions made the post worthwhile for me.  I annihilated mine because I didn't know what the fuck I was doing with it.Chicken breast and couscous. Yeah, I'm from NE Ohio, it's in most of our local grocery stores. But wedding soup is far more common here than I've seen in other parts of the country.Lol I wouldn't have minded if you did if the result was recipes for awesome food. Good to know about the cilantro, and better idea with tiny tortillas. Bite sized quesadillas sounds fantastic!I found a tip for buttermilk (if you don't have any) - use regular Milk 1-2 cups &amp; add a table spoon of white vinegar, stir and let sit for 5-10 mins- and you're good to go.
I've used this a few times and it seems to work very well :)Oooo!I'm surprised that Ziplist won't send you your recipes. I know that people have still recently been getting their recipe file by writing to support@ziplist.com. Although, if your recipes didn't get moved to Epicurious, then there might be a different issue altogether. Some former Ziplist members thought that they were missing their Ziplist recipes, but then it turned out that they actually had multiple Ziplist accounts under different email addresses. If that's the case then it's time to play everyone's favorite game: now which email address did I use to sign up here... (Oh, btw, I'm the Redditor who created Copy Me That.)To be honest you don't need all of them. Just print out a few that you think are useful and stick them to the inside of a cupboard door. I would prefer if this information was compiled into a text format.well that was confusing This was amazing. To offer my two pennies worth - for filleting fish, spend 10 minutes watching the Japanese do it on YouTube. It's the best education. And NEVER fillet with a blunt knife. 
Secondly, a lot of us don't have much time. But I DO have enough time to watch gordon ramsay's 'the f word' on YouTube - full recipes to beautiful food get summarised in 5 minutes. Can't get better than that.Generally a vinaigrette would have an even larger oil to vinegar ratio (3:1) than this graphic is suggesting (2:1).exactly, not many people like burnt meat.I'm a student too and like making bulk recipes. I made [this](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/authentic-louisiana-red-beans-and-rice/) Louisiana-style red beans and rice recipe last week and I'm still eating leftovers from it. Turned out pretty damn good...only thing I changed was using smoked sausage instead of andouille since I can't get it easily here in SoCal. Added quite a bit more salt, tooI posted the same thing in food hacksEuh that happened to my sister's friend. He pushed the wrong side of a double door and his fingernail lifted off completely.  For the rest of his friendship with her he was known as fingernail Mark.  I shudder.We were in New Orleans in November, and my husband and I regularly talk about making the three hour drive on one of our days off JUST to have the fried chicken at Willie Mae's again.  We went to the new location on St. Charles in Uptown.  Oh burn!Thanks, that was extremely interesting. You are amazing for posting this. I often find myself making the same internet searches and these infographics are very comprehensive for basic kitchen knowledge. Will add to my recipes book. 

Thanks OP! I was just looking at freezer burrito recipes. This is the coolest idea I've never thought of. Trying this tomorrow. Thanks!I like to make 2 cups of rice, add a can of black beans, a can of kidney beans, some cheese, and enchilada sauce or salsa to make burrito fillings for a week or so. Just wrap them up and freeze if you want to keep them for longer.

And go gataNew to this subreddit. I just purchased your book after browsing your blog. Thank you, Beth! I am looking forward to cooking delicious frugal meals! ruined food caused by uncalibrated hands is not. Hands are free!Before. 

I usually eyeball it, but if I cook for more than one or two people ( = the amount I'm used to, so I know what the amount looks like in the regular drinking cup I use to measure) I usually just weigh it. 
Rice, pasta, couscous etc are all around 75 grams per one person portion. For a quick lunch I reheat 1 cup of brown rice that I'd previous cooked and stored in the freezer, pour it on top of a large can of plain tuna. 

From here I mix it up day by day by putting different flavours on top, usually chilli and hot source. 

I also put some zero fat Greek yoghurt to add some moisture to the consistency Print them off and tape them to inside of cabinetsOP, cross post to /r/coolguides! This would for right in, if it hasn't been posted yet. I work at a sandwich chain where we make our own vinaigrette. IIRC, we use 1/3 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of oil. So it seems about right to me. I do opposite ratio of oil and vinegar. Maybe I'm weird.Having cooked with coconut oil quite a bit, I find that it emphatically does *not* have a high smoke point. My go-to oil if I need something with a higher smoke point is grapeseed oil.Eat a salada lot of this is pretty common knowledge for those that cook on the regular, but a very large chunk of it is definitely stuff I don't usually see as cooking tips.  Very useful, thanksI only have two off the top of my head:

[Crockpot Buffalo Chicken](http://www.skinnytaste.com/2012/04/crock-pot-buffalo-chicken-lettuce-wraps.html)

[Chilli](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1o594m/simple_slow_cooker_chili/)

They need to be prepared in advance but both are pretty versatile if you have some sitting around. 

I use the buffalo chicken in wraps, salads, sandwiches and pasta. The wraps, salads and sandwiches all use similar ingredients (lettuce, cheese, green/red/yellow pepper), etc).

I like to use the chilli in pasta (adding a little extra tomato sauce, basil, and oregano if the chilli isn't covering the pasta). It's also good on nachos or by itself. 

Both meals can be added to and seasoned to taste, require very little prep time, can be made in bulk, and freeze well.A couple of tricks I didn't see that I've picked up.

If you need brown sugar but don't have any, regular granulated sugar can be mixed with molasses to taste for light or dark brown sugar.

Cut avocados can also be saved by spraying cooking spray or coating them with vegetable oil before wrapping tightly

Avoid storing bananas in the fridge, as they mature they release ethylene gas which causes other fruit, including itself, to ripen as an exponential rate. placing them in the fridge allows the gas to remain concentrated.I mean I've never even seen endive and escarole where I am is easier to find at a garden centre then at a supermarket.

What if you have fat hands?am i the only one that can't read the pasta chart?For the record, I'm EXTREMELY skeptical of egg substitutions in general/r/soylent is a tasteless glass of nutrients. It has complete nutrition. It costs about $75 a week though, so not exactly cheap. But it is probably the cheapest, quickest, and healthiest thing you could eat every day.Guess I'll just go make an omelette with 12 tablespoons of peanut butter.

I'm just kidding! You're right, I guess I was just surprised to see peanut butter used to sub an egg. Thanks for the perspective.Baked potato piled high with steamed/microwaved veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, cooked mushrooms etc), cottage cheese and salsa.

You can bake all the potatoes at once and nuke as needed, and cut up all the veggies at once and just pop in microwave as well.  It travels easily if you have a microwave at work. I think you'll find that all the veggies and salsa go really well with the cottage cheese and are much more pleasing to eat day after day than something like burritos or sandwiches.Buy a damn thermometer for the meat doneness. Everyone's hands are different and thermometers are cheap.Lay down a bed of roughly chopped root veggies (multi-bite sized carrots, potatoes, parsnips, etc). Toss a cheap chunk of meat on top (pork or beef usually). Tough is *good*. Make sure there's enough veggies to keep the meat out of its juices. Season to taste. (salt and pepper may be enough) Seal the cooker and turn it on.

This is called *[braising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braising)*, and turns just about any cut into a wonderful stew.[blood is also an excellent egg substitute](http://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2013/9/blood-and-egg)Why should it? Maybe you're allergic to egg, or ran out of eggs but have extra peanut butter, or need to use things that don't need to be refrigerated (and live in the US where that's necessary for most eggs), or you want to make it vegan or... Any reason, really.

 The reason to substitute isn't relevant to the question of whether the substitution is possible, and all it was aiming at was telling us which substitutions are possible. Why should they have to imagine ever reason someone might be inclined to substitute?Good to know. I only really use the food processor for pie crust, which makes the plastic one pretty useful. Oh and long nails are gross I trim my fingernails for two reasons, used to bite them and stopped by trimming them a lot, and the other is if they have any length I'm afraid they'll rip backwards on something.That's the point. The image doesn't say why.Just repeatedly did the meat doneness scale on my hand over and over, I'm mindfucked in the best way possible. Thanks for the consolidated guidelist, I absolutely love picking up new tricks!Saving for future reference awesome post!!!!!!!!Food. Mmm.Very useful. For more info on how long foods keep, another source is stilltasty.comThank youI worked in a produce department and I agree. Pointing to what is in season doesn't take much effortThose are super expensive around me.  I can get asparagus on a good sale. It does, provided the butter is cold enough and you pulse. The plastic ones are mostly a waste for me.I own the food processor pictured on the "what kitchen mixer" infographic. It makes better smoothies than the vitamix blenders I've used.Wow, this great! Thank you!I have stuff like this on the inside of cabinets or on the refrigerator, then when I'm stuck, I just flip open the cabinet and reference it without interrupting my cooking to much.That Italian wedding soup one irks me. 

I don't know about other parts of the country, but I've never had problems finding endive and escarole. You should definitely use those in place of asparagus. It's a pretty simple and amazing soup to make.I'd hesitate to suggest PB&amp;J, since peanuts are rather fatty (and PB usually has a ton of nasty oils added), and cheap jam is mostly sugar with a bit of fruit flavor. Sliced bread is also either terrible (no fiber) or very expensive.

Bananas are decently priced and year-round, as well as pretty damn good for you... strawberries are far more expensive. Honey isn't exactly a "miracle" sugar though, and tends to be spendy.Freeze a bottle of water and plop it in with food you want to keep cool. By the time dinnertime rolls around you have cold water and preserved food.Same answer I always give. PB&amp;J sammichrs with milk. Or PB&amp;fruit/honey (I suggest bananas and strawberries). For a not-so-healthy splurge to switch it up on cheat day ...  Add bacon to your PB&amp;J. Its amazing.Rolled oats soaked in water, milk, or juice.

You're going to need other stuff to round out your nutrients... but if you aren't willing to cook beans and rice (you can't digest them raw), then you're pretty limited.Saving this.This is pretty cool!

Does the (food processor's) sharp s-blade actually work for pie crust if you don't have a blunt version though?Socal here too. IME, 99c store is more expensive than some normal grocery stores due to custom packaging or custom products made to look similar to others. So the weight per dollar isn't as good as other stores. That said, I rarely go there. It's just what I've experienced when I tried price comparisons.

(don't know about Dollar Tree)Hey all!  I was asked to continue to share my healthy recipes involving cauliflower.  Depending on your budget this may not be your idea of cheap, but if you can swing the ingredients this is a DELICIOUS way to eat healthy and low calorie!  I believe this recipe might also be paleo-friendly, but Im not an expert on that particular diet.

The recipe is my own, so heres the rundown.  Note: This is a 1 serving portion, approximately 250 calories according to MyFitnessPal.  If you want a larger portion, increase ingredient amounts accordingly.

--------

**Ingredients**

Chicken Marinade:

* 4 oz chicken breast

* 1 tsp sesame oil

* 1 tsp soy sauce

*  tsp brown sugar

* 1 tsp sriracha

* 1 clove minced garlic

* A pinch of crushed red pepper

Cauliflower rice:

* 6 oz cauliflower

* 1 tsp sesame oil

*  tsp garlic

* Ginger and salt (to taste)

* 2 egg whites

*  tsp soy sauce

**Directions**

* Cut the chicken into strips and throw the rest of the marinade into a ziplock bag and let it sit for an hour or two.

* Chop the cauliflower into rice-sized pieces.  A food processor would come in handy here but I dont have one so I just did mine the old-fashioned way.

* Heat the sesame seed oil on medium heat and add the cauliflower.  Continue to cook and stir it until it starts to get a brown color

* Add garlic, ginger, and salt.  Cook about a minute longer, then set aside

* Fry the egg whites (this shouldnt take long at all since the pan will still be hot), then set them aside with the rice.

* Turn the heat down just a tad and cook the chicken until cooked through.

* Add the rice and egg back to the pan, stir it around until its nice and hot, and add a bit more soy sauce if youd like

* Serve it up!  Enjoy!

I really hope you like this one!  I am by no means a professional chef so constructive criticism on my methods is always welcome.
 
I don't know if someone has already said this but you also have to remember that the only item that will "run out" after that one meatloaf is the ground beef. The bread crumbs, spices, and ketchup will keep for a long time. The eggs will keep for a bit but definitely not "run out" that meal. So if you do meatloaf one week, you spend $5ish on a pound of ground beef (depending on how lena you wnat it) and $$ for the rest of the ingredients. But then say, two weeks later, you want another meatloaf. The only things you will have to buy are ground beef and maybe eggs depending on how fast you go through them. 

You are going to spend more money now because your kitchen does not have the staples. Once you get those, the only things you will have to buy are the fresh ingredients and replenish staples every once in a while. So, stop thinking of the meal in terms of costs of all the ingredients but instead of the fresher ingredients and you will have a better sense of what each meal will cost. Also consider that a meatloaf (or whatever else) will last you more than one meal. So you will get 3-4 meals out of the one and then not have to buy more ingredients for for those meals.Hooray, another thing to bookmark and never go back toNo question here. I just wanted to say thank you for what you do, I'm a huge fan!

Here is my go at [Curried Lentils](http://i.imgur.com/C5oZCey.jpg) tonight. Absolutely phenomenal!Or a quarter cup of mashed potatoes! I can vouch for that white bean rosemary soup. Delicious. Now I can't wait to try the others!um... does anyone else think that that's way too much oil in the vinaigrettes? It has some reference value but has more value when you learn it and remember. Like cooking, once you kearn a skill or trick, you utilize it often.This is amazing. It should be bound together and made into a book if you ask me. I was actually thinking about printing them off and binding them... these are cool and all, but who the fuck is actually going to refer to these when they are cooking things???Bahaha I definitely thought I was replying to NeverCooks, who has posted extensively about his unwiches and low cal options from wherever. I swear I haven't stalked your food history. But definitely try these!!!! Go light on the cilantro if you haven't cooked with it before. This was my first experience and the first batch was just....whoa. overwhelming. But after using it in this I went on to make a garlic cilantro hummus that was freaking amaaaazing. These quesadillas are definitely in the monthly rotation. I make them with tiny tiny tortillas.this is amazing i want to upvote every single oneI love this!Not sure what type of chicken you're cutting (whole, breasts, etc.) but I find cutting it when it's still fairly frozen to be the easiest and least messy way.My old livejournal food community used to do this and it was great fun. I vote +1 on this idea and would participate. There are other reasons to substitute than calories...Omg, so many. Chips, salsa, various cheeses, ancient grains crackers, guac cups, nuts, chocolate barks... just to name a few. Finally I can just use 2 egg whites when I don't have one egg handyFantastic collection, thanks OP!It's broccoli stems all shredded up and sold in a bag. It's great with red onion, chicken, and Asia dressing. broccoli slaw?Awesome! Thanks!Hey, look at you.The tortilla strips are super cheap and they are sooooo good.  I keep meaning to try the salsa, but I keep forgetting.I know I'm late but I'd like to second this suggestion. My two top food blogs are Skinnytaste and Budget Bytes (so you can see why I'm here on eatcheapandhealthy - it's the perfect combination). In baking egg is primarily used as a gelling or thickening agent. Banana, mashed potato, pumpkin, peanut butter can all do the same thing. It may alter the flavour/consistensy of the dish you're baking, but still serves the same purpose.Thank you for sharing. Now, do I print or lilnk?3 tablespoons of peanut butter is a substitute for one egg? I don't get it. That's like 300 calories substituting 70.Big packs of single serve, steam in bag in pod edamame. If you have little packets of soy sauce or even just salt on hand, even better! Season the pods, then eat the beans.Who said love has to be reasonable?  He'll find someone, someone very special - someone who won't press charges.Great, thanks!I love infographics so much.Fantastic! Thanks

Definitely get a big backpack for grocery haulingAnd modeling his hands.Frozen veggies are great! All the peas I eat are frozen and most of the time frozen green beans are cheaper than fresh.  They taste much better than canned and aren't more expensive.  

The only veggie I buy canned often are tomatoes and green chili peppers. Uh, meat guy really needs to trim those fingernails if he's going to be poking steaks.Get their smoked salmon. Great for onion, tomato and lox bagels. There isn't anything at all wrong with frozen veggies. They're often more "fresh" than "fresh" veggies, since they tend to be flash frozen after harvest. mixed nuts or just the cashews.  Yum yum yum!!!!  They also sometimes get in the dried seaweed snacks and those are hella good.What will done meat feels like: Failure.nobody here sanitizes, and nobody gets sick. Wheres the problem?As a diabetic, I learned the hard way not to trust online auto-formulas. :)Have you considered raiding your neighbors garden?I don't know if this violates the ethos of this sub, but I try to always have a variety of frozen vegetables.

Vegetables are usually cheaper when they're in season and honestly the way to get the most variety for the cheapest price is just to shop around. You can look at your local farmers markets (or if you want a lot of vegetables and aren't very picky, look into joining a CSA) and compare those to the prices at grocery stores in your area. There's a great grocery store near me that carries a lot of produce with much better prices than I can find at the farmer's markets. A lot of it really depends on the area you live, including what vegetables are in season. 

Also, as the other commenter mentioned, frozen vegetables are often cheaper than their fresh counterparts. I'm not a huge fan of frozen vegetables, but they're great in terms of prices and storage time. Someone on [r/fitmeals](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/2vg5dh/low_cal_300_cal_sweet_and_spicy_shrimp_with_rice/cohh97y) claims this is 800 calories?

I know. That stuff is OLD. I can't believe there are still sites hosting it. I still use the More Fast Food My Way vids frequently though. In the winter buy:

 * kale
 * cabbage
 * broccoli slaw (cheap all year)
 * squash 

I like to add kale, cooked lentils, cabbage, broccoli slaw, and frozen peas to salad. I don't eat very much lettuce. I find other veggies more filling. 

Some frozen veggies are always a good price (buy generic):
 
 * peas
 * green beans
 * spinach
 * corn (not really a veggie I know)
 * chopped broccoli (not florets)

Canned tomatoes are always a good price. 
Hell yeah, that looks delicious. Definitely going to try that out. I found her site when I just moved out and didn't know how to cook/was broke as hell. I'm still like that more or less but at least I know how to make a few things. Also I love her sriracha shirt.  

That site looks great! I probably care about low cal less than I should but it's always a plus so I can try making a bunch of things in one day and not feel super guilty about it, lol. Thanks for the link!Get out!! Really? That's amazing, (obligatory after watching an hour) you know.Haha I call it Voonderpot as well! That's a great idea! Ha! So true. :)Nah, probably not. I really don't like doing sponsored posts. I've only done one or two, but prefer not to have that in my format.Seriously, black bean quesadillas are amazingI understand that. But MFP doesn't reliably allow recipes to be shareable to other users, nor does it have the functionality to take a recipe and convert it into a "my foods" item that others can use. Additionally it often picks up the wrong food when entering it and requires fixing before saving. 

Having it entered and useable by everyone with a consistent entry would be great.I definitely need to compile my one-pot and one-skillet meals! I'll put that project on my list. As far as high protein, low-carb breakfasts, you can do something like a frittata (or crustless quiche), which is basically any vegetable baked into eggs with a little cheese for good measure.  Or I like to do yogurt with nuts and oat bran mixed in (and sometimes berries, too). I'm a huge proponent of spatchcocking poultry. (Plus the name makes me giggle because I'm a giant 3rd grader.). I found Martha Stewart's recipe for spatchcocked turkey for thanksgiving one year, but the technique works on chicken, too. Cooks SO fast, it doesn't have time to dry out. Kind of foolproof, might be worth a shot?If you get a head of iceberg lettuce, you can easily [core it](http://www.wikihow.com/Core-a-Lettuce-in-One-Quick-Move), and then rip up pieces as you need them, or rip them all up and keep them in a tupperware container or plastic bag for a few days.

It's a great idea to keep everything separate until you're ready to make it, but also look at how grocery stores sell their ready-to-eat salads. Usually it's a pile of lettuce, some veggies arranged nicely, a sliced egg, and a packet of dressing. If you work in an office, you can make that in a tupperware container and keep some dressing at work in the fridge, and presto, salad for lunch!Fantastic! I love hearing that! :)I use a Nikon D3100, which is pretty basic DSLR camera. I use the lens that came with the kit and always use natural light. I just work with what I've got! Rainy days are automatically "writing and research" days. ha. :)You can put the link into my fitness pal manually and it will look up ingredients and calculate the various nutritional content. Haha, thank you :)Awesome!! I'm so happy I could help. :) I love hearing stories like yours!Awesome! I hope I can help a lot of other people do the same. :)Dude, he was the personal chef of Charles De Gaulle!These are super tasty, but one time I found a small rock in mine, anyone else have this experience? Probably a rare occurrence. Thanks a lot! Haha those KQED-links you provided were funnily outdated. It seems a whole lot of it is on youtube as well though. Whoa, thanks for the extensive reply, lots of suggestions. I'll make sure to check them out :) Started watching Jacques Pepin and he seems to be quite the bossI Bought a three pack a few months ago online. But recently I also spotted it in a Jumbo supermarket, so I guess it is pretty widely available yeah.Thirding BudgetBytes. My favorite recipe from her is of the [hearty black bean quesadillas](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/02/hearty-black-bean-quesadillas/). I get a tube of turkey meat ;) from the store and put that in there too. It kind of beefs them up. They're fairly low-calorie, I think. I've noticed that you tend to go for the lower cal stuff, in which case you might also like [SkinnyTaste](http://www.skinnytaste.com/).Made with tsp dark soy sauce instead of oil,  tsp smoked paprika, tsp chilli powder,  tsp garlic and a pinch of ground ginger. Had to bake for 40 mins (at 200C) checking every 10 - 15 mins or so to shake around and poke for crispiness. Turned out amazing.  First time having these, won't be the last! http://www.sixpackbags.com/voyager-backpack.html

You could get something like this, my co-worker has one and she really likes itMy Costco usually has big containers of smoked whole almonds that I'm obsessed with. The sodium probably isn't the greatest, but these really satisfy that need to eat something crunchy and salty. Great stuff, thanks dude! Tried one of her recipes this evening and it came out great (well, there is some room from improvement but that was mostly on me. I also totally failed with the rotis I was going to have on the side but that's another story.)Thanks for the tip! I'll make sure to check it out later! :))Hi Beth. Can you try to post some yummy one pot recipes and other simple but tasty recipes aimed at college students? 

Semi-relayed to the question above, do you have any ideas for a high protein, and relatively simple/easy breakfast ideas? All good ideas I can think of typically are carbs and such. :/ I see you are dutch. At least here (your friendly neighbor to the east) they have sriracha (and tons of other stuff your normal supermarket doesn't have) in pretty much every asian supermarket i have set foot in, so might be worth checking them out.Seaweed, roasted chickpeas, or rice snacks. I like salty and crunchy so I stay away from sweets for chip substitutes.  Also, don't eat baked lays and whatnot thinking it's better. There are partiallyhydrogenated oils in thereyes, my new go-to. here are some variations I discovered by The Domestic Geek YT channel [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddGi1wwAISg)/[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyufaE226cA)I like simple foods... maybe you should post some of them anyways!You might try Ina Garten's [Barefoot Contessa](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/barefoot-contessa/episodes.html) and Lidia Bastianich's [Lidia's Italy](http://www.hulu.com/lidias-italy). They're not exclusively vegetarian chefs, but they tend to focus on cooking a lot of vegetables and veg-friendly dishes. 

And definitely agree with /u/juggerthunk's Jacques Pepin recommendation. His series [Fast Food My Way](http://www.kqed.org/w/jpfastfood/recipes.html) and [More Fast Food My Way](http://www.kqed.org/w/morefastfoodmyway/episodes.html) are available via KQED.Happy Cake Day! It's a risk for most people because they do not sanitize between uses. I'm not eating anywhere that does this (Thailand or not). Feel free to keep salmonella poisoning to yourself!  You get it once and you'll understand why people are cautious. Fat Tuesday would be a good start date of splurge days.Calories on the packaging of uncooked rice are always for the uncooked product. This includes both weight and volume.

I tend to regard 1 cup of cooked white rice (no compressing) as being approximately 200 calories. The easiest experiment is to cook 1 cup of rice with a typical quantity of water (2 cups?), then start portioning it out into halves, quarters, eighths, etc and see how much volume the cooked rice takes up. Obviously the 1 cup of uncooked rice is 640 calories, so you'll probably end up with just shy of 3 cups of food afterward.I would suggest implementing a search function where a reader could exclude recipes by ingredient.  Like maybe I might click a box that said no dairy and a box that said no peanuts and then I would get all the recipes that don't include those ingredients.  Those aren't allergies I personally have, just an example.

At any rate, love your work.  Keep it up.Can I ask what you eat when you go camping? That might be a good place to start. i'll have to find a way to get this all to me because i dont live in the states but i will keep you updated ;)I understand, I know people who have that same aversion to left over food. But then I get to eat all their left overs much to their dismay. I think my best moments are when I take food that is left over at other peoples tables and put them in my take home. (After they have left, obviously.) But honestly many left over foods are considered really good after they have sat for a day, IE lasagna, pasta salad and other casseroles have a chance for their flavors to mingle a bit more and can be a good thing. Also I think it's REALLY hard to consistently eat healthy without involving left overs. Usually my healthiest food options are the left overs from food I have made, rather than pre-packaged foods or take out. #####&amp;#009;

SUPER delicious!Hey Beth thanks a million for all the work you've done, I'm actually eating your curried chickpea recipe as I write this. You've revolutionized the way I eat as a university student can't thank you enough!Hey Beth. I love your website, as a photographer I find the images very appealing and they make reading your recipes a lot of fun even when I'm not cooking. Do you have any details on your camera/lens/lighting setup, and any general tips for food photography?Carry a lot more than that when I backpack. Don't carry food with water in it. Ramen and oatmeal are good options. Sandwiches will keep all day easy especially if you keep the ingredients separate. Trail mixes with nuts and fruit are great for on the go. Fruit like bananas and apples. Of course if you can get access to a stove the options are limitless.Omg I love you and your blogThat's awesome! Thanks!Food won't spoil just because you keep it at room temperature for a few hours, you first need to get some bacteria INTO the food. A way to prevent this is to "can" your food. That is, as it is still (very) hot, put it in the container, then close it. Then refrigerate. 

Put it into an insulated lunch bag and you should be set.##Main Courses:

In essence, um, any sort of food that you can warm up or eat cold at home, too :PGet a good thermos and some good ice packs for your lunch/first meal(s). That'll let you have at least one hot or cold meal during the day. 

For your late meal, stock up on things that don't need refrigeration. Nuts, peanut butter, canned meat(tuna and chicken to make salad, get your hands on some single serve condiments, or "borrow" some from one of the eating places on campus. Other canned meat can be used for sandwiches, there's canned ham and such), canned foods you can microwave in a break room somewhere, etc. 

Hi Beth, I just wanted to say I love your blog! I found it in the summer when I was first looking for cheap and healthy recipes to help me lose weight. I have lost 50 lbs since August with the help of your blog :) My boyfriend and I were eating out at least 4-6 times a week before I started trying to cook more. After I found your blog we eat out maybe once or twice a week. I am a lot more excited about cooking and food. I have started meal planning every sunday and shopping for the week. About 75-80% of the recipes I use are from your blog because your recipes are always good and I trust your tastes. I've only ever had one recipe that didn't work out. I enter all your recipes that I use on myfitnesspal to find out the calories and most of your recipes can easily fit into my caloric budget. I really love the tips you give for storing food as well. It's really helped with our food budget. So thank you for sharing your awesome blog and helping spark the love of cooking and helping me become a healthier and happier person. I don't know how healthy, but I love their trial mix, 12.99 for 60 servings i think[Here's a good resource](http://whatscookingamerica.net/Vegetables/VegetableBuyingGuide.htm) for picking produce at the market.Probably uncooked, if it's anything like pasta. Thanks.  I love your blog, I make the honey spice chicken thighs several times per month, and when I find recipes elsewhere, I almost always check to see if you have a version of it.**PRO TIP**


Go back to your recipe and add a space after each *. It turns this:

*1 tablespoon vinegar

into this:

* 1 tablespoon venegarImpressive, I wouldn't have even attempted to return that lol.Hey,  just wanted to say that i love your blog and its helped me out with cooking skill,  I never learned when I was young. You could try separating your lunch serving before serving dinner.  That way the bottomless stomachs can't eat it.  :)One thing I do with breads that are part whole wheat is I add a little extra gluten to help it out.  I havent tried this particular recipe,  but its something you can experiment with. that's awesome that you've made the blog so successful! 

another suggestion for the site that I would love to see is an estimate of the nutrients for a dish. I know it varies so much based on the ingredients but with the tug of war between healthy-cheap-tasty it can be frustrating to find a great looking recipe and have no idea what's the nutritional value might be until I've got all the ingredients in front of me. I want to thank everyone for joining me today! It was a LOT of fun being able to interact with all of you! I'm sure I'll pop by from time to time to answer more questions and read your feedback. You can always contact me on Facebook, Twitter, or via the contact form on my website.

And thank you REDDIT for hosting me!! Cheers!Get an insulated lunch bag that can fit both your lunch and dinner and pack them. You can use cold cans of soda to help keep the food cold if you want soda or use those reusable blue ice packs for lunch boxes. I was very taken aback by how much my emotional and mental state was affected by not getting enough food. It literally changed my entire existence for that month. Hunger is not just about being hungry, it effects every aspect of your life and drastically so.That's a solid suggestion. I actually started doing that this week to compare, and noticed that I can buy two-three chicken breasts for $10, or I can buy a whole chicken for even less. What the hell sense does that make? I guess it's the price of convenience.I believe it's in uncooked volume. It would be really sneaky labeling to put post cooked weight without indicating. Do you think indoor gardening of herbs is worth it to cut down on your grocery bill?  I am on the fence.

I bet aerogarden would give you a free system if you blogged about it.  Seeing product reviews on your site that advertise they cut food costs would be very informative.  Would you consider doing this?I'm a huge fan of Better Than Bouillon soup bases. I use them to make broth, which I use in A LOT of my recipes. They make a lot of different varieties, including low salt and organic options.I'm a wine drinker. It's a nice calm buzz and so many to choose from! :)I still work a few days per month in the lab. I don't want to let go of that career entirely. It's fun and a good fallback career, but nothing beats working from home and the blog is my "baby", so I want to put my all into it. :)I LOVE your site! The step by step pictures are absolutely amazing. What do you think was the most important thing you took away from doing the SNAP challenge?Thanks for the tip!!I had some basil, rosemary, mint, and oregano growing on my porch at my last apartment (I moved in September), but I rarely used them in my cooking because I didn't know how to account for the price in my breakdowns and I know fresh herbs aren't very available to many of my readers. :(I usually just decide based on what I'm in the mood to eat and/or what is on sale at the store. When substituting cuts, I think you need to pay most attention to whether they are bone-in or boneless and if they're a tough or fatty cut versus lean. Bone-in cooks slower, so switching out for something boneless will require adjusting the cooking time. Fatty and tough cuts of meat need to cook at low temperatures for a long time to break them down and become tender, which doesn't work the same for lean cuts. Lean cuts are usually cooked quickly at higher heats. As long as you pay attention to those two things, substitutions should be pretty easy. Ground meats are pretty seamless to substitute beef/chicken/pork, they're fairly interchangeable.I could try that. :) Thanks! I will label it, as my toddler says, "MINES!"I'm definitely going to try that; thank you!

And, just to reiterate what many others here have said, Budget Bytes is amazing! It's always my first go-to when I'm looking for stuff to make. Some personal favorite recipes include African Peanut Stew, Quick Curried Chickpeas, and Hearty Black Bean Quesadillas.Do you grow your own herbs to save money?  We have started using an Aerogarden at our house to grow basil and mint. Hahaha probably because I LOVE cinnamon! ;)I use a Nikon D3100, which is pretty basic as far as DSLR cameras go. Hmm, I don't cook-splurge often. I guess it's because I'm always cooking for the blog, so I always already have food around. I guess I'd make a big salad with all sorts of fresh veggies that are usually too expensive (think cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper) or make a pizza with the same toppings in mind. Things that are usually too expensive like good olives, goat cheese, or those expensive vegetables again. :P

If I don't want to cook, I like to pick up sushi, pizza, Or MAYBE even a burger because I never make those things at home (I mean, I make pizza, but it's not the same).My family has some restrictions on what kind of animals we eat.  How do you pick which meat to make a dish around, and are there any animal specific and cut specific properties that make substitutions more or less complicated?When you do experiment with tofu, definitely press it - it eliminates water from the tofu so it can suck up the flavor.  It makes a huge difference how the tofu tastes and cooks.

This is my press that I love: http://www.amazon.com/EZ-Tofu-Press-Removes-Texture/dp/B007LLGMG2/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423597459&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ez+tofu+pressI bake my naan on a hot skillet on the stovetop. It comes out great! It's kind of like cooking weird tortillas. Love this idea! I'm also sensitive to dairy but not lactose intolerant, and it can be hard finding recipes without dairy, or ones that still sound good when you omit the cheese.Thanks for the answer. Yeah I eat leftovers everyday as well and a couple of hard boiled eggs for breakfast. It's kinda boring but I hate wasting food and have very little time for prep. Thanks again for coming by and may your days be successful and full of joy!!! beth, your recipes are amazing and I love the photos you include. Makes everything so easy to follow

I did think your shawarma recipe had a bit too much cinnamon though :)
hey beth, What kind of camera do you use to shoot the delicious photos of the food that you cook?I will be completely honest and say that I have no idea how to prepare tofu. I mean, I've seen it deep fried, but I hate frying things. I should probably practice cooking with it. I have kind of neutral feelings about tofu. It can be either really bland and boring or pretty good, so I'm sure that all depends on how it's prepared. Hi and thanks!! This is so much fun! :D

Perfect lunch? Like if I could have *anything*? Probably salad and a flat bread. I like that combo because I get a good dose of vegetables and a pizza-like dish without the heaviness of traditional pizza. ...and maybe a glass of wine? Hahaha

What do I *usually* have, though? Reheated leftovers, which honestly I am very happy to have. I like the idea of being able to pop a dish full of food in the microwave and be very full and happy in the end. Very little work but very satisfying. :)Fiber bro

Edit: insoluble fiber is counted in total carbs but it does not contribute to caloric count, you cannot digest it.Hi Beth!!  I love your site!! Most of our weekly dinners are your recipes. I just ate some beef and pineapple enchilada filling with rice that we made a double batch of the 2nd time in two weeks - so good! 

First I would like to say thank you for doing step by step photo instructions! That is incredibly helpful. I'm not new to cooking, but I don't know a lot and it is so great to see how certain things should be done.

Questions: What do you make when you want to splurge and not care about costs? And where do you like to go out to eat / get take out when you don't cook?I'm not a fan of Ramsay's cooking shows. It feels like he's trying to mix haute couture cuisine and homemade and it always feels like he's making something basic, but fussing about it way too much.

I don't know any vegetarian-specific cooking shows that I'd recommend.

The Vegan Zombie on Youtube is OK, but he seems rely too heavily on fake meat. I'm not full-on vegetarian anymore, but if I really wanted meat-texture, I'd just eat it. 

Honestly, I just watch any cooking show that doesn't sound like it's being spoken in a echo chamber and doesn't have needless filler or tons of transitional noises (uhhh, ummm, pauses, etc). Any dish that isn't focused on the meat (like a steak or baked chicken) can have the meat removed and still be pretty much the same. Here are channels I watch on a regular basis:

Food Wishes on Youtube is good. The guy obviously knows his stuff (I think he's a professional chef). However the guy seems to end every sentence with an inflection that gets tiresome quickly, so I don't watch it a lot.

The Art of Cooking on Youtube is from a Chinese-American chef and he explains many methods of making Chinese-American. I can now make rudimentary sauces that are way better than the Chinese place I used to frequent (that has gotten worse over the past few years)

Ochikeron on Youtube is from a Japanese woman. She's more about presentation, but she has great ideas for vegetarian dishes, including rice.

Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana on Youtube has a bunch of Indian recipes in English.

KQED on Youtube had several shows with Jacques Pepin. I highly recommend watching what he cooks. He feels significantly more comfortable with the food than Ramsay (who seems to fidget and fuss with whatever he's making).That's what I thought.  Thanks.

Not worth it for me at the moment since I have access to a microwave.I would love to see more tofu recipes on your site.  Do you like tofu?  I don't have anything that I "always" splurge on, but if I have extra cash my splurges are cold cereal, frozen pizza, or good cheese. OR, if I go to Whole Foods, I love their bread. A good bread is such a luxury. That sounds perfect. Will definitely check it out when we're visiting :)

Thanks Beth!Good afternoon Mrs. Moncel, I am the guy that created this place and super happy to have you here! Just a quick question. What is your perfect lunch look like? Hmmmm... that's a tough one because I haven't had that experience. I live by myself so I literally ALWAYS eat leftovers for lunch. Okay, how about once per week, say on Sunday, you make an extra meal that is specifically for lunches. Like some sort of stew, pasta, or casserole that can be divided up into individual servings and kept if the freezer so that your hungry family keeps their hands off? That way you're only cooked "extra" one day per week? Here's a list of meals that do well frozen in single serving portions:
http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/04/top-10-freezer-meals-2/Hi! What is the one food you always splurge on?This would be awesome! Or enter them into a database like My Fitness Pal and link to it.What should I do about lunch? X__X I've sort of mastered cooking for dinner, but I find myself reaching for prepackaged stuff at lunchtime or going out. Sometimes I can bring leftovers from dinner, but I can't always plan on my family not eating the whole pot of something... I have exactly 30 seconds in the morning to make or grab something, and the night before I get burned out with cooking dinner and don't want to prep two things.If there is, I haven't found it! Overcooked eggs are so sad, too.

I have brought some meals to work that have a soft boiled egg on top and reheated them in the microwave. I've found that the yolk doesn't cook completely through as long as the dish is just "warmed up" as opposed to heated to the point of hot-hot. I dunno if that helps, but that's what I've done!I had at one time planned to make the How-to a regular feature, but I guess it slipped my mind! *writes on to-do list*

You can find all the how-tos in one place if you go to the black menu bar across the top of the site. You'll find "how-to" at the bottom of the drop down menu under "Misc", or just follow this link: http://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/miscellaneous/how-to/That's so fantastic! Your experience is exactly what motivates me to keep this going. :)

Organizing the recipes by price is tricky because prices change so often. That's why I used the $-$$$ system for the book, but even that fluctuates depending on the availability of ingredients. I haven't quite figured out the best way to approach it yet.I like working with boneless skinless chicken thighs the best. You don't have to do anything to prepare them and they're so easy to just slather with sauce and then bake. They stay nice and moist and tender. Try these Maple Dijon Chicken thighs for example: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/05/maple-dijon-chicken/They're just meant for reheating, not for cooking. Thanks for answering. And I'm sure we all hope to see another book in the future. Hmm, I don't know. I think energy levels depend on a lot of different factors, so it's probably different for each person. Could be anything from getting enough sleep, exercise, water, proper nutrition, hormone levels... there are a million things that can boost or diminish energy.Hahahaha, yes, I got hooked on Serial from the first episode (I listen to NPR all day while I work in the kitchen). I still can't decide if he did it or not, but I definitely think Jay is a shady character who is full of nothing but lies! I don't think the police should have based so much of their case on his testimony.Looks like you're far more similar to me than I thought!

What's your drink of choice at parties?If you want to round out the meal with some vegetables, curry roasted cauliflower would be great. Actually, you can roast just about any vegetable with curry, so you can customize it to use what you like. It's so easy, but has so much flavor! :)

http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/10/curry-roasted-cauliflower/You're not doing lab work anymore? That was super inspiring about you. I'm going into that field and love cooking off to the side.It's something that a lot of people request, but I don't feel comfortable providing it for many reasons. The calculators available online are not very accurate and providing incorrect information can be dangerous to people with some medical conditions. I think it's best to let readers choose the nutrition calculators they trust best and calculate them on their own. Good idea, thanks. Shipping food is not something I usually do, but I had to do it for Sriracha as well, so it is a good option That makes me SO happy! I want to convert every person on the face of the earth into a cook! Hahah :)Another tactic is cooking enough food on the weekend to get you leftovers for lunch on Monday and Tuesday, and cook simple, quick meals on weeknights that have enough leftovers to eat for lunch the next day.

I do this with my husband and I and we roll through the week without wondering what's for lunch. If you're cooking for one you can get away with cooking a couple less meals and just stretching leftovers out longer. 

If you do food prep on Sunday and maybe again on Wednesday you can cut back on cooking time other days to crank out meals faster in the evening. I use iherb for a lot of things as you can get them a lot cheaper than local (I live in Sydney). Don't know if the prices are good for America though. I think the print book would be the answer to both! It was a HUGE project and I did it all while working full time and blogging full time. I still can't believe that I published a real book. I never would have dreamed that I'd be able to do something like that. Writing a ten page paper was like pulling my teeth out while I was in school. :P

That being said, I wish I could have focused on the book and book alone while writing it. I feel like it would have been 100x better if I hadn't been so stressed or so pressed for time. But I guess we're all our own biggest critic, right?Hey, Beth! Longtime Budget Bytes reader here. I recommend your blog all the time. 

I've been noticing a lot of soft-boiled eggs in your recipes recently, and you make a great case for their awesomeness. I think eggs make a great budget-friendly meat substitute, but I like to cook most of my food ahead of time and eggs are not very conducive to that. Is there any way to re-heat an egg and have it taste good? I would love to bring some eggs to work for lunch sometime.My favorite place to eat in New Orleans is Delachaise. It's a super cute wine bar that has amazing food! Try their mussels and the flank steak bruschetta! To die for!

Other than that I don't think I can offer much help. I really don't get to go out to eat a lot! :( You're welcome! That always bothered me, too. And no matter what anyone says, lemon juice + milk is just NOT the same as buttermilk. Hahahah... it may react the same way and work in a pinch, but it doesn't taste the same. :)I lived in Baton Rouge for nine years. :) It's changed a lot since I left in 2010, so I don't know any of the current restaurants. Chelsea's had some surprisingly good food there and I remember liking Bistro Byronz when it first opened up. 

The one thing that I LOVED and miss about Baton Rogue were the produce markets (Fresh Pickens and the one on Perkins, both run by Capital City Produce). We don't have anything like that here in New Orleans. I don't find farmers markets to have the same selection or prices as those two markets in BR. I miss them!

I'm hesitant to do "local" stuff because I'm not native (grew up in Michigan) and Cajun/Creole food is actually not my favorite. *gasp* I admit it.Anything you make for dinner that transports and reheats well makes a good lunch.  Chili, soups, stews.  Just make some extra at dinner, and pack it up for a lunch later in the week.Wow! That IS a lot. I'm sorry, cilantro is delicious, it's unfortunate that it's so expensive. Thanks for the response! I totally understand the whole roasted chicken thing. It's been one of my cooking nemeses for years. Last fall I discovered this guide and it was so simple and delicious. http://www.chow.com/recipes/30264-basic-whole-roasted-chicken 

I agree! It's an absolutely vital life skill that so many people lack. Knowing that I'm helping people become more self sufficient is beyond satisfying for me. :) 

My favorite place to eat in New Orleans is Delachaise! It's a wine bar, but they have the most amazing food. Their mussels are to die for, as well as the flank steak bruschetta.  http://www.thedelachaise.com/

I'm sure there are a million other great places, but I don't get to go out to eat often. Boo.Hi Beth. I love your site, I peruse it every time I make my weekly meal list. For me, it's the step-by-step photos that really sets it apart from other food/recipe blogs.

I really like the "How-to" section. The ["Divide and Freeze your chicken"](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/11/divide-freeze-chicken/) has been a game changer for me. I used to have frost/ice all over my meats. It seems like you add a new recipe every few days. Do you plan to add to the How-To section of the site?Yes, whole chickens are probably the most cost effective. But even I will admit that I hate working with them. Some butchers will cut them into pieces for you for free, I've heard. Next to that, large cuts of pork tend to be inexpensive and versatile, like pork shoulder. You can cook that in a slow cooker then use the pulled meat for a million different things (it freezes well, too).I have been vegetable gardening for 6 years now - mostly tomatoes, cucumbers, herbs and many greens. If you have questions about how to start growing a few veggies of your own, you can ask me. Even buying a growing herb plant (which is often the same prices as cut fresh herbs) will save you money. A lettuce seed pack can cost .99 and grow you over a hundred heads of lettuce! Even if you just have an apartment balcony, you can grow a little of your own food. (Food stamps can be used to purchase seeds and gardening supplies in most places!)Yes! I came here to recommend the same thing. I have good memories from being little of making popcorn in one of these with my dad, and my parents just finally replaced their 20+ year old whirley pop (or the equivalent).  This is one kitchen gadget I'll never be without! Can you get your hands on liquid smoke? You can usually add a drop or two of that to any dish to get a nice, strong smoky flavor. I haven't personally used it, but many readers have used it to supplement my recipes and talked about it in the comments. Also, check online retailers to see if you can get the smoked paprika or fire roasted tomatoes shipped to your area. The tomatoes might be too expensive to ship because they're heavy, but smoked paprika might not be too costly.Your post has been removed because it links directly to a recipe website.

Ha!Best way to make an egg sandwich: sandwich thins, two slices of ham, slice of cheese, one egg.

Crack the egg in a coffee mug and add 1 TB of water, whisk with a fork.  Microwave for one minute (cover with paper towel).  Depending on the coffee mug used, the egg should cook in to the perfect cylindrical shape for the sandwhich thins. 

Low cal and packed with protein to keep you full longer.Hahahah, I have a lot of recipe fails! :D Every time I go more than 3 or 4 days without posting a recipe, it's probably because I've had a recipe fail. And I guess they aren't always "fails" but just recipes that don't turn out spectacular and I feel like at this point I have a reputation to uphold. :P So, that happens maybe a few times a month?I've been dying to get creative with food without having to worry about cost. Having a splurge day is a fantastic idea! I wasn't sure how to do it, aside from creating a whole new blog, which would just be too much work. Thanks for that excellent idea!! I will probably do it. :)These are dangerous.  if I'm not careful I'll eat the whole bag in one sitting, in which case they're not cheap or healthy.I second this I love Copymethat Hahaha, "ease into sriracha" that's definitely the way you have to do it!
I feel like I've never been good at roasting a whole chicken. I don't know if I just don't like doing it or if I don't do it well. It would be nice to be able to just do it on a regular basis with no qualms. It's definitely a money saver, but I can't stand to do it.
I never watch cooking shows. Crazy, right? After cooking, photographing, blogging, and just generally being immersed in food all day, I don't want to watch food on TV. Hahaha.Yep! I have a small herb pot but haven't planted anything yet Beth, I went from being anxiety-ridden when it came to cooking, to very at ease thanks to your blog and cookbook. You've made it very easy for the beginners to gain confidence with the step-by-step instructions you provide. 

You make it seem totally easy to cook, and through your recipes, I'm teaching my 9-year old to cook, too. I really enjoyed your SNAP Challenge, and we use those recipes all the time, especially the Spinach Rice Breakfast Bowl.  Do you have plans to lay out the website into price ranges like you've done in your cookbook?Savory coconut rice is my absolute favorite! I'd eat it as the base of every meal if I could.
http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/12/coconut-rice-take-2/Hmmm... I don't watch a lot of TV, but I've always been a sucker for Law &amp; Order and I love Modern Family when I want something light and funny. I've also been a big fan of 30 Rock and The Office. I guess I love quirky comedies.Sea salt, a pepper grinder (freshly cracked is a whole different beast than pre-ground), oregano, cumin, cayenne, chili powder blend, curry... those probably get the most use out of my cabinet. :)The blog started out as a personal challenge and a creative outlet (I was really bored and really broke, so blogging gave me something to do). I quickly realized that it was helping people and that became the major motivation. I absolutely LOVE helping people discover that cooking is actually fun and satisfying, rather than a chore. Knowing that I've helped people cut their bills and make more satisfying (and often more nutritious) meals is beyond amazing. I feel like the luckiest person on earth to be able to do this.

Now that the blog has grown to its current size, it's also become a business. Running a blog this size is expensive, so I've had to make it into a business just to keep it going. I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit, so the business side is fun for me now, too. 

So, for me it's about helping people, having a creative outlet, and a building a career. :)
A kindred spirit! What do you usually prepare for your lunches on Sundays? Well, this is awesome!

Too bad Ziplist won't send me my recipe list. Didn't get to export it before they shut down. And the Epicurious connection didn't happen - my recipes didn't move over to that site. :(Not sure if i'm late to this but do you have any quick recipes or advice when preparing/cooking chicken? It takes me a while to make it + I'm terrible at cutting chickenBest way to get energy without consuming a lot of caffeine?That stinks!  Fresh cilantro where I am is very cheap.  Have you thought about getting a small herb pot and growing your own?Thank you for all your great recipes! I don't worry about the cost per se, but I like them because they are all so approachable. I'm a good cook, but sometimes I want something interesting, tasty and easy. I would love to see more Indian recipes (loved your naan recipe). So my question- did you follow Serial and do you think Adnan did it?I've recently learned that you can put popcorn kernels in the microwave! I throw mine in a brown paper bag with some coconut oil &amp; salt and microwave like the packaged stuff. Thank you!

I've had other people ask about the allergy thing, too, and honestly I don't know where to start! There are just so many food allergies. A lot of the recipes are already friendly to individual food allergies, even if not labeled as an "allergy friendly" recipe, so maybe I could just compile or do roundups of previous recipes that are friendly to each particular allergy?

Hmmm, that might work! Thanks for getting my wheels turning. :)

And nope, never baked the naan on a pizza stone. I don't have one. :(Greetings Beth! 

Thanks to Budget Bytes I've started with Indian food, so far Tikka Masala, Dal Nirvana and Naan. My family is not very adventurous with food so it was a huge deal to cook and love a new cuisine! 

What dish would be a good complement to the dal and naan next? Request: 

Can you please include nutritional information for your recipes?Wrap in plastic wrap and then put in a freezer/storage bag. Get as much air out of the bag as possible to help prevent freezer burn.

And when you go to cook it, just cook it frozen. Look up America's Test Kitchen video of cooking frozen steak.Ahhh I'm so excited about this! I've been following your blog for years and years, probably since 2010. I just wanted to tell you that I've fallen in love with cooking because of you! Being a single gal, I want something fast, easy, and delicious. You seem to hit the nail on the head every time.Thank you!!

I'm blogging full time now. The size of the site has gotten to the point where it takes full time dedication to keep it running. Luckily, I was able to optimize my monetization strategies last year so that I can afford to do this full time. Just by visiting the site you are helping support me and the effort, and I thank you for that! :) 

My food heros? I love Alton Brown because I love his science approach and I love Mark Bittman for his simple approach to food.

That's a great suggestion for searching the site! I'll take note of it for my next redesign. :)Hi Beth. I am new to your site, but I love how it is organized and I do see it recommended frequently. I wanted to ask you, what do you feel your greatest achievement is regarding your food blog/cookbook? Conversely, what has been your biggest disappointment thus far?Hi Beth, Love your work. A lot of my staples in kitchen come from your blog and book!

I'm going on vacation to New Orleans in March (yay!) 

I wanted to ask what are your favourite places to eat in the city?

Also, are there any must-try local specialties and where should we get them?Oh, and parties... Hmmm... Usually we do more drinking than eating at parties, so I just pick up some tortilla chips and salsa. hahaha... I don't know if I ever really cook for parties. :)Honestly, I don't snack much. I'll sometimes make popcorn in the evening (stove top tastes way better than microwave and only costs pennies). If I need a snack to bring to work it's usually a piece of fruit or I'll fill a small dish with yogurt and some dry oats. I pretty much never buy pre-packaged snacks. They're expensive. :PBeth, I just want to say thank you for your tip on freezing buttermilk cubes. I just read that at your site, and that's going to be so helpful to me. In the past, I've just tried to cook several buttermilk recipes during the same week so I could use what I had bought.Hmmm, it sounds like it must not have risen much? Maybe it needed more warmth. You can try putting it in a slightly warm oven as it rises. Also, if it's not kneaded enough it won't be strong enough to hold in the gases and rise properly, so maybe try kneading it a bit longer.Well, I knew I had to make a change when I wasn't making ends meet and I had cut out every other source of extra spending. Food was the only category that I had left that was even negotiable.

The first time I calculated a recipe cost, the lightbulb went off. I saw how one ingredient can drastically skew the cost of an entire recipe. That allowed me to start planning and designing recipes based on ingredient cost and I learned to make meals that had a lot of volume AND flavor, without costing an arm and a leg. 

If you want to try your hand at costing out a recipe, which I highly suggest everyone do at least once, here is my tutorial: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/07/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/Helsinki, Finland. A bunch is over two euros. The two Chinese grocery stores I go to (including the one I mentioned) take plastic as well, albeit with a $20 minimum purchase. Typically I don't have trouble going above that $20 because it's kind of a trek for me too, so I usually only go when I need a bunch of stuff. Well, I haven't ever done it! ;) I've only bought steak a few times and when I did, I cooked it immediately. Hi Beth! Created an account just so I could ask you something! Longtime fan here who has lived in Baton Rouge... curious about how you like it there. 

Do you have any favorite places in town that you like to go, food or otherwise? 

I remember being pretty frustrated by the lack of grocery options but the farmer's market was always good. 

I'd love to see you introduce some fresh farmer's market produce in your recipes, and perhaps incorporate a little local flavor! I'd love to see you do a barbecue shrimp or something like that. Thank you for everything you do! :DCheeeeeeese. If I have extra money and I want something "fancy" or to really spruce up a meal, I'll get a nice cheese. OR I'll go for some sort of fruit, vegetable, or fresh herb that is normally too expensive (fresh basil, a fresh lemon, etc.). Those add a lot to a meal, but aren't always affordable for every day use.Hi Beth! Your site has been a tremendous help to me over the past couple of years in providing delicious and frugal recipes as well as teaching me the basics of cooking. It's an incredibly useful skill (one of the most important skills to have as a self-sufficient individual, I think) and I don't want to sound too melodramatic but you're really making a difference in peoples' lives with your work.

I believe I read somewhere that you're living/lived in New Orleans. I'm from the Lafayette area and I only visit NOLA a few times a year. I was wondering if you could share your absolute favorite places eat in NOLA. I'm sure you won't have any trouble narrowing it down or anything :)I personally wouldn't eat it every day. :P  I'm not a nutritional professional, so I shouldn't advise you either way, but I'm pretty sure the research shows that lunch meats are not good for your health because of their high sodium and nitrate levels. Unfortunately, I don't have any references prepared for you to read on the subject. If you have specific questions, I'd suggest getting in touch with a Registered Dietitian.Any brand name food products that you use every time, besides Sriracha? :)

Your book promo video was awesome, so hopefully it all comes together eventually. Totally understand about being private though!I've been reading BudgetBytes for ages now, and it's pretty much completely replaced all of my other recipe sources. Your recipes seem to have just the right balance of simplicity and quality of outcome for me. However, since I've gotten on your site, I seem to have turned into a vegetarian - a vegetarian who primarily eats stew. This is probably a good thing, I know, but I'd like to have meat again one day. 


In terms of cost, deliciousness, and stretchability, and laziness, what's the best cut and species of meat, in your experience? Whole chickens?Hi Beth, love your site and your recipes! I'm not from the US so sometimes I can't get my hand on some products. The ones I feel I miss most is 'smoked' stuff, smoked paprika or that different kind of canned tomatoes you use. Have you got any suggestions on what a good alternative may be to still get this American style smokey flavor?Beth! I love your blog and have been using recipes from it for a loooong time.

One question, though: Why are there so few fish/seafood recipes?It's not a silly question, at all! I almost wrote a blog post about that once upon a time, but never finished it.

I like to choose vegetables that are more sturdy (not soft, low water content) because they last longer in the fridge. Think "crunchy" vegetables. Prepping them ahead of time but keeping them stored separately helps them stay good in the fridge, then you can just assemble each day in minutes. Hearty greens like kale last longer than soft things like spinach or mixed greens, but if you buy them in a big tub they'll last longer than the kind that are in a bag.

Those are my quick tips! Maybe I WILL write a post about it! :)I agree. I'm usually terrible about eating leftovers. However for my new years resolution I've been preparing my week of lunches every Sunday. Somehow mentally I consider them "premade meals" not "leftovers" and it's much easier.I am a traditionalist, I usually have two eggs, sunny side up, and three slices of bacon with whole wheat toast. It takes a total of 15 minutes to make (I also prepare my french pressed coffee during that time), and 5 minutes to clean up. I enjoy having this breakfast, because it is one of the few breakfasts that keep full and energized throughout the day. Oatmeal is great, but I tend to be hungry an couple of hours later. hey beth, I love your blog. You have helped me learn to be more creative in the kitchen and very easily taught me to do things I never thought I could do. With that out of the way.

How often do you experiment with a recipe that doesn't end up making it to the blog?

p.s. the book is great too!Hahah, my favorite splurges are cold cereal, frozen pizza, and maybe fancy cheese! 

I know, I know... I need to make videos! That's the future of blogging. I'm super private, though, so I've been hesitant to share that much of "me" with the world. Also, there's a lot to learn about equipment and production, so it will be a big project. I probably will end up doing it, though. :P

I actually don't use a recipe organizer. If I want to save something for future reference, I just bookmark it in my browser. Love your site, Beth! I'm a college student that loves to cook, and I've shared a bunch of your recipes with my friends who were fairly new to cooking and they've loved them.

My question: I know your site obviously focuses on budget-friendly cooking, but would you ever consider doing a splurge day? Maybe one day a week where you post a recipe that's a little pricier than your typical fare -- it doesn't have to break the bank, though! I'd love to see what you'd concoct on a slightly larger budget.The trick to cheap eating is to know where to go for what. I regulalry make the "circuit" on a few stores. The differences can be quite large, even without specials. 

For example. I have a green grocer across the street were I live right now. A head of red leaf lettuce sells there for $3, $3.50 at the Safeway up the street, or I can walk two blocks down to the no-frills where they sell the same head of lettuce for $1.50.

This is true for pretty much everything. So I suggest to keep the pricing for the items you buy most often in your head and compare as you go shopping.Honestly, I don't keep track. I just go by the rule of thumb that if I can't smell the herb or spice when I sniff the jar, it's probably not going to do a very good job of flavoring my food.When you're first starting out, it will all seem very overwhelming. It will definitely take time to learn, so don't get frustrated or overwhelmed. My best advice is to be observant. Look around and take note of prices. Notice what is less expensive and more expensive. Look at how different forms of one vegetable will be different prices (organic, conventional, pre-cut, single portions, etc.). Produce is often sold in several forms, so give the produce department a good look through because they won't all be shelved in the same spot. You'll learn as you go and you WILL make mistakes, but those will help you learn.

As far as what is in or out of season, that will depend heavily on your location. Watching the prices every time you go to the store will help you learn this. You can also find charts online that might help, so try googling something like "What produce is in season". Buzzfeed also does some awesome round ups each season that lists the produce items that are in season and gives some recipes you can make with them. &lt;3 Buzzfeed!First of all I love your website. I never create a menu for the week without consulting it first. You have really helped me to expand my cooking abilities and try new things. There are so many recipes on your site that have become a staple to our diet. Also, your recipes helped me ease my husband into Sriracha. Now I'm pretty sure he couldn't live without it. Thank you for being awesome. 

Do you have a recipe, meal or cuisine that is either a goal or something you wish to master? 

Do you watch cooking shows? If so which ones? Thanks for the advice, this sound like a great tactic! I've been thinking too much about preparing meals for near immediate consumption. I am obsessed with your Louisiana red beans and rice recipe. Thank you for all your tasty &amp; affordable recipes! 

What's your favourite way to use coconut milk (or cream)? I have cans of both that have been sitting in my pantry for way too long!Oh, and I usually freeze in single serving portions, so I can just reheat in the microwave. I keep a LOT of my food in the freezer to make them quickly reheatable. :) I find the things that work best are soups, stews, pasta dishes, and casseroles. I put together a list of my top ten freezable dishes a while back, although I could probably add to it now!

Here is the list: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/04/top-10-freezer-meals-2/Where do you live? I'm just curious, here I think a bunch of fresh cilantro is about 50 cents (US). I've never thought of it as an expensive ingredient, so I'm curious to know where it's so expensive. Check out [Eat The Seasons](http://www.eattheseasons.com/). It is a great resource for what is in season! Hahaha "Voonderpot" :) Love it!

This morning for breakfast I actually had one of the Nacho Taters that I made yesterday. :P Weird, I know. But I love savory food for breakfast!

http://www.budgetbytes.com/2015/02/nacho-taters/Hahaha I love this question. My favorite splurges are cold cereal and frozen pizza. I normally don't buy cold cereal because it's expensive and I can't stop myself from eating the whole box. After I was done writing my book, I was SO sick of cooking AND eating, that all I wanted was cold cereal. True story.

I decided to splurge yesterday and buy a box of cereal (maple brown sugar frosted mini-wheats, I think) and got home only to find that I accidentally left that bag at the checkout. I was SO SAD. I was really looking forward to that cereal. Ha!Hi, Beth, I love your blog! Two recipes of yours have become a real standby for me when entertaining a small group or looking for a quick dinner.

[Oven Roasted Autumn Medley](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/09/oven-roasted-autumn-medley/) : sometimes with spicy andouille

and

[Turkey and Stuffing Casserole](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/11/turkey-stuffing-casserole/) : except I normally do it with a divided chicken and once did it with halved cornish game hens.

I have followed your blog for years and look forward to more recipes! 

Random Question: What shows are you watching?What are your must-have-on-hand spices?I grew up in a big family (7 total) and my mom was always cooking. Fast food gets really expensive when there are a lot of mouths to feed, so cooking was pretty much the only option. I spent a lot of time just hanging out in the kitchen because of that. I've always found it fun because it's like a mix of science and art.  :)Ooooh I love your blog! I'd like to ask: what has your blog meant for you and what does it mean for you right now? Bit of an abstract question, but I wonder what role it plays in your life! Thank YOU! Your encouragement and support is more appreciated than you know. :DI usually make 1-3 recipes per week, depending on what they are (is it a single pot dish or a "main" and sides?) I usually eat that for 3-4 days and then supplement the last few days with meals from my freezer. When I cook a recipe, I always pop a few portions of it into my freezer, so I always have a rotating stock of reheatable dishes to choose from. Of course, not every meal freezes well, but enough of them do to keep a good selection going.Hi Beth,
Thanks so much for your hard work! I love your blog and I just got your cookbook for Christmas. Your salsa chicken casserole is a staple around our house. 

I know you do a lot of vegetarian recipes, but I was wondering if maybe you could do an allergy series at some point. I have an allergy to dairy (not lactose intolerant, something else unknown). I usually just omit the cheese, but it'd be cool to see some meat and vegetable recipes specifically geared around this. Likewise, I know a lot of others have allergies (celiac, nuts, whatever) and I think it would be neat if you did an allergy challenge the way you did the SNAP challenge. For example: week 1 - avoid ingredient x; week 2 - avoid ingredient y, and so on. Many people think dietary restrictions necessitate expensive cooking, but it doesn't have to be that way. I think you'd be able to get that message across :)

Thanks again for all you do! 

P.S. Have you ever tried baking your naan on a pizza stone? What temp would you set your oven to?Beth, I want to say that your site has been a godsend since I found out about it last year, to the point that 99% of the time I don't go hunting for recipes anywhere else when it comes time to plan my week. 

Saving money isn't even my main goal (but it helps!). I mainly wanted to cook more for health reasons, and I think it would be better for our culture and our environment if we all did more of it. The layout and apparent philosophy to the site is great for this. No other recipe site has every step photographed and is as free from pretense as yours is. Just want to say thanks and keep it up!

Questions:

* Honestly, I haven't cracked your book open too much, as the site is so much more useful. My wife and I got your book simply because we wanted to support what you do. How much time does it all take you a week and far does this gig go to supporting you? Have you considered putting up a donation button or setting yourself up on www.patreon.com?

* Who are your food heroes? Have you read much from Micheal Pollan?

* As much as I love your site, I would really like to have a text list of recipes somewhere, for ctrl+f search-ability or just being able to skim down a list. Does it exist? Would you consider adding it if not?Yep, I've got a full blog reader full of stuff ranging from food to fashion, home decor, and science. I put together a short list of a few of them here: http://www.budgetbytes.com/around-web/[Copy Me That](http://www.copymethat.com/recipes/) is fantastic (and created by a redditor!).  They have a toolbar option and also a mobile app.  It's been a lifesaver!What's your go-to for snacks? I'm usually eating granola bars/fruit, but I'd love to see some alternatives here.

What's your dish for parties?

Thanks for doing this!That's one of those skills that gets easier as you go. I definitely couldn't do that when I started the blog, but now it's second nature. To build a recipe I tend to start at the bottom or base and decide what my cheap filler ingredient will be (usually pasta, rice, beans, or something like that). Add to that some vegetables, meat, a sauce, and maybe somethings special like cheese or nuts and you've got a meal! :)Hey Beth, love the blog and the book! I've been using your recipes for sometime. I just made the honey wheat bread a couple of days ago and it's great but super dense. Do you have any foolproof methods for getting a fluffier texture? Hey Beth! What was your kind of "lightbulb" moment when it came to your eating habits? What made you realize that you had to find a better way to feed yourself inexpensively, without sacrificing flavor?

Also, I just wanted to say that I use the honey sriracha sauce that you made on [this recipe](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/12/honey-sriracha-chicken-thighs/) on almost everything. I use it as a noodle sauce, a marinade, and even on wings. It's freaking amazing.The sad thing about blogging is that I always need new material to post, so I rarely get to remake previous recipes that I love. I can't say that I have an all time favorite because there were just too many good ones, but when I need something easy, delicious, and cheap, I tend to make some sort of variation of this Penne Pasta with Sausage and Greens: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/09/snap-challenge-penne-pasta-sausage-greens/Tips for freezing steak?  I don't eat a lot of pie, but I prefer desserts that have either tart or bitterness to balance the sweetness. So, for pie it would probably be something like strawberry rhubarb, cherry, or key lime. :)Where do you like to splurge in the kitchen?No Frills is a bit out of reach for me walking, though I may find my way to sucking it up if the difference is that big. 

I got in touch with a meat seller in Kensington and they've offered to show me the ropes of meat buying if I make my way down there, so I'll probably do that this weekend. Thanks for the solid suggestions.Is deli meat bad for you? Should I not eat sandwiches for lunch every day?Wow, who inspires me? I've been trying to think of an answer since you posted this 20 minutes ago and I'm a little at a loss. There probably isn't one person in particular, but anyone I meet who overcomes challenges or negativity in their life. Those are two very difficult and powerful accomplishments and they inspire me to do the same.

Tips for shopping for a meal plan as opposed to a single meal: You have to be deliberate. Actually sit down and plan it out. Pick specific recipes, list ingredients on hand and what you need to buy. Pick recipes that include similar ingredients to reduce leftovers and shop your pantry/fridge/freezer to see what needs to be used up first.I feel like if I go the Chinatown route, I'll need to start carrying cash. Is this the case? I prefer to use my credit card for all my purchases if I can help it (I keep track of spending via online banking).I throw together very similar chickpea stir-fries. So many delicious variations! One of my favorite meals, for sure.

I'm a sucker for lots of spice -- coriander, cumin and/or curry powder. We always eat these with greek yogurt or sour cream, and lime if we have it!Also a cooking newbie here. How do I make a salad? I know that sounds like a silly question, but from grocery shopping to chopping vegetables to storing, how do I do it?Sounds delicious, shame that fresh cilantro costs more than all the other ingredients combined :(I've been making your recipes for a long time, thanks so much!

* Given that you're budget-conscious, what do you love to splurge on (food or otherwise)?
* Why don't you do more videos? Missing out on those YouTube dollas! Haha.
* What do you use to organize your recipes? Now that Ziplist is gone, and after trying a few apps, I still haven't found the perfect solution. I'm currently using Evernote.How long do you keep your spices?I'm a total newbie not only in the kitchen but in the grocery store as well. I want to buy produce but don't know where to start. How do I know what's in season? How do you choose a head of lettuce or a container of strawberries or a bag of spinach? What makes a good apple different from a bad apple?Hi Beth!  My wife and I are big fans.  We have a 19 month old and our days are very short due to early bedtime, so we really like that your recipes are simple and quick.  We make a lot of food ahead to keep in the freezer in order to save time.  Which recipes are your favorite for not only making ahead, but reheating quickly?  We freeze casseroles and stuff like that, but they always seem to take an hour to bake, even when they've thawed in the fridge.  Do you have any advice for recipes that wouldn't take as long to reheat?I love these type of easy recipesHi Beth! I love your site. A few of your recipes are staples at my house now, especially Italian Wonderpot (We call it Voonderpot). 
  
What did you have for breakfast this morning?Hi Beth!

About a month ago, my husband and I decided we needed to reboot the way we were eating. Too much processed  'convenience food' and not enough 'real' food.  An easy but vicious cycle to get into with two toddlers. Our spending sucked, the food was blah, and we just generally felt gross.  I found your blog about 3 weeks ago and have been cooking from it almost exclusively since then. I have yet to find a recipe that we don't like. We're spending less on food and eating so much better than we have in quite a while, so thanks so much for the kick in the butt to get us to quit making excuses. 

For my question:

What's your favorite indulgence? When you've had it up to here with responsible grocery buying and are ready to really splurge on ingredients and make a fabulous meal or dessert, what's your guilty pleasure?I know you have a background in nutrition, but what got you interested in cooking in the first place? Do your parents cook a lot?Hi Beth I don't really have a question just wanted to say your site taught me to cook well as a college student and has provided me healthy, delicious recipes AND saved me lots of money to this day! I also purchased your book and try to recommend your site to any friends who are struggling with figuring out how to cook for themselves. Thanks so much for everything that you do!About how many different meals do you prepare to eat a week? How do you keep the meals you make fresh? 

I currently make three different meals each Sunday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'm worried that what I make on Sunday, might not always be safe to eat by the next weekend. What are your strategies for keeping your meals safe to eat?I've followed your site for a couple of years now, and many of my favorite recipes come from it (dragon noodles....omg).  Thank you for what you do : )

Do you follow any food blogs?  I think a great idea for this would be to find a way to use leftovers for lunch the next day. So, using the basic ingredients from the previous meal and making something different for the following day. I hate when I finish a meal with a lot of food leftover, so maybe it would be cool to find a way to create fun and new recipes for this purpose. I think a lot of people would help out with this, and also enjoy using this site! I'm always amazed at people who can look at a few ingredients and say "Hmm, let's make something from them" without needing to consult cookbooks or recipes.  How do you formulate a recipe?Do you have an all-time favorite recipe of your own?

What are your kitchen staples, something you make at least a few times a month?Try unreal.candy. 

http://getunreal.com

By far the best 'fake' candy out there. Give it a try!What is your favourite type of pie?Beth, you have inspired so may people to eat healthy food on a budget. 

Who inspires you?

What are some tips for shopping for a meal plan instead of shopping for a single meal?

Microwave yes. toaster oven noDo you have access to a microwave at work?  Toaster oven?

If you're able to reheat foods at work, the possibilities are nearly endless.Eh you'll be fine. Get a fridge and start small and you'll be in good shape in no time. If you have any friends that you know know how to cook, ask them for a lesson and you'll buy the ingredients and alcohol.

My bf pretty much only knew how to cook meat on the grill and cook eggs when I first started dating him. Honestly, you could probably get pre-packaged salad packs, a pack of steaks or chicken breasts, a loaf of bread, some fruit, a few russet potatoes and a few eggs and start with just simple meals. Just think of something you want to eat and then look up the recipe and go buy the ingredients and tools and give it a shot. The Internet is full of advice on simple cooking. You're going to waste money and food in the beginning but that's what we all did and you'll eventually get the hang of it.Looks great and I hope she gets a lot of good questions! #####&amp;#009;

First off I'm on mobile so forgive me please. Where are you at in the country and what is your living situation (apartment, house, can by the river)? Second, start little. A sauce pan, measuring spoons, an individual sized thing of milk and half a box of annies mac and cheese can be dinner. After acquiring a fridge, buy a half gallon of milk, its cheaper, lactose free keeps longer if you aren't a big milk drinker. Target sells 6 packs of individual frozen veggies that steam in the bag. Jar of sauce plus rice, pasta or quinoa plus protein plus veggie is dinner when you get a little more comfortable. Even start with like minute rice boil in the bag or even the precooked packs. 

Start small, don't get discouraged, there will be meals you make at first that suck. You will get better. Three cookbooks I recommend How to Boil Water https://www.amazon.com/dp/0696226863/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_8CJ2ub16JTM6H , Just 5 Things: Easy Gourmet Cooking with Just a Handful of Ingredients https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003XU7W4Q/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_dEJ2ub0RP9NQV , The Complete Cooking For Two Cookbook https://www.amazon.com/dp/1936493837/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_WFJ2ub041R713 . Use in this order for learning. Again sorry for the crap formatting, I'm on mobile. If you have any questions feel free to pm me, I would consider myself a healthy, sometimes lazy, fairly cheap cook at home. I love egg fried rice, I will definitely try that. Thanks! Okay so you may never see this but dude buy a piece of fish throw on olive oil salt and pepper (salt and pepper packs can be stolen from McDonalds if you're not keen on getting a $1 shaker set) wrap that shit in tin foil and bake at 350 until desired (rare medium ect.) I like mine well done so that's somewhere around 10minuets. That's a one person meal for like $6, in stuff you need to buy which is olive oil, seasoning, and tin foil. And you don't need to keep it cause you're not buying a 12 pack of fish just a single serving. No refrigerator necessary. If you're feeling fancy get a plate out cook that fish and microwave some uncle bens rice. Put them on that plate you got out ans Boom! Dinner for one. Did I just blow your mind? Probably. Youre welcome. I've been looking at these, but haven't been able to determine if they'll actually cook food, or if they're only good for reheating.  Any thoughts on that?Thank you for this detailed post! I'm definitely going to try this out :-)Thank You!Center of the US?If you have a little oil - vegetable or olive oil is my go-to - it sort of flash-boils the water off the frozen veggies so they cook straight from frozen pretty nicely. What I do is this:

- Heat skillet on medium-high with enough oil to just coat the bottom. 
- Add frozen broccoli, stir fry mix, whatever and agitate until everything is uniformly coated in a little oil. 
- Let everything get back up to temperature, agitate a couple minutes. 
- Drain the liquid that melted off the veggies (a combination of ice melt, "sweat" from the vegetables, and oil - I just tilt the skillet over the sink and hold everything in with a lid or spatula) and throw it back on the heat.
- Add seasonings of choice, cook to desired consistency. 

Crank up the heat if you want a little brown on the outside, just depends on personal preference. I like to do my broccoli until it's just warm, but I'll cook zucchini and onions and other stuff until it's basically charcoal just because I like it.That may be my favorite whoops link everYum, this sounds great! Thanks for the recipe!America's Test Kitchen had an episode showing how to make Wild Rice &amp; Mushroom Soup that looked good, but I haven't tried it.  Here's a [recipe link](http://www.food.com/recipe/wild-rice-and-mushroom-soup-493380).

There's a video too but you might need to be an ATK/Cook's Country member to view it.I aim to strike a balance in my nutrients. Protein is more expensive then fat, fat more expensive then nutrient rich vegetable, and all that more expensive then carbs. So I expect to pay more per calorie for chicken breast then rice, but I can't expect to be nourished from rice alone. Have you tried turning leftover meal parts into new meals, example you had chicken with broccoli and rice for dinner, next day toss leftover chicken with rice, peas soy sauce and an egg for fried rice? Or died that mentally bother you as well? 

Edit:didn't read far enough downThat's a good point - hadn't considered that.  In practice I can't see us getting into it more than a couple times per week.  Still a solid point though.Oh, for sure, leftover spaghetti is way better the next day, and occasionally some other stuff. I usually don't make enough for leftovers, actually, since I can barely open the container without gagging. :( I never bring home leftovers from restaurants.Ditto, their produce prices are awesome. The two of us can go through mad amounts of broccoli, Costco has 3 lb precut bags for less than $5 here. You can't buy that amount in heads at the normal store. From your description I'd say you're quite above average in today's economy. You mention your hobbies. In another comment you mention the cost of ingredients + cookware vs. eating out. Put it this way, you probably bought a fair amount of quality camping/outdoors equipment over the years. Think about how often you use them. One could rent equipment from REI, etc. but you know that's not cost effective at all for someone who partakes in these hobbies semi-regularly. Compare this to eating. You eat everyday. You will never not eat. You will eat until you die. Why rent (eat out) when it is much more efficient to own (cook)?My leftovers are better than what I eat initially. More time to sit in da juice. I mean restaurant leftovers can be nasty if it's nasty food in the first place. But home cooked leftovers are usually better.I don't know why you're getting down voted.  I live out of a mini fridge and it's great.  You keep less crap in your fridge. You also don't like leftovers so it would be ideal.  It would keep your electricity cost down and it will also force you to eat your food. Food wot stay as long in your fridge so you have a lower chance of spoilage. There are mini fridges with decent sizes freezers so I would look into those.  You need a mother.Oh sorry, I missed that point.  Could make it on demand I guess, but yes.I was mostly proud of the dressing tasting so good! haha I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed and crossed my fingersGet a fridge and get uses to left overs.

Check out /r/frugalHow many servings is this?When I was first on my own I realized I had no cooking skills, although I was gifted some pots and pans, and also was blowing allll my monies on eating out. I also HATE leftovers.

I would tackle dinner first.  Lunches out are cheaper, and if you get overwhelmed you'll quit. 

Invest in:
1. A small fridge
2. A crockpot
3. A sauce pot
4. A frying pan
5. A cookie sheet
6. Some high heat cooking utensil (like a silicon spatula and wooden spoon, for instance)

For starters, try planning 2-3 meals a week at home.  I get meat on sale (either purchased and frozen the previous week, or I check the sales papers before I go) and use http://www.allrecipes.com to plan the rest of the meal.

When you are getting started, spices are going to be a HUGE up front cost, so if you buy garlic and italian spices on week 1, try to find other recipes that use those in week 2, etc.  

Once you build up your pantry, (flour, sugar, regular spices, etc), then you will only need to buy the fresh ingredients each week. Meat, cheese, fruits and veggies.  

I currently feed a family of 3 for roughly $200/week (but it has taken me roughly 10 years of learning to cook, trying new things, and cutting back gradually to get here.  I now make all meals at home, we almost never buy bread products, because I make them, etc)Yep, I worked at Sam's Club for a half a year or so, and it was by far the worst job I have ever had. I was a cashier, and the amount of pressure they put on you to sell credit cards and upgraded membership cards is just horrible. I would never recommend working at Sam's Club to ANYBODY. Yep, I worked at Sam's Club for a half a year or so, and it was by far the worst job I have ever had.

Yes that's the secret sauce. Google other recipes, too. I know when I looking for the real movie butter topping, there were a bunch of people who had different methods. 

I do want to say, don't fuck around with any consumer products, like Kernel-Seasonings and the Orville's Butter. They don't produce that real movie theatre taste or smell.. even though they promise it. 

Good luck and post your result!This sounds delicious, I added it to my recipe list and will try it within the next two weeks! in Thailand, every shop that cooks chicken does this and everyone is fine. I do as well at home. This is over cautious and not necessarily true.Nah, it's just gelatinzed starch with a couple of hard bits here and there.  It's what people do to it after that makes it unhealthy. ;)checking in from Thailand; this isn't Thai without fish sauce, coconut milk, and chilis.I think one goldfish would be more than 150 calories for 55 fish! Some get up to 12'' long...He doesn't even have a fridge to put the soylent into.macadamias; they are super delicious, crunchy, and they are a lot of calories for the energy, and healthy!this reminded me to dig into my soup; its been in the fridge over a week. will report back if I dieI second this. I used to live in Toronto on a budget: the Chinese supermarkets are great for cheap meat, Kensington market sells some good seasonal veg and no frills is perfect for everything else. i mean even counting that he eats out all the time 800 a month is pretty incredible... i literally eat out every day and spend maybe 400 a month (caveat - i do a lot of eating at the school's hospital cafeteria)Well, I don't blame you for not financing a $2000 fridge, because that's just ridiculous. Get one for $500 or so. Take the $500 out of your food budget and it will force you to start cooking that month! Good luck.Also, if the initial cost is too inundating, check out goodwill, or IKEA if used weirds you out. buy something lower cost at first and work your way up to the nicer stuff. you won't be as upset if you accidentally melt a spatula (not that I've ever done that...)in the unlikely event you get sick from eating refrigerated food that is 3 days old, your body will strengthen itself and you won't in the future unless you are immunocompromisedno. if you have an extreme immune disorder you may want to follow all of the US food guidelines (I am not sure about that I am not a doctor), but most other countries completely ignore those rules and everyone survives miraculously. Food will regularly be sold from restaurants that has been sitting out for a few days (not even refrigerated) no problem. If it smells and tastes good, its good.I just came to say that I've been there sir.Ok, firstly, dude buy a fridge. 

You need it to keep your groceries in order. 

Secondly, it's hard for us to write a shopping list when we don't know what you like to eat.

And thirdly, I was in a 100% eat out scenario for a while when I had a kitchen problem. DO NOT SWITCH TO HEALTHY FOOD IN ONE WEEK AFTER EATING OUT 100% Your body goes into some type of shock and gives you horrible digestive issues, so go 50/50 and then a week or two later make the full jump.I know! I want to help him too. I almost want to say, "PM me any time you have a cooking question too." OP-as a matter of fact-Go ahead and do that if you have a cooking question. If you can make it to the Chinese markets in Chinatown they are dramatically cheaper for produce. Meats are also decently priced. My personal fave is on the east side of Spadina just south of Dundas. Such a good selection of Asian stuff too. Soy crumbles have less fat than ground beef--I like to mix them with beans occasionally for tacos, burritos, etc. You can always add a little brown rice, too!Chili is really easy too. Thanks for the advice, I will have to explore those options. But before then I'll have to find someone with a truck and a couple people to help me move it. I don't have a lot of friends in the area :(https://www.youtube.com/user/CookingShooking is a newish Youtube channel in the same vein started by a very enterprising and talented teen, which I think is really, really awesome :)It's generally considered unsafe. It puts you at risk for infection. If you are healthy, like over 7 years old but under 50/60, and not pregnant, you will probably be ok - maybe some mild diarrhea, likely asymptomatic. 

But why put yourself at risk for infection?Yo dude. My dearest mother got me a cookbook called "cooking comically". Its awesome. I'm normally like you, just eating out everywhere but this has got super easy recipes with all the ingredients. And its really good. You should check it out. Its like a long rage comic bookI make homemade granola on Sundays, and it lasts me through the week. You can control the sugar content if you make it yourself, and add as many nuts as you want for some added satiety. Serve it with milk or over yogurt, and it's something I look forward to every morning.

[Teochew style porridge](http://kitchentigress.blogspot.sg/2012/07/teochew-fish-porridge-video.html)Super stupid question here. How do you manage to keep greens/herbs fresh 2 weeks at a time, or do those count as "we need it for dinner"? We go through them pretty quickly (We have rabbits in addition to loving salads) - but I still feel like the last few days of those two weeks wouldn't have the most beautiful greens in the world. You're probably going to need to take baby steps.  I'd recommend starting with frozen foods. Good quality frozen foods. Prepared dinners will save you money and be convenient for you.  Get them from trader joes or whole foods and store them in your freezer. It will still be cheaper than eating out every day. Some of these dishes will need to be warmed up in a pot, pan or in the oven. This will get you accustomed to using your kitchen, and familiarize you with utensils, cooking temperatures, etc.  Building a level of comfort with and habitually using your kitchen will prepare you for your next advance: marinating and sauteing simple dishes. You will definitely need a set of pots and pans and a large cookie sheet to get started. A decent 10 to 12 piece non stick set is around 100 bucks at homegoods and cookie sheets can be found at the grocery store. Dont want to clean them? Get the throwaway aluminum pans. Whatever. For now, just get into the kitchen more.  I helped my husband change his habits from a peanut butter sandwich in times of hunger to one who boils pierogies and bakes up some frozen garlic bread. At least it's a quick hot meal, and its not slathered in grease for 5x the cost at a restaurant. I hope this helps you. I buy dried edamame in the healthy "hippie" food section of my grocery store. If you can't find that, try looking for frozen. Eating it plain is good too. I imagine if you cracked the egg and put it in something it wouldn't explode.

I really just wanted to tell everyone that if you microwave an egg in its shell it will explode, because it's a fun game. Also did you know that its really really difficult to break an egg if you push on it end to end?

Egg facts.That's like the mentality that buying a prebuilt computer is cheaper and better than building it yourself.  

Knowing that doing it yourself is cheaper, and better, is what will help too.Youtube is a good place to look to vegetarian channels

Well, I often see used fridges in great condition in craigslist. It seems like a lot of people remodeling just want to get rid if them. Also try free cycle, if there's an active group in your area. I'm no germaphobe, but I don't eat (typically) eat leftovers. The smell of "old" (which could simply mean that it's sat out long enough after cooking to be room temperature) food makes me sick, unfortunately. :(Great thank youa thermal cooker can also work. kinda pricy but it works and works wellinstead of rolling the thing and freezing. consider rolling in a good wax paper and freeze the meat and microwaveable stuff. then when it comes to taking your burrito to eat just nuke the filling and add the good stuff like sour creme and guac. Don't forget to poke the yolk. Just keep decreasing the time till it stops exploding? Usually takes 1-2mins for my microwave.This is how I make popcorn with the Whirley Pop:

* Turn on heat, add coconut oil and flavacol salt. For a big batch, a big spoonful of the coconut oil (its solid at room temp) and a good amount of the flavacol...i'm using that shaker so like 6 shakes. Let coconut oil melt. 

* Once its mostly melted, add popcorn. Start turning handle nice-and-easy so it spins and spreads everything around evenly. Don't stop spinning until popcorn is done popping. 

* Then start microwaving the butter topping in the microwave, do like 1/4 cup in a small glass or mason. 

* Once the popcorn is finished popping, pour it into a bowl and pour the heated butter topping over the popcorn. Mix it around and possibly add more flavacol salt to taste.Hi, I didn't down vote you but I believe the "carbs/insulin makes you fat" theory championed by taubes has been widely debunked in recent years. eg. http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.sg/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html

For twenty dollars a week, roughly, AUD, you are given grocery lists and recipes.

If you have a mandolin slicer you're all set, if not just slice as thin as possible. You can bake them at 300 ~15/20 mins. I like to throw them in a skillet over high heat and some peanut oil, either way sprinkle a punch of salt and pepper an a light dusting of garlic powder. Sometimes I'll throw some cayenne pepper in as well. And if I bake them I drizzle a little evvo first

It is never too late to start nurturing yourself!  

Think of all of your favourite food - chances are good a few months from now you can make those dishes yourself and they will taste better than restaurants and takeaways because you can tailor each dish to your own preferences.

Good luck with it all - hope you find your inner cook and really enjoy the food adventures ahead.  Cooking for your friends is a delight you owe yourself.

How does that work? How does it taste? Don't you have to boil it? Regarding the "yucky leftovers" bit: 1) Sometimes leftovers are disgusting. Sometimes they're even better. You won't know which is which until you get a fridge to keep the leftovers in so you don't get salmonella or listeria or something. 2) I know it's not something you think of right away, but have you seen those people who freeze casseroles ahead of time and then just pop then in the oven when they want to eat? You can do that too, and with minimal leftovers. Divide the recipes into thirds and get very small baking dishes. Freeze those in your new fridge that you seriously have to buy. Pull one out after a long day at work, stick it in your oven while you drink a cold beer from your new fridge, and in 45 minutes, yum you've got a single serving of tater tot casserole. (That one makes fucking amazing leftovers, btw)I totally buy my (browning and mixing) meat in tubes. At Aldi. Frozen. Super cheap.

Most of them taste pretty close and you can make them for much less than what you'd spend eating out. Olive Garden even has some of their recipes right on their website. You can also half or quarter most recipes if you find they make too much food or maybe share some with a friend. =)Ok so I love my girlfriend but cooking is just not her thing, ["Help! My apartment has a kitchen"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618711759/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) was probably the most useful thing for her. It gives it to you in understandable ways tells you how to do thing like prep and onion, what a stick of butter weighs, what tools you need for things. It's just all around a good book, with manageable proportions (few left overs) and easy to follow instructions. OP is apparently unaware that many home-cooked foods seem to get better the next day. Really missing out on civilized life!Hey if I can just weigh in with a teeny bit of advice - youtube videos.

Watch people on youtube make food. I find it extremely motivating when I don't feel like cooking. You'll also have someone teaching you, which can be easier and feel less challenging than learning on your own. Lastly, it means you don't have to get a cookbook because all/most of the recipes are free.

[Chef John](https://www.youtube.com/user/foodwishes) is my favorite because he sounds so nice.

[Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=249k2WymdFc) is also great. He barely yells at all in these videos, and they're super helpful.

I understand you might feel overwhelmed, but just go at your pace and enjoy the experience. Cooking and food will become a whole new world. ... dude do you want help or not?You silly Billy.Do you have a recipe for this perchance? Like do you just layer zucchini?I know im late to the party and someone may have said this..  Is there anyway you could ease yourself in by going to the grocery store instead of eating out? Say you have a craving for a burger. Google some recipes on how to make a burger and fries. Hit up the grocery store for the ingredients and go home and make it. 

You wouldn't have to buy a fridge right away because you are only making one serving.  You'll learn some cooking skills.  No leftovers.

I buy bags of salted, frozen edamame from Trader Joe's, run it under some warm water, and eat it - you can usually make a $1.99 bag last for three meals.Get a meat thermometer. Look up safe meat temperatures. 165F is perfect for chicken. I usually cook meat at 350 or 400F and just google shit like 'oven chicken thigh 400 time' to figure out about when I should check the chicken to see if it's done yet. 

Get a pan. Put some tinfoil down. Put piece of meat on the tinfoil. If you want, make a 'boat' of tinfoil around the meat to keep the juices right under the meat instead of spreading out. Put seasonings/oil/butter on the meat. Put it in the oven for the googled amount of time. When it's done, pick up meat, toss out the tinfoil, you have a clean pan. Looks good to me! Put your damn leftovers in the fridge at work and eat them the next day foolI think I'd start with writing down a list of 7 breakfast lunch dinner snacks I liked. Then figure out the ingredients for those, and the total cost of you ate those 4 weeks in a row. 

Don't buy cookies/sweets etc. you'd be amazed by how much that saves you (use the oven. It's much cheaper to buy flour and bake your own cookies, house will smell great as a bonus which is a good supplement to the antidepressants. replace the sweets with fruit leather - handy way to use up fruit that's getting too ripe.)

Then see if you hit 200 a month. 

Eat a vegetarian meal once or twice a week to save on meat. Buy meat in bulk and freeze in one person sized portions. 

Eat a bean salad with rice. Maybe a little chicken, beans, onion( I don't like raw onion but do like them in a salad when fried/until glazy), bell pepper, tomato, raw spinach or lettuce. Try adding cumin to see if you like that. 
If you do Google Moroccan recipes with dried apricot, chicken, raisins, cumin. Serve with rice and Moroccan carrot salad. 

Eat pasta once or twice a week ( lasagna in oven, or pasta with red sauce and ground beef, or pasta with white sauce and mushrooms, or a cold pasta salad - use up left overs!- with leafy greens, tomato, feta cheese, pine nuts, avocado, corn, dressing: throw a bit of honey-olive oil(3 parts)-balsamic vinegar(1 part) in the magic bullet ). 

Eat rice three times a week. Vegetarian with a fried egg and stir fried veggies ( green beans with tomato, or a mix of shredded cabbage with onion and garlic, add broccoli or cauliflower. Or with corn, green peas, carrot in small chunks. )

Or spicy with tomato, onion, bell pepper, chili pepper, pineapple, chicken. 

Or curry: onion, curry spices ( come prepackaged in different flavors), chicken, green peas, carrots, left over potatoes, cauliflower or broccoli, can of coconut milk. 

Eat potato two times a week. Normal with beef and veggies, or mashed with salmon ( I love steamed salmon- throw in steamer for about 15 minutes with a little salt and pepper to taste and you're done). If with salmon try adding boiled carrots with a little butter and parsley as the veggies. 

Try stamppot. Very easy to make. Cook potatoes and mash them up ( little bit of butter or milk helps with the mashing) with raw chopped kale. Add some sausage or bits of fried bacon. Also nice with a pickle on the side. Great winter dish. Instead of kale you can also make stamppot with sauerkraut, or raw endive. 

Eat salads. Or fruity salads: Raw endive, or raw chicory, or raw celery sticks chopped up. Add apple, banana and orange and a little mayonnaise. 

Grate carrots. Add soaked raisins and a little mayo. 

Once a week ( or less) eat 'junk food'. If you have flour and yeast make your own pizza dough ( it's pretty easy!!). Add toppings. Throw in oven. If you want to spend some time DIY fries: cut raw potatoes. Soak in cold water and then dry. Fry in shallow layer of oil that doesn't completely cover them. Fry in batches so they have enough room in the pan. Fry twice. First to cook them ( 10 mins or so). Then take them out (bowl with kitchen towels). Then dry again to crispen up until golden brown. 

Make a few freezer meals for when you don't feel like cooking. 

If you like you can bake your own bread. It doesn't take nearly as much time as most people think. Also store bought bread often has at least 20 ingredients and added sugar and other crap. Bake your own. It's water flour salt and yeast ( or sourdough instead of yeast ). 

Get free sourdough starter from carlsfriends.org - I've been baking my own bread for years now. Takes me 15 minutes of mixing every 3 days if I do it by hand (or 5 minutes of work and 10 minutes of watching the machine mix;) ). Let rise in warm place for a few hours ( until the bubbles on the surface pop) throw in oven for 45 minutes. I don't do the whole preheat the oven thing. Works great. Tastes amazing. House smells real good. Saves money.  
Same time/procedure for yeast leavened bread( which my parents prefer). Add nuts or seeds etc if you like those in bread. 

Feel free to PM with questions :)Try making them into smoothies if you feel that they are already over ripe. You might consider looking into soylent.Leftovers are the easiest thing to deal with, imo.  If you have any leftovers, bag lunch.  Simple.

I somehow manage to feed a family of 5 on about $200/week and I rarely have leftovers.  Yes, we have a boy about to hit teenaged years and is sprouting about an inch a month, so I know exactly where most of my leftovers do go.kijiji/craigslist.

Literally 30 free fridges on my towns kijiji right nowWhere do you live, dude?  I will literally come over to your house and teach you how to cook.  I will also take you to the store and help you buy some pots and pans and stuff.i'm going to have to try all of that. how do you go about making the popcorn? as in: in what order do you add the ingredients and at what point during the process? 

i'm so intruiged right now. i've been looking for a good popcorn for years now. I haven't used the ceramic myself even though I know people who love them. I suggested it based on cost, to be honest. And because people say it's the closest thing to nonstick. I survive on the following: 

1. Enamel coated cast iron (such as Le Creuset) for my cast iron needs (heats up evenly LIKE A BOSS and oven safe) 
2. Stainless steel tri-ply (it was $30 bucks, an off brand at Costco) 
3. A seasoned carbon steel wok for all my stir fry needs (doesn't heat up that evenly, but is almost nonstick when properly seasoned, so I use it for eggs). 

I also realized that fat isn't a bad thing since I was having trouble hitting my calorie count needs for each day, so I use more oil these days. Sticking is a non issue. In college I lived with a friend from High School who taught me how to cook and she would always say that I was probably "doing it wrong" if I didn't add garlic and onions to a dish. 

She was right. [Plan to Eat](http://www.plantoeat.com/ref/e66ebd43f7) has really helped me - I was in the same boat, and using Plan to Eat and a lot of simple foods, we saved over $3000 last year from our usual food habits. PM me if you need personal help, I've been there."You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle."Check out Moroccan tagines. A tagine is pretty much like a crock pot. Lots of varieties - fish, chicken, rabbit, beef, lamb. Just cook it on low and don't add as much water/stock if using a crock pot instead of a proper tagine.Mujadara is great. If you like spices, check out rfissa - it is a Moroccan dish that serves lentils over shredded flat bread and with chicken. I've made the lentils solo a few times and put them over rice and its delicious. Also check out recipes for Afghani lentils - you can make these cheaply with canned tomato, peppers, onion, and spices (cinnamon, ginger, cumin). Yeah! Freeze a few portions of each one, and then you can defrost different ones in different weeks. Then it isn't the same thing multiple times a week. Offering you a shopping list, in a separate comment bc my other was already long.

I would suggest: 

* chicken, (you can buy an already cooked rotisserie chicken, I strongly suggest that over buying raw, but if you'd prefer frozen chicken fingers will fill in alright)
* eggs
* a nut, walnut, almond, cashew or peanut would all be fine choices
* feta cheese
* tomatoes (2-3)
* olives (a can or jar)
* spinach (I'd suggest raw so it can double as a base for salads, one bag)
* lemons (1-2 is fine)
* pasta
* bread (I suggest fresh italian/french bread from bakery section over factory sliced bread)
* 2-3 pasta sauces, perhaps a tomato sauce, and a pesto
* 2-3 salad dressings (I personally love chicken, spinach, raspberry vinagrette and walnuts)
* sandwich condiments you like (mustard, ketchup, mayo, relish etc)

If you already buy tuna, it will also work well with these ingredients. You also need:

* microwave-safe tupperware
* small tupperware containers for condiments, salad dressing
* a pot
* a pan

What you're going to want to do is cook all the pasta, and put in a tupperware container in the fridge. After that, you have all the ingredients you need for pasta, salad or sandwiches. All of the items on this list can be combined, offering variety.

Per week, you should think about having one meat and about 3 types of veg/fruit on hand. If you like greek yogurt, that would also fit nicely with these ingredients. Look for variety in your sauces, salad dressing and condiments.Do you know where I can find good pressure cooker recipes? I have a really big one I never really use. It would be cool to learn how to cook with it.Everyday I put about 1/3 cup salsa in a pan, two egg whites and taco seasoning. Cook foe about 5 mins. Then top with plain greek yogurt. It is close to a taco taste with all the nutrients and few calories. Try not to cook the same thing every day. And try to alternate meals - for example, if you eat Thing A for dinner and have leftovers, leave Thing A in the fridge for dinner the next night, and make Thing B for lunch. By dinnertime the next day, you'll probably barely remember the night before. Then move on to Thing C and B for dinner/lunch.I love popcorn, carrots, or bell pepper strips. If I want more flavor I buy the kernels seasoning. Ranch is awesome on everything. For more of a snack feel, baby carrots or other cut up veggies (peppers, cucumbers) are really good with hummus or salsa.How is ceramic? I use a regular non-stick pan and I find that sometimes, it's not really the best. Things don't heat up that evenly. My roommate has a glass pan and for sauteing, that thing is a fucking marvel to use.That is AWFUL. 

I'm not saying YOU are awful, but you need to learn, fast. 

http://i.imgur.com/ZrrUOry.jpgCheck the serving size on that meatloaf. It may say "Serves 4" or something. Reduce the ingredients by proportion. Also, not every recipe needs to have every ingredient listed. I habitually leave out certain things if I think they're unnecessary and a hassle/too expensive. I also add things not in the recipe if I think they might make the dish taste better. That sort of knowledge involves a good sense of taste, though, and for cooking, developing that sense might help.Recipe for Chloros Zomos.

Introduction:-

To a certain extent, this drink is the result of my own experimentation,
although I did have two sources of inspiration. The purportedly anti-cancer
Gerson Diet, which primarily consists of apple and carrot juice, and Dan
McDonald's Lemon Ginger Blast.

The name is a slight play on (and homage to) the Spartan Melas Zomos, or Black
Broth, which was made from boiled pig's or other animal's blood, and a certain
amount of meat, garlic, and vinegar. Chloros is ancient Greek for the colour
green, which my drink is with the presence of celery leaves. The Spartans presumably
used their soup as a means of obtaining their necessary nutrition and protein
while on the march; and it is recorded that in old age, the men who had grown
used to the broth, still preferred to eat it over anything else, when they
were at home in Sparta.

My intention with this recipe is that it be a staple in a somewhat similar
manner, while having considerably less objectionable ingredients for modern
sensibilities. The drink is extremely healthy, and something which I recommend
both for the curing of disease, and maintaining good health. When I was in
Kyneton I would sometimes drink it when I felt it necessary, and I buy a
somewhat more limited version of it on most days here in Nimbin.

Ingredients:-

1 Apple, cut into quarters.  

1-2 Carrots, depending on their size, sliced.  

1 Lemon, quartered with the peel left on.  

1 Avocado, quartered.  

4 Celery sticks, 10 cm or so long.  Make sure to include a good amount of the leaves as well.  The colour this creates is beautiful.

1 half teaspoon of unground Fenugreek.  If you can get the ground stuff,
that's fine.

3 cloves of Garlic.  

3 teaspoons of powdered Turmeric.  

3 teaspoons of powdered Almonds.  

2 grams of fresh Ginger root.   

200 ml or so of Water.

Method:-

Combine all of the above in a blender that has a jug with a 1-2 litre
capacity. Do not put all of the ingredients in at once, however. Put the apple
pieces and the other larger ingredients in first, one at a time, and use a
small amount of water each time as lubricant for the blades.

Once all of the ingredients have been properly blended, the jug can be taken
off the blender pedestal and put in the refrigerator; although if it is not
sealed, this drink should ideally be consumed within a maximum of 24 hours. If
I was going to take some of this while travelling, I would keep it in a
thermos flask, where it would most likely keep for longer. 
Yeah I'm the same. I just don't get how you can spend so much more than that and not have it be intentional? I just eat a lot of eggs and milk. And I eat meat pretty often. I only buy it when its on sale at no frills thoughI'd go with salads and pasta. For pasta you should cook a whole batch, then heat up the portion you want to eat with the mix-ins you want. For sauce, 'cream of X' soup works pretty well, you could season it if you want. If cheap isn't so important, you could just buy pre-made pasta sauces. 

So you've got a batch of pre-cooked noodles, before you leave for work throw some with some veggies, meat and sauce in a microwaveable container. All you have to do before eating it is heat it up.

Salads are similarly easy, toss ingredients in a container, and pack a container of dressing on the side. Come meal break, combine and eat. 

I would also like to introduce you to the brain-child of my lazy cooking days, a little something I call 'meat salad'. You start with pre-cooked meat, whatever you like, although I mostly used chicken or ham. Then add one or two vegetables and a cheese,  (tomato, olive, feta; spinach, mushroom, swiss; corn, carrot, cheddar, etc.) and microwave it. All the prep required it to chop or shred the ingredients, and it's super-tasty.

Also if you like eggs, they are easy to prepare and go nicely in salad, pasta, sandwiches, pizza, etc for a quick way to add protein. You can also focus on canned chickpeas or nut (like peanuts) to add protein and therefore an energy boost, without the hassle of having to prepare meat.

You should buy a pot and a pan. You really will never *need* more than that.A rice cooker isn't really necessary, and if you're on a limited budget or in a limited space it's downright wasteful unless you're using it every day.  Same with the water kettle.  You can do both of those on the stovetop pretty easily.

If you do use them daily, that's a different story - my electric kettle gets switched on twice a day - but they're definitely not essentials.Canadian here. Grocery bill comes down to around $30/week for me. I don't buy meat because it's a hassle, and eat out if I want meat. Total food may be around $50-70/week, including booze. I obviously don't eat meat every day.Some mini fridges are awful.  Mine at school was either freeze or barely cold.  I just swore off dairy products and delicate produce like lettuce.$1000 for a fridge?  My partner and I have a fridge similar to [this](http://products.geappliances.com/ApplProducts/Dispatcher?REQUEST=SpecPage&amp;Sku=GTS15CTHRCC) (ours is even smaller at 11.9 cu ft) and it's plenty of room for the two of us.  It ain't fancy, but it keeps things cold.Costco has great products and prices.

Costco also invests heavily in their employees; great pay, strong benefits, vacation time, etc. 

Sam's Club and Walmart are the same entity and the shabby regard they show their employees is newsworthy. 

Patronizing companies that treat their employees well and shunning those that do not is important.

In the end, giving a shit feels better than zero fucks given.+1 on plantain chips. i love them and they make me feel better because they're not regular chipsif you can find a restaurant supply store somewhere, they'll have the best pans and everything for a lottt cheaper than shit like martha stewart idiot brands. 

get 1 10 inch teflon frying pan and a lid for it. $20 + $10 tops.

wooden spoons so you dont scratch the dickk out the teflon ~$2

get a rice cooker. $20

any store sells glass/pyrex baking pans, get one of those and start baking whole chickens. 

like really you can cook just about anything with an oven and a pan with a lid. there is zero effort involved here. just put a chicken in the bitch and wait until its not salmonella. 

if you're used to paying $20 for a damn chicken breast at some halfass restaurant i think you'll be disgusted how easy it is to do at home for like $1. the magic of salt oooOoOooo

~ worked in restaurants for like 15 years. ~
Aight fair enough, but ew73 was talking to OP's situation. Listen, I've also been without a decent fridge and the answer has always been processed food or meals that consume almost all ingredients in one go. I personally loved getting a whole bunch of ramen plus various seasonings to make it interesting. 

Someone else mentioned adjusting the dial, so if there is an accessible temperature control, then use it.[Lactose intolerance can occur in children/infants as well, although much less frequently.](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=lactose%20intolerance%20in%20infants&amp;es_th=1) The first result and the one from the Mayo Clinic explain this. It may cost $30 to make if you have none of the ingredients and you make super fancy stuff. Most people who cook regularly will have most all of those ingredients already, and will only need one or two things. And it makes a ton of food.Holy shit, I love this subreddit and how chill it is. Anywhere else on reddit, you would've been utterly destroyed with downvotes for even mentioning bottled water. But on this sub, it's just some more legit advise for someone trying to live a little more efficiently.My grocery bill for one month is $75, max, on a good month. Mostly out of need, but I can't fathom having $225/week grocery budget! Oh, the things I could buy with that...

The rest of the comments are gold. /u/ooglygooglypants hit the nail on the head, and everything he says is awesome, so I won't say it all again except the key points: You'll need a fridge. If you won't buy one, might as well keep eating out. And yes, you'll have to start eating leftovers unless you want to throw away huge quantities of food, in which case again - might as well just keep eating out instead of wasting it. I'm not talking about OP. I'm talking about me and my apartment. The cool thing about reddit is a lot of times threads will be useful to many more people than just the person who originally asked the questionYou need to learn how to cook one of your favorite meals that you eat when you go out.  From this you will learn cooking skills and be able to branch out from there.  If you don't know anyone that can help you, cooking wise, YouTube is a life saver.  You need a medium to large skillet, and a pot to boil water to start with.  Like others have said get over left over aversion.  Spaghetti is great for multiple meals.  Crockpots are great for soups, which can make multiple meals.  OP should also check out some of the Jamie Oliver vids--as much as I love Gordon Ramsay, he's not exactly beginner friendly.OP spends 1k a month on food. I'm pretty sure he can afford a 100$ mini fridge.Plantain chips, korean seaweed, root vegetable chipsYea...I'm the only one who eats hummus so I'd either have to go on a huge binge (which I'm sure defeats the purpose of a healthy snack) or throw a party...Looks like I'm throwing a party!there is the brickworks farmers market not too far from youSafer that way.  There's lots of cool people here but all it takes is one jerk to ruin it for everyone. Suggestion noted and applied
Food is my passion but I'm pretty sure most of your questions here have already been answered.  I just wanted to say I'm literally excited FOR you.  I hope you learn to love what you make and eat.  I taught myself to cook.  I've been practicing for 10 years and I've still got a long ways to go.  Internet really helps move food knowledge along faster than a book in my opinion.  Go you!  Don't get too discouraged.  You can do it!Start with Breakfasts and lunches:

Breakfasts: Buy bag of bagels, add some of your favourite topping (margerine, butter, herbed cream cheese). Toast with peanut butter and jam. Buy some apples, bannanas, oranges, and other cheap in season fruit. Make the occasional scrambled eggs + toast, omelets (scramble eggs, put into pan, let them heat without stirring them, dump cheese &amp; veggies and meat on, let cook, eat).

Lunches: Take afforementioned apples, bananas, oranges. Bake some super easy cookies (I use this one and I seriously am as dumb as fuck when it comes to baking: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/ ). Make sandwhiches. Peanut butter and jam, peanut butter and banana, nutella and banana. Get more elaborate; lettuce (small head) + tomato + lunch meat + cheese + nice mustard (I use organic stone ground). Take the left over lettuce, dump on some caesar dressing, look in your bulk section for cheap crutons and facon bits, scrape on some paremesean cheese (great in those omelets, too). 

Simple as fuck dinner: Get one of those 8$ rotiserrie chickens from the grocery store, a bag of potatoes. Boil the potatoes, put butter in, mash them. Buy some celery and carrots, cut em into sticks, eat em with a bit (but not a lot) of ranch dressing. Delicious, not terrible for you. Take the left over chicken and use it in your sandwhiches for the week. 

You can do all this with a 20$ mini fridge off craigslist and your microwave.I put a bag of carrot and celery sticks in my lunch every day. It really makes a difference in filling you up, but it doesn't add a lot of junk calories. Also, the crunchiness is an awesome complement to a sandwich.I don't even use a knife or stir.  I throw in a couple whole chicken breasts and taco seasoning, and they fall apart after letting it cook for 6 hours.

If I'm feeling daring I throw in a pack of ramen towards the end.Unfortunately I have done a lot of finicking with the dial :( when I turn it a minute amount, it'll go from freezing everything to making everything spoil because it's not cold enough. Very frustrating.Hey don't get overwhelmed.  Cooking is a lot of fun if you do it for joy.  I find it to be very creative and stress-relieving.  Also...yes you could go spend that $12 on at Jimmy Johns...but that probably only gives you one meal.  $12 of a meatloaf (you can even throw in a side of potatoes) is probably going to give you 3-5 meals. :)  

I'd suggest watching mountains of youtube videos.  And Google is your friend.  You can google the answer to pretty much any silly cooking question and find what you need instantly.  Get a fridge. Then: 

Easy/healthy breakfast: 

Get: 
yogurt (preferably a good plain yogurt)
banana
thawed frozen berries
granola or some sort of rolled breakfast cereal (something that looks like oats, including rye or some kind that starts with a t, the name of which I don't remember)
a good fruit and nuts mix (i get a yummy one for a little more than $6 a lb in the bulk bin of the grocery store by my house)
some sweetener &gt; maple syrup or honey works best

Place yogurt in large bowl. 
Cut up banana and place that over yogurt.
Put grain over that. 
Put fruit/nuts mix over that. 
Sprinkle sweetener on it. 
Stir. 
Enjoy.
Repeat. This may end up being a silly question, but have you tried adjusting the temperature knob in the fridge? Every fridge (mini-fridge included) I've ever owned/used regularly had a knob like [this one](http://www.staticwhich.co.uk/media/images/adhoc/2--analouge-thermostat-324708.jpg) that you could dial to make it warmer/cooler. If everything is getting frozen, you might be able to set it warmer to make things be chilled properly.Thanks for the advice. I was worried he'd think that I broke the fridge, since I've been living there for a year and was just too timid to say anything about it before. It was like that when I moved in, but I guess I have no way to prove that...I'm not talking about OP now, I'm asking for myself. And I don't spend $1000 a month in restaurants. 

A lot of times posts are helpful to many other people besides the person who asked the questionHey I've been thinking about your dillema for a while now. You need a crockpot. It's the easiest shit in the world, you don't need to know anything about cooking at all. You literally just put some stuff in a giant bowl and it's ready to eat in a few hours. Chicken, beef, veggies, canned soups, whatever, it's super hard to fuck up.

Also, going from eating out all the time to eating at home is a pretty big transition so don't feel like you have to immediately start cooking everything form scratch. If your goal is to save money, frozen dinners and hot pockets could be a decent stepping stone or a fall-back for when you don't feel like cooking, you can pop something in the microwave instead of going to Jimmy Johns. Every damn time I try to make skinny girl popcorn it burns, EVERY time. I've just opted for the Orville 100 calorie packs instead. Microwave popcorn is also incredibly unhealthy due to the packaging.Ok lets do some math. You are spending 1k a month eating out. That's 33 bucks a day. That's 11 dollars a meal. So anything we do under that is bonus. 

Step one, as described by others, but a nice nonstick skillet that is bigger than you think you need. It's going to cast you maybe 30 bucks. Then buy two dozen eggs. No fridge?  Doesn't matter. The eggs will be fine for a week. Splurge on the eggs. Get the ones that cost 4 bucks a dozen. We are at 34 bucks or about one days meals. Throw in some good butter. Doesn't need refrigeration. Four more dollars. With this, make scrambled eggs. Buy some hard dry sausage or salami. Scramble it with the eggs. This is now your oh shit I'm at home and don't know what to do. 

But a bag of sweet potatoes. Stab a sweet potato with a fork. Put in microwave for five minutes. Smother in butter. Add cinnamon if you are feeling fancy. Now you have protein, fat, and carbs, no fridge required. 

If you have ten minutes on the way home stop and buy spicy Italian sausage (the loose kind). Dump it in a pan and stir it under it isn't pink. Pair with sweet potatoes. 

Until you get a fridge, buy a cooler and some bags of ice. Yeah it's not awesome but it will keep your food safe and at least leave you with decent leftovers.  Eat at home for dinner for two weeks and you've probably saved enough for a fridge. Now things get fun. 

There are two books I absolutely recommend. First is for the sad sad basics. Buy the starving students' cookbook by fed hall. It has - bunch of recipes with very specific directions, cheap ingredients, and minimal tools. Use this until you save some money for a fridge, and maybe 200 bucks for more tools. Just think 200 bucks is probably less than you used to spend in a week eating out. And hell what are we two three weeks in? Suffer through for 30 days, how bad can it be!

Now you have a fridge, money saved for tools, and a few options like omelets and grilled cheese sandwiches. Now it's time to decide if you want to get serious about cooking. 

I loved Tim Feriss's book the four hour chef. It's not a book about cooking as much as it is a book about learning to learn. But the recipes are easy to follow, and the food is delicious. If you are a foody this is how you make it at home. 

Best of luck to you and proud of you for trying!In that case, get your landlord to provide a working set of appliances.  Apartments / rentals come with an implied warranty of habitability, which includes working appliances.

Refer to your state's landlord-tenant law for specific remedies.  /r/legaladvice may also be able to help.Late to the party here, but yeah you need a fridge and freezer. This doesn't have to be that complicated. Just get one dish to be somewhat palatable and go from there. I make a lot of stir frys because it's easy, quick, and you can change it up with just a few different ingredients. 

So Get a stir fry pan or a wok with a lid. You can do a lot with this pan. Once you have that you can head to the grocery. Generally you want a protein, vegetables, sauce/seasonings, and maybe the option of some type of carb or starch. Boneless skinless chicken breasts are a good start. Then veggies - broccoli, mixed stir fry veggies, whatever you want. Frozen is fine and much easier. Then sauces. These are probably next to the salad dressings. Maybe some teriyaki, pesto, or tikka masala. If you want get rice or some sort of pasta. That will require another pot though. Also grab some vegetable oil. 

When you're ready to cook, cut up the chicken into bite size pieces. Put a small amount of oil in the pan and turn on the burner to half to 3/4. Put the chicken in and stir every now and then until it's cooked fully. You may need to drain some of the juices out. Next add the veggies and put the lid on. Stir and drain as necessary. When those are all cooked put the burner on low and add your sauce. Stir that up, put the lid back on and wait 5-10 mins or so. Put that in a bowl on its own or over some rice/pasta. Once you get the hang of it you can start to get more creative but this is what I make for myself 2-3 times a week. It's fairly healthy and make good leftovers. I feel ya. I eat the same thing for lunch and dinner for three days in a row and then switch. Craigslist is good for finding appliances. Of course they have been used, but sometimes you can find something close to new... and cheap!As someone who gone hungry before it is outrageous that you would throw perfectly good food away. Order less, eat the leftovers like someone who has a lick of gratitude, give it away to someone else (a homeless person, a broke intern, somebody) or go without. Did someone not raise you right? That made me legitimately unhappy.Food safety in the US is micromanaged to death. I cant tell you the amount of high quality BBQ Ive gotten from my boss cuz he is under the impression that cooked meat spoils after 3 days... Wrapped and fridge kept!
He's spending $1000 in restaurants. He can afford a fridge.:)Oh good! :) Do you have any ideas?


Also, maybe keep an eye out for super simple ways of cooking? 

Ex: I make mashed potatoes by adding butter, diced potatoes into a pot, stirring until the potatoes are covered, then topping the whole thing off with chicken stock. When the excess water is boiled off, I have super soft mashed potatoes. Cheap, healthy, quick, easy, very tasty, and didn't give me gas! I just followed this recipe and it turned out great! This is fantastic and exactly what I was looking for in this subreddit! Thank you!!!

Edit: The recipe also gave me enough for 4 meals which will save me time tomorrow!Dude, if you can afford this much on food each month, there is practically no basic fridge outside of your budget. 

You need to reevaluate what you think is worth your money(you mentioned before that a fridge is there to keep lettuce cold, while being totally okay with spending large amounts of money on eating out. You're an adult. Make a list of pros and cons. Grow up), then man up and you know, get a fridge, and go to the grocery store. flour* sorryI used to do that too! It's super nice getting nice home-made food all the time without having to cook every day&gt; It's hard to believe, but i've always subscribed to idea that it's cheaper for one to just buy a prepared meal at a restaurant then go out and buy $20-$30 for stuff to cook some thing.

I just have to ask ... were you raised in a wealthy household?

Because I just can't imagine this mindset from a functioning adult who wasn't waited on hand and foot growing up.First get a fridge, a decent one will cost you one month food budget's worth.

And second, YouTube.  Whatever you want to make, look it up and follow along.  Don't understand the word saute?  Look it up, there's a thousand videos about sauteing.  Maybe watch a couple to get more info/different perspectives.  The video recipes are awesome because they will give you and idea of what the steps look like and what the food should look like.  The best ones will teach a little technique along the way.  One of my favorites is Chef John, his youtube name is foodwishes.  To be honest, most of his dishes will be overly complicated for you at first.  But it's easier than you and once you have the basics down, you'll be good and I've yet to be disappointed by his recipes. He's also a classically trained chef so you get some good techniques that are used in the restaurants you've been living off of.

Also, Alton Brown's Good Eats is on Netflix and elsewhere.  He approaches cooking in a more technical way, explaining what's actually going in the process.  It's really helpful for more analytical, technically minded people.

You gotta eat, you might as well eat good food (and not pay an arm and a leg for it).I'd recommend asking for edits but not letting anyone edit it.  That could get messy. Yes, but babies aren't lactose intolerant.

For example, lactose intolerance is defined as "Lactose intolerance is the inability of **adults** to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and to a lesser extent dairy products"

it's the first line on Wiki...Mint.com


give it your bank and credit card login credentials and it pulls the data. You have to sort shit like that purchase at walmart that was lightbulbs from groceries to household but its pretty solid.


its prety helpful.  It alerts me when bills are due as wellGet some nice tupperware. Crockpot + tupperware will help you portion things out.Thanks bro! 


Pm sent about that other thingCan I ask what you use to categorize your spending?I dont really have shit to get dirty. 5 things in a pantry and plastic cups in my cabinets arent really screaming "dirty slob". I dont take left over home and I dont cook in my house. Its actually incredibly spotless. My spare bedroom is kind of cluttered with my home office and fishing shit on the walls and camping gear in the closet though. But theres nothing just lying about. Okay, here's what I think.

It's great you are buying a fridge, that's step one, but honestly, it's going to be a huge shock, if it's not an emergency, just go one step at a time, pick something, watch a few youtube videos on how others make it, do some shopping, make it happen.

If you go from eating out every day, to never doing it, it's going to be super rough, figure out what you can do well, easily, and then grow from there.
I, in fact, just did.Yeah thats crossed my mind a couple times today..I'll take 1 week worth of groceries please.... ill circle back around


*drives away from pharmacy windiw*Ice makers are overrated
if i were you i'd invest half of that 1k a month on cooking classesFreeze it, and it will never go bad :)Not a bad ideam you cross post itHahIve been hitting up cooking apps and youtube channels all night so farI like a pulled beef burrito, and it cooks up well in a large batch and freezes beautifully.

I take a large roast, chuck roast is my favorite, throw it in the crockpot with some water and beef bouillon (I actually use Better Than Beef Bouillon and love it) and a couple cans of green chiles.  It goes great with just beans and some pepper jack cheese.Are you an ex girlfriend of mine?I don't even eat $225 worth of groceries in one *month.* That buys a ton of food for me. 

Your going to need a fridge. For sure. You're not going to be able to eat healthy without one. 

Check out budgetbytes.com for some great recipes. Lately, I've been eating baked chicken a lot. 

http://everclevermom.com/2014/05/easy-weeknight-paleo-chicken-best-drumstick-recipe-ever/I'm sure you've heard this by now, but you should buy a fridge - definitely one that comes with a freezer. Keep a few frozen pizzas or a box of chicken nuggets in there for the one or two nights a week where you don't feel like cooking. Trust me, you will feel like that sometimes, and $5 for a frozen pizza is a lot better than $15 for a carry-out one.You can also just put corn kernels in any old paper bag with a bit of EVO and put that in the microwave and boom you have popcornWash them, dry them, freeze them on a baking sheet. Optionally cover baking sheet with freezer paper or parchment paper.

I prefer to take them off the stem first, but it works either way.lolI bought a box of frozen chicken at Costco. Went to open it two months later (I had been out of town), it was a frozen solid block and I couldn't get anything out of it.

I wen to go return it to Costco, put it on the counter, an open box, seals gone, and said "I want to return this, I bought it a few months ago and I don't have a receipt."

The guy smiled, said okay, let me look up that receipt for you. Then he gave me my cash and said have a nice day. No questions asked about anything.

Best return policy ever.
When I looked at Sams Club for the things that I would buy at the grocer, the unit price was higher, and they only carried brand instead of generic.

Then again, I was looking for Peanut butter and Oats.Where do you buy 50 pounds of flower?I've wondered if that was worth it, I'll have to give it a try. Late to the party, but fellow single, high-earning guy here. I suggest cooking once per week.  

First, pick something you really want to eat. For example, lasagna. Look through some recipes online and pick one you like.

Go to the store and buy everything you need. Don't forget a pot for boiling noodles. Strainer. Lasagna pan. Measuring cup. Measuring spoons. Knife. Big spoon. Plastic containers for leftovers. Also buy all the ingredients including the spices. 

Next Saturday or Sunday, follow the recipe. Not sure about something like how to brown beef or slice mushrooms? Youtube it. 

That night you'll have a lasagna feast and it will be good. 

Put the leftovers in single-portion plastic containers. You'll get a few more meals from your lasagna. If the first lasagna was good, why not have it for dinner tomorrow night? Maybe switch it up by picking up some garlic bread or a salad on the way home.

The first one might cost you $100. But you also bought (and used) some kitchen equipment. 

OK, now the important part. Do the same thing the next weekend, but make something different. Beef stew perhaps. 

Do this for two months and your kitchen will be in order and you'll know how to cook eight things. 

Good luck out there. Lol you have got to be kidding me. How did you get this far in life?What about those of us who can't afford one? My apartment came equipped with a shitty mini-fridge that only freezes everything, and pretty much all my paycheck goes to bills and rent.I like Goldfish. 150 calories per 55 fishies. Can't beat that!at least get a mini-fridge! with all the money you save making your own food, the fridge will pay for itself :)China Town and Kensington Market were my places of choice when I lived in Toronto. That and No Frill's for canned goods (e.g. beans).Not sure if it was mentioned, but you can get away with very few items to start. Fridge is definately a necessity, but beyond that Ikea and other places sell "starter kits" which usually have some pots, pants, boards, knives etc. 

Additionally if you don't know how to cook take a look at your local Y. Mine is offering cooking classes where they teach you basic knife skills etc. Not sure about how much, though I think it's &lt;$100 and a pretty good investment if you really do start from scratch and don't know how to cook an egg or burn water.Maybe I'm a bit desensitized.  I see people in /r/personalfinances who spend just as much as food, but they have a fridge, and they're also $30k in credit card debt, have no savings, and they're pretty sure they're ready to start the process of buying a home.  OP is a lot better off than a lot of people I give budgeting and financial advice to.I don't blame you for gas phobia. I once saw someone with a badly burned face and he said it was from gas range explosion. His advice was use electric.My mother is allergic to dairy, gluten, tomatoes, and onions. She makes her own almond milk and says it's awesome and cheaper! But it does required some super nice blender she just got for x-mas.

I don't know the whole process but you soak the almonds overnight to skin them and then just blend them up with X amount of water. You need that special blender to make it not as grittyI spend almost $30week in food. Healthy fresh food. I cook on sunday for the work week. you can do what we do in Asia, just leave the food out if its safe. Almost anything will keep for at least 12 hours unless your in blistering heat. Most meats here have been sitting in ~90 degree heat for many days and no locals get sick.I prefer lentils and rice, khichidi style. It's cheap, filling, and delish. My family frequently makes 3 bean chili with added TVP on Sundays, since it's cheap, delicious, and filling. Everyone can have seconds or thirds!Yeah, but for 6 people, not one person like OP. So 33/week per person.Rice soup, or congee. Cook rice, and then add stock and cook more, until it's soupy. Mashed potatoes, etc. Soft tofu, heated up, with a dash of soy sauce on it.
Indian might not be your speed, so I'm not going to recommend it. The place where you're fucking up is realizing a meatloaf will feed one person for multiple meals. At least 3-4.

So yeah you could spend $12 on Jimmy John's or the same amount on a meatloaf.... but the Jimmy John's is $12/meal and the meatloaf is $3-$4/meal.

Shiitake dashi is something you can make yourself by simmering dry shiitake mushrooms in water or vegetable stock. It's good to use in place of the regular dashi.
Depending on what store you go to, you can get miso that doesn't have bonito or fish added to it. I've had more luck at organic stores, and places like wegmans.Soak them overnight, then use a pressure cooker. I would use stock instead of water for pressure cooker. To piggyback on your comment: OP, you don't even have to buy that much meat, it's just cheaper in whole form. There's a counter for that at most grocery stores, and TJ's has deli meat prepackaged. I prefer dark miso. Brown rice, black rice, barley... The rich flavor is amazing, and shiitake mushroom compliments it very well. When I was in college, I would top rice with a dollop of miso and a little bit of butter. Probably my weirdness/borderline malnourishment.Months of wages saved up will not help you if the company goes under, or you get injured, and you're living on a fixed income without a fridge and the knowhow to boil pasta. You are spending nearly my entire monthly rent, weekly. You have a 15 year mortgage and less than a year's wages saved up, yet you're spending more than your mortgage payment (assuming it's in the pie chart) on eating out. 

Go get a saucepan, some heat source, and at least some Progresso soup. If you really want to get fancy, get some bread to eat with it. 


You can usually find some on craigslist/kijiji! They're a lot cheaper! The worst you might have to do is bleach the heck out of what you get.Scrambled eggs. You can make them the night before, store them in the fridge, and heat them up in the morning if you are careful to undercook them a bit. They'll finish in microwave.I don't think slob is totally warranted... Sounds like he's very clean, almost a germaphobe if he thinks left overs kept in a 
fridge are gross.Lol that's crazy. I buy motorcycles off kijiji (Canada uses it more than vraigslist but same type of site) a lot and same deal. "Decent condition" motorcycle = a frame from one bike an an engine from an entirely different type of bike.sooo....200 a weekNot quite the same but I'll eat on things until they get moldy or start to smell bad. When things go bad they go bad quick and you know it beyond a shadow of a doubt. 

I know it's been said but I think it bears repeating. OP, get over your aversion to leftovers. Cooking single size portions is a lot harder than cooking things that'll last a few days. Therefore you're making it harder to get healthy. Agreed! What are the soups?I cook up a double batch of a similar recipe to this [this one](http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-inexpensive-lentil-tacos-304604).  It takes the water longer to boil off with a double batch.  Scramble a dozen eggs and toss some cheese on when you roll them up,  and you've got a dozen breakfast burritos ready for the freezer and/or microwave.I'm removing your post because it links directly to a recipe website.  You can make a text post containing the entire formatted recipe and a link to the source but you cannot link directly to the website.  There are tips on formatting your recipe in the sidebar. Okay, skimming replies, I don't think a lot of people are touching on something: it's not about the money for you. Probably the subreddit bias, ha. 

Lots of people have given you really great advice about what to buy ingredients wise, but if you get a basic Costco membership (assuming there's one near you) you can stock up on groceries all at once place. (You need a fridge. Just get one.) Easy way to go about it is try as many of the free samples you can to get an idea of what you think you can eat for a while. 


Then do a quick search for simple recipes and if you're interested, pick up a few of those ingredients. Build a little ingredients web. That should about cover variety. If you need help easing into something, Costco has lovely pre-cooked meals or components to help your way. (Like chicken-noodle soup, roasted chicken, etc.) Bulk may or may not be your friend depending on how much food you eat though.Hey, Lots of great advise in here but i'll add my two cents.

Things I buy and Cook as a college student that are quick and cheap and healthy:

instant oatmeal, storebrand.
a big bag of potatoes
a big bag of onions
peanut butter
bananas
frozen veggies (my grocery store sells premade mixes like a stiry fry veggie mix or individual veggies )
frozen chicken breasts
tortillas
canned beans (sometimes 99 cents at my store)
pasta
canned pasta sauce (not white sauce! that stuff is literally butter, milk, and cheese)

You'll probably want a fridge. Maybe even a little college dorm sized one that alot of people have? Those usually have a little freezer in them too. It wouldn't be the best thing but it'd be cheaper than a full size one.





Not a vegetarian, but I'd be interested in this as long as the recipes are both cheap and healthy.  I've got environmental concerns.i love these so much but they hurt my teeth :( You could do Parkay Spray. I don't want to know what's in it, but it tastes butter-ish and it's very low cal.&gt; I also love really crunchy, crisp grapes.

Try frozen grapes sometime.I would suggest keeping food in the work fridge since you seem to be there more than at home, and/or keeping veggies which can be stored outside of a fridge at home and some canned protein sources like tuna. 

Getting out of the office is important. Is there a park near by, or a comfortable spot outside somewhere which is good for people or pigeon watching? Make the break about the place and stimulate your senses with trees and a breeze rather than relying on expensive food. Bring a wrap, salad or a picnic to eat in your spot. 


You dont need a fridge for tomatoes (theyre better out of the fridge) carrot (store them in a cool cupboard in a brown paper bag), capsicum (buy them fresh and they last forever), red onion, or kale (keep it in a vase with some water, it will last forever). All of those go great shredded in a wrap.  Make it in the morning, throw a can of tuna on there (use one of the ones with flavorings like mustard and mayo), it will take maximum 10 minutes (note-the veg wont last outside of the fridge once cut, so use it all or snack on the rest while making the wrap. Bonus healthy start to breakfast). For the picnic, pack some celery sticks (the vase trick works for them too), some peanut butter or tahini to dip them in, tomatoes, fruit, crackers, whatever.  

Can you keep stuff in a work fridge? If you can, you can buy better proteins like a bbq chicken, smoked salmon, cheese, plus a bag of salad greens, and some aioli, and throw together a wrap or salad before heading out to your lunch spot or home for your commuting dinner. You can also keep milk in there and have porridge for breakfast at work. 

Is that kind of food appealing at all? I can help you make a list and meal plan based on this if it would help.Can confirm.  I used to deliver appliances for Lowe's.Step one: get a fridge.ive had a hard time finding it, personally.  and it's still covered in plenty of oil.This is a great suggestion. Even more so considering that I don't generally make enough of sides. Leftovers are just extra of the main course and can definitely be repurposed for other meals. Thanks for sharing! There are many reasons why a woman might not be able to breastfeed. Sometimes formula is a requirement not a choice. Seriously?  He doesn't own a fridge, spends $12k a year on eating out, clearly has no sense of personal responsibility or decision making skills. Any reasonable adult is going to run like hell from this guy. Every where I've found sells it at about the same price. I guess there's not much profit margin in formula. If you know of any place I'd greatly appreciate it. Couple of more months then we will switch over to almond milk or lactose free milk. It will literally save us 300/month.My family sighs over leftovers. I try to change
them up. If I roast a chicken, I'll make a chicken 
soup or stew with what is left over the next day.
I use rice or egg noodles for the starch. Same for a
beef roast but I like to add some barley for the stew.
So it's not the SAME meal they had yesterday, but 
it passes as a "new" meal for them. I don't waste 
the food I buy, and they have new different meals from
the same main ingredient. I think the saying for this is
"cook once, eat twice". so far works for me!I'm in Florida. I shop pretty much at Walmart weeks to week. In the kindest possible way, I urge you to suck it up and buy a fridge and a few cooking supplies. I don't know what your long term plans are, but if they involve a spouse or every having kids, you should at least learn some basics. And not to mention the fact that you can eat much healthier at home. So it's an investment in your long term future and you may even find it fun!

Actual cooking is easy now with tons of recipes with step by step directions online. Start with small easy things that can be staples and branch out from there. 

Get 1-2 lodge cast iron pans. They can go in the oven and are super cheap. Buy one cookie sheet. Get some kitchen towels or oven mitts for handling the cast iron and cookie sheet. Get two pairs of kitchen tongs because those things are super useful. Get a silicone spatula or two and a big spoon. Get 1-2 cutting boards, a decent knife for chopping - doesn't have to be expensive - and a microplane because fresh grated cheese and citrus zest both bring wonderful flavors to a meal. 

Lots of veggies are delicious just tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper (I use lemon pepper) and roasted at 425 until they just start to char - usually 20-40 min depending on the veggie and thickness of cut. You can do this with carrots, potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, beets, Brussels sprouts, etc. if you want to get fancier, shred some Parmesan on top when it comes out of the oven and some lemon juice/zest. Or drizzle some balsamic vinegar on there. (You can buy pre-made balsamic reduction which is convenient and delicious.)

Grilling chicken is dead easy. A foolproof method is to put a pan on med-high with a fat (olive oil, bacon fat, whatever) and let the chicken brown for a few minutes without moving it. Then flip it, put a lid on it, and set heat to low. Don't touch it, don't look at it, don't take lid off. After 10 minutes, keep lid on and just turn off heat and leave it on the warm burner for another 10 minutes. Trust me. It will be perfectly cooked, juicy, and will taste chickeny instead of like a flavorless puck. 

Breakfast? For week days hard boil some eggs in advance. Bonus - you can take them to go. Put eggs in a pan and bring to full boil. Then turn off heat, put a lid on and leave them for 12 minutes. Transfer to cold water to cool and then put in fridge. Done. 

Scrambled eggs take 2 minutes and you can jazz them up with diced onions/peppers, feta cheese, tarragon, etc. Eggs are good for you. Spend the extra buck on free range omega-3 ones. 

Weekend breakfasts? Line your cookie sheet with parchment paper - not wax paper - and throw some bacon on it. Put it in a cold oven and set temp to 425. Check in 20 min or when it starts to smell bacony. It will probably be almost done. If you use thick cut bacon (recommended) it will be more like 25-30 min. When it seems close to being done, push some of the bacon aside, and crack some eggs on the sheet. Bake another 6-7 minutes until eggs yolks just start to glaze over. Boom, perfect, chewy bacon and the creamiest sunny side up eggs ever. When you have that down and can eye your bacon's doneness, experiment by throwing in other stuff, like asparagus or make a sweet potato hash to cook with the bacon. (Just be ready to rescue your bacon if the other stuff needs more time than you guessed.)

Baking breakfast is SO easy, textures are better than pan cooking (bacon cooks evenly, you won't overlook the egg) and it looks all artisanal and pretty coming out of oven. Plus 0 minutes spent bent over a hot stove getting splattered with grease. You will feel like an accomplished badass, pulling it out of the oven. 

Also, get a slow cooker. If you really can't handle leftovers, a small cheap $20 one will do. But I think you should consider a bigger one. You don't have to eat the same thing the next day. For example, I cooked a whole chicken in mine this week with carrots and potatoes and then the next day I shredded the leftover meat and mixed it with some tomatillo sauce, Mexican cheese and some sauted onions and peppers and threw it in a parchment lined cast iron pan and warmed it up in the oven. Two delicious, totally different meals and less than 15 min prep for both. You can do pork shoulder and cook it with minimal seasoning and have a hearty roast one night and BBQ pulled pork the next.  

A rice cooker might be useful as well. Throw some rice on, stir fry a protein, toss in some veggies, and there's a healthy meal. 

Just find a couple go-to easy recipes, get comfortable with them, and use them as a base to experiment from. Make a goal to eat dinner at home ____ days a week, then work breakfast in there and then if you really get on a roll you can start making meals ahead of time, upping your goal number of meals at home, and planning lunches. If you have time, spending a couple hours in the kitchen on the weekend pre-cutting veggies and making things ahead of time can make life much easier. And make a habit of cleaning your kitchen every night. It's impossible to keep up the habit of cooking daily if your work area is a mess. 

If you start to have fun with this, you may want to get a high powered blender for easy breakfast smoothies loaded with healthy stuff, making soups - which you can make ahead and freeze - and for making stuff like hummus. Would you quit judging the guy and help out? He's admitted he wants to change and is asking for tips, not to be kicked.Thanks! I make a lot of soup and it never occurred to me to throw some in there!With the limited material we have available  there is no way to truly know the situation. So if we were in a bar I would buy you a beer for your polite and reasonable stance. 

I would like to point out that most of his answers are excuses rather than action. Which is an indication of an addictive behavior. He doesn't even own a fridge! 

In the end I want to help.  From what I read, he is either a troll or has a serious issue. To hammer the point home, we often have posts on how to live on $25 dollars a week or so.  Maybe OP doesn't need to live that cheaply, but at $250+ per week eating out, he could buy your suggested inventory today, and still come out way over budget for a thread like that.  And it's a one time expense.That must be some bitchin soup. Thank you!!I think you should try it on r/frugal.

They will be far more encouraging and helpful
than what I'm seeing here.Probably already mentioned but /r/slowcookingI'd pair that with things that are pretty strong flavored as well: dried fruit, nuts, mushrooms, citrus, bay, asparagus... 

Turkey as a protein, definitely. Scanning through my cookbooks I'm seeing a lot of shrimp as well.

You could cut it with brown and/or white rice if the flavor is too strong and make a pilaf! Throw it in some poultry-based soups as well.I realize this seems uncommon today but back in the 70's I remember my mom cooking for a bachelor who didn't know how to cook. The only thing he knew how to fix was canned soup, so don't feel too bad. The key thing is that you've realized you could save money cooking so you are willing to try something to change your habits. Good for you!

Here are some suggestions to help you out, I know it seems intimidating to try and plan entire meals when you have no idea how to cook. Pick out what might work for you and just be willing to new things. Here is the fun thing, with Youtube you can find videos and watch how other people make things. Find a video on how to make scrambled eggs, or fry up hamburger and see how it's done, that may help to remove some of the intimidation factor.

 * Make a list of the kinds of foods you like. Do you like veggies, or do you prefer meats? How about fruits, pastas, breads, rice, how do those fit in? Don't think too much about it, just jot down some foods you like, this will help you in finding recipes that you like.
 * You can cook for yourself and still cook unhealthy food. I recommend getting familiar with the food groups, portion sizes, etc. Again, Youtube is your friend or see if there is an adult education class where you can learn this information and ask questions. This is to help you figure out portions, what will help keep you doing well, etc.
 * Look for a cookbook for children. I recommend this because you have no experience cooking and a cookbook like this would fit with your experience. As an added bonus, you might find information about nutrition that will also help you. I still have my children's cookbooks from 4-H just for reference.
 * Since you are just starting out you probably don't have the interest right now in taking a lot of time to cook. So check out the box dinners aisle, the canned soups, etc. The dinners are usually pretty simple to fix and have good instructions on the side.
 * Don't worry about starting off with a lot of cooking pans, you can get by pretty simply. And they don't have to be new. I recommend getting a small sauce pan (1 qt), a larger sauce pan (2 qt to 3 qt), a skillet, spatula, stirring spoon, one or two knives for slicing, measuring cups, measuring spoons and a cookie sheet. There are other items you will want to get as you get more experience but these very basic items will get you started. Check in thrift stores, don't worry about getting them new for right now, unless you are worried about using old items. 
 * When you get a refrigerator, you can start planning for left overs. I understand about not liking a lot of leftovers, I don't like the texture and they seem odd. However, some foods work as leftovers, I fix up a batch of veggies, herbs and some ground meat every other week for my lunches. I freeze half and then eat on the other half for the week. The items I pick don't get that soggy texture that I don't like so I don't mind eating on them for the entire week. As a treat, I then eat out from work once a week, because it is nice to get out of the office.
 * When looking at the cost for items, remember that you will get multiple servings. For example, for the meatloaf recipe you quoted a price for, you would probably get at least 3-4 meals from it. Don't like leftovers? Then freeze part of the hamburger, fix up enough for one serving, then fix up everything fresh when you want a new batch. 
 * Have patience with yourself, and remember you don't have to train to be a chef, you just want to learn how to cook some things for yourself so you have more money to spend in other areas. I've been cooking since I was very young and it's only in the last 7 years that I've gotten comfortable with it. Start simple and gradually add things. Every little bit you can do, even if it's just one or two meals a week will help.

Good luck to you.You probably eat much healthier than I do. lol

I also go to the grocery store much more frequently. I don't have a car so I only pick up a bag or two of groceries at a time. Some months are more than others when I run out of certain staples and that month was a particularly low one.  One of my favorite meals is chicken and rice, and it can be both healthy and very filling!  Unfortunately you'll need a way to grill/bake/saute chicken and a small pot to heat the cream of chicken sauce.

All you need is some chicken breasts, instant/regular rice, cream of chicken, and salt and pepper.  If you want to toss some veggies in there, go for it!  You cook the chicken, make the rice, and heat the cream of chicken into a nice creamy sauce (adding a *pinch* of salt and some pepper/other spices) and then just combine to make a pretty darn good meal, in my opinion.  Give it a try!$165/mo on groceries? Wow. I spend that much on one trip, usually more, and I go once every week or two. And it's just my girlfriend and I, and we cook simple dinners/lunches.Straight upYou don't own a fridge?  You are the 1%Is this mixed wild rice (brown rice with wild rice) or straight up wild rice?Many grocery stores will pick out your groceries for you and have it waiting for pick-up. It comes at a price, but that doesn't seem to be a factor. Good luck. Here's one with a good overview from Serious Eats/River Cottage:

http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/09/nasty-bits-offal-deviled-kidneys-recipe.htmlHave you searched online for cheaper buying options for the baby formula? I feel like that there must be a site you can get it cheaper Yes, but a huge portion of humans are lactose intolerant (especially in certain areas -- a huge number of japanese are, for example, iirc) and don't know it. Also, certain women have medical issues that make breast feeding impossible. Also, adoption. Even a mini-fridge works, especially if you don't want to invest in a full-sized one. We have one at our house in England and it helps us keep from buying too much and having things spoil. Sometimes I think it would make my life easier having my own mini rather than sharing one with other people.My meals during my bachelor days by super easy, super fast, as little cooking as necessary and not much money. Try starting here.

* ramen - add water, microwave, some ramen you gota add boiling water to (gota use a pot)
* mac'n'cheese - couple different kinds, but the hardest of them you just boil the noodles and add whatever it says
* microwave meals - stouffers is your new fast food, insert into microwave, insert into microwave and enjoy your feast, kind of pricy (but much less than eating out!)
* pasta - pick any pasta and any canned sauce. Boil the pasta for however long the box says, microwave some sauce and put it on the pasta. You wana get crazy; mix and match the canned sauces, throw ground cheeses in it (any really, white cheeses are best), put a little olive oil in it
* texas pete - texas peat isn't a meal, it's what makes meals. Buy any meat at all, put texas pete on it and cook it in the oven for however long google says to cook it. Salt's pretty good too.
* crock pot - just put some meet in it with bbq sauce and it'll come out awesome, let it cook on low all day long
* milk - milk is awesome for when everything above is too more effort, just drink several cups and it's basically a balanced meal. Blend it with protein powder, chocolate, oats, peanut butter, bananas and/or basically any fruit for variety and more calories.
I can also attest to the instant pot. It's fantastic.  I got mine as a Christmas gift. It's rad.  It slow cooks, rice cooks, and steams as well as any dedicated device.  I also made yogurt in it once; I've never made yogurt before but it was pretty good.

Pressure cooking though, is on another level.  Dried beans cooked in 20 minutes at pressure (30 min overall?).  The other day I tossed in some broth, diced potatoes, diced carrots, a few raw chicken legs,  dried split peas.  15 min at pressure and I could peel the meat off the bones with a fork, and I had some pretty great chicken soup.

I've heard good things about using one to cook tough cuts of meat, so that might be my next adventure.Yes! Paper bags also travel easily to work. Plus you can flavor it however you'd like.
