Borscht is the only preparation that I've loved the flavor of beets. Many years ago a girlfriend of mine had a 6 month teaching assistant position in Novgorod and came back with a wonderful recipe. We made it a few times and I thought it was wonderful. The teacher she worked with came here to the states a year later and helped tweak the recipe a little. I really wish I had a copy so I could make it again. I'm afraid I'd make the effort and find myself disappointed not being able to replicate the flavor from my memory. Regardless I suppose I should give it a shot some day.How much liquid did you put in the slow cooker to start?The one time I tried to do pasta in the slow cooker it was HORRIBLE. Inedible.I've definitely had issues with beans not getting mushy (kind of crunchy almost? mostly the skin...) if I add salt early.Whats beef consomme? Not heard of it before, similiar to beef stock?As long as you don't put it in the crockpot and in the fridge you should be good. If you put your whole crock pot insert in the fridge and then put that in heat, it may crack in the middle of the day.  It's safer to prepare all the ingredients in a separate container (big mixing bowl with saran wrap over it) and dump all of that into the crock pot in the morning.

Just a friendly tip :)I did this last week.  I believe I used a different recipe and added a crap ton more spices and some extra chicken. Also, add okra in.  Adds a great flavor and texture!

I didn't brown anything, but I did make it more of a soup instead of a chunky plate of food.  I did about 5-6 cups of chicken stock and that way the juices were soaked up by the meats (why you brown the stuff in the first place).  The roux takes maybe 5-10 minutes to make so I would suggest just doing that in the morning and cut stuff the night before so you can just toss all of it in the crock pot in the morning.

Good luck! It should turn out wonderfully! I added some rice 30 minutes before the end and that turned out pretty well.I have put cheap steaks right on the bottom with whatever other vegetables in it on low for eight hours and it shreds into ridiculously tender carnitas.  I don't think this is necessarily trueAll of your ingredients should be fine.  They even sell roux in a jar that has a shelf life of 3 years.  What I personally would do is start a pan on the stove and brown all my meats and saute all my veggies (to get a nice fond going) and THEN throw all that in the crock pot.

Source:  From LA and been cooking/eating gumbo for as long as I can rememberI pretty much always go from fridge to crock. Prep the night before, throw into the cooker in the morning before work, meal ready when I get home.

Also thanks for the recipe.  I'm gonna try that one next.That's why I'm skeptical and don't use sodaParsley instead of dill? 

Maybe it's a polish thing, but I feel like every one of my grandma's recipes incorporates dill in some way. It was always fresh from the garden too *sigh* those were the days. Everyone here has posted good answers, but something you might want to keep in mind, as it is a mistake that I've made, is make sure that the cut of meat isn't touching the sides of the slow cooker. This also might be obvious, but the part of the meat touching the slow cooker will be cooked way faster and get tough and burnt.&gt;Polish borscht, its white and uses potato

Not *all* Polish borscht.
No it won't, when the meat releases the liquid in it it'll shrink accordngly, so about the same volume will be used.Nah. Technically you don't need to add any liquid, there's enough liquid in the meat to cook it, I've done it that way a couple of times. Whatever liquid you add is just for the flavor, not because you need more liquid.if the acid wouldn't, why would CO2?  I think the point here is that it doesn't actually help tenderize. 

Thanks for posting a traditional version. I'll probably try that one next.I imagine a lot of people feel the same way about grocery store sushi.The meat will release a lot of juice of its own.  If you start with too much liquid, it will overflow.Fresh beets are great. I like them in a salad with goat cheese, baby arugula and thinly sliced red onion.Now I'm wondering what kind of monster would toss in spaghetti or soba noodle.I totally make this recipe all the time and I love it with the tomato and I use ground pork instead![This one](http://youtu.be/_BwbD6iqaRc) is similar to how my family does it except we don't add garlic, but that's up to you.

Also if you use pork instead of beef I think it tastes better.You sir, have insulted my pig.

:pMight try pork sometime. Tomato juice sounds like an interesting idea. Thanks. :)

Do you think the celery-like stalks of the beets are too bitter to add in?Me too. I actually skipped the tomatoes altogether when I made it and doubled the beets. 

I've been informed this technically stops it from being borscht but i'm a loose cannon that doesn't play by the rules.It looks a little too tomatoey for my likings, but that was nice of you.  I'd still try it.Agreeing with the comment above yours. As long as you keep the environment at 100% humidity (e.g. steamy under a lid), it will braise evenly. It can't dry out because the moisture has nowhere to go in a 100% humidity environment. 

You might want to flip the meat though occasionally to get the flavor of the braising fluids to penetrate evenly.Since you remove the meat from the cooking liquid to shred it anyway, the soda doesn't really stick around. I also use more of a Carolina-style BBQ sauce (mainly vinegar and tomato) that isn't sweet at all.That is precisely what I do everyday. I prepare the food at night, and my GF pulls it out of the fridge the next morning and lights it up. I have heard about issues with the crock going from the fridge straight to the heat. I'll state I haven't had problems with this, but better to be safe than sorry. 

Perhaps give it a try on a day when you'd be there in case everything goes to kittens. Hope that helps.Very good recipe. 

Word of advice though, this is called gumbo, which is more soupy than jambalaya./u/boh_my_god has it right!  Also, note you can ask your grocery store to cut it up for you - most of them will help you out!Just raw, the slow cooker drains out all the fat.please share the correct recipe, I would love to try it, and hate to do it wrong and like it.I have polish and Ukrainian heritage and even within my family there are 3 different types, borscht really only means "eastern European soup" in my mind, I have had some polish versions based on potato!To me borscht came in a jar and tasted disgusting. Then I was convinced to try it at a Kazakh restaurant, it was fantastic!

My fault! The list is supposed to say cream cheese. Fix'd.Yup, either works fine! Just happened had penne lying around.I am from here and have never heard of a place that did an all you can eat, but there are tons of places to get it.Manitoban with Ukrainian ancestry checking in, there us also Polish borscht, its white and uses potatoCame here to say this.That sounds reasonable enough, thank you!If you leave the lid closed for the whole time, the whole cut of meat will be moist.  You can turn the meat over during cooking time though, if you want.  If you put too much in the crockpot , it takes forever for the food to start to cook, I think.I love beef stroganoff and this looks delicious. I'm definitely going to give this a try. Thanks!Cut it up and freeze the chunks you don't use.  I don't think the amount of soda or the other ingredients are critical, just put enough liquid to cover it half way to two thirds or so.  Some onion and seasoning makes a difference, but again, not critical. The barbecue sauce will pretty much outshine all the other flavors anyway.  



Tl;dr: just go for it, you'll be fine. :-) Do you cook the bacon first to render and drain some of the fat?  Or just start from raw? In my experience, all salt does is make the skin of each bean less likely to fall apart. But that's just me.If you eat beans regularly they stop making you fart after a while. I keep trying this with beer...We also cook a lot of black beans (stovetop), never soak them, no problem.What's that?lid on, on the counter. :) Chicken will cook quicker than beef, depends on the cut and sizes though, right?Just to clarify, you said cream cheese in the description but sour cream in the list?Traditional Borscht is all over the place, with the only constant being beets. The recipes vary in so many ways. Some use potatoes, some use cabbage, some use beans, some use beef, some use pork, etc.. You're right that this is the first time I've seen MSG, red wine vinegar or brown sugar, but I use white vinegar (only because my grandma and aunt use sour salt and I have no idea what that is or where to find it) and occasionally table sugar (depending on how much sweetness I get from the beets). 

Anyway, these are all small changes that were made, it's not like OP added noodles and broccoli or something weird like that. I want to upvote you for your confidence, but I want to downvote you because you're wrong.  I'm so conflicted. I have suggestions, because the recipe is not too far from mine: 

* Use pork ribs instead of beef (the pork is much better flavor and texture and the rib bones make for a better broth in the end, just remove the meat from the bones later in the process)
* Use tomato juice instead of diced tomatoes or tomato paste. Your borscht won't taste tomato-ey and you won't lose the beet flavoring, but I absolutely would never make my borscht without the tomato element. It just balances it somehow. I think it needs the acidity (in addition to the vinegar) to balance the sugar and the beets. 
* More dill. Always more dill than they call for :) and it has to be fresh. None of that dried flavorless dill. 
* Diced celery. &gt; liquid from the pork fulfills a roux's fat requirement (it doesn't need to specifically be butter[1] ).

It does not fulfill that requirement.  You're using flour and cornstarch as an emulsifier and while a roux is an emulsifier, a huge part of the emulsification, flavor, and texture from roux is based on the the fact that you're cooking the flour in a fat.  In your instance, yes, you're thickening it, but there's nothing roux about that approach because you don't cook the flour.Borscht originated in the Ukraine and is a soup, not a stew.When I was about 3, I turned a bowl of it upside down on my head (this is usually served cold in my family). Parents left it long enough to take a photo, but I can't imagine how long the clean up was.I hear you guys have all you can eat perogie nights quite often out there. Is this a true fact?[This one](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-carolina-bbq/) is pretty good. I also add ~2 tbsp liquid smoke, and I make [this coleslaw](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/creamy-spiced-coleslaw/) to go with it.No but my husband has, he was quite fond of pyramid pizza though. Pizza is his thing The texture and taste are definitely different, just like anything else pickled vs fresh. They're firmer and sweet, not salty and vinegary. They still turn your pee/poo red, though.

They're cheap enough to buy one, peel it, cut it up and steam it if you'd like to try it. You'd spend way less than a dollar for a small one. I'm not a big fan of pickled beets, but I do love some fresh, steamed beets!

Thanks! Thought it had posted but it must not have gone through. 

8 strips of bacon

3 chicken thighs 

handful of fresh spinach

1 tub of onion and chives philladelphia cheese

herbs and spices (I used mixed herbs, garlic powder and pepper)

Criss-cross the bacon into a weave, then using a meat tenderiser, tenderise and flatten out the chicken fillets. Lay the fillets on top of the bacon weave, spread out the philly cheese and sprinkle herbs on top. Stick the spinach on top of that, then roll it all into a log. I wrapped mine in tin foil, then cooked for one hour on high, 4 hours on low. I think 4 hours on low might have been too much as you can see in the first photo, it's so tender it falls apart but was a bit dry. I think it would be fine on 3 hours on low. At the end, I unwrapped it and chucked it in the oven so it could crisp up!

This recipe is awesome because you can tweak it to your own tastes and add whatever fillings you like! There was about 1 litre of liquid left in the SC after cooking and I reduced it and made it into a nice sauce.Don't forget to post the recipe! I put 6oz of crappy beer (coors light, miller light, bud, PBR, etc) for every lb of meat. Carbonation helps break down the meat, little bit of hops, and you don't get the sweetness from soda.Thanks, Jim. You just can't beet it.Some people shyed away, which I find pretty funny. It's weird how people can have an aversion to something you can get fresh at pretty much any grocery store I've ever been in.What size baking dish do you use?It always looks like a crime scene by the time I'm done.I made this! So good. I had a bunch left, made it into soup, and it lasted even longer! I pretty much use it the same way I use salt and pepper. The crystals are kind of large so I want them to have time to dissolve. In this case I put everything in at the beginning. It would probably work pretty well in stroganoff as well.That's actually kind of an interesting fact. Borscht is kind of known for having beets, but I recently saw that not all of them actually use beets. Now I learn that a lack of tomatoes makes it a completely different soup? I feel like the American educational system has failed me.

Still tastes pretty good though. ;)\*shrug\*

Might not be traditional, but it sure tastes good. I tried a traditional one stovetop last time, but it was very bland. Don't worry - I'm just pushing through a bunch of variations right now. :)Yeah I was wrong there. Usually it is a soup. This specific recipe came out much more like a stew though - not much liquid relative to the other ingredients.

I really need to learn to make perogies as well, actually. It's been a while since I've had them.Thank you for the dinner recipe for Friday night.i always use some liquid smoke and really adds a great flavor. And then use some smoked paprika in my rub. Tasty!You have a good point. Honestly I had never considered the matter that way..Borscht isn't stew, it's a soup. It's also Ukrainian. It's really popular in Manitoba, as there's a lot of Ukrainians and Mennonites here. 

Edit: [Perogies](https://twitter.com/SafewayCanada/status/524190839908491264) are also popular here.Traditional Borscht is not slow cooked, has tomatoes and most of these ingredients are wrong. Russian and Ukrainian foods don't use msg, red wine vinegar or brown sugar.

Sorry don't want to sound negative, but for someone who grew up on Borscht, this is not it.. I would hate for people to get the wrong impression when they first taste it.
Well Done Dwight!Oh, the Putin bit was pretty good. I just recently found out myself, and just thought I'd share some knowledge.What's funny is that I've always associated borscht with Poland, but before posting a comment I decided that I'd better be certain and check.  A quick skim of [the wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borscht), and the joke just kind of punched me in the face.  OP isn't wrong, I just thought it was funny.That looks like penne not egg noodles.I have the same slowcooker as you are, but one digit stopped working..

Borscht should be made with tomatoes as well, otherwise it is svekolnik (from Svekla - beet) - other beer soup with veggies. 

I am going to give this recipe a try! I bought some MSG recently. Do you find that putting it in with the rest of your seasonings, or right before serving, is the better option with slow cookers?There's Russian and Ukrainian borscht. I have no idea what came first, but there's a distinct variety for each.3ish pounds of pork shoulder cut into 3-4 inch chunks dry run on top and bottom of the pieces. 1/2 bottle of liquid smoke (~1/4 cup) and a shot of bourbon. Cook on low for 10 hours. Makes the perfect pulled pork that tastes like you actually smoked it. Add whatever sauce you feel like. I love borscht but every time I make it I treat it like nitroglycerin.  If it slops on anything, it shall be stained foreverI married into a tight Polish-American family. Barszcz (borscht) is a staple during the winter ethnic holidays. 

It's pretty cool actually. We celebrate all the holidays as any American family would, then we re-convene and celebrate the same holiday as an ethnic family would.

Same people. Different foods. Different customs, different conversations, different etiquette. I don't know of any health reason why you could not use it again. But I would probably throw it out or use it to make some rice.I'm the type of person that hates pickled beets, buts loves borscht. Not trying to start anything, but polish borscht is one of the most satisfying soups you can find. Soooooo good and warms up the very core of your soul. My dad referred to everything my mother cooked that he wasn't a fan of as "borscht." I never stopped to think about what it actually was lolHey Putin, borscht is actually Ukrainian.  You may have taken Crimea and Donetsk, but you can't have our beet stew.You have to cook it longer if you do it like that, that's why rouxs are superior even if you don't want to use proper nomenclature. The roux uses fat to cook the flour quickly.I do the same thing. Amazing flavor. cold sour cream in hot borscht! you can stir it in to make the texture creamier and the temperature acceptable for consumption. OR you can spoon off a little of the sour-cream along with the soup and get a fun surprise of creamy coldness in each mouthful. 

also, rye bread goes super good with it!I've only ever had pickled beats, do real beets taste better? I want to try them, but don't want to waste my time/money if it's a vastly different flavor. That was a pretty ballsy move. I love beets, but I tend to be in the minority on that opinion where I come from. Looks great tho. I'm glad to hear it was a success.  

I'm gonna give this a try soon if I can get my hands on some nice beets. I also like how you kept the ingredients in chunks. The few times I have had borscht it has been pureed. WHAT IS THIS EASTERN CRAP 

Lexington-style is the one true barbecue.Now nothing in my house could possibly fulfill my appetite. God that sounds good. Beef Slowganoff?

Looks delicious!You've never been to Kansas City?after i reuse the frozen stock/broth for another batch, should i throw it out?Once beans are hydrated, it "wakes up" the germinating seed and will start to sprout. I don't about all these fancy words and technicalities, but when you do this to thicken sauces you are supposed to slowly bring it back to a boil while stirring it before you eat it otherwise you can taste the starch/flour....so you actually do cook it. Or...you should if you don't want it to taste crappy. I love white chicken chili!  Never made it in a crock pot before, please let us know how it turned out. 

(The recipe I use is a bit different, no corn and adds heavy whipping cream and sour cream right as it's taken off the stove)

I'll have to give this one a try!

Why would the acid break it down that much better? There isn't a lot of contact between the soda and the inside of the meatI agree that dry-rubbed and smoked is superior (that tasty bark), but this is definitely the easiest method I have tried.  It is not too sweet and still quite tasty. Well you have to consider your audience.  People who regularly like to super-size a meal and drink an entire soda of that size probably like their meat that way.  If people are used to drinking soda, I'm sure its something they really like...the sweet, sweet meat...Never heard of borscht. Awesome! Low and slow, baby. Low and slow.Cool, thanks for the info :)Oklahoma Joe's FTW. Or Jack Stacks FTW. Or Gates FTW. Or Bryants FTW. 


Damn we have some good BBQ here. I love white chicken chili. My wife hates it. 

I might just have to make it again. Not to make her mad, but because it's so darn good. If you ever find yourself in Memphis, go to the original location Central BBQ (it's in Midtown by the Zoo). Best Memphis ribs ever.Gotta try this next week.  What kind of onions did you use and how did you cut them?Ahh okay, thanks :)Then why not say "Because the seared meat is nummy." It's more accurate.You and me both.I live in KC... I pine for Memphis dry rub ribs.I've not tried either recipe yet! They probably both work.No, because it doesn't fully saturate the meat and you don't pour it over the meat after it is shredded.

Personally I prefer fruit juice over soda. I usually put a good hearty rub on my meat, pour an orange/pineapple juice mixture in my crock pot, then place the meat in. Sure the rub mostly washes away on the sides and bottom, but it gets a good ratio of spices into the pot if nothing else.

I much prefer a juice/spice mixture to just dumping some bbq sauce in with the meat. You can always add bbq sauce when you serve, might as well get a different flavor profile on the meat when cooking.Chicken breast: 3-4 hours on low

Chicken thighs/dark meat can go up to 6-8. Yeah I don't really use a recipe for pork shoulders..just apple cider viegar, a little Texas Pete hot sauce, some crushed red pepper, some black pepper, and a pinch of salt.Yep! Sour cream is the usual condiment for borscht. I tend to stir it in.NC here as well - I put a half cup of apple cider vinegar, 1 can of Dr.Pepper, then some garlic salt/black pepper rub on the meat. Dee-licious! You can also add half a cup of BBQ sauce of your choice, it'll still turn out tasting like NC style BBQ.I'm with you. Once you develop a taste for the vinegary Carolina style its hard to go back to the overly sweet, syrupy varieties of BBQ. So good.Well that is very strange. I would have to guesses then.
1) Not hot enough
2) Bad beansMy first stop at a Tx BBQ joint left me completely confused. The menu said : Beef, chicken, sausage. Where the pulled pork?!I just made pulled pork last night! No added sugar and it was super delicious!

I cut a lemon into slices, placed it in the bottom of the crockpot with like 1/4c chicken broth. I rubbed the pork in a mixture of ground ginger, garlic powder, salt, and chili flakes. Left on low for 8-10 hours and it was amazing!How long in slow cooker on high or low?Same here.  Cup Or two of red wine vinegar and the pork in the slowcooker.  Not from the Carolinas but have always been partial to the east Carolina pork. I generally use root beer. I think it adds a really nice background flavor when you add a sweet BBQ sauce to it. Like others have said, you just cook the pork in the soda and then discard that liquid. I don't think it makes the pork taste sweet at all, though I've never done it with Coke; if you use root beer, the meat won't be sweet until you add sweet BBQ sauce to it. My pulled pork is literally carnitas with bbq sauce I've tried both, and it really depends on who I'm sharing it with. I personally prefer to use beer and a little bit of rum instead, but I'm also an alcoholic so I'm kind of an outlier.Late to the party, but this kicked ass.  I was worried the sriracha would be too hot, but it worked out perfectly.

Thanks for sharing!

If you don't cook the flour it's not a roux.Everyone that had some loved it!

Here's the recipe I used:
http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/109254/slow-cooker-borscht/

Main changes were:

- Added about 1/2 teaspoon of MSG (makes it more savory - great in all stews)
- Leaving out the tomatoes and tomato paste (I like my borscht more beet flavored)
- Extra beets (added a can of sliced beets to suppliment the fresh ones)
- Put the cabbage in from the start instead of waiting until the end
- Cooking on High for 5-ish hours instead of low so it would be ready by lunch time.I do think a lot of it has to be where you grew up. I live in KC and love BBQ. I've gone to other places through the country and anything is ever as good as home.Holding in the juices misnomer doesn't bother me at all.

Anything that keeps people searing meat.The recipe that you linked to says to fill the slow cooker with water while OP's link says to just put 6oz of BBQ sauce on them (which doesn't sound like enough to submerge them). Which would you recommend?Hello!  Former food science guy here.  The soda doesn't contain "ingredients that will begin to break down your meat."

This is right up there with people talking about how searing "holds in juices."Ha of course everyone has their preference. I've tried many types of BBQ, but having grown up near NC I'm partial to that style. My dad makes it nc style, with his own smoker too. Its to die for. It's probably the one meat I would never prepare in a crock potNothing is best in TX. No one wins there.Yes, which I why I corrected him in that thread the other day too.I lay down a raft of sliced onions, add a can of petite diced tomatoes, then the pork.  Let it go 8 hours.  The acid in the tomatoes helps to break down the meat; the tomatoey-ness won't clash with your barbeque sauce; the onions add moisture and glutemates for flavor.  After 8 hours, the onions are basically disintegrated. Then I add my bottled sauce and take off the lid until it reduces to my desired sauciness.yes, he wasDisagree.  TX BBQ is the best.Disagree. KC BBQ is the bestI guess this poster was wrong

http://reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2v97bh/pulled_beef_wow/cofshz2
That's what's up. When I was writing my comment above I thought /r/smoking might be cigarette enthusiasts or something.I use diet soda I find it cuts down on the sweetness. Also I rub my pork with garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper prior to pouring to soda on it. Honestly I've never really measured it. maybe 1/4-1/2 cup? Just enough so the pork is (almost covered) ~~covered~~ while in the bag. Worce about 6-8 dashes, its really up to how much you like the stuff though.Amen.As you can see from all the comments it depends on your personal taste. For me it does make it way too sweet.

I just cut up an onion, put it on bottom, put about a cup or so of apple cider vinegar in there (pork shoulders are fatty enough to not need much liquid), then put the pork on top after giving it a nice dry rub. Then about a half hour before I'm ready to eat it, I shred it, add a vinegar based bbq sauce, and let it marinate some more before eating.Well i don't think it's the carbonated water that's supposed to do it but rather the acid in Cola.Never use diet soda, it will not be edible.i use this, every time i slowcook pork...whether its for carnitas, or pulled pork......it adds enough citrus and a bit of smokiness. 

http://c4.q-assets.com/images/products/p/khr/khr-1784b_1z.jpgI just cut up an onion, put it on bottom, put about a cup of apple cider vinegar in there (pork shoulders are fatty enough to not need much liquid), then put the pork on top after giving it a nice dry rub.I don't think so, but then I like sweet.

If I'm going for a more savory palette, I like braising in beer.  Works great in ghetto carnitas.Its just a cheap and easy way to get some sugars into the cooking process.Seriously... I have no idea how winter vegetables make it into Filipino dishes, but it's a must.how much vinegar and Worcestershire do you use? Aprox is ok, just trying to understand if it is 2tbps of vinegar or 4 cups... and then the Worce ratio. Can you provide me your recipe, pretty please? I need a fellow North Carolinian to trust! I'm not sure about it making the pork to sweet, but the soda isn't necessary at all.  I make a pork shoulder every week in the crock pot and I've never put any liquid in during the slow cook.  The rendered fat from the pork cooking is the best sauce for keeping the pork moist in my experience.  Why not just add club soda if it breaks it down? You could then save the juices without being too sweetI've always been skeptical about this too. I've cooked this recipe, but it hasn't turned out any more tender than the normal low and slow cooking. If coke was only used in this recipe to break down collagen, then why aren't we soaking brisket? &gt;sugar is one of the first ingredients in most of them

Sadly it's high fructose corn syrup for most of them.Not being negative, but /r/smoking is a great sub if anyone's looking for something like that.In my opinion NC style BBQ can't be beat! Love that stuff!I'd put money on this person living in Texas or another big BBQ state.  And therefore it's sacrilegious to not do it "low and slow" and my god it's like putting ketchup on a steak.. :P&gt;  All the soda does is introduce ingredients that will begin to break down your meat

Source?

Its the long cooking time that breaks down the collagen in the meat and makes it tender.I love to slow cook my potatoes with swiss chard, but lately I like to use some butternut squash.  But really, you should be making home-made chips. As with all things, it's a matter of personal taste. To answer your question directly, NO, the soda itself does not make the meat overly sweet, but YES, the barbecue sauce at the end abso*lutely* could.

  Not all sauces are created equal. Some are thinner and more vinegar-based, others might as well be smoky-red molasses (I think sugar is one of the first ingredients in most of them). Some people use a whole bottle of sauce on the final product, while others will add a little at a time until they are happy with how it tastes. Still others may leave the pork alone and let people decide how much sauce they want on their individual serving.

  People are all up in arms in this thread about "the way it SHOULD be done", but that's a garbage philosophy. Different strokes for different folks. The only absolute of cooking is that there are no absolutes! This is much better than adding crappy soda to it.#####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;__Roux__ /ru/ (also __rue__) is a substance created by cooking wheat [flour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour) and [fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat) (traditionally [butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter)) as the thickening agent.

&gt;A roux is used in three of the [mother sauces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_sauce) of [classical French cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_classique): [bchamel sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9chamel_sauce), [velout sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velout%C3%A9_sauce), and [espagnole sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espagnole_sauce).

&gt;[Clarified butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarified_butter), [vegetable oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil), bacon drippings or [lard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lard) are commonly used fats. It is used as a thickener for [gravy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravy), other [sauces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce), [soups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup) and [stews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew). It is typically made from equal parts of flour and fat by weight.  When used in Italian food, roux is traditionally equal parts of butter and flour.

This is a crock pot sub.  It's not the same method as smoking it.  I don't think I can explain it any further without sounding condescending.Well, I do add a teaspoon or two of flour/cornstarch to about a quarter cup of liquid, whisk, and reintroduce to the rest of it (to avoid clumping). It's making a sauce from a roux base, but in reverse. The dissolved fat already in the liquid from the pork fulfills a roux's fat requirement (it doesn't need to specifically be [butter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux)).

But yes, I see what you're saying. It's a sauce with a thickening agent added in after the fact.Cool, I'll have to try that next time I slow cook something with lots of drippings.Interesting! I'd love to try, any good recipes? Lamb is quite cheap where I live.Yes, a roux is really just a fancy word for a thickener.  The longer you cook your roux, the darker it gets and the less thickening power it has.  You'd probably want to make the roux then add it to the warm drippings slowly to thicken the drippings.Can you add the drippings to a roux?Use diet soda?The beans were well covered the entire time, I was using a smaller pot than the recipe suggests.I bought them from a bulk ingredient store about a month ago, I'm not sure how long they were in the store for before I bought them but I know they have fairly high stock turnover so I can't imagine it would have been too long. &gt; with instructions from a person in the Philippines

There are regional differences in cooking adobo and even differences between family recipes.

Carrots and potatoes? WTF kind of blasphemy is this. I may have to try it just to see the difference.I soaked them for around 12 hours overnight, and they swelled up but not to the point of being out of the water. Should I have waited for them to do so?I soaked them for around 12 hours overnight, then put them in the slow cooker where they spent another 10.5 hours.I'm just saying if we're talking about the way the pros do it, we're in the wrong sub.

Get a smoker and go to /r/smokedmeats or something.Which is why I said "most".Well no shit.&gt;That's how every decent barbecue place in the country does it.

They don't throw it in a crock pot either. They smoke it.
Not my kind of bbq. In east NC we use a vinegar based sauce that isn't sweet in the slightest. Some times you will have a sweet slaw and sometimes the slaw won't be very sweet either. But our sauce is never sweet.You don't reduce something into a roux. A roux is simply flour cooked in butter for a period of time, which usually becomes the basis for a sauce.The BBQ sauce you use will definitely make more of a difference than the soda you cook it in since it is drained later. Pick your usual BBQ that isn't too sweet and it won't be too sweet. You can also use the sauce sparingly since a lot of flavor comes from just cooking it. I use ginger ale instead of cola.  No risk of too sweet.Not at all too sweet. In fact, I'd go as far to say that it's the best way to make it IMO. This super bowl, I didnt make it for the first time in 5 years and I actually had people mad at me because they love it so much. If it were too sweet, I dont think I'd be having people clamouring for it. 

Just to be safe though, I add vinegar to give some tang when I remove the soda and add the bbq sauceYou could use some dark beer too. One or two for the pork, one or two for you!Because I'm right and on the internet you have to listen to me!I've used soda in a slow cooker and pressure cooker with excellent results, the result flavor was not overtly sweet.Honestly, I just take the pork out of the wrapper, dry it off with a paper towel, and put it in the slowcooker.  Put the lid on, turn it to low and go to work.  I come home and add a trace of liquid smoke and pull while using the drippings to keep things moist.  If desired, I'll toss some into a hot cast iron skillet to get some "bark".  

Then you can add whatever BBQ sauce you want.  I'm particularly fond of a mustard-based Carolina type BBQ.  

I'm not a big fan of adding liquids to pulled pork.  I like the taste of the pork, not marinades or rubs....YMMV. :DAre you trying to start a slapfight here?

It's not like you're going to even be eating this pulled pork, so why is it so important to you what other people like?

And why do I have the feeling this whole thing is going to wind up with me putting you on ignore?You can also reduce the remaining liquid in a saucepan to a roux and store it for other meals, or to 'reintroduce' in condiment-sized portions when reheating the pulled pork leftovers. Extremely tasty and I don't feel like I'm being wasteful dumping it down my sink.If you pour a bottle of sweet baby rays into your finished pulled pork like most people here do, it's going to be too sweet.  I don't care if you drained the soda first or not.Depends, if you water a soda down to about half it's original strength, would you say it's too sweet?  Because by the time you're done cooking that's about the strength of the liquid - I typically start with 12oz of soda and end up with about 24oz of liquid at the end.

As for the BBQ sauce, they do make varieties that are significantly less sweet than what most people think of when they think BBQ sauce, but they may be hard (to impossible) to find depending on where you live.Because you're being a snob. 

And let's just ignore the "it's not too sweet"  posts all over.  you say so so it **must** be true. /s

TL;DR  You might want to stop pointing your nose so far up.  You're going to drown if it rains.Why?  Have you ever had good pulled pork?  The shit that get posted on this sub would only taste good to a 5 year old with a sweet tooth.&gt; ost barbecue sauce it just as sweet as soda.

I nodded at that part, cringed at the rest.Old family recipe we use. Half a cup of soy sauce, one cup of vinegar and 3 cups of water. small container of pickling spice with lots of garlic. 

Pork, chicken, whatever meat really. Lots of garlic to flavor.

served over rice its amazing.

I normally make about 6x this with a fistful of pickling spice in a seasoning pouch and 6 heads of garlic.

pepper is normally added in the bowel. I haven't tried bay leaves yet. It used to be made with brown sugar but we stopped that a while back.Do you put a lid on the tupperware? Also on the counter or in the fridge?Not when you throw in a 12oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce the way i do it.In a pinch I can just pour in equivalent of water and drop in a bullion cube.Personally I'm a fan of Garlic-Rosemary pulled pork.

Give it a rub with fresh rosemary, salt, pepper and cumin. Cut slits in the roast and insert slices of garlic all over. Marinade overnight in apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and a bit of olive oil. 

Slow cook fat side up with all the marinading liquids, I usually throw a couple extra sprigs of rosemary in the juice too. The drippings make a delicious gravy afterwards, perfect for mashed potatoes.I only ever use vinegar..however I'm from NC so I think my taste buds are permanently attuned to that.Have you tried turning it off and back on again?You have to soak the beans. This happened to me the first time I made black bean soup. I was all, "Soak the beans? Ain't nobody got time fo dat." So then my soup took like forty hours to cook. Ever since, I'm a tried and true bean soaker, and my soups are perfect in a reasonable amount of time.Every time I make pulled pork everyone loves it.  I use the simple recipe where all I add is a sliced onion and cup of ginger ale.  Afterward I add in Sweet Baby Rays.   
As others have said, you remove the juices afterward, and it isn't sweet at all.  Last time my wife used that to make a delicious french onion soup.Just recently I concocted a recipe for Superbowl and it came out amazing. I love mac and cheese and it was some of the best I've had.

I don't have it down to a science, but this is basically what I used.

* 1 small container of sour cream
* 1 can of cream of chicken
* 4 cups of Mexican shredded cheese
* 1 small can rotel
* 1 box of elbow macaroni cooked al dente
* 2-3 chicken breasts fully cooked, shredded, and seasoned

So for the chicken I made a big crockpot batch of taco chicken separately and beforehand (another recipe). I make the chicken and freeze into bags so I can make chicken tacos whenever I want. I had leftover and dumped about 2-3 breasts worth of the shredded chicken into the mac and cheese. Came out incredible. I haven't tried it without the chicken so you may need to tweak the recipe. I put the crockpot on low for 2 hours, stirring a few times. It will start burning after a while so once you hit the 2 hour mark keep an eye on it and drop to warm setting when you like the consistency.Well, Im speaking about the traditional recipes used here on Reddit.  I  typically use a rub for the pulled pork myself.  And then if I think it needs something, I add it at the end.  Most barbecue sauce it just as sweet as soda.  Pulled pork is much better if you just use a dry rub.  That's how every decent barbecue place in the country does it.  Sauce can be added to the sandwich if desired.Thanks! Going to find out tomorrow for lunch!!No! The grocery was out of all the cuts I wanted to use and the lamb was what was available.That's ok. I get into work at 6am and usually eat somewhere around 12-1pmWill do!
I never taste soda or any kind of sweet flavor. Just deliciously tender and juicy artery-clogging pork.Nope.  It really doesnt.  Typically the drippings are discarded and then you add bbq sauce and cook it more.  But I actually use the leftover juice a bit and mix it with bbq sauce and cook it down on the stove.  Its delicious.  And its not sweet at all.  Trust me, I totally understand why you would think it would be really sweet.  Its not.  Good to know. Thanks!A leg of lamb takes 2-3 hours to cook in the oven at 350F. Unless you have a tiny, deboned joint it's going to take at least that long in the slowcooker.Pinto do not. Don't chance it with other beans. Orange marinated lamb is huge where I live. You should try it, it's amazing. It's better to use an orange liqueour than plain orange juice in my opinion thoughI saw on cook's country they brine the dry beans. Basically let them sit in salt and water solution. I tried it once and it came out pretty well.Same here. That's too much soy sauce. No sugar, no ginger, but I do use bay leaf.PM me your address! It's only too sweet if you leave it in with the rest of the meat. Once your pork is done, toss the leftover cola and the drippings. All the soda does is introduce ingredients that will begin to break down your meat, leaving it tender.

Pull your pork, use your own sauce. You should be good to go.Thanks for this comment! Your recipe removes all the things I don't like (picky picky me). Sounds delicious! :)Alright, I'm back, so here's a rough outline of the recipe (sorry for the lack of formatting, I'm on mobile): 

-one orange, quartered and sliced as thin as possible 

-one cup water 

-one half cup of sugar

-one half cup corn syrup*

-one quarter cup mint chiffonade (more or less to taste)

Put all ingredients, except mint, in small sauce pan. Simmer uncovered on medium low to medium heat until meat of orange slices has fallen off and the pith (white part) is translucent; ten to twenty minutes. Let cool until room temperature, check for desired consistency, adjusting by adding water or corn syrup and reheating, and stir in mint chiffonade. 

*I'm pretty sure that's the right ratio of corn syrup, but I'm not entirely positive. Regardless, it should be close. Also good to note that leaving the pith will make the final product somewhat bitter, which may or may not be to your liking. If you're unhappy with this, then a sectioned orange and its zest could be substituted, I suppose. I ate a lot of beans growing up and my mom never soaked the beans. She always cooked with pinto beans. They were always fine so I don't get why beans need to be soaked. I think at most she would rinse and let them soak until her pot of water was boiling and then throw them into the boiling water. Do pinto beans not need to be soaked like other beans? not always. If you have to large a croakpot the liquid could be spread out so much that it does not cover the beans. You are right that normally this does not happen, but thought it should be something to look at.How old were the beans? 

If you find some that have been lurking at the back of the cupboard for years, they might have reached the stage where they never cook.  They're best if they are less than a year old, in which case you can generally just chuck them in the slow cooker with enough water and they'll cook fine, no soaking required.  When they're too old, no amount of soaking is gonna rescue them.Soaking beans like this also mitigates the presence of phytic acid and other antinutrients in beans. Also, soaking reduces the amount of raffinose (which causes the err hmm musical effect of beans.)Yeah I think the main change I would make next time is taking the advice about the ratio of soy sauce and vinegar,  like others have pointed out. It was a bit a strong. I'll    mix around the other suggestions too,  thanks! Lots of soaking suggestions but I haven't found that to be necessary if you cook the beans in DISTILLED water. The minerals in water can fuck up the cooking of beans.

I've been able to cook black beans in four hours and garbanzo in six. That's with no soaking at a all and cooking them in the slow cooker on both low and high.When I soak beans they usually swell more than 2 inches in the bowl. Were your beans still submerged after the soak or did they grow so much the top layer was out of the water?Lives in the Philippines for a couple years. And you are correct, except some people would add the sugar. That was a personal tasteI also made this a couple weeks ago.  I love ginger, so this was fantastic for me.  For the average person I'd suggest cutting the ginger back by half (at least).  Also I would go with a closer to 50/50 vinegar and soy mix.  I think the sugar and bay leaf ad a nice texture.  While this may not be an authentic adobo, it sure was tasty.Adobo is an interesting beast.  I traveled a few of the islands of the Philippines for a few years, and every time I had Adobo it was different.  Sometimes it was a strong ginger and vinegar flavor.  Others were more sweet and sticky because of lots of sugar.  
My favorite had a nice sticky and sweet sauce that contrasted very well with the vinegar and peppercorn flavors, and had very little ginger in it.  
Tl: dr, there really is not right or wrong way to make adobo.  It's all preference as long as the base ingredients are similar.  [really?!](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-11044-Breaking-Bad-WHAT-gif-WAT-WOT-qP9W.gif)I'd say  no longer than 2-3 days, but I honestly don't know!I really like this idea, thanks. Dumb question: you've got to use them at that point, right? You couldn't just leave them soaking in water in the fridge for a while, could you? I'm sorry, I just have very little experience with dried beans haha!You don't even need to refrigerate! Just leave them, covered , on the counter. There's never a bag of bean in my pantry cause they go right into water!Not with a slow cooker but a few days ago I baked 4 chicken breasts with a tbsp or two of olive oil, I shredded the chicken in the ceramic dish and that soaked up most of the water and added back some of the flavor that rubbed off.I don't want to be one of "those" people but I made adobo with instructions from a person in the Philippines and it's a bit different and came out amazing. 

* Carrots &amp; Potatoes
* No Ginger
* No Sugar
* 50/50 ratio of vinegar to soy sauce (also, they use cane vinegar which is more pungent than rice vinegar, if you can't find cane vinegar, use coconut vinegar)
* Pork belly

All this makes it a completely different dish. I tend to tout my version since it was absolutely one of the best things I've ever eaten. I think the secret was deglazing the pork belly with some beer.I'm actually down to do that. Filipino here:  I would never use this recipe.  Use a 50/50 mix of soy sauce and vinegar (1/3 cup each is fine).  Garlic, onions, black pepper are a must.  Type of chicken doesn't matter.  You can use pork too.

Never sugar, never tried ginger, and maybe 1/10 times I make this I use bay leaf.  

Start there and modify next time you make.  My sister prefers more vinegar than soy sauce.  This recipe prefers more soy sauce than vinegar.  My wife can't get past the 50/50 mix.This is pretty much dried bean cooking protocol, i cant believe people don't do this.I would try adding more liquid and let sit somewhere cold, like a fridge, or if you live in the northern hemisphere, the garage or porch.  Let sit overnight or longer in the liquid.  Then cook again for at least 8 hours.  I have done this with bean soup and saved it.Make sure you are soaking your beans completely submerged. I tend to do it for a full day. Secondly don't add any salt until they are done cooking. It's a weird trait beans have. If you add salt too soon they simply don't cook right. Thirdly check the liquid level periodically and make sure your beans are covered fully until they are done. You can always reduce the liquid if needed.This is a great idea that I am stealing.Even in a larger crockpot the beans will spread out and so will the liquid. they should still be covered at the same proportion in any vessel. Could have been the salt content in the recipe, it makes beans stop cooking and can lead to odd bean textures if salt is added before they are cooked.I tried this same recipe a few weeks ago, but mine was just full of the ginger flavor. If I had to do it all over again, I would use less ginger, and maybe add another bay leaf or two.I love mint and and orange but I've never used orange juice in a slow cooker. Whatever you do please post an update to let us know how it goes.Even if OP is not interested, I'd like the marmalade recipe. Not too many people notice that!Orange and mint is such a good combo in my opinion. A quick Google search of Orange mint lamb gave lots of results. You could definitely braise the lamb in orange juice and use the liquid to make a sauce.

Alternatively, at work we make an orange mint marmalade for savory foods, but mainly cheese. That might be a good substitute for mint jelly in this case. Let me know if you're interested and I can give you a rough recipe (I'm not at work today). Eye of round roast holds up well.  
Here's a [taco soup recipe](http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/16678/slow-cooker-taco-soup/?ast=taco%20soup&amp;asas=Mobile%20Home%20Page&amp;asat=Quick%20Search&amp;ase=event10,event8) to get you started with the ground beef, pretty easy and hard to mess up. Search that site for other slow cooker recipes, many good ones. Enjoy!I didn't have wine on hand, and a few recipes called for dark beer, which was easier and less expensive for me to get. It probably changes the taste a bit, but I'm not sure how. I've never knowingly had FOS with wine, so I don't know.Thanks, that was what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure because the ground beef is the only major source of fat in the recipe.The best mac n cheese I've ever had I made in a slow cooker. I like them creamy though, not crispy or together like baking often is used for. I likely could bake it too, it just is easier when I don't want to have to time it exactly right and grab it in a more forgiving time range.Definitely want to brown and drain the beef before adding, as with any ground beef in a soup.I wrap. I'm afraid if I cut the ribs, all the mojo will be lost. Pork spareribs?

Username checks out.I use onions, mushrooms, and carrots, sometimes asparagus. Don't really mess around with corn because it doesn't really have much as far as nutritional value goes. Why use beer instead of wine? Ive only ever made this kind of soup once admittedly but that called for wine.Anytime I work with any type of dried bean, as soon as they come home from the market they're rinsed, put in Tupperware, and covered with water. They can stay like this 1-2 days before draining and slow cooking. I never get undercooked beans anymore. Orange Juice and lamb? Quite a funky combo that one!

Do you have any beef, or even better lamb stock cubes?toss em, but they should have been soaked through. All I can think of is your crock pot is bigger then the recipe calls for and the beans were not completely covered.It came out super dry though I had plenty of liquids. I think my crockpot it reaching too high of a temp too quickly. . I cooked it on "low" for 8 hours. I also just made ribs for the first time ever in my slow cooker (first slow cooker recipe ever also) they turned out AMAZING. I feel yaYeah it can be really hard to find up north!  Sometimes you can find a bag of frozen sliced okra hiding amongst the peas and stuff.Sobey's carries it in Canada.. at least where I am.I had this happen once, also with baked beans, years ago. Still not sure why, but I've heard either too much acid or too much salt too early in the process can stop beans from cooking thoroughly. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to salvage them.If you send me a bottle of dat maple syrup.. 

I'll send you couple of bottles of Stubbs Was the cooker plugged in and turned on?was nice with black beans, corn and diced tomatoes, so goodI must be a mutant because I don't like Stubbs or Sweet Baby Ray's at all. :(Really appreciate that :) thanksThank you very much!Huh, my mom's ironing board has a row of mushrooms on it. I guess it's from the 1970s.I cut mine with stone ground mustard. It's the goods.The roast i did 2 days ago in the crock was a big steak, and it turned out great. It had 2 big sections of fat, so the meat didn't dry out in the crock and it was easy to pick out after it was cooked. http://www.foodsubs.com/Photos/chuckpotroast.jpg This is what mine looked like. Slow cooking is very forgiving, but I have had some dishes fail. Why was your roast a failure?My wife and I do slow cooker ribs all the time and they are amazing and tender. Literally wrap the ribs so the flat meaty side is against the wall of the slow cooker. Also when they are done pour more BBQ sauce on top and broil them quick. Crispy and tender and perfectI'm alive!Cooked for 5 hours,  came out really good! Had a pretty strong soy sauce and garlic flavor with a distinct cut of bay leaf in there. Lots of onions, but boy do I love me some sweet slow cooked onions. 

Here's the recipe: 

http://www.chow.com/recipes/30473-slow-cooker-chicken-adoboI stupidly did not take a picture before cooking* it, but will next time if I am in doubt. I will also look for fattier cuts.. plus aren't "roasts" supposed to be cylinder in shape? Mine looked like a big steak. Lol. It was an all around fail. I love vegetarian curries, pasta sauces, and soups in the crockpot. Desserts are also good in the slow cooker if you want to just pull something out of the fridge from last night and have a left over night but want something special to accompany it! (crisps, puddings, etc.)My only concern is that it would dry out and overcook much quicker with the lower volume. Perhaps on low and if you check it often to make sure it doesn't overcook? Stubb's &gt; Sweet Baby Ray's all day longI probably have a little more experience than you in slow cooking, but take what I say with a grain of salt. In my experiences, anything with a healthy amount of fat is good for making a pot roast. Big cuts that have a few big pieces of fat like chuck roast, bottom sirloin, and possibly round are all good. London broil and skirt steak are generally thin cuts, so I don't like them for pot roast, but they are great for chili. Last time I made pot roast (3 days ago) I didn't even look at the label, just the marbling on the meat.

If you upload a picture of the actual meat, we can probably tell you more. it's usually 160ish core temp for 10 minutes to safely kill all bacteria..


chances are it's okay, but certainly wouldn't call it safe, more borderline.It's also in Washington, DC (and Virginia &amp; Maryland).Meh BBQ sauce that people who only buy barbeque sauce from Walmart think is good.

It's not bad, but it's nothing special. Pork seems to do better when the long cook is in a thinner liquid (water, beer, [Dr. Pepper](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/yuqst/pulled_pork_using_dr_pepper_and_a_slow_cooker/)) then drained and add the barbeque sauce at the end.  I would guess that would be the same with the sweet Asian sauces.If the chicken didn't reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees, I wouldn't eat it. I only use a little. Can't imagine people using a whole damn bottle.Thanks!  I'm apparently spacially challenged, but don't think my question deserved downvotes!?!I'm off to find some purple potatoes!! Anything that tastes like bacon is a-ok in my cookbook!Cut them into 2 piece segments, rotate them up 90 degrees and place them in on the side that's been cutStubbs is amazing. Thanks! It was tossed with olive oil, a bit of minced garlic, salt and pepper to taste and cooked at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes.well....try eating it then?

if i dont hear from you in a couple hours i'll sound the alarmsSurprisingly it's not, it's all intact stillSame thing but now with better spelling! i feel like it would be reduced to textureless mush.....Cook for 10 min.  
 
 2 tbl spoons liquid smoke

 2 tbl spoons brown sugar

 celery seed

 salt &amp; pepper

 2 tbl worcestershire sauce

 2 tsp spoons grape jelly

 14 oz ketchup

 1/2 cup water

 3 tbl spoons dry mustardMade this today... IMO  there's too much soy sauce, next time I'll try less soy sauce and more honeyCurly's is fantastic and also uses real sugar.I did. I cooked them stacked for half the cook time, turned them on their side, encircling my crock pot for the other half, and then finished them under the broiler. I was surprised and disappointed at how bad they turned out given how often I see wonderful, successful posts such as this one. I'll admit to still being confused. Can someone clearly define "side"?Recipe: 

3-4 chicken breasts

2 cans, cream of chicken

3 cups of chicken broth

Garlic

1/4 stick of butter

Shit ton of Buffalo sauce

Onion (optional)

I served this over rice.
I use the "Good Eats" recipe, slow cook in the oven for a few hours in a foil package with juice and vinegar, take em out, add sauce, put under broiler.I always make my own simple BBQ sauce and never measure, so can't give an exact recipe, just ketchup, molasses, liquid smoke and something like Mrs. Dash, my friends and co-workers all really like it.  Only tip is more ketchup than molasses.No. I've just seen a few recipes for it online when looking for new slow cooker ideas. Wanted to try it out to compare to how I normally do it.I do enjoy stubbs a great deal. Did you put them under the broiler before eating them?  That made a big difference. I cut them in to segments,  but that should definitely also work. Stubb's makes decent BBQ sauce and uses actual sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.&gt; you just want to eat food you are used to sometimes.

yeah, most of my international travel has been aligned with heritage so I'm very lucky that even the strangest food doesn't seem too abnormal. but if you asked me to eat raw carrots/broccoli/ranch dip regularly I'd probably go batty :-)That's just how my family always made it, gave it a nice crisp top layer =p. I might have it once or twice a year these days.  The recipe says to cut the ribs into 2-rib segments. So I would deduce OP means put these segments onto their sides, rather than wrapping the whole rack around the inside of the pot.

EDIT: If you want to cook the whole rack without cutting it, you could just wrap the whole thing around the inside of the pot, [like this](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-baby-back-ribs/).Roasting pan?? For mac and cheese???? Get a Pot get anything its not a hard thing to make.I'm just gonna assume you're a subscriber there and ask you what is generally considered a good/great store bought sauce? I've made my own a number of times and prefer it, but sometimes I *just don't wanna*.Probably for the same reason I did it, no roasting pan available at the time and a good one wasn't in the budget.

I should probably remedy that situation.I'm guessing those are the downvoters. Ha. I cooked ribs for the first time not too long ago. 

I removed the ribs and pures out the glop about 3 hours in. I only used dry rub while can owing. 

Will mop Pwith BBQ sauce next time, but they came out nice and tasty. I was thinking like chicken or pork with some asian sauces like sweet and sour or just some different barbeque sauces Dude, if it was just me, that'd be every meal. Some people don't like bbq sauce to have any flavour besides sweet. It also tastes like pure sugar. I don't get the appeal.I found the recipe here: http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/223464/slow-cooked-white-chili/

I halved the recipe and decided to shred the chicken instead of cubing it. Only a few hours left and we'll see if it's any good! I was just about to poise the same question, glad I'm not the only one confused by this! I would highly recommend using a few already-written recipes to get comfortable with your slow cooker before just throwing stuff in. If your sauce has a high sugar content, and you're cooking on high for a long period of time it can be prone to burning.

What cuts of meat/sauces are you considering? If you can find a similar recipe, chances are it will work out fine.Thats good..Mac and cheese is so easy to make and so easy to make GREAT! Every other day seems like people try to crock pot it.I only tried it once.  The results was _okay_, but I doubt I'll do it again.Thanks for the reply, I am probably worried over nothing. CheersQuestion!! And I really hope it gets answered :) when the recipe states, "place ribs on their side in your slow cooker"... I feel so dumb that I need this to be explained. Do you cut them individually and put them on their side? Or wrap the whole rack around in the slow cooker. I want to try this tomorrow night! Thanks. I leave the lid on. I don't know the science behind it but they end up brown and tender, with a nice sweet taste, as if I had done it in a pan (or even better in my opinion). They do sit in some juice but the result is still amazing!They taste even better if you slow bleed the pigDo you leave the lid on or off? I know carmelizing  the onions requires taking all of the moisture out of them so I am worried about them sitting in their own juice and bit working their magic. mmm... gonna try this out.

Does anyone have good homemade BBQ sauce recipes? My mom has those same ceramic canisters!!!Why?Can I ask why for the love of good do people want to make mac and cheese in a slowcooker?Are you a Student?Nice!Did you create this recipe?I live here too...got mine at WalmartUsually I do 4-6 onions, but soup pan that I have doesn't have the widest bottom (I mean, I can do a pot roast in it) and I cook them on  low. So it usually takes me around 2 hours. But that's still really only enough soup for about 4 ish people.I really want to try this, those look amazing, and it will be a nice change up from all the soups I've been making. 

Thanks for sharing! just a big heaping pile of meat. nothing else.I've been having some bad times w/ using BBQ sauce for ribs or Chicken Thighs. I always end up with a soup./r/bbq would like a word with you, /u/southernboy90walmart sells themPurple peppers are totally a thing! As are purple tomatoes, purple carrots, and even purple potatoes! 

I made purple mashed potatoes once using just milk, butter, garlic, and some S&amp;P, and I swear they tasted like bacon. Mostly high fructose corn syrup. You can make your own BBQ sauce super easily! Keeps for a long time.Removing the lid releases very little heat. The crock and the stuff inside contain the majority. I stir and baste several times throughout the cooking. I've never an issue. Experiment and find what works best for you. 

Through my own trials the only thing that makes a difference is salt content. If salt is needed, add it when served. Otherwise you risk making your ingredients dry despite being submerged in liquid. Even doing several onions at once, you're looking at about an hour. Onions caramelize at about the 45 minute mark.

I imagine it could take a couple hours if you were doing a ton of onion in a small pan, but I cannot imagine spending 2 hours caramelizing onions...People seem to love it but I think it's *way* too sweet. I hadn't seen a Safeway until I moved to Winnipeg. It seems to be more in Western Canada.I've started to see Sweet Baby Ray's sauce in Canadian grocery stores....What the heck is Safeway? I'm not even kidding. I'm in Ontario. It turned out just fine, it was only a few items that we above the broth.  My question we more generally speaking, should you ever stir your slow cooked meals, and if you do how should you compensate for the lost hear.The first and last time I made slow cooker ribs they turned out grease/fat covered. They were inedible. They come out much better for me using the oven.You can find it in Canada pretty easily, I would think. My local Safeways in Winnipeg stock it, and I've seen it in Fortino's when I'm visiting my parents in Oakville.one of the best sauces in the land

also amazon is amazing. 

http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=sweet+baby+raysHow did it end up turning out?
I'm still very curious if there is a max time on each meal were you need to cap the cook time at.I use these guys for wraps. [Gem Wraps](http://www.newgemfoods.com/products/gemwraps.html) Supper helpful.I will do what I want. Seriously, fuck off with your bullshit. Basically, artificial sweeteners aren't like regular sugar when heated. Sugar caramelizes when heated. Artificial sweeteners begin to break down into other stuff that just doesn't really taste good.

It's not poisonous or anything, just isn't something that tastes remotely good. Yes you are entitled to your own opinion, but there is no need to be rude about other people's opinions because they differ from your own. Anytime there is sauce discussed on this subreddit it's ALWAYS Sweet Baby Ray's _____. I live in Canada, what the hell is this stuff?!Spring rolls are out for low carb. Just serve with vegetables (minus potatoes). Add fresh parsley to brighten up the roast.  
  
/r/ketorecipes is a good place to startBut have you ever cooked anything before besides a bowl of cereal?I am entitled to my own opinion. So fuck off with your bullshit.I'd better upgrade from my old crock pot before they start background checks. Don't do it!!! THEY'LL KILL YOU WITH YOUR OWN SLOW COOKER!*Gentleman's Relish*Her friend probably kept opening the lid to 'check on it.'Refried beans would work well too.But you must know my secret ingredient that I'll put on a public post. Sweet Baby Ray's Hawaiian BBQWhat sauce did you use?well, bitch shouldnt've been talking shit about her chili recipe.

the defense rests.I know, right?  When I first heard that someone was killed by a cooking implement all I could think was "Please don't be a slowcooker."  Lo and behold, now people have more ammo for their prejudices and stereotypes.Politicking and slowcooking.... not even oncewhat about bacon? are kids into the adding of bacon scene? cook them onions in some bacon fat. THE TASTE!You can only read so many pulled pork recipes on your feed...This looks so delicious definitely going to try making some.She could've done the same thing with an oven and it would've been done faster. It's nice to know that if I'm ever confronted by a stranger in my home intending harm to anyone, I have a lethal weapon at my disposal. Oh goodness... Did you try to search for "without evaporated milk"?

http://www.101cookingfortwo.com/easiest-and-greatest-crock-pot-creamy/Since you use a slowcook, don't use any liquid. It's only in the oven that it is necessary to add liquid to prevent burning. I've done plenty of roasts in the slow cook and I never added any liquid. I generally just put whole garlic or vegetables in the bottom of the slow cook. The meat will produce some liquid over time anyways and I hate having too must liquid in my food.Blue Sky drugs CanadaSo I went ahead and did it whole. It turned out way dry :[ something might be wrong with the heating in my crockpot or something, though. Bleh. Still going to eat it with sauce :PLettuce rolls, spring rolls.  Roast with veg.  Stir fry. Salad with beef. Soup.

That's all I have.  The America's Test Kitchen is incredible too:  


Slow Cook French Onion Soup adapted from from Cook's Country (serves 6-8)  

2 lbs. of beef bones (the bones I used weighed about 1 1/4 pounds)  
4 Tbsp. unsalted butter  
5 lbs. of yellow onions, sliced into 1/4 pieces  
1 Tbsp.  brown sugar  
1/2 tsp. dried thyme  
5 Tbsp. all-purpose flour  
3/4 cup apple butter  
3/4 cup sherry 
1/4 cup soy sauce  
4 cups of beef stock  
Salt &amp; pepper  



You start the recipe by microwaving the beef bones on HIGH until they turn brown (it took 8  minutes).   

While those are cooking, put the butter in the slow cooker and set it to high, and then start slicing those onions!    

Once the onions are all sliced, add them to the slow cooker along with 2 teaspoons of salt, the brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of pepper, and the thyme.  

Then it's time to add some unusual ingredients (unusual for French onion soup).  

Mix together the flour, apple butter, sherry, and soy sauce until smooth (be patient and use a whisk). Then add the mixture to the onions and toss it all together.  

Now, get those beef bones from the microwave and nestle them under the onions toward the outside edges of the slow cooker.     

Put the cover on the slow cooker and cook the onions on high for 5-7 hours (the original recipe instructs you to cook the onions for 10-12 hours, but the onions turned soft and golden brown after about 5 1/2 hours in my mom's cooker). 

To finish the soup, remove the bones. In a pot on the stove top (or in the microwave) bring the beef broth to a boil, and then add it to the slow cooker. Continue cooking the soup until you're ready to eat. We served this with some good chewy, crusty bread and salad. If you're a traditionalist, feel free to ladle the soup into bowls, top with a slice of bread and some Gruyere cheese, and melt the cheese under the broiler (just make sure your dishes are broiler safe.

This is what I'll be slow cooking, this saturday :-)Awesome, thanks. Will be trying soon!low on 6 hours.[Here's the recipe.](http://slowcookd.com/recipe/bbq-pork-loin-back-ribs/) My wife says it's the best thing I've ever cooked.It shouldn't be. But I would like to add in that I prefer Brandy in my recipe for French onion soup. I use about 50mL (one of those mini bottles) for four servings of soup (we don't really drink brandy, so it's easier than buying a whole bottle and measuring). Meh, even on the stovetop, you've got a minimum of 2 hours depending on how many onions you're caramelizing. If you're doing a LOT of soup, I can totally understand sticking it in the slow cooker.

I don't, because I want to eat it as soon as possible and NOT wait until the next day.How long?1/2 cup might not have enough moisture and could burn to the bottom of the crock. I'm not very familiar with porridge, but would it be acceptable to make a larger amount, store some in a refrigerator, and heat it up the next day in a microwave? Rice reheats fairly well.super! thanks!Makes sense--thanks!Suggestion was 10-12 on low, so I went the high end to be as tender as possible.  I guess I am not sure how people can stir when you cook something for that long.  I usually cook my meals over night so start it at 6:30-7:00 and it will be done in the morning, and I am asleep like 10:30 or 11:00 till then so I couldn't possibly stir it for the last 7--8 hours.I think it was simply a matter of not stirring it for 12 hours. The exposed food is probably dehydrated and easily burnt after that long. It probably isn't enough to make it any less tasty though! :)

I'm really not sure if that's an excess time or not. Would be curious if there was a suggested time limit for any reason. I made french onion soup last week and, same as you, didn't have any sherry around. What I did have was a part bottle of home-made mead that was left over from when we bottled up two weeks ago. So that got used instead.As someone in the same situation as OP "Local Cuisine" stops being local after about 6 months and you just want to eat food you are used to sometimes. yum, thanks for sharing. i'll check this out too.I would probably just makes the bean soup just like the recipe without the ground turkey in the crock pot because you have to put the beans in a blender after to puree it. I don't think ground turkey would be good pureed. So, I may just mix in the turkey with a bowl of the bean soup at the end and add greek yogurt/avocado on top of it. Would you prep it at all or just throw it in the mix at the start?Thanks! No, I froze the base, so after stage 3. Add the salt, let it cool down completely, and freeze it in a tupperware. I did freeze a bunch of bread slices too in a Ziploc bag because I can't go through them before it goes bad. This way as long as you have cheese in your fridge when you thaw the soup, you're good to go!This looks so good! And I love how Budgetbytes has the total cost and cost per serving on their recipes, it really helps as a student to know what I'm getting into!Yeah I figured I would have to freeze a few batches, so I wouldn't sicken myself of the same meal lol. Did you freeze it cheese n all? And it's so easy to make for such a tasty result! You get a lot of servings too. I had it once a day every day for a week and still froze 3 cups of it...I didn't have sherry or cognac, and beer was just easier to find. I've seen recipes that use either, but I've only tried it with beer (that I know of), so I'm not sure what the difference would be. Why did you choose beer instead of the more traditional sherry or cognac? Was it just what you had on hand, or does it make it tastier? Onions overnight and soup stage while at work all day actually seems really manageable to me. I like this setup. Properly caramelizing onions for French onion soup takes a long, long time, even on a stovetop. This looks delish. I'm going to have to try it!! no just taste, and I was not thinking when I was typing.
BUt, saying that salt can help in holding it together if you used a ton of salt. but then you would be trying to make jerky, in a slow cooker which is such a bad idea.Could just be a manufacturing defect. Can you take it back or at least compare to another unit? You really don't want food leaking into the main heating unit.No, I always treated it very carefully and never put any cold water into the hot pot or anything like that. I also noticed the pattern on the coating, but I don't know if it was like that since the start. I use water because I'm poor Have you dropped or bumped the pot? The coating on the ceramic appears to have crazed, and if the material underneath is porous, would explain the 'bleeding'. AFAIK the coating on the pot should be uniformly smooth, not crazed.Awesome! I do love Hoisin though.Recipe:

* 2 pounds stew beef (I picked up cube, chuck roast?)

* 1 large yellow onion, chopped.

* 1 red pepper, chopped.

* 1 orange pepper, chopped.

* 1 yellow pepper, chopped. 

* 6 medium white potatoes (I used Eastern Potatoes) cut into bite sized pieces. 

* 24 oz. tomato paste. I used 4 6 oz. cans. 

* 1 1/2 Tbs. Curry Powder. 

* 1/2 tsp. black pepper. 

I dry brined the meat the night before hand. It's easy, tenderizes the meat since slow cookers can sometimes dry out beef, and makes it tastier. Not gonna go into much detail but www.amazingribs.com has a great write up on dry brining and I do it for all my meat now. 

Mix all the ingredients and cook on high for 4-6 hours. This mother will be THICK! at the begining 'cause of all that tomato paste. I added everything in layers and had trouble mixing it without risking a big mess so I had to mix as it loosened up. At the end it's still a pretty thick stew, so if you want something thinner I'd recommend adding a cup of water or maybe beef stock. 

I used my vegetable chopper to cut the vegetables so they were all uniform, which is what I like in my soups and stews. The potatoes I cut a little bigger. 

As for curry, I just used a generic spice aisle brand. I'm sure there are people here who make their own, which I'll try one day. 

Overall this stew was great! I did throw some salt in as it cooked, which I recommend. 
How did you prepare the asparagus? It looks delicious.People have a wide variety of tastes and preferences in this world.

You have a delicious stock to use in future cooking. This looks so yummy, will definitely be making this. I'm currently paying 9000 a year for this knowledge, I thought I may as well put it to good use. thanks guysi it was beef stew left for nearly 5hours cooking turned out ok everything was cooked meat was okay, was a little bland but i think that was due to lack of herbs more than anything elseMe too. Still eat stuff like this, though, but I keep the door to the freezer open for a while while it's cooking.WooooNot cooking so long helps.; if I am going to be Late I reduce extra end the last of the cooking finish in warming setting 


Also down Playing acids / vinegars Try with different onions next time. I like to use at least 3 different sorts.I cried a little thinking about that.Spices keep the meat strong? Saved. Favorited.

I've been making due with a more poor man's version. 

1 large onion. Beef broth. Butter. Herbs of choice (I use Herbs de Provence, Parsley, and crushed Bay Leaves).

Cook down onions with spices and butter. Add broth. Add more butter. Simmer. 

If I'm ever in the mood to treat myself I'll definitely give yours a go.Report back and say how it turned out. I think you will be fine however you do it. 

Good luck! I have my fingers crossed for you too :DDid you ever have to pop a zit that had gotten red and sore?

Imagine that instead of a little dot of goo coming out of it, a pound of goo came out.

And instead of the zit being on your face it was in a rump roast.

And instead of knowing it was there because you saw the bump and could take care of it in the bathroom, it was a surprise and it exploded all over your cutting board.That's reallly good to know! I was kind of shocked at the price of red meat as I'm used to chicken breast which is typically like.. ~$6 for three breasts. I thought the shape of what I purchased was "off" as well. Now that Good Eats is on Netflix I should probably watch all episodes concerning meat cuts. :P thanks for the tip!Oh interesting. Meat cuts confuse me so much (nonetheless abbreviated meat cuts, lol) and since I go to a typical grocery store rather than a specialty meat place I'm always to nervous to ask questions. I'm going to try it in the crockpot without cubing. Fingers crossed it turns out okay! Thanks for the help [:Based on an episode of "Good Eats" and family word of mouth...With PotRoast it's just the cheapest cut of meat.commenting 2remember this 4dindinYes.    
* Good -- time often means flavors get leeched out into the broth and wake up.   
* Bad -- the long cook time means I can't eat it until tomorrow.Gravy?This is so far my favorite beef stew slow cooker recipe. It is seriously out of this world: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/10/slow-cooker-rosemary-garlic-beef-stew-slow-cooker/I don't see how your plan could go wrong. Worst case, you could cube it up and make a beef stew.

As per your cut of meat, I believe the 'CH' is for choice. So you have a cut of choice texas beef shoulder. Broil refers to exactly that, most times I have seen this cooked it gets broiled.  Thank you for your easy recipe! I put it all together just now, minus the okra because I couldn't find it in the store. This stuff must not be too common way up north, I don't think I have ever seen it.I believe the term for the blood-like fluid is sarcoplasm. Then myoglobin is the hemoglobin equivalent.Well yessir!  ...Yep, I think you've combined all the top-o-the list ingredients for the ultimate French Onion soup (which is a treat during the winter-time, btw)I'll PM you :) Me neither, its about to be 80 degrees (26.7 celcius) this weekend.

Beach weather in february? *Fuck yes.*I defer to your more accurate assessment. Jolly good.I love caramelized onions- i have meant to try it in the slowcooker.  Ill probably do a mass batch and freeze portions so i can make this soup on the fly. :) looks greatTo be completely honest, the first time I made FOS I caramelized the onions in a pan but wasn't too happy with it. They weren't caramelized enough to my taste, so I decided to look into a different method, and here you go! That's what they call me.Wow, you really took your parent's cooking advice as literal as possible.

Next time be sure to look at reputable recipe sites before jumping into a new type of cooking.You would waste the power on a crock pot for 10-12 hours instead of dirty a pan?

That is the kind of commitment to laziness I have only heard of in legend.Chicken breasts for 4 hours on low. But that's ONLY chicken breasts. I think it can help make the soup a bit thicker, but by adding it to the onions you also make sure it doesn't 'clog' together. I'm not exactly sure though, I'm only assuming from what I've seen on some recipesI haven't started experimenting with stews yet -- next on my list, the Irish stew, but I will for sure try yours right after. It sounds so good!I've been playing around with a french onion soup based beef stew crockpot recipe. This really helps me solidify what a good french onion base should look like. Thanks!

(So in my recipe, I'd do your first step, then during the second step I'd add less broth -- maybe half -- and beef, onions, carrots. 1 hour before serving, add a bag of frozen peas.)is that... good or bad?Flour thickens the soup.If you want you could make a gravy by taking the chicken out then whisking in a little flour until it is a good thickness. Or you could mix a little corn starch in a little *cold* water then throw that in for the last half hour to thicken it up.What's the flour do?The small ramequin pictured doesn't hold much, but I would say at least 6 regular sized bowls since there are 9 cups of liquid + the onions.Freeze it and use it in place of water next time you cook chicken.Step 1 caramelizes the onions, which you could do on high for about 4-6h, and then add the rest of the ingredients for another 3-4 hours on high. I just did it that way because I wasn't in a hurry. I think it is less about amount of liquid you use and just more about how you handle the final product.  Corned beef, for example. Cook in a lot of liquid to pull the salt out but then slice and serve. No shredding.Ill check tomorrow, they are probably under $20 with the lids. I only saw the small one with a lid. But I stacked them for the pic. Pans in my area GW are usually $2-5 and lids are $1-2. Im not looking to making any $. I think its awesome someone else loves the 70's stuff. Wifey made me stop buying after a lil bit to much Tupperware. But let me know what the most you would want to spend. Ill send the receipts so no worries.How many servings do you get out of that?ladies an gentlemen we have found the 24 hour soup!That's awesome! I would do the same thing. I would totally live in a Brady Bunch house!!That's gross...Ahoy hoy, fellow Oilers/Slowcooking fan!I make a very large batch so I can freeze it (with some raw broccoli and some turkey breast) for lunches through out the month. 

I take 5 cups long gain brown rice, 11 cups water, and 5 tablespoons of chicken bullion, with a splash of olive oil. Then you cook it on high for 3 -5 hours stirring every hour after the first two. Then as soon as it looks fluffy turn it off. Don't do this.

http://science.howstuffworks.com/aluminum-foil-in-the-microwave.htmHow did it taste?Oh man, those are cute! They'd probably only be used as a decoration, but I'd love to have them! How much? I can send you a prepaid USPS shipping label if you have a printer and a box to throw them in!


Edit: Make sure you put the slash before the u/username too to link to the person! So wait, in step 1 you cook for 10-12 hours, then in step 3 you cook for an additional 6-8? So like, a total of 16-20 hours worth of cook time?Recipe for brown rice? Good to know! I usually add some red wine to my broth but could see the beer giving a better body. Will try this week!use a recipe, plain beef is plain, then it had nothing to cook in but what liquid was in the meat. the jelly stuff is GOOD, yeah it's odd to those not used to the kitchen, but good stock is thick like that when coldBut if your slowcooker is round, you can spin the lid and centrifugal force will give you a clear view for a moment without lifting the lid!In a spoiled Californian. I can't even imagine I'm an excitable boy.Ah, ok, though this seems a little weird - 2 hours to reduce on the stove? How much liquid did you have? 5 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar is almost nothing. I only added 150-200ml of chicken stock, and even that was too much in the end. In total, the meat juices, plus marinde run-off, plus chicken stock equalled about 1 litre of sauce. Pretty thick gravy type thing. 

Perhaps your sauce for marinating was different? Mine was quite thick to begin with, so it wasn't like I was adding thin and liquidy soy sauce. It was a thick marinade. 

I fished all veggies and meat out, and then reclaimed the gravy. I never reduced it.  

I'll have to experiment with drumsticks next time, haven't been game enough to stray away from thighs yet.

So, things I'll change:
- Less liquid
- Less cooking time
- More veggies
- bigger veggie cuts
- smaller slices of meat (no shredding, just for something different)
- toasted sesame seeds
- kimchi[This Cornish hen dish](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cornish-Hen-in-Port-Wine-and-Fig-Preserves-51200420) is so perfect.  It is super easy, only has four ingredients (you can use any dark/rich kind of preserves - I used a 4-fruit blend of cherry, blackberry, currant and strawberry), it is unique, is the perfect blend of sweet and savory, and if you baste it it comes out a beautiful purple/red color.  Just make sure you buy the hen early enough to put it in the fridge to defrost for a couple days since they usually come frozen rock solid.Decribe it to me, I dont want to google it.I would get them in the freezer, especially since you used broth. A week is about the limit in the fridge.No, you can't taste the 'beer', but it does give the soup a richer taste.Depends on what you are making. Chicken can be done in a few hours, but you wouldn't want to eat it if it had been sitting out all day.I'm drooling over the pictureis the beer taste very prominent? I've always put meat on top .. either on top of veggies, or sometimes in the case of chicken, on top of tin foil balls to keep if out of the fat. Keep in mind, in this case, by time the veggies had rendered all of their liquid, the meat was pretty much covered. 

I thought the meat was fine. It was tender and wasn't dried out. However, I probably would not have enjoyed the meat by itself. I quickly shredded it into bite sized chunks. returned it to the broth, and served it like stew ... at which point I was wishing I had had added some lentils, barley, or split peas to it at some point.Or a winter in Montreal --but you get the idea!Hey u/Calexandria, I found this at Good Will today. If your interested I can check on it tomorrow(if they are still there) they looked really clean. http://imgur.com/vZWXhyJI've made this with a similar recipe: sriracha sauce, bbq sauce, root beer/dr. pepper and hot and spicy taco seasoning. Just a footnote to this comment:

Don't wrap them in foil if you're putting them in the microwave. It should go without saying, but I figured I'd mention it as a precaution.Thanks for the answer.

Any reason not to just cover the whole roast with stock or something?Tried this recipe out tonight -- AWESOME. The Sriracha gives it a bit of a kick but not enough for it to be way too spicy. Thanks OP :DI always found it funny that hoisin sauce, which translates to seafood sauce, is almost never used on seafood.This sounds perfect for a chilly weekendHad this happen with some oxtail yesterday. I've never cooked it before and was really surprised at the amount of gel that came out of the bones. But.... I used caps lock... You should have known I was serious!also works well with Root Beer...&gt;  wrap the whole potato in foil and microwave for 5 min

Something tells me this is how you make a fire in your kitchen...Just wondering, why didn't you put the meat on the bottom. Also I haven't slow cooked much with chuck roast, what was the consistency like when you served it? Thanks.Did you accidentally put in jello instead of beef?

^^^^I ^^^^ask ^^^^because ^^^^I ^^^^may ^^^^have ^^^^done ^^^^something ^^^^like ^^^^that ^^^^beforeOops, I wasn't very clear. It took me 2 hours to reduce on the stove. This is already with the chicken stock and about half of the vinegar omitted. I marinated drumsticks, and they were fine. It was basically too watery and therefore bland. The skin comes out a little bit like this Chinese dish I really like where drumsticks/wings are basically boiled in soy sauce. The skin isn't browned first, but they absorb a tremendous amount of flavor. I prepped it the night before, so then it was ready by the time I got home from school! It fit perfectly with my schedule, but of course it's different for everyone. :)Well his user name is relevantYes, wrap the whole potato in foil and microwave for 5 min.  You will be shocked how good these turn out.Thank you!Looks like a lovely recipe, but I think I'd just caramelize the onions so I didn't add a 2nd day to the soup! :DFrozen, believe it or not. They come out better that way because they aren't over cooked. They don't get mushy or dry out. :( dat anxiety.I had been craving French Onion Soup but wasn't happy with the recipe I had, so I decided to mix a few of them (from here and the rest of the internet). I have a 4 quart slowcooker and it was FILLED by the end --just how I like it!

Ingredients

* 5 or 6 yellow onions, thinly sliced
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/3 cup butter
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 3 tbsp flour (optional)
* 1 cup of  dark beer (I used Guinness)
* 8 cups of beef broth
* 5-8 sprigs of fresh thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* salt to taste (I barely added any because my broth was not low-sodium)
* sourdough bread, cubed (or sliced)
* gruyere or swiss cheese, grated or sliced

Directions:

1. In your crockpot, place onions, butter, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, and garlic. Push all onions to the bottom so they don't burn on the sides and set on low for 10-12 hours (or overnight) or on high for 4-6 hours. I found this was the best way to caramelize the onions without having to dirty a pan. The smell is also amazing, so that helps.

2. Optional: Add the flour, and let set on low for 30min. 

3. Add beef broth, beer, thyme, bay leaves, and pepper. Cook on low for 6-8hours or on high for 3-4 hours. 

4. Taste, add salt if necessary. Pour in an oven-safe dish. Add cubed bread (I find it easier to eat than having to cut up the slice in the soup) and **cover** with cheese. Place in oven under the broiler until the cheese is bubbly and golden browned. Voil! 

Edit: added approximate time on high.Real sugar caramelizes and the flavor develops.  I can't say what happens with artificial sweeteners, but since they are different chemically they don't just act like sugar when heat is applied.Still sounds like beef stew to me.

[And bell peppers do come in blue/violet.](http://images.dpchallenge.com/images_challenge/0-999/96/1200/Copyrighted_Image_Reuse_Prohibited_21115.jpg)That's awesome. I just ate more of the beef tonight and it was still really good. I just made a batch of Frank's pulled chicken and it is delish.  I may have to try a beef roast version now.Usual recipe. Chopped onion, can of Dr. Pepper, 3 garlic cloves, spices to taste, and a mixture of Sweet Baby Ray's with Hoisin sauce.I make these awesome tobasco panko breaded chicken bites and it uses the same sauce to dip them in. I'm really excited to try this now as my fiance loves those things but they are so time consuming to make, thank you so much! I've made baked potatoes like this before and they were great. The recipe I used was pork chops and gravy, then your foiled potatoes, then foiled corn on the cob. It was a great one pot meal.I roasted a whole chicken today on a bed of onions, with no liquid added and by the end of the 6 hours it was swimming in at least 2 cups of liquid - pretty amazing how much one chicken can produce while still staying incredibly tender and juicy.#####&amp;#009;

I use this slow cooker http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZI26C8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

I've done 72 hour short ribs and they were fine, my friend has a vacuum sealer that we used for that, but normally I just use a normal freezer bag and try to get all the air out by putting it under water.Steel cut oats are really good in the crock pot. [Alton Brown's Recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/overnight-oatmeal-recipe.html)You need to take the roast out of the plastic wrap / styrofoam first.Hahaha! Classic. I imagine for my purposes it will be more than enough, doubt I will need a circulator for quite some time.

Unless like all my hobbies I jump head first into it.I saw "horribly wrong" and thought either explosion or fire.

One meal getting screwed up sucks, but it's still usually a pretty successful way of cooking. Just got to try the recipe again!I think it depends on the cut. Some people swear by braising for long/slow cooks, so to them, water in the crock pot is essential.  

When I roast in an oven, I more often than not do it dry (as long as the meat has plenty of fat to self-baste.  

occasionally I do braise in an oven, but never cook "dry" in a slow cooker.A couple of things 
- reduce on the stove! Using a slow cooker to reduce is not a great way to do it. 
- I'm not adding chicken stock next time because there was enough liquid from the meat, but it definitely didn't come out watery for me. Did you marinate the chicken overnight? I mixed through some extra sauce at the end when I shredded the chicken. 
- what meat did you use? I had skinless thighs. I imagine that, unless you brown thighs with skin, you're gonna have a bad time. Is that what happened? I believe the troubled mind behind Hemlock Grove had a similar acid trip.So nice,  you posted twice? I did the same thing! Tried to make pork and beans, like my dad used to make when I was a kid - the house always smelled fantastic. I literally threw diced pork and some cans of beans in, no spices. Turned it on in the morning, left for about 12 hours, came back to the most disgustingly overcooked mass of goo. It smelled terrible! Lesson learned...I do beef roasts in my crockpot and just use less liquid than I would for a pulled meat. Chalk it up to experience and learn from mistakes.  I'm kind of hungry for chicken and dumplings now!  Better luck next time for you.  That is one of the most comforting foods I enjoy, especially on a cold winter day.I think I'm going to just scoop out the biscuits. I mixed them up in there before I put it away in the fridge, but hopefully they've bobbed back up to the top. 

I think I'm going to just pour whatever remaining chicken/sauce over some fresh-baked biscuits or puff pastry and call it a wash. 

What I don't get is I made this exact dish a week ago. I think the issue is this time I went from warm to high to cook the biscuits instead of low to high like last week. I'm definitely going to try the Bisquick method next time.I would be more worried that your food was sitting out all day with no constant heat or refrigeration and that the meat is spoiled.the butcher told me to do a poke test, pretty much feel the roast you buy and look for any squishy or unusually hard spots. the abscesses are more common than you think, but good butchers know how to spot them. 

funny thing was, while i was reading that post i had a pork roast in the crock pot &gt;&lt; Sucrose is regular, granulated sugar. Sucralose is the fake stuff.Sucrose is regular, granulated sugar. Sucralose is the fake stuff.Wow, that's kind of scary.i'm no chemist but this post explains it pretty well: http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2f4ayi/when_making_dr_pepper_pulled_pork_can_i_sub_diet/ 

just the way things break down.  i've never done it but i hear it results in a stinky black sludge. mmm. Ah. That explains it.  Use broth of some sort (probably vegetable or beef) and you'll have a fine roast.We just eat right out of the slow cooker. I made the big mistake of cooking meat in diet coke recently. Care to elaborate on why fake sugar, aspartame, sucrose are bad?I made a pot roasted lady minute, I thought, I'll make some baked potatoes to go with it. Wrapped two whole potatoes in foil, chucked them in, they cooked perfectly. But how can you serve anything without the matching bowls?  http://m.imgur.com/4W9kOv3
Probably 6 hours on high...Whoops you're right - one can of diced or crushed tomatoes go in at the beginning with all the spices.Absolutely. I make potatoes this way when I have a campfire going. They are commonly referred to as hobo potatoes. They cook a lot faster than eight hours. I usually add butter, onions, and garlic to them and just toss them in the coals. Maybe add a cob of corn (unpeeled) and some sort of mammal flesh on top of the grate. It's a quick and easy meal that really sticks to your ribs.

I know that's not entirely what you were asking, but the answer to your question is yes and that's why I know it will work.using water, to me, is a cardinal sin.  there's so many delicious liquids, why use *water*?! use beer (literally any beer), wine (red for red meats, white for white meats), beer or chicken broth, a can of soup, salsa, even the liquid from a can of corn, non-diet sodas. anything but water!

edit to add more liquids i'm thinking of: ever buy a jar of pepperoncinis? The remaining liquid makes delicious liquid to cook a chuck roast in (but is salty enough that no additional salt is needed).  i make crazy good carrot apple chicken with about 1-2 inches of apple juice in the bottom of your crock (can't contain any fake sugars/aspartame/sucrose).  pineapple juice also does magical things with pork.I made C&amp;D just last week for the first time and I read that a LOT of people had problems with the dough not cooking all the way. 

So my recipe called for 1 can of torn up biscuits, to be added during the last hour of cooking. (Soup would cook for a total of 6 hours on High)

Instead, I cooked it for 3 hours on High, then added the biscuits, and cooked another 2.5 - 3 hours on High. This gave the biscuits plenty of time to cook, and I just stirred the soup about once/hour. 

I was home and able to add the biscuits halfway through - but if I wasn't able to do that, I'd probably make the soup like normal, then transfer to a pot and boil the soup with biscuit pieces added so they'd cook faster. 

I think if you were to cook the biscuits in the oven and then add them, they'd be too airy and fall apart in the soup - then you'd just have really thick chicken soup. Actually myoglobin is just the protein and its role is certainly not oxygenation of blood, that occurs at the lungs. The body has different oxygen-carrying proteins for different purposes. The most commonly known is probably haemoglobin, which is found within your red blood cells and transports the oxygen from your lungs to your muscle. When blood is said to be oxygenated, it means that a high proportion of the haemoglobin in the blood is currently bound to oxygen. 

Myoglobin is another oxygen carrying protein, but this is only found within muscle cells(myo meaning muscle, globin being a family of proteins) and it acts as a store of oxygen as opposed to transporting it. This ensures that the muscle cells don't run out of oxygen and they can keep respiring. 

You're right about the colour of myoglobin though, both it and haemoglobin contain iron pigments which gives the proteins (and muscle/blood) the red colour as well as allowing for binding oxygen. Also as an aside the brown colour you get when cooking meat is due to the iron as well, which reacts to change colour in the exact same process as the formation of rust.I don't flip it, but if it's looking particularly dry on top I might use a baster to add some liquid over top. Yeah, especially if you're cooking it dry. If I don't add liquid, there's always gelatinous fat in the crock pot after. It still happens when I cook with broth or another liquid, it's just less noticeable. It still tastes fine, you just have to scrape out the overcooked fat first. This might sound silly but... is there any tomato added to this? To make it saucy? Crushed tomatoes? I'd definitely try it again but add a nice helping of red wine in the slow cooker. Well, best of luck! Let me know how you like it! :)Thanks. To be honest, this is how I cook at home but am looking for new recipes for work. This will have to be a 'make it at home first' kind of deal.If you're not melding flavors, I'd look to just microwave them or boil them separately and mix them in prior to serving.Honestly, I didn't. I'm pretty comfortable with how I season things (and also very lazy) so I never bother dirtying my teaspoons. My best guess would be about  .5-1 tsp each to start, and then when I tasted it towards the end of cooking, another tsp or more of a few things like garlic and chili powder. Just play with it and don't be afraid to taste :)Tablespoons :)and now we see the issue, it would need some juice to keep it wet and juicy.

Also I would guess with no spices, all the meat just lost its strength and oozed away.What measurements did you yourself use for the spices? eehhhh, I mess with my stews and chilis all the time to stir it around and taste the seasoning. I'll frequently add more salt, pepper, spice, etc. while it is still cookingHmmm, this presents a bit of a timing challenge for a weeknight... I was hoping to set this up to cook after my lunch break so it will be ready for dinner. I'm not sure if it will keep on the auto "warm" setting, either. Anything I can do to make this work over 4 hours? For the Olive Oil, the "2 T"...is that tablespoons or teaspoons? I've done this when making pot roast. It kept the potatoes from getting overly mushy. Worked great.I would salvage the chicken stew base and remove and discard the biscuits.  They're only a couple bucks or less anyway.  I use Bisquick for dumplings and have never had a problem with them being mushy.  You can do the Bisquick dumplings in the crockpot too, on high, just before ready to serve (it takes about 20 minutes to cook them).I would remove the layer of biscuits and bake it on a sheet pan (better put a silicone mat or parchment under it so it doesn't weld to the pan). Then you can put it back on once it's cooked through.Yup, proper broth can look pretty gross when cooled, but it makes for great soups! Same with bone marrow I'm sure it would still have an awesome flavor! It'll just be closer to chili than soup :)i always use Mojo Criollo...its basically orange/lemon/garlic/onion....and its awesome

http://c4.q-assets.com/images/products/p/khr/khr-1784b_1z.jpgHuh, that's a cool idea.  I actually do some thing similar where I marinate chicken in a porter for a day or so.  I am gonna try this.Awesome - thanks.  I've been thinking of attempting to cook chicken some time in the next few weeks and I have no idea what I'm doing.  The crockpot seems the simplest way for me to go.Interesting.  Thanks.Either way will work. Just might take slightly longer from frozen. This recipe seems to imply cooking time for frozen though.Here's the recipe I've used a couple times really enjoy it. http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2h02uq/the_perfect_fall_curry_sweet_potatoes_chick_peas/I DID IT JUST TO SPITE YOU AND I REGRETTED ITReally?  Never heard of slow cooking with meat alone.  I guess it makes sense though since you can "slow cook" a roast in the oven with no liquid.It sounds kind of "normal" to me. Without a reference picture is hard to say.

Meat ooze liquid, lipids and collagen while cooking which forms a foamy/gelatinous substance. I never cooked meat by itself alone so my foam has some of the coloring from spices i added.

Meat could look grey if you cooked it for too little time, magic happens around 8 hours. So it could be that the crock pot you used failed and turned off while you were gone.

Sounds like a case of bad luck for your first time.You don't need to, technically, but it helps immensely. I think it was probably a combination of rendered fat and myoglobin, a mixture of water and protein that allows the muscle to oxygenate blood. It also gives red meat its color, so it is often mistaken for the "blood" in a rare steak. I think there was a TIL post about this not too long ago.Am I the only one who thinks it's normal to have this thick gel? Lots of good meats give off the gelatin from the tendons/marrow/etc depending on whether there's a bone in or not. I don't think you necessarily did anything wrong, just perhaps you were seeing meat be cooking for the first time.Exactly my thinking. When I make beef broth, it gets "gelatinous" but oh it's so good. We are eating animal parts here, people. It's not a soylent green wafer.Question - did you halve the recipe or something? The recipe calls for 1 lb of chicken breast, right?No, nothing.there was a post about that to WTF a year ago. a butcher came into the thread said it was not uncommon but experienced butchers know how to spot them and will toss the chunk. he did say they had a couple pass inspection and explode on the cutting table. he said it was gross....Couldn't tell you for sure.  I tend to dislike hoppy beers and wouldn't try it that way myself.  I actually learned to brew my own so that I could have less hoppy beers made exactly the way I wanted them.Indeed the easiest way is to foil em with salt, toss em on coals while making bbq or the oven, after that just cut it in quarters, some butter, grilled. Meat or bacon with cheese and your got a papa asada You don't really need to, meat's got plenty of water in it.Try a dark beer. I use my homebrewed mocha stout and it adds a great flavor that isn't sweet.TOO LATEDO NOT GOOGLE OR YOUTUBE THIS!Did you add water?Do you think something hoppy would carry through, or be overpowered by the flavor? just wondering, i think i'd sooner try a stout but an ipa might be interesting.At room temperature though? Seems fishy.I really like making sweet potato curry in mine. Chippah!Sounds like it cooked like meat cooks in a moist environments - oozes liquid and probably dissolved a lot of the collagen in the meat. Because it wasn't browned and probably had zero spices it would have just been grey. Then it looked gross and you let it cool before dumping it. The goop would have formed a gel like consum as it cooled. I had a similar experience after cooling home made stock for the first time. Never said anything about safety, you seem a bit obsessed with the topic.  Aluminum is reactive to acidic foods and can alter the taste.  
From Reynolds own site:

Occasionally when aluminum foil comes in contact with a different metal or a food that is highly salted or acidic,
small pinholes are formed in the foil. This is a harmless reaction that does not affect the safety of the food. It is
difficult to predict, but may occur under the following conditions:

1. When aluminum and a dissimilar metal are in contact in the presence of moisture, an electrolytic reaction
may occur causing a breakdown of the aluminum. To avoid this use aluminum, glass, ceramic, plastic or paper
containers. Do not cover sterling silver, silver plate, stainless steel or iron utensils with aluminum foil.

2. A similar reaction may occur when salt, vinegar, highly acidic foods or highly spiced foods come in contact
with aluminum foil. The result of these reactions is a harmless aluminum salt. Some aluminum salts are used in
medicines to treat stomach disorders. The food can be safely eaten; however, the aluminum salt particles can
be removed from the food to improve the appearance of the food.Did you taste it first? Because it actually might have been delicious.I assume you used some kind of broth or liquid and not just the meat itself???4 hours on low does dry this recipe out, yesDid you put anything in with it? Or just the beef?don't have to go that far; setting macros to Carb/Fat/Protein = 40/40/30 should help.Just when you thought /r/slowcooking was safe to read while eating lunch!  LOLBoom. Sciencethanks poopface tomato nose*tsssssssssss*

Yeah maybe ya shoulda used Pepsi insteada Coke or sumthin!

*tsssssssssss*It's worked well for me. I am probably going to upgrade to an actual circulator soon but everything has turned out great. True circulators are under $200 now.Yum lolIn my copy of Slow Cooker Revolution they frequently suggest packing carrots and even chicken breasts in foil and resting it on top of the liquid to prevent overcooking. Wrapping the potatoes should work great. Make sure your foil packets have well crimped edges or some liquid will seep in. If you used pop, did you cook it in diet instead of regular? This myth has been widely debunked for decades. Breakdown of aluminum foil's structure through heating has been documented, but it's in such miniscule amounts that it poses no threat for the consumption of food cooked in or on foil.

  You'll hear it said that aluminum collects in your brain and bones, but that's not entirely true, as your body is amazing at eliminating small amounts of foreign substances with remarkable efficiency.

  Consider mercury, which can be far more harmful than aluminum (I've never heard of anyone getting aluminum poisoning). As long as you limit your intake of mercury by, say, not eating ten pounds of fish per day, there is no significant risk of it lodging in your body forever. It will eliminate as any other inorganic material would.

  You can find a slew of websites on both sides of the argument, but those who "fear the foil" also post things like the benefits of coffee enemas and the best kind of berries to realign your heart chakra.

  Tl;dr - cooking with aluminum foil is completely safe.What ya gonna pick? PUS POCKETS!I've tried a similar recipe in the past and definitely got better flavor from a heavy stout or a really malty lager than I did from cheap beer.  That being said, even the cheap beer was still pretty tasty.Never heard of aluminium leeching into food, I don't think it's possible or happens in any significant amount.

Edit: Also doesn't affect taste.Congealed fat was my guess too.
Sure, but try this, if you have a steamer basket use it instead of foil. if you want it out of the cooking liquid prop it up on a small bowl turned upside down in the slow cooker. Dude, do live in Kazakhstan or something?Try orange juice and cilantro with a pork shoulder. The best pulled carnitas you'll ever have. That's perfect!

Not a terrible price either, I'll just change the cooker I buy. 

Thanks a ton!I think its worth a try! I used Yuengling both times I made it. I would say a decent enough amount that they type of beer would change how it tastes!Maybe it cooked and rendered the fat while you were away, and then turned off automatically or accidentally before you got home. When cooled, the rendered fat will congeal into a gelatinous mass like you describe. It wouldn't happen if the pot was still warm, though.The tastiest of sins.Yes, 8 hrs on low will be more than enough time at a high enough temp to cook a potato.I wouldn't want the aluminum to leech into the food, depending what you're cooking (anything acidic particularly).  You might try parchment paper.Also, black eyed peas, I make mine with a ham bone.Pump your brakes, Captain Condescension.I made this the other week and my god is it good. I altered it a little (added some chicken breasts, omitted the carrots, used a bag of frozen mixed veggies, used chicken broth as I had some on hand). I'm always looking for good, healthy food so this was right up my alley. Also, to note: using the chili powder realllyy makes this taste like a vegetarian chili (duh), so if you want to shy away from a predominantly chili taste, substitute that powder for something else.

http://skinnyms.com/skinny-slow-cooker-savory-superfood-soup/Is this worth doing if you can't blend at the end? Are you using whole potatoes or chunks? There are recipes out there for making baked potatoes in the slow cooker wrapped I'm foil so theoretically it can work. how much does the flavour of the beer come through? like is it worth trying a good stout v. an ipa v. some swill?Angels are over-hyped.

I had sex with one. It was mindbogglingly awesome without question. But not as good as I expected.

Overall 7/10, would bang an angel again.Maybe the roast had a hidden puss pocket that escaped when it was cooked?Toast it under the broiler for a few minutes to get a pseudo bark on there. It's not the same but adds some texture. Null argument. This has nothing to do with carbs. All else equal, eating the same roast without the fat will lead to less calories consumed, and therefore better for the waistline. Looks freakin delicious! Thanks!Looks really good! I liked the suggestion on the recipe that said to use the stew like a pot-pie filling. 

What kind of ale did you use? Agreed, broccoli might be a more conventional choice. I think you're right on the money with 2 cloves.I see these at antique stores all the time.  Depending on where you go they can be ridiculously priced to relatively cheap.  Keep your eyes open.  I currently have 2 (nearly) complete sets.. I fear the day they will break.  By the way... when they do break it is awful, tiny slivers of white glass everywhere!I have a roommate that opens my slowcooker AND my oven when their in use. I die a little each time :(I was thinking broccoli, but I can see spinach working well, too. I am going to bookmark this recipe and try the garlic. 2 cloves sounds like it should do the trick. "Because the meal isn't over when I'm full, the meal is over when I hate myself." -Louis CK

Why the high cook time? Does the chicken come out rubbery or does it dry out? Nothing. Just let the meat render down to create the juice. My fear was dryness, but by the end of the cook, there was liquid halfway up the chuck by the end. It is really yummy! 

 
**Ingredients:**

32 oz chicken broth ( or veggie broth to make vegetarian friendly)

12 oz beer

1 cup of carrots, finely diced or shredded

1/2 cup celery, finely diced

1 cup onion finely diced

2-3 cloves of garlic, minced

1 tsp salt

1/2 tsp pepper

1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

3 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

1/2 cup heavy cream

1/4 cup cornstarch
 
**Directions:**
 
1. Place all chicken broth, beer, carrots, celery, onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper into your crockpot. Cover and cook on LOW for 6-8 hours.
 
2. Once time is up, remove lid and stir in shredded cheese, and heavy cream. Stir until cheese is melted. Next whisk in cornstarch. Recover and cook for 10-15 minutes longer.
 
3. For a smooth soup (which we prefer for this soup), use an blend soup in batches, or use an immersion blender before serving.

I got the recipe from [This](http://www.familyfreshmeals.com/2014/01/crockpot-beer-cheese-soup.html#_a5y_p=1270569) website. Its really good!Just finished making this. I would not recommend the recipe (maybe with some major tweaks). My whole pot came out super watery and bland!  

EDIT: I ended up cooking this for 8 hours on low, then taking everything out to reduce the sauce. I probably spent 2 hours doing that. If I were to do this again, I would trim the meat of all the excess fat and skin, and add more vegetables. I used 3 carrots to begin with. I would probably make it 5-6 big carrots, add a whole (small) cabbage, and MAYBE reduce the amount of onions to just 1.I've made a great vegetable soup a few times. My other go to is a marinara sauce. No meat needed. You are correct. The can of sugar water is for flavor, nothing more. http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/health/low-carb-vs-low-fat-diet.html?_r=0&amp;referrer=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/health/low-carb-vs-low-fat-diet.html?_r=0&amp;referrer=I'm glad your degree keeps you from keeping up with current studies! I didn't know I could ignore my field of study once I had a peice of paper. 

Edit: Try this, they do a good job of not getting too complex on the matter while still covering the study nicely. http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/health/low-carb-vs-low-fat-diet.html?_r=0&amp;referrer=&gt; The carbonation softens the tissues.

Source? I can't imagine that ~10 minutes of fizzy, if that, would do anything. The tenderizing comes from the long cooking time and the collagen breaking down.Dump a jar of coconut oil in on low for 30 mins.  Warm lube.I used to not want to use soda because I was afraid of the sweetness.  Now I *really* don't want to use it.  One of my biggest problems with slowcooked pulled pork versus smoked it that the texture is so mushy.On kiwis? for real?I have a Dorkfood temperature controller for my slow cooker. It only works for manual models. It works by cutting the power to keep the temp at what you set.Chicken plus onion soup mix plus cream of mushroom soup&gt; food for thought. 

HehThat's.... Probably a pretty great point, actuallyMind.Blown.

The skins are the best part!! Rub 'em down with some sea salt and olive oil and they are freaking delicious! My whole family eats the skins (except for my little sister, but she's just odd). 

But we also eat the skins on kiwis, which I KNOW most people don't. I guess we're the odd balls. Same here, I sometimes just use the "it wont cook right" excuse because I'm so damn bothered that she can't keep the lid on. I think part of it is the fact that I took the time to prepare this meal and it's ready when I say it is, not to mention that she could just as easily learn to cook things in the crockpot but instead she just stares at it like it's magic.....I can polish off way the hell more than my TDEE without feeling sick.  I've never been a fat person, but if I had no concept of nutrition and just ate however much I felt like eating, I feel like I might end up kinda fat.There are mixed reviews, but I would say most don'tPeople don't eat baked potato skins?The lids get all full of condensation and you can't see the beauty of the food correctly!!This sounds delightful. I've been craving black bean soup for a few days and this is EXACTLY what I was wanting. Heh. Hello, r/keto.This is true in most study's I've read as it's the most popular option among test groups. I have believed this for the longest time as well. There's some study's I've read though that conclude that the hormonal response from fat consumption can lead to a longer sense of satiety. Don't know how that compares to the initial feeling from protein, but it's food for thought. I can dig up the paper when I'm not on mobile.But, let's not forget that OP's roast is sitting in Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure any of this matters, once you pour corn syrup over the thing.Maybe not much,  but I haven't seen any from the "fat makes you skinny"  side of things. Protein gives the most satiety, and fat has more than twice the calories per gram as protein.Actually, there is. There's a lot of fuss lately over the carbs vs fats argument, but the fact of the matter is that gram for gram, fats have the highest calories. Considering protein has the highest satiety of the macronutrients, trimming fat off of meat to cut back calories is some pretty sage advice.

Now, you can totally be like me and not care because flavor means to much to you :PBut don't they feel sick? I always assumed fatter people just didn't feel "full" till after they'd exceeded their needed calories, or just never excercised in any way.Uh... Gluttony?What did you use as the liquid for your recipe?Just made this overnight -- I'll be having it for dinner and it smells delicious!

http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/vegetable-chickpea-curry... why not? that's clearly when you're done?You can do what you like with the chicken thighs - if you've got skins, perhaps you should give them a fry before you pop them into the slow cooker to get some chicken skin flavours into the whole thing. 

Love chicken thighs!Fat doesn't run into meat.

http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/mythbusting_fat_caps.htmlA little late to the game,  but [this is delicious](http://m.campbellskitchen.com/recipes/slow-cooker-chicken,-broccoli-rice-25994?utm_referrer=direct%2Fnot%20provided). We over at /r/keto would disagree.If it runs into the meat it's there.... things don't vanish into thin air.And ~5ml love juice as an aphrodisiac. Have you watched Louis C.K's bit about overusing superlative words? Cause I think this is a textbook example.

Absolutely = without exception; completely; wholly; entirely

delicious = Very pleasant; delightful

In other words, you were expecting something more than "completely full of delight"... that would be what, sex with an angel??Long enough for the meat to reach your desired temperature minus three to five degrees (for carryover).You don't have to use soda, fizzy booze works wonders. Cider, Guinness, ale, etc.Try hard cider next time (for pork, not beef).so... cut carbs?

Check this link out, a lot of the recipes aren't vegetarian, but there are a ton of great looking recipes.  I think they mean dried vs fresh. You can use fresh herbs, but they'll taste different and you would need different quantities. Not sure on the tomatos, probably since it's easier and there is a different taste to it, it's winter and tomatos may be out of season. Garlic is in your vegetable section of the grocery store, probably near the onions. You can buy cloves and cut them up yourself, or get jars of it pre-minced.That delicious, tasty food. The food that makes you sit back in your chair and think to yourself "I'm not stopping until I can't eat any more"I think everyone needs to remember what the soda *does* in the BBQ Pulled Pork recipe. The carbonation softens the tissues. It doesn't really flavor the meat. I've found that getting a little creative with the seasonings and sauce is best. Use a bold-tasting sauce (or make your own). A little spice helps offset any sweetness, too.

Also, whatever you use for soda make sure it's real sugar, not corn syrup!For the love of everything what is that? I must have the recipe. You make your grandmother very sad.Actually, just checked.  That time is for medium or high.  Have to admit, I've never used the Low setting (it's a Ninja cooker).  Maybe add extra 30-60 min. for minimum time to get to the "target" zone?that titleI just made the Dr. Pepper pulled pork tonight.  To be honest, I expected something more... I'm not sure what I expected, but with all the fuss about Dr. Pepper, I thought it would taste out of this world!

It was absolutely delicious though...I rarely cook that well, and meat of any variety or preparation is always a good time for me.

I'll have to try yourFranks Red Hot dry rub recipe!One year we stayed in and made a roast chicken dinner complete with potatoes, carrots and gravy straight from the slow cooker. We shared a bottle of wine and it turned out pretty well :)Mixed it all up, but forgot to take a picture of it before I plated it up. [Here's an action shot](http://i.imgur.com/KPeil2d.png) right before I ate a bit!

It was friggin' delicious! I threw a bit of fresh cracked pepper on top. I think next time I'll add a bit of minced garlic into the mix; it's great, but I feel that garlic will bring it to the next level.

Edit: Weirdly, I think Spinach might work well in this. Might try that next time as well.-2# butter

Cook low and slow for 18 hours.  Serve.  Propose.I normally flip every hour.&gt; around 2.5-3 hrs or so

On Low?
Can't blame the food for that though!Beer cheese soup! I'm not sure I even got the sweetness from the soda. It was just kind of bland shredded pork. Not a bad thing, but not the same stuff I had done all summer in my smoker. 

As for the beef. I'm really pleased with the finished product. Has a nice spice to the finish and all of the liquid rendered down from the meat, not added in. Had I know it would have tasted so good, I would have done a better job documenting my process. 

Can't wait to see your effort posted!True. But depending on who you're talking to you'd be better off getting rid of high GI foods. Fat is very calorie dense, though, so there's that.I'll add ground turkey into it for a protein packed gym meal. I didn't care for the Dr. P sweetness when I made the pulled pork.  I substituted Ginger ale, and II felt it really let the meat and sauce shine through, might help.  I will try but I want to try your recipe though next time I do Beef.Looks good! I'm making this for the second time today. The first it went way too quicklyIf you stop eating at satiation...a lot of people don't I am! I just started it shortly before I posted that. I have about 2 hours left. I just snapped [a picture of it](http://i.imgur.com/IhcbGVz.jpg) in the crock pot. Sorry about the picture quality; it actually looks pretty decent and smells VERY good. I'll be shredding the chicken in about an hour, and another hour after that. Then just some rotini and I eat!

I'll take photos of the post-shred and pasta stages as well.citation needed all around.Lentil Soup

I also like to make super large batches of beans and rice to freeze for later meals/side dishes. Eating fiber makes you more satiated.The fat usually melts quite a bit so you aren't eating it, it is juiced into the less fatty parts.Are you still cooking it??! How is it?! Thanks!This message sponsored by Adderall^tm.At least baste that mofo
I had no idea what this was in response to at first, haha.

That's totally fair though. In retrospect, the severity doesn't really seem like it matters a great deal - food poisoning is food poisoningAnd the result?Green lentils get really soggy for me. I've heard red ones hold up better but haven't tried them (they're not stocked at the store).Wife's mother had a saying, "if it tastes good, spit it out, it's bad for you."Eating fat makes you satiated. Therefore eating less calories in the long run.Based on this it looks like OP needs to leave it in for the full 8 hours. "High" or "low" apparently only affects the first few hours. Once it's all hot, the cooking rate is the same between the two.Cutting the bulk of that fat out will reduce the calories per serving.I've had gastro and had to put on a drip and lose continency for a couple of days, both ends, and I've had food poisoning that's just the world falling out of your arse a few hours after you eat, then you're fine again, no harm done.

It may depend on the particular pathogen.Sounds great I'm gonna try it, thanks!Etsy has a lot, too. This is great everyone, thanks! I'll have to try every single one of these and report back!Scientifically speaking,  if you start it fat up the fat will baste the meat as it cooks. However, the lower half will be more well done. So by flipping twice, fat to non to fat, you allow equal cooking time and allover basting. Think rotisserie chicken. That said, the difference is fairly minimal with most size cuts. I think the answer is all personal preference though. There really isn't a way to screw it up; there are a dozen differing answers in this thread but everyone is unanimous in saying it turns out delicious whether you flip it, pre cut it, remove the fat, don't remove the fat, etc. Wait... sorry. didn't realize I was in r/slowcooking. Please ignore, unless you want to try it.Ranch Chicken

Take a packet of ranch dressing mix and combine with about a quarter cup of fine bread crumbs in a plastic bag. Put the breast in the bag and shake it about until it's well coated. Bake @ 350 in a baking dish till done.

You should be able to smell it anyway.  My entire apartment smells so good hours before it is ready!I bought this same slow cooker. Can confirm, it is the best. If it's a Dr. Pepper type stock, I don't think health is primarily on OPs mind.I did chicken breasts with soy, ketchup, honey, paprika, garlic, and a dash of liquid smoke yesterday. I did them on high for three hours and they were a little overdone, but I think 2 on high or 3:30 on low would be pretty good. The flavor was great. Salsa chicken, honey garlic chicken, lemon garlic, white chicken chili, chicken burrito bowls. The possibilities are endless. I almost always flip, hasn't given me any trouble except with the ribs that were falling apart.Google lentil recipes. I never make lentils in the slow cooker but I'm sure you could and they're so versatile That's already in my rotation. Basically a normal chili recipe (or white chili recipe) but minus the meat. It's good. But I'm looking for something a little more exciting.I would think anything with beans would be a good fit.  A vegetarian chili would be my first choice.So it is 4QTs so I am looking for a 6-8QT unit, any recommendations?To Ebay I go...  This is generally what I do as well, depending on what I'm cooking. Pulled pork gets trimmed before it gets cut and any remaining fat gets just mixed in. Beef roast though? Slice it off and toss it out!Bourbon chicken http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=2034705As a white guy with an asian last name, I thought you would use the finger knuckle method. I stopped using my rice cooker and measuring cup years ago. Put rice in pan,level. Touch your fingertip to the top of the rice, add water to the first knuckle. Put on high till it boils. Stir, and put on low until it's done.I love this question and really hope someone answers that is not just stating a personal preference.Yeah, that's what I love about slow cookers, it's hard to screw things up.I flip because the part below the liquid line is going to be cooking faster due to the greater thermal conductivity of the ~~fluid~~ liquid (EDIT:gasses are also fluids)./r/theydidthemonstermathPlease do and pics if you can! Thanks!Peel in the soup, through the potato away. ;-)If only this could make the crock switch to Keep Warm like a fully programmable one.  Cool product though, may find something similar for other uses. I think i like this answer the best, hahaOh! And I have 2 of [these](http://kingsriverlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Dianas-mixing-bowls.jpg) which were my grandma's. I only have the green and red. I use them daily, and would kill for the whole set!Oh man!

I wonder if I could do a sous vide using that...http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2dhk8g/pepperoncini_chicken/ 

One of my favorite recipes. I posted it here a few months ago.I made this tonight. Thanks for the inspiration and idea!

I only added one soup can of water ... and still feel like I could have gone entirely without it consistency-wise. Volume-wise, it was about right.  

Kids enjoyed it (three of them). My picky-eater barely complained, and even gave the carrot and mushroom a taste-test (probably because she's grounded from her phone and is doing anything she can think of to get it back) ... but still declined eating them. They all enjoyed the gravy/broth and meat, but who doesn't?

At 8am, I seared the chuck with just salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Added 2 quartered onions to the crock, the carrots, whole small red potatoes ... and some left over celery. Meat on top.

Mixed the soups and a can of water, mixed in an entire head of garlic cloves, and poured over meat. Realized as I saw the bits of mushrooms I completely forgot the fresh mushrooms. Had to quarter them because they were huge ...

Lifted the meat and spread out the mushrooms and barely had room in the crock. Meat was touching the lid in some places. Around 11am, it had receded.

Around 4pm the liquid had risen to just below the lid.

Plated at 6:50, cooled enough to eat by 7.

Delicious!

Actually, I picked up a pie pan and 9"x9"x2" dish yesterday too! $7 for both! Stupid question but I've only cooked chicken a couple of times in my entire life (and I'm 41!) - do you put the breasts in the crock pot frozen, or do you thaw them first?

With the slow cooker there is no wrong answer!I got the Hamilton Beach Set 'N Forget slow cooker for around $40 at Best Buy and it is fantastic. I think it is a 6 quart slow cooker. You can set it to cook for up to 14 hours and when it finishes it goes into "keep warm" mode until you get there (or 14 hours has passed, then it turns off automatically). The settings on it are high, low, warm, and thermometer. It comes with a meat thermometer so you can tell it to cook for a certain amount of time once the thermometer reaches a certain temp&gt;Bad for taste, good for the waist~~line.~~

It is my vintage canister holy grail. I have so much jealousy. LolNatural fats and fat from meat are not necessarily unhealthy, just eat it in moderation and you will be finedepends on how healthy you want to be. i'm lazy and think fat is tasty so i keep itAh...gotcha.  I was wondering if it made the protein cook up differently or something.  I dig the tea ball idea as well!The high/low setting on slow cookers is kind of deceiving because they both reach the same temperature, high just gets there faster than low. 8 hours on low is about the same as 4 hours on high, so you may be good after 2 hours on high, but it depends on the cut and weight of the meat. Here's a handy reference chart for converting times.

High | Low
----|---
3 hrs | 7 hrs
4 | 8
5 | 9
6 | 10
7 | 11
8 | 12I don't like the texture of fat AT ALL, but I always cut it off after cooking. Still get all the flavor cooked into the meat, and it's easier to cut off imo.Except, as far as I know, there hasn't been much recent evidence supporting the "fat makes you fat" movement in nutrition science.

And yes, I'm super fucking fun at parties.I flip, but I leave the fat on until the end and remove it during the shredding process. Leaves richness and moisture but you don't have to actually chew it./r/theydidthemathDefinitely making this. Looks delicious!Leave it. Perhaps baste with a ladle a few times if you're worried?My friend Lynn's Amazing Chicken

sprinkle both sides of chicken breasts liberally with chile powder. Wrap breast with bacon (I use 2-3 slices). Sprinkle both sides with brown sugar. Bake at 350 F for 1 hour. Turn breasts over after 30 minutes.

Coat chicken breasts in flour, season with seasoned salt. Cover with chicken broth (I use around 4 cups). Sprinkle generously with tarragon. Bake at 350 F for 1 hour. Serve with rice.I've make something similar (not slow cooked though) and I tend to use the garlic and herbs philly instead. Or if you can't get hold of it just add heaps of garlic with basil, oregano etc. I cannot think of a more accurate response that I've read on reddit today.&gt; I could quickly duck into the corner bodega where I got the first bottle and just get a second bottle...

Well, that escalated quickly. Bad for taste, good for the waistline. Wow.  I always cut the fat off.  Is that bad?Mine came with the manual! Autoshift is 1 3/4 hours on high and then it automatically switches to low. Thanks for the feedback. Yeah, I meant "splash of red wine *vinegar*" there. Unfortunately I dumped the whole bottle of wine in the crockpot so there won't be any pairing happening, but I took a few swigs before throwing it in. 

Actually, I could quickly duck into the corner bodega where I got the first bottle and just get a second bottle... Thanks for the idea!

Next time I'll brown that shit. Love me some maillard.My rule with slow cooking is don't touch the lid until it's done: no poking, smelling, flipping, nothing.  Just leave it be.I do see what you're saying, but the heat lost due to opening the lid doesn't reduce the cooking time by very much. Most of the heat is contained in the liquid and solids. Because meat and veggies are mostly water (muscle is 79% water, carrots are 87% water), we'll approximate that the contents are 3 quarts of water (75% full crockpot), multiplied by a percentage that detracts due to the difference in specific heat between water and protein, fat, and carbohydrates. 

Convert 3 quarts to liters: 2.84 liters

Mass of 2.84 liters: 2.84 kg

Specific heat difference multiplier (rough): 90%

Mass of contents * multiplier: 2.56 kg

Volume of air: 0.95 liters

Specific heat of water: 4.184 kJ/kg *C

Enthalpy of vaporization (water): 2,260 kJ/kg

kg of water vapor in 0.95 liters of steam: 0.000558

Heat required to vaporize 0.000558 kg of H2O: 1.26 kJ

Heat lost from contents: 1.26kJ

Net temperature change of contents: 0.117 *C

Even if the contents have much higher amounts of lower specific heat stuff, a 50% difference only yields a 0.21 *C change in content temperature. Definitely hot enough to continue cooking, if they were near boiling before.

We also need to include the steam lost while the lid is open. Assuming (there's that darn word again) that we lose 0.2 volumes of steam per second the lid is open, 20 seconds results in 4 volumes of steam leaving. Yikes! That's gonna take quite a bit of energy. We've already calculated how much heat is lost due to a volume of steam leaving, and how much the temperature changes. If we multiply each by 5, we'll get our final numbers.

Total heat loss: 6.3 kJ

Net temperature change: 0.59 *C

Net temperature change (worst case): 1.05 *C

The transition from liquid phase to gas phase is the overriding factor, since the water and steam stay around the same temperature. I could calculate the difference, but I would need to do some measuring of the steam temperature and water temperature before and after lid lifting.

The next question is: how long does it take to get back those fractional degrees?

My crockpot says it draws 240W at 110V assuming 75% of that is directed into heating the bowl, this results in heating of 180W. A watt is a joule per second. If the heat lost was 6.3kJ from steam leaving, it will take the slow cooker about 35 seconds to replace that lost heat. Assuming that the slow cooker is on the low setting (half power), this rises to 70 seconds. On the warm setting (quarter power), this rises to 140 seconds.

While opening the lid does cause a large amount of heat to be lost, the temperature of the contents will remain fairly steady. Because they will remain near their cooking temperature, the contents will continue cooking, even though they've gone down in temperature a bit. 

As Bill Nye says, "don't take my word for it, you can try this yourself". Next time you're cooking something and it's boiling, get a stopwatch ready. When you lift the lid off, start the stopwatch. At 20 seconds, put the lid back on. Stop the stopwatch once your delicious dish has reached boiling again. Depending on the setting, this could be as long as 2:20, or as short as 0:35. Of course, this was all done with estimates and assumptions, but it should prove the point.

I may have gone a little overboard, but hope you have a fantastic day! :)

Also, I agree with you, OP's dish looks fantabulous.

EDIT - 

TL:DR - Lifting the lid off of your crockpot won't change the temperature by much more than a degree, the food keeps cooking while at the slightly lower temperature, the heat is replaced in a couple of minutes.&gt;I could probably still take the beef out and brown it for a few minutes. 

Nah, keep going, it's too close to midnight!

For next time, browning adds flavour and rendering some of the fat early on doesn't really make it less fatty, as most of it goes into the pot to cook!

The recipe looks fine. If you like the balsamic flavour, a splash of red wine vinegar might do more than a splash of red wine, which you might serve in a glass alongside instead.

Enjoy!Chicken Alfredo

1 chicken breast,
1 shallot (an onion is fine as well),
2 cloves garlic,
cream,
chicken stock,
pasta,
cheese (parmesan works best I think but whatever you have lying around is probably good)

Cook the garlic and shallots in a frying pan and brown the chicken with them, you don't want to cook the chicken through.
Add the chicken stock and a bit of cream with the pasta into the pan.
Boil it till the pasta is cooked and the chicken will be too.
Add cheese.
Eat.
Bask in the glow of this amazing and simple one pot pasta recipe.

Edit: Didn't realise this is the slow cooker subreddit, but it's still worth a try.I don't flip, but I shred it and let it all simmer in the juices a while before serving. Sesame chicken https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2ioa8k/long_time_lurker_first_time_slowcookerslow_cooked/

Cook for 2 hours on high much better (I've learned from cooking this 3 additional times)Browning it probably would've been a good idea, but it's already in the pot. [Here's what I'm going with](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2v8kgq/i_was_planning_on_making_oxtail_stew_but_i_forgot/cofgh5c) if you've got any advice to add. I only turned the pot on about a half hour ago, so I could probably still take the beef out and brown it for a few minutes. My cuts don't look particularly lean though (super fatty, actually) so browning them might melt off a lot of the fat. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. I'm accustomed to oxtail stew being really fatty.Yes, nostalgia can be a powerful thing.. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Spicy-Asian-Marinade-232058Thanks. I'm still gonna give it a try. Maybe add some Tabasco and lemon pepper to it after it cooks to spice it up a little. No idea in your case but my slow cooker has warm, low, and high settings. I cook 6-8 hours on low or 3-4 hours on high and warm is just for keeping things warm.

If your slow cooker doesn't have a high setting then you can't shorten the time. Most recipes that call for 6-8 hours means low setting afaik. Your low may be a warm setting but I think you can check the temp by loading with water and using a thermometer.

The 6-8 hours on low is usually around 190 degrees F and high is usually around 200 something.Hooked rugs, macrame plant hangers, and terrariums. 

We bought a 70s house that was really nicely remodeled and de-70sed a couple of owners back, but some of the houses, especially the one-owner ones, are still fairly pristine examples of 70s houses. I've said if we'd ended up with one of those, it would have been cheaper to switch out our furniture and go for a full-on 1970s Brady Bunch look than to rip everything out. Just have fun with it. The way mid-century has gone from dated to cool, we'd probably be ahead of the trend curve.I made an oxtail soup about two weeks ago, and forgot to add beef broth. My hubs and I swooned when we ate it-- *best evar!*

I browned the oxtails in a little oil, and, because they were so lean, I added a little honey (a heaping teaspoon or so). The sugar aids the Maillard reaction. I added some water and a little bit of chicken broth. 

I braised with the oxtails peeking an inch or so above the water/broth. Braised for hours. I think it was about 6 hours, iirc. 

Added veggies at the 4.5 hour mark, and then tossed in some of the more aromatic seasonings and kept it on warm until serving time. The broth was a nice deep colour. The refrigerated leftover broth was gelatinous, and to add to the sinful goodness, I further reduced the broth because I only needed about half or maybe 3/4ths of it for the meal.

Any of your options sound like they'll do fine! If you want to go on the balsamic beef flavour side, then cider vinegar and wine/wine vinegar will add to that. If you find that the flavour needs chicken broth, you can add it then. I'd save the pork drippings for another dish!

Enjoy!My wife opens it all the time and it is the most annoying thing ever!Peacocks? I don't remember peacocks. I'd go for those before owls or mushrooms. Mom had mushrooms, and Grandma had owls.

There are peacocks near us, and apparently I'm one of the few people who likes them. Then again, I like bagpipes too, so I'm probably just weird, lol.My wife won't open it, but we have a house guest every few months and I no longer slowcook when she is staying with us. She opens the damn thing and while I know it has cooked for 6-8 hours already, it irrationally bothers me that she is so rude to intrude on my cooking routine.I'm impatient. Here's the recipe I'm attempting (FYI: I have a small crockpot):

3 garlic cloves  
1/2 onion  
1 carrot  
tsp thyme  
tbsp paprika  
pinch celery salt  (I also forgot to pick up celery)  
pinch black pepper  
4-5 mushrooms  
1 bottle red wine  
1 pound oxtail (two vertebrae)  
2 bay leaves  
half tbsp chicken bouillon  

dice onions. crush/mince garlic. chop carrot and mushrooms.
add that shit to a bowl and mix it all up. lay one bay leaf on top of the 
veggies and put the other along the side of the bowl (probably doesn't make a 
difference but that's how I did it). sprinkle in the chicken bouillon (should 
be a pretty light quantity).

layer the base of the crock pot with the veggies

mix thyme, paprika, celery salt, pepper. coat the oxtail in the seasonings mix
add the oxtail to the crockpot. pour in rest of veggies, filling gaps and 
covering the meat.

pour in the wine. 

cook that shit on high for 4 hours (just started now at 7pm. 
Gonna be a midnight snack).

After cooking, add a splash-2tbsp of red wine vinegar (to taste I guess) to "brighten
the flavor" or something. Haven't gotten to this part so let's see what happens.I've got a similar Crock Watcher that was my mom's with an even more earthy 70's motif. I've never figured out what the "auto shift" function is for. Still use it all the time....and with a glass lid... you don't need to lift it!I do something similar, but I take chicken thighs with salsa and canned beans, season it like chili (cumin, etc.) and crock it for 8 hours. 

Easy and super tasty. Yum!Cool, so I am just going to make a list below. A lot of them call for green onions or regular white/yellow onions. You can just leave the green out and replace the regular with onion powder. The same goes for celery (although I do just fine with celery as long as it is cooked really well). I am a big fan of soups as liquids leave the stomach via gravity and don't have to be pumped out.

Don't even get me started ;) Seriously!! Those are nothing short of amazing!I usually get around a 2 lb roast and cook for around 10 hours.  I would say check it at 8 hours.Good. I put 3lbs of chicken in 5 hours ago. I'll have a tasty lunch. Always! I just set it in the morning and come back 5-7 hours later and eat. I'd definitely be willing to buy them from you. 

I already hit up OP, but she wants to keep them. I don't blame her at all. They're awesome. Kitchy as hell. They're real real cute! /u/kinggutter talk to this guy/gal! You know what, from my own experimentation, with sizes from yours to around 3lbs or so, (that I've tried), the magic time is around 2.5-3 hrs or so.

Hey, going for 5-6 hrs might be better, but I couldn't tell the diff once I was over about 3.5 hrs.  ...Magic angels bless the chuck roast around 3 hr mark?  Dunno., ...But, I did notice that you posted this about 30 min. before now, so you should be just about there, even right now - yum!Looks like there is no real answer. I dont think it *really* matters, it will all cook and be seasoned/juicy regardless. That and the whole shredding and bit.

Personally, I like to keep the fat at the top the whole time (so no flip). Probably as that is how I've done roasts in the past. Anecdotal-ly i like to think less fat will melt into meat-sauce this way.Holy shit, those are cute as a motherfuckI've got a whole set of these collecting dust in my garage. I thought no one would be interested in them, so I've just left them be. Good to know someone might appreciate them!Cook on low ? Bonappatit.com has an article called something like 27 ways to make chicken not boring. It's worth looking it up. I would link, but my phone isn't working the best right now :(I cut my roasts into pieces before cooking, that way much more of it will be in the juices. I mean you're gonna pull it all apart anyway.Chicken in a pot is easy. Chicken, onion, carrots, celery, potatoes, and any other root veggies you like (radish, etc.). 1/2-1 cup of water or chicken broth. 1 tsp of salt and pepper. Throw in basil, oregano, and any other spices you like. Cook on low for 6-8 hours &amp; stir it up. Delicious.[Chicken Philly Sandwiches](http://foodfamilyfinds.com/slow-cooker-chicken-philly-sandwiches-recipe/)

My only advice is to go easy with the seasoning sauce and do NOT add salt to your chicken breasts because it will just taste like pure sodium lol. Otherwise an awesome recipe. **TRAINWRECK?!** Those are my *favorite* colors/styles, but only when combined. 

I've had my sights set on a set of Corelle dishes, but when I look at the patterns, I hate how *modern* they all are. All of the things I like (mostly 70s motifs) are stoneware, and they chip too easily. :( yeah, i don't think you need to strain it. delicious fat makes the sammies better. i also leave the onions in. And the fat will get crispy and delicious too.Oh, man! My gramma had those when I was a kid! She made amazing chili in that crockpot (in the 1990s).I do chicken in the slow cooker with spices like hot pepper flakes, chili powder, salt and pepper, and any other spicey spices that sound good. Cook that chicken until it falls apart then shred and add Sriracha as desired cook for a little while longer to let the flavors melt together.

When I make them into tacos I do sour cream, shredded cabbage, lots of avocado slices, some cheese and any other delicious taco toppings of your choosing.

Alternative method of eating would be over rice with avocado. Also delicious. :)We had the exact canister set when I was little. We had the crock pot too but it was orange-red-ish.That is far to simple to have actually been thought of by myself. 

Once I am finished making supper in it I will do this. 

Thanks!Take a 1 quart pitcher.  Fill it with water.  Pour it in crock.  See how many times you can do that.  Double that number.Yep. Stupid easy. 

It is SO good - my 6 and 7 year old boys even liked it and they are pretty picky.I'd flip it,  and finish it fat side upEveryone here seems to really like them, but as I don't have the childhood nostalgia to fall back on I can only look at them and see them as... pretty ugly.I make parmesan chicken breasts last night, turned out great. I did mayo (2 tbsp), dijon (1 tsp), seasoning salt, pepper, basil, paprika. Mix together, paint chicken breasts with, then roll them in seasoned panko and parmesan and bake on a baking sheet at 425 for 20-30 minutes.

Was delicious and easy.Citrus is fine in a slow cooker. Conchita pibil uses oranges and orange juice with pork. My grandma used to own that set! They're almost cute in an ugly way.I was looking for basically this earlier today, and ended up going this this: http://crockpot365.blogspot.com/2010/08/slow-cooker-marmalade-curry-chicken.html

It's going now, and looks pretty good! Instead of mixing the marmalade &amp; broth in a bowl, I just scooped some of the marmalade out of the jar, added the broth (well, the Better Than Bullion and water), and stirred/shook it up. I didn't want to have to wash another bowl, and I got every last bit of marmalade out of the jar. Win.Stamped 1978 on the bottom! They predate me by 10 years! :Pi don't flip. cook fat side up, so that fat juice gets into the meat. if you pour the dr pepper on the roast it it will be fine.Cool. So after the 6 hours add paste shred chicken and serve? Sounds delicious, I'm glad I made this post. Welp, made in the 70s? Now you're stuck with it for life. Cute set![Here's the recipe!](http://www.thinkarete.com/crock-pot-recipes-pizza-pasta/)Chicken Cacciatore

* 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
* 1 medium green bell pepper, 1-inch pieces
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 4 frozen boneless skinless chicken breast halves
* 1 can black olives, drained (optional)
* 1 jar spaghetti sauce
* 1 can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
* 1 tsp salt 
* 1 can tomato paste

Mix everything BUT the tomato paste together and cook on low for 6 hours. Add tomato paste and stir, break up chicken with two forks. Serve over pasta or rice.Looks very tasty I'm going to try it, thanks!I REMEMBER those cannisters from my sister's first apartment.  Wow.  Wayback time machine moment. I usually lay it on a bed of beans and onions, lay breasts on top, then add whatever veggies that match on top. Seasoning each layer if possible and pour the mixture on top. Best of luck!I haven't made it yet, but this looked pretty tasty:
http://www.sippycupmom.com/2012/09/recipe-zesty-italian-crockpot-cheesy-chicken.htmlSounds good I'll try it, thanks!Hi PercussiveLove: Don't forget the sidebar rule - *When you post a pic of the meal, please include the recipe.

Message the mods and we'll re-approve it after your recipe is posted. Thanks!This. Also if you're in a hurry you could put the breast in a zip lock then fill a bowl with cold water and submerge the bag in the bowl then put it in the fridge. The less air in the bag the better. Conduction from water will thaw it quicker than convention only. 1lb chicken breast, 1 cup salsa, 1 cup orange juice. Yes, flip it, i do that because i think that the meat doesnt dries up and it gets flavored evenly with the juiceNow I know where all the cookies went. This post makes me really happy! And jealous. Awesome find!!!Honey+sriracha+soy sauce+lime is nectar of the gods, works so well with chicken and meat and greens.That's why I do it. My husband will eat baked potato skins too so it's nice that it saves me a stepOMg I'm the same way. Anytime anyone tries to open my slowcooker I get irrationally upset. I know it's a little thing, but everytime you open the lid you are losing all that fantastic heat that is working so hard to make it all ready at the right time. General rule of thumb is you lose 20 minutes when you open the slow cooker. You let heat escape and it has to build back up. I contemplated duck taping the lid one day lol.

That being said this looks amazing!

ITT: Others who get annoyed by the opening of a crockpot that is hard at work on something yummy.I have this set! And the salt and pepper shakers and creamer! I had it passed along to me after my grandmother passed away. I love it! I found a good medium for me was to use some of the bacon in a stew or gravy and then stir in some bacon I crisp separately. The gravy turns out great and you still get that texture. Me as well. I thought they were ugly as sin, but when there's cookies in it, you really don't care what the jar looks like.Welp, thankfully I'm just at this apartment for a another year or so - so I won't have to deal with that and the new one actually works. Mein childhood!Ah sorry, I'm a newbie to this. Chicken breasts to pork roast.omg, those are cute as fuckThe new one won't last nearly as longI don't think anyone is entitle to their opinions when it comes to siracha.I'm  so jealous, my mom loved stuff like that and i would totally put all of those things in my kitchen bc of that.My wife is the same. She doesn't really like anything that I make if it's new. This is the only way to do it.. works great with pork and chickenPut I in the sink and run the water (cool) it will help it thaw faster. Otherwise, you might end up with a half cooked turkey. It was the aftermath of 'reconnecting with the earth' which started in  the cultural revolution of the 60's.. A stark contrast of the aesthetics of the 50's and 60's 

The entire decade was a trainwreck for style/color.You are so lucky. Your crockpot will actually take 8 hours to cook a meal unlike newer ones which cook everything at higher temperatures and burn things at 5 hours.The 90s is vintage now...never mind the 70s.I prefer it but a lot of people would rather have none to very little. I leave most of the peel on because it has a lot of fiber. Plus we like it. Probably hand mixer.  Immersion blender would make it mush.   A hand mixer separates it quickly and easily! I like to peel about 50% of mine, because as /u/adminbeast said, it's kind of like pulp in orange juice. I need these.Recently got a new oven in my apartment after complaining about it the realty company asked if it was a "Harvest Gold" oven, and it was. They decided to just give me a completely new one rather than fix that relic from the 70sPeel in potato soup is sort of like pulp in orange juice. Some people like lots and lots of pulp; some people find any pulp at all to be unpalatable; but virtually everyone will drink pulp-free juice, even if it's not their preference. Potato soup works the same way: some like loads of peel, some find peel unappetizing, but everyone will eat peel-free soup.

Unless you're going for the peel-heavy effect, make your soup without peel.You're entitled to your opinion, and that's fine! :)Thaw it in the fridge. It's a large piece of meat and if you cook it without thawing, the outside will cook before the inside becomes unfrozen which can possibly introduce bacteria. I have the large mushroom cookie jar.Yeah it was a little oily thought it was just the chicken fat... So I told people not to have all the chicken skin in there. 

Hah good luck and thanks for the tip!Lol we had the same set!Thanks! I'm going to try it - but I'll use less olive oil when I make my own vinaigrette. Oy, the calories!!! :) Good catch! Now I know the difference.

http://m.skinnyms.com/slow-cooker-balsamic-chicken/Ah ok - you probably didn't need the excess oil in there then. Do you have a link to a recipe?Maybe I did it wrong but I used balsamic vinaigrette. I used the left over salad dressing I had.My parents have the matching dinnerware set for this that they received as a wedding gift for "formal" dining pieces.This looks so good. I too have been wanting a Ruben but am not pregnant. I'm grocery shopping today or tomorrow morning I think this is a must. Lastly, thanks for the heads up on rinsing I hate extremely salted anything.My grandma had that set. After she passed I took the cooker and my mother sold the rest. I cherished that croc pot till my ex wife stole it when we divorced. Now I have a modern one and I hate it... I miss ol reliable...Are you using balsamic vinegar or vinaigrette? Vinaigrette is balsamic plus oil. Is it straight balsamic vinegar? I think you made a typo?Does that work in all cases?  A lot of people are saying to put it on a "warmer" setting when it's done cooking, which I don't have.  I've got "low" and "high."  I was under the impression that high didn't mean cooking twice as fast, but I could obviously be wrong.  Can I just cut the wait time in half?Removes a bunch of the salt/preserves.  That's hilarious! Also: suck it, Rachel Maddow! Fabulous find!I've been doing Siracha, honey, and garlic for a couple years. I drizzle it on shrimp and grill them on a skewer. So good. Knew I was on to something. What benefit do you get from rinsing the brisket?My kitchen towels *may* have owls on them........Anything's breakable when there's three kids in any house.  Picky eater here... And no offense to the OP but I definitely wouldn't eat. Not many times does actually LOL when one types LOL. This is one of those times. I worked at Sears in the 80s in the paint dept., we had to handle housewares as well. They still had that Merry Mushroom crap then. I wasn't a very good Sears employee. :(What kills me is that they consider the 70s vintage.Nice layering skills, OP.Chicken breast is done in 3-4 hours on low. Chicken thighs can go longer (up to 8 hours or more on low).I'm totally with you on these cheese selections.Recipe dammit! 

Or "sauce", if you will. In the recipe, it gives the ingredients at the top and says 
&gt;"For the drizzle:"


lolThese make me so nostalgic! My parents had this whole set.or peacocks.After mushrooms and acid were discovered and before they were banned... Yep.This is the COOLEST slow cooker ever. Plus, I collect mushroom ceramics. I have a jar similar to your biggest one. Seriously though, I'm insanely jealous of your find. You have no idea. e___eOk cool, and that's good to know because while I love me some mashed taters, that's not exactly what I want with a pot roast.I remember those.  Still ugly as fuck. Give your Mother a brand new set - something she would like.

Bam - free set.You got that backwards. That is a burrito. I would go with some Asadero cheese if you have access to a place that sells the Mexican cheeses. That or Queso de Oaxaca. Both are the types of cheeses that melt fantastically.Nobody will be snatching up those ugly blue geese on crock pots made in the 90s. The 70s were weird, but the funky style is so much more than the 90s could've ever hoped for!Oh.  My.  God.  My girlfriend is going to hate that I found a searchable name for these items.  I've had an eye open for the containers for years since my parents had them when I was growing up.  I'm always looking out for them at Goodwill stores and yard sales.  I had no idea that there were so many matching items.  

Nice score.My parents had them, too.  I keep hoping I'll find them when I go to the Goodwill store, but no luck so far.  I've never seen the crock pot, though.  Now I need that.You mean "70s Mercedes Brown".OMG you got Rachel Maddow's cannisters!I only have two sets of the canisters... You may have changed my world. I'm sure my wife thanks you.BADASS! If you overlap two tortillas like a ven diagram you can get some extra girth. Also, always use a warm tortilla. Holy crap this comment just gave me a flashback. We had a GIANT hooked rug on a wall that was just a giant owl. Hooked rugs, another 70s thing!They keep talking about renovating it &amp; I get sad every time they mention it!Can you tell I was a kid in the 70s? LolTry adding a bit of garlic and paprika to that next time you're experimenting.  I can't get enough of it.My grandma has the same biggest ceramic canister. It's been her cookie jar for as long as I can remember. My cousin's brat broke it last year. Omg...my mother had that set when we were kids. I've wanting to get the small canister to make a fairy house for my fairy garden.I always use this and just sub the chicken in place of pork (I don't like pork).  

http://www.chow.com/recipes/30356-easy-slow-cooker-pulled-pork

Make some coleslaw to go with and bam! Yummy easy meal :)I've got a truly ugly 70s Carletonware coffee set in brown and orange... the cups are too small to be useful as I drink out of mugs, I've no use for the coffee pot, or water warming jug, but I refuse to part with a single piece.  It's too hideous not to love.My mom has those jars! I've never seen another set until now.I gave that to my husband several years ago!It was a fun sort of time to be a kid in the suburbs. Bright colors everywhere, popcorn ceilings with glitter in them, riding in the way back of a station wagon the size of the Titanic and making faces at the people behind you.Sauce of saucesBrown cabinets and avocado green counters. So much avocado green.I don't know how my mother missed the Merry Mushroom Corningware. She had to settle for some with herbs on them (in French, ooh la la).

I just had a Sudden Clarity Clarence moment: she had mushroom decor all over the kitchen, and a fridge that was a fungal paradise. I used to cry uncle from time to time and clean out the tupperware in the back of the fridge. You should know it's gotten bad when a teenaged slob, later a college student, draws the line at the state of a fridge.#####&amp;#009;
